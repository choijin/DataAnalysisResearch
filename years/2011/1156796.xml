<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Virginia that will provide research training for 10 students, for 11 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2016.  The program focuses on field biology, encompassing the application of field research, experimental design, data analysis, and synthesis to the main research areas of plant-insect interactions, pollination biology, ecosystem ecology, conservation, invasive species, aquatic ecology, and applied insect ecology.  The students have a choice of mentors from a pool of about 7 resident and visiting faculty at Blandy Experimental Farm.  In addition to carrying out research projects, students are required to participate in weekly seminars given by visiting scholars as well various workshops, such as the ethical conduct of research, getting into and surviving graduate school, and how to communicate scientific research effectively.  Students are provided tours of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History and take advantage of numerous biological and cultural opportunities in Northern Virginia.  Blandy Experimental Farm is an ecological field station (not a farm) at the northern edge of the Shenandoah Valley.  It is rural in character, but not isolated: it lies within 10 miles of the Shenandoah River, the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the Appalachian Trail, and only 60 miles from Washington, DC.  REU students have access to a new laboratory building, a greenhouse and screenhouse, and a variety of habitat types for field research.  Recruitment of students is carried out through campus visits, poster mailings, and online advertising.  Students are chosen based on their prior academic performance, recommendations, and interests.  Student outcomes are evaluated throughout their attendance in the program.  The program will be evaluated through several approaches including the use of an REU common assessment tool.  Post-program follow-up surveys of students gauge long-term impacts on their interests in scientific research and science education outreach, academic performance, and career advancement.  Information is available at www.virginia.edu/blandy/ReuWebPage/HomePage.php or by contacting the PI (Dr. Haynes at haynes@virginia.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. McKenna at mmckenna@howard.edu).</AbstractNarration>
