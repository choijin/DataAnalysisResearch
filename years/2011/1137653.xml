<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Workshop proposal, supported by the Energy, Power and Adaptive Systems program in ECCS is to increase the participation of faculty across the nation in three workshops planned to disseminate educational material and approaches developed at the University of Minnesota through the ONR Grant "Center for Reforming Undergraduate Education in Electric Energy Systems."  This effort was aided by a previous NSF grant "ONR/NSF-Sponsored Workshop: Reforming Electric Energy Systems Curriculum." Through these two grants, five faculty workshops were held and three more are planned to promote curriculum reform in undergraduate education in Electric Energy Systems.</AbstractNarration>
