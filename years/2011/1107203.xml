<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to examine the impact of sea ice on the distribution and abundance of zooplankton, and how they are partitioned among top predators. To this end, new and historical data will be used to test a series of hypotheses and answer questions relating to bottom-up and top-down control of large crustacean zooplankton and their impact on the flow of carbon and energy in the ecosystem. From the examination of these hypotheses, new mechanisms will be derived and old ones re-evaluated. Existing numerical models will be used to assess the relative importance of these mechanisms. Existing conceptual models will be tested, and new conceptual models of carbon and energy flow will be developed. Such a study of the eastern Bering Sea shelf ecosystem is timely. Some of the most direct effects of changing climate will be on sea-ice - its extent, duration, timing of retreat, and inter-annual variability. Sea ice in turn controls ocean temperature/salinity, timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom and thus the extent of export/remineralization of fixed carbon. Crustacean zooplankton can be a choke-point in the flow of carbon and energy through the food chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bering Sea ecosystem provides roughly half the commercial seafood landings in the United States, as well as significant resources for subsistence fishermen.  Major fluctuations in these stocks have occurred in the past and been associated with climate variations.  Improved management of these important fisheries should be enabled by the understanding derived from this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Bering Sea sustains over half the US commercial fish landings annually, and important fish and marine mammal populations for subsistence communities and the tourist industry.  Climate-related changes in the ecosystem could therefore impact indigenous populations, as well as major commercial interests.  Recent field observations of the plankton community on the southeastern Bering Sea shelf indicated that climate warming will suppress populations of large crustacean zooplankton, thus altering the diets of commercial and subsistence fish species and lowering survival.  Since these changes could negatively impact the commercial and subsistence economies, research by the BEST-BSIERP programs focused on the effects of climate warming and the disappearance of sea ice on the species composition and abundance of planktonic organisms on the eastern Bering Sea shelf.                The field studies essentially confirmed that warming over the southeastern shelf will suppress populations of large crustacean zooplankton.  Although the BEST field studies occurred during a sequence of cold years, comparison of BEST data with the results of sampling done during the previous series of warm years confirmed that abundance of large zooplankton was lower during the warm period but gradually increased as conditions cooled at the onset of the cold period.  Subsequent fisheries analysis of post-larval pollock indicated that during the warm period, they entered their first winter in poor condition, and that the amount of large zooplankton in their diets was much lower compared to diets from fish taken during cold periods.  In addition, fisheries data indicated that post-larval pollock entering winter during a warm period had much poorer survival than those beginning winter during a cold period.  The BEST-BSIERP synthesis program therefore undertook an analysis of the available data and developed a numerical model in an effort to determine the cause of declines in large crustacean zooplankton during warm periods.  Computations using winds, currents and nutrient concentrations from an oceanographic model confirmed that southeasterly winds, which predominate during warm periods, promote more transport of nutrients onto the shelf.  However, there was no indication that more nutrients during warm periods resulted in less forage for large crustaceans.  It therefore seems unlikely that declines in large crustaceans during warm periods were caused by lower amounts of food during spring and summer.  In addition, dietary analysis indicated that predation on large zooplankton by fish and other crustaceans was elevated during cold periods relative to the warm period.  It therefore seems unlikely lower large crustacean abundance during warm periods was caused by higher predation.   However, a numerical model we developed did indicate that large crustaceans, which depend on fats synthesized during the spring and summer to survive winter, would consume their fat reserves by November or December during warm winters and would therefore not survive till March-May, when plant growth made food available again.  In contrast, animals entering winter during a cold period would consume fats more slowly, and their reserves would not be exhausted until April or May of the following spring, when food once again becomes available to them.  The experiments indicate that low populations of large zooplankton during the warm period were not caused by a series of random events affecting their food supply or by elevated predation during summer, but were cause by a fundamental response of the animal?s metabolic rates to ambient temperature during fall and winter.  The lack of large crustacean zooplankton in the southeastern Bering Sea during warm periods causes salmon and older pollock to shift their diets from large zooplankton to larval and post-larval pollock, thus causing a decline in pollock survival.  Elevated predation and poor condition of post larval pollock during warm years lowers their winter survival and negatively impacts commercial and subsistence fisheries stocks.  The overall BEST-BSIERP research indicates that climate warming on the southeastern Bering Sea shelf will likely cause declines in pollock and salmon fisheries stocks, imposing potential hardships on the local commercial and subsistence economies.
