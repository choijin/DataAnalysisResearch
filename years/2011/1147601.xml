<AbstractNarration>This project examines changes in the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH, also referred to as the Bermuda High), a large cell of high surface pressure that forms over the subtropical North Atlantic in summer and affects the weather and climate of the southeastern United States (SE US). Recent work by the principal investigators shows that the NASH has intensified in the past 30 years compared to the previous 30-year period, and that the intensification was accompanied by a westward expansion. Similar trends are also found in model simulations of the effect of increased greenhouse gas concentrations on climate. In addition, the western portion of the NASH, which overlaps the SE US, has experienced larger north-south shifts during the past 30 years, and these shifts are associated with heightened variation in SE US precipitation during this period. Work under this grant aims to identify and characterize the causes of the changes of the NASH in observations and climate model simulations through data diagnosis and numerical modeling. Previous studies suggest that both local and remote diabatic heating play important roles in the seasonal development and maintenance of the NASH. Work to be conducted here seeks to identify and quantify the changes of these heating on interannual and interdecadal timescales, and assess their relative contributions to the interannual to interdecadal variability in the NASH. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to its scientific merit, the work has broader impacts due to the societal impacts of precipitation fluctuations over the SE US, a populous region with a substantial agricultural sector. In addition, the project will support two graduate students, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) is a boreal summer semi-permanent surface pressure center that affects large-scale atmospheric moisture transport and tracking of the North Atlantic tropical cyclones. The variations and changes of the NASH thus has tremendous influences on the summer weather (rainfall and temperature) of the southeastern United States. Earlier work by the two principal investigators of the project shows that the NASH has intensified in the past 30 years compared to the previous 30-year period, and that the intensification was accompanied by a westward expansion of the high pressure center. The western portion of the NASH, which overlaps the SE US, has experienced greater north-south shifts during the past 30 years, resulting increased occurrence frequencies of heavy rainfall episodes and droughts in the region. The goal of the project is to understand the physical origins of the observed NASH variability and change across interannual to decadal timescales through both dynamical diagnosis of observational data and numerical modeling. Our research at Georgia Tech has shown that the intensification of NASH is largely driven by changes of large-scale diabatic heating in the tropical and subtropical regions, specifically, the enhanced heating over continents and cooling over oceans in summer. We also found that the interannual variations of the NASH intensity is coupled with the variations in the marine boundary layer clouds: the NASH strengthening/weakening modifies the amounts of these clouds and the resulted diabatic heating change driven by cloud change provide a positive feedback to the original change in the NASH strength. This close coupling between the NASH intensity and boundary layer clouds suggest the importance of good cloud simulation in weather and climate models that aim to produce skillful predictions of summer rainfall variability and US hurricane landfall risks given the critical role the NASH plays in the North Atlantic atmospheric circulation. Our research also explores how large-scale transports of air mass creates atmospheric high and low pressure centers by respectively accumulating or depleting mass from an atmospheric column. Low-frequency (10-30-day periods) atmospheric disturbances are found to be the most important factor determining the establishment of the NASH in summer and the decay of the NASH in fall. Additionally, the project also supports a modeling study of the interaction between environmental aerosols and developing mid-latitude winter cyclones (surface lows). We found that it is necessary to couple the aerosol effects with deep convections occurring within these cyclones in order to estimate the dynamical impacts of aerosols on cyclones. Without the coupling between aerosol effects and deep convection, aerosols tend to strengthen the growth of a cyclone. Including such coupling leads to a weakening effect of aerosols on cyclone growth. Since the western US winter climate is largely controlled by these cyclones propagating from the North Pacific, our results have major implications for hydroclimate simulation and prediction in states such as California, Oregon and Washington. This NSF project also supported the training of two PhD students and two postdoc researchers at Georgia Tech and provided them opportunities to study tropical and subtropical climate variability and change and to prepare them for careers in either academia, government or private sectors.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/26/2017<br>      Modified by: Yi&nbsp;Deng</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
