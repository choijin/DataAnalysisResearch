<AbstractNarration>The marine troposphere plays important roles in the global geochemical cycles of many elements, in the global radiation budget, and in the global distribution of organic compounds, nutrients, microbes, and pollutants.  Our ability to sample this space between the atmosphere and the sea is central to improving our understanding of this dynamic zone.  By virtues of its location in the western North Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda has been a key location for numerous field studies on the marine troposphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support through this grant, researchers at the Bermuda institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) will continue to maintain and operate a state-of-the-art Tudor Hill facility for three more years (September, 2011 through August, 2014).  Operations will include the collection of continuous meteorological data and weekly bulk aerosol samples and rainwater samples.  These data and samples will be archived at BIOS and made freely available to the scientific community, as well as the collection of samples and data for a variety of external research projects funded variously by NSF, NOAA, NASA, and other agencies.  Modest user fees will be requested for the collection of samples or data in addition to those specified above or for other research use of the facility.  Anticipated net revenue from these user fees (ca. $10,000 per year) will be used to defray costs of site maintenance, equipment replacement, and additional technician support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  In general terms, the continued operation of the Tudor Hill facility will facilitate and augment research into the physics and chemistry of the lower marine troposphere and ocean-atmosphere exchange processes in the North Atlantic Ocean Basin -- topics that are of central importance to international research initiatives such as GEOTRACES, COLAS, and IGAC.  Regionally, this facility will complement other ongoing time-series research in the Sargasso Sea, including the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS), Hydrostation S, and the Ocean Flux Program (OFP).  As in the past, data and samples will be made available to support graduate student research as well as undergraduate educational activities and research.</AbstractNarration>

Measurements of various chemicals in the atmosphere have been made on Bermuda since the mid-1970s. Longer term measurements of air and rain chemistry began in the early 1980Æs under the Western Atlantic Ocean Experiment (WATOX) program, and in 1988 a 70Æ walk-up research tower (see Figure 1) was erected at Tudor Hill as part of the Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE), an international long-term study of the atmospheric transport of aerosols and gases in the North Atlantic region.  Since March 2003, with support from the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the Bermuda Institute for Ocean Sciences (BIOS) has been operating the Tudor Hill observatory as a research site for research activities conducted by BIOS and visiting US and international scientists. From September 2011 to August 2014 it was supported by funding through NF grant # 1130395 from the Divisions of Ocean Sciences (OCE) and Atmospheric Sciences (ATM).

Routine activities at the site include continuous recording of meteorological data (e.g., wind speed and direction, air temperature and humidity) and sampling of bulk aerosol (airborne particulate) and rainwater, providing archived samples available for a range of chemical analyses.  The following research projects were undertaken at the facility during the grant period:  Princeton and Brown Universities and BIOS:      Isotopic and compositional investigation of the sources and interactions      of reactive nitrogen in the marine atmosphere at Bermuda; Arizona State University: Source apportionment of      iron in the marine atmosphere - application of stable iron isotopic      measurements; Florida State University and University of Miami:      A novel tracer approach to estimate the atmospheric input of trace      elements into the global ocean; Plymouth University, UK: The role of the marine      atmosphere in the transport of trace metals; Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de      l'Environnement, Paris, France: Measurement of the isotopic composition of      water vapor in the marine environment.
