<AbstractNarration>Schneider 1107795&lt;br/&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will use a systematic approach to elucidate the processes that control sea ice thickness and areal extent on seasonal and longer timescales. First, they will identify responses that are robust among current comprehensive global climate models (GCMs). Next, they will develop fundamental theories to explain these responses, beginning with the consideration of physical first principles, continuing through simulations with a hierarchy of models with increasing levels of complexity, and culminating in tests of the theories with satellite-derived observations. A principal tool will be an idealized atmosphere?sea ice GCM, which helps bridge the gap between understanding of fundamental processes and simulations with comprehensive GCMs. Using this and other models, they will test the theories developed for Arctic sea ice retreat in the broader context of sea ice changes in a continuum of climates spanning the full range from a completely ice-covered to a completely ice-free planet. These theories will be used to interpret observed sea ice changes and to evaluate the aspects of current GCM projections that differ among the models, such as the rate of 21st-century Arctic sea ice retreat. Specific questions to be addressed include:&lt;br/&gt;? How do interactions between sea ice and other components of the climate system determine the seasonal cycle of hemispheric sea ice cover?&lt;br/&gt;? What physical principles govern the sensitivity of sea ice to climate changes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will elucidate some of the most fundamental questions about the dynamics of sea ice and climate. It will bridge the gap between state-of-the-art GCM simulations and fundamental physical understanding, thereby providing metrics for model assessment, suggesting ways for model improvement, and reducing the uncertainty in the prediction of future sea ice retreat. By exploring sea ice retreat in a wide range of climates, it will place past and possible future Arctic sea ice changes in a broader context.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funded by this NSF award, we have investigated the processes that control sea ice cover and how it responds to climate change. Specifically, we addressed questions such as:     How do interactions between sea ice and other components of the climate system determine the seasonal cycle of hemispheric sea ice cover?  What physical principles govern the sensitivity of sea ice to climate changes?  How do changes in sea ice cover interact with and feedback onto other components of the climate system, such as cloud cover changes?     To address such questions, we employed a range of scientific tools. They ranged from analysis of observational data, simulation with complex climate models, development of simplified conceptual models to quantify dependences among key variables, to the development of high-resolution models that resolve the dynamics of clouds and boundary layers.   Major findings of our research include:  We have isolated sources of uncertainties in satellite sea ice observations, which affect estimates of changes in sea ice extent in the southern and northern hemisphere. This has led to a reassessment of previous findings about expanding Antarctic sea ice in recent decades. We have developed a conceptual model that bridges the gap between seemingly conflicting results on "tipping points" of Arctic ice cover&mdash;instabilities of the ice cover that, when tipping points are crossed, may lead to irreversible loss of ice cover. Generally, complex climate models have not been found to simulate such instabilities, whereas simplified one-dimensional models do exhibit such instabilities. The newly developed conceptual model illustrates the key differences between the one-dimensional models and complex climate models. It turns out that both meridional energy transport in the atmosphere and a seasonal cycle&mdash;processes represented in climate models but often ignored in simpler models&mdash;can stabilize sea ice cover. We have developed a conceptual framework for high-resolution simulation of polar clouds and their response to changes in sea ice cover, including the development of a new high-resolution simulation code. We have made the code publicly available and hope it will benefit the broader scientific community.  This work is ongoing. We are currently using this framework for studies of the polar cloud response to global warming and how it feeds back onto the warming.     Overall, the work under this award has helped bridge the gap between state-of-the-art climate simulations and fundamental physical understanding, thereby providing metrics for model assessment, suggesting ways for model improvement, and reducing the uncertainty in the prediction of future sea ice retreat. It has provided key elements of a theoretical framework for interpreting the observed Arctic sea ice retreat and the widely differing future Arctic sea ice projections from state-of-the-art climate models.
