<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this research are to advance Reference and Extended Command Governor control theory and algorithms for systems, such as downsized systems, that can presently fail to perform optimally due to lack of ability to handle stringent state and control constraints.  The Governors are predictive control algorithms that augment high performance feedback loops and modify reference commands to protect the system from constraint violation.  In this research, Reference and Extended Command Governor methods are developed for: (a) systems with fast and slow dynamics, (b) linear systems with nonlinear constraints, (c) systems with dynamics evolving on Lie groups, (d) systems with dynamic disturbance models, and (e) for the case when Governors are placed inside intentionally or unintentionally created feedback loops.  The research progresses from developing the theory and algorithms, to treating high impact automotive and aerospace applications using simulations and experiments, to disseminating research results for academic and industrial audience, and to incorporating research results into courses to enhance student education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has a potential to benefit automotive and aerospace transportation, energy efficiency, environment, defense, and maintaining space infrastructure.   Specifically, the  advances made will: (a) enable higher levels of automotive engine downsizing and vehicle fuel economy improvements, (b) allow for a more aggressive use of aircraft gas turbine engines during emergency maneuvering which will increase aircraft safety, (c)  extend the safe range and mission duration of very flexible aircraft (for a variety of commercial and military use), (d) enhance attitude control and safe rendezvous and proximity maneuvering capability for autonomous spacecraft, (e) improve energy management of automotive and aerospace hybrid powerplants with small energy storage.  The research results disseminated through publications (including a monograph), and implemented in a Matlab toolbox, will support researchers, students and practitioners alike in their activities to develop and implement the Reference and Extended Command Governors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   With the increasing trend towards system downsizing and the growing stringency of requirements, constraint handling and limit protection are becoming both increasingly important and critical for engineered systems. Constraints can reflect actuator limits, safety requirements (e.g., process temperature or pressure must not exceed a safe value) or obstacle avoidance requirements. Reference governors and extended command governors are control schemes (i.e., algorithms that are implemented in software) that can be augmented to existing control systems in order to provide constraint handling/limit protection capabilities.  These schemes exploit prediction and optimization to supervise and minimally modify operator (e.g., pilot or driver) commands when there is a danger of future constraint violations.  The extended command governor provides a less conservative solution than a reference governor, however,  at the cost of increased computational complexity.    The research undertaken in this project has advanced methods and design procedures for rigorous constraint enforcement based on low-order system models thereby leading to more practically appealing and computationally efficient solutions with guaranteed constraint protection properties.  Furthermore, novel methods and governor design procedures have been developed for decentralized constraint enforcement in distributed/large scale systems, for prioritized constraint handling in cases when it is not feasible to enforce all constraints at once, for systems affected by large unmeasured disturbances, systems with time-varying constraints and time-varying references, and systems operated with commands sent over communication networks.  In addition, constraint enforcement techniques based on reference governors and more general model predictive control solutions have been developed for systems with nonlinear dynamics evolving on non-Euclidian configuration spaces (i.e., on manifolds) which emerge in various applications such as spacecraft control and robotics.  Finally, results and design techniques for reference governors placed to modify signals other than commands within the control loop have been established and schemes where in addition to reference command modifications the internal controller states may be reset have been proposed.    The research undertaken in this project has also synergistically combined advances in theory and the treatment of specific applications to aerospace and automotive systems.  Simulation-based and experimental studies have served to demonstrate the potential and quantify the benefits of the reference and extended command governor schemes, that have been enhanced with novel theoretical results that we have developed, for constraint handling (limit protection)  and to establish directions and requirements for further theoretical advances to satisfy the needs of these applications. Specific applications we have considered included downsized fuel efficient turbocharged automotive engines, aircraft gas turbine engines, high altitude long endurance very flexible aircraft that may provide an alternative to communication satellites, hypersonic vehicles essential to national defense, flying wind energy generation turbines, constrained spacecraft relative motion control with obstacle/debris avoidance, constrained control of spacecraft attitude while protecting sensitive sensors and maintaining communication links, assuring safe operation of aircraft gas turbine engines, and maintaining safe operation of advanced automotive Free Piston Engines (FPE) intended for hybrid hydraulic and electric vehicles.  In all of these applications, avoiding constraint violation is essential to be able to maintain safe operation of the system and reference and extended command governors provide attractive solutions.     The results have been shared with colleagues and partners in academia, industry and government laboratory through seminars, interactions, and collaborations...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
