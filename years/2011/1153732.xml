<AbstractNarration>The 2011 Electromagnetic Interactions with Nucleons and Nuclei (EINN) conference will be held from October 31 to November 04, 2011 in Pafos, Cyprus. This award will enable junior scientists without other means of support to attend the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EINN offers a unique venue for the presentation and discussion of frontier research covering the electromagnetic properties of atomic nuclei.  The conference runs across different subfields of electromagnetic nuclear physics, including those at the interface between nuclear and particle physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modest size of the conference and its cross-disciplinary aspect enhance the learning experience and provide serious training of the next generation of leaders in nuclear physics and related disciplines.  Students will have many opportunities to interact with present leaders in an informal setting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The  EINN 2011 ( http://cyprusconferences.org/einn2011/index.php) continues a tradition of biennial meetings since 1995 that foster presentation and unfettered discussion of the latest results in forefronts across the spectrum of basic nuclear physics research.  The ten sessions of the EINN2011 covered the following topics (http://cyprusconferences.org/einn2011/program.php):  Nucleon form factors and low-energy hadron structure (new  high  precision electron scattering results as contrasted with a new proton  radius extraction from Lamb shift measurements in muonic hydrogen) 3-dimensional partonic structure of the nucleon (new experiments and  future prospects in parton and generalized parton distributions,  transverse momentum distributions) Precision electroweak physics with searches for dark photons (new  weak charge measurement of the proton, beyond standard model physics,  first results for dark photon searches at MAMI and JLab) Meson structure (new meson transition FF results (pi0, eta, eta')  from BABAR and their interpretation, hadronic corrections to muon's  (g-2)) Baryon and light-meson spectroscopy (first complete polarization experiments) Nuclear effects and few-body physics (new vistas in nuclear physics  from a QCD perspective and in few-body chiral effective field theories)   The meeting was sponsored by the University of Cyprus, the Cyprus Institute, the Helmholtz Institute Mainz, the National Science Foundation and Jefferson Lab.    The meeting attracted 65 attendees including both established leaders in the subfields covered and promising young scientists (see Image 1).  Contributions from both groups have been emphasized in the selection of speakers and discussion leaders. Roughly half of the audience was composed of young scientists. A successful poster session (see Image 2) was organized and an oral presentation was given by the presenters of the top 3 posters selected by a panel of established physicists.  The EINN is considered a European counterpart of the Photo-Nuclear  Gordon Conference. It is unique  among physics conferences in covering a  very broad scope in an informal atmosphere with modest attendance.  The  scope of the program reviewed the latest results and plans for future  proposals as well as conveyed the breadth of the research field.  The  relaxed atmosphere, together with the balance among theorists and  experimentalists, enhanced learning, cross-fertilization, and  establishmed new research collaborations.  In summary we believe that EINN 2011 met its mission as described above. The next meeting is held October 29-November 2, 2013.
