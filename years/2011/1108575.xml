<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hops (<em>Humulus</em>, Cannabaceae), the female flowers of the hop plant, are used in traditional medicine to alleviate migraines, inflammation, insomnia, bladder problems, uro-gynecological infections, symptoms of menopause, and many other central nervous system and skin problems. The hop plants are thought to have originated in China because China is the only country in the world where all three species of hops are found. On the other hand, the knowledge, distribution, and variability of wild hop varieties in China is limited, and the sampling of wild hop populations in China is vague. Today, the common hop (<em>H. lupulus </em>L.) is cultivated in many temperate areas; the Yunnan hop (<em>H. yunnanensis </em>Hu) is endemic to the Yunnan province of China; and the Japanese hop (<em>H. </em><em>scandens </em>(Lour.) Merr.) is found naturally in East Asia and has been introduced elsewhere as an ornamental. Only the common hop<em> </em>is commercially farmed on a worldwide basis as an important preservative and flavoring in ales and lagers.

This vulnerability was experienced from 2006 through 2009 when dry conditions, disease, poor yield, and a fire in a hops storage warehouse led to a worldwide shortage of hops.
