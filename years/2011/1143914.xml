<AbstractNarration>This award will support student attendance at the IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC), which will take place June 26-28, 2012 in Porto, Portugal.  CCC is the primary conference for research on computational complexity, i.e., the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, conference attendance has been around 100, and around 30% have been students.  The conference's technical content and professional networking opportunities are particularly valuable to students.  Because the next meeting is outside the U.S., students with accepted papers may have difficulty attending.  This award will provide partial support to approximately ten student attendees to defray costs of registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was used to provide travel allowances to support student attendance at the 27th and 28th IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC), which took place from June 26 to June 29, 2012 in Porto, Portugal and from June 5 to June 7, 2013 in Stanford,California.   CCC is the primary conference for research in computational complexity, which studies the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. This study includes many fundamental problems, e.g., the feasibility of cryptography, the so-called P versus NP problem, and what could be achieved with quantum computers.   The conference's technical content and professional networking opportunities are particularly valuable to students.  This award provided support to fourteen student attendees (four for the 2012 conference, and ten for the 2013 conference) to defray costs of registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.  Students from across the country were supported, including many who otherwise would not have been able to attend.   In addition to paper presentations for the papers accepted to the conference, the program for both the 2012 and 2013 conference included invited talks and the conference's annual business meeting. For the 2013 conference, a rump session was also held with short, informal presentations of work in progress.  The recipients of the travel allowances supported by this grant were able to participate in all of these activities.   Due to the exposure to the latest research and networking possibilities, attendance at the conference benefits the research education of the students awarded funding.  Supporting an active pool of student researchers provides for the health of the computational complexity research community.
