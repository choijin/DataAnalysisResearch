<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program that is cofunded by Chemistry, Professor Karen Allen and colleagues from Boston University will acquire a circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) chemical and catalytic mechanisms of enzymes, (b) characterization of proteins, (c) natural product biosynthesis, (d) assignment of absolute stereochemistry of enantiomerically pure compounds, (e) determination of structural perturbations caused by mutations in glycolytic enzyme, and (f) stabilization of the functional form of NF-kappa-b essential modulator (NEMO) protein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A circular dichroism spectrophotometer will produce spectral data that provide information on molecular structure and especially the conformations of bio-molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and enzymes.  The principle of measurement is based on differential absorption of left and right circularly polarized light by optically active samples such as those in the double helix of DNA. The instrument will provide research and laboratory training in analytical techniques that allow measurement of physical properties of organic and inorganic molecules to graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows. The CD spectrophotometer will be integrated into training of students in the Chemistry and Biology Departments, as well as the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program for the study of intermolecular interactions, geometric isomers and protein structure.</AbstractNarration>
