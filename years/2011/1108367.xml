<AbstractNarration>This project will continue the research by PI James E. Dixon to continue underwater paleoenvironmental modeling and archaeological survey in Southeast Alaska as part of a multi-year effort to identify ancient archaeological remains on the continental shelf dating to the late Pleistocene, ca 12,000-16,000 y.a.  This is the time period when sea level was lower, due to the ice sheets covering large parts of North America.  During this time period, the coastline had the potential for supporting human occupation and it has long been hypothesized that this was one of the routes of early human migration from Asia to North America.  Following the flooding that occurred with the post-Pleistocene sea level rise, evidence of these early migrations,in the form of archeological sites, would have been covered and now occupying the contemporary sea floor.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous project, Gateway to America I, was supported though a Small Grant for Exploratory Research through the Arctic Social Sciences Program. During that pilot project, two anomalies in the undersea area were discovered; one resembling a stone fishing weir, the other a rectangular and circular shaped depresses that could be of cultural origin.   This project would continue the investigation started in the pilot project by 1) documenting and testing the anomalies observed in 2010, and 2) conducting additional underwater survey and testing guided by GIS modeling and field observations.  The project has the potential to bring empirical evidence to a decades old debate in North American archaeology: when and by what route did people migrate into North America from Asia?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the Earth's last geologic epoch, the Quaternary, the formation of continental glaciers resulted in vast amounts of water being transferred from the oceans to the land in the form of glacial ice.  The most recent event, or Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), peaked about 19,000 years ago when global sea level was lowered by about 120 meters (394 feet). This event exposed the relatively shallow seabed, or continental shelf, along the margins of the world's continents.  Along the Northwest (NW) Coast of North America isolated areas of unglaciated land supported terrestrial plants and animals during the LGM.  Fish, birds and marine mammals inhabited the adjacent coastal waters and shores. As the glacial ice retreated, terrestrial plants and animals colonized the newly exposed land.  About 17,000-16,000 years ago these events created a coastal corridor bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by the massive Cordilleran ice sheet.  This corridor may have been the first viable route for human migration from Asia to North America.  This suggests that North America's earliest archeological sites may lie beneath the sea on the continental shelf of the NW Coast.
