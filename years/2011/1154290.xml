<AbstractNarration>Project SOAR is recruiting, retaining, and graduating academically talented students as majors from the departments of biological sciences, chemistry, physics and geology, mathematics and statistics, or computer science.  Four cohorts of students are being organized, beginning with 17 scholars in the freshman year and with continuing support of 15 scholars for the cohorts from their sophomore through senior years.  The multi-disciplinary nature of the project is supporting collaborations between faculty in the participating disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOAR scholars are being supported in a variety of ways to ensure their academic success; these services include enhanced faculty mentoring, year-long freshman seminar, STEM learning communities, a STEM living community, peer tutoring, and peer mentoring.  SOAR students are being offered strong undergraduate research opportunities, internships, and co-ops and the project is being informed by both internal and external advisory boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SOAR project is coherently designed around effective practices for increasing retention and graduation rates for low-income, first-generation students.  The project is increasing the participation of members of groups underrepresented in STEM and is increasing the number of STEM graduates that will contribute to alleviating the region's needs.  The project is producing data via multiple modes of assessment and evaluation that will inform institutional changes in recruiting practices, design of first-year courses, use of discipline-specific learning communities, and academic support services.</AbstractNarration>

(Supporting Data are included in the images)</p> <p>1. <strong>Increased the retention for SOAR Scholars compared to similiar populations in both the STEM disciplines and university as a whole. </strong></p> <p>The average across four years of SOAR cohorts for 1st to 2nd Fall retention at the university was 92.2% compared to 70.5% for STEM Low Income and 73.9% for STEM overall. The average acorss four years of SOAR cohorts for 1st Fall to 3rd Fall retention at the university was 85.5% compared to 58.1% for STEM Low Income and 63.8% for STEM overall.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p>2.<strong> Increased graduation rates for SOAR Scholars compared to similar populations in both the STEM disciplines and the university as a whole. </strong></p> <p>Four-year graduation rates for our 2012-2014 SOAR scholars (2015 SOAR scholars have not graduated yet) are signficantly higher than similar populations in both STEM discipline and the university as a whole.

The 4-year graduation rate for the 2013 SOAR scholars is 77.8% compared to 27.0% for STEM Low Income and 32.8% for STEM overall. The four-year graduation rate for the 2014 SOAR scholars is 50% (comparative university data in not yet available). The 5- year graduation rate for the 2012 SOAR scholars is 77.8% compared to 36.6% for STEM Low Income and 41% for STEM overall. The 5-year graduation rate for the 2013 SOAR cohort is 94.0% (comparative university data is not yet available).</p> <p>3.<strong> Created a program model for recruiting, retaining, and educating financially needy academically talented STEM scholars at Northern Kentucky University.</strong></p> <p>The STEM scholar program, supported by CINSAM (Center for Integrated Science and Mathematics), was initiated in the Fall of 2018 and is modeled after the SOAR scholar program. The first class had 19 students, 16 of which are retained in STEM majors, and 1 retained in the university, yielding a 95% first-year retention rate similar to the average first-year retention rate of 92% for the SOAR cohorts funded by this award. Furthermore, strategies developed as a result of teaching the SOAR Freshman seminar class have been disseminated to Freshman seminar courses for both STEM and non-STEM majors on campus.</p> <p>4. <strong>Provided improved educational opportunities and student support programs in the STEM fields so that our SOAR Scholars could acheive their best academic performance. </strong></p> <p>SOAR scholars assumed leadership roles in the university as tutors, peer mentors, and STEM ambassadors. SOAR scholars in all four cohorts had higher GPAs compared to similar populations in both STEM discipline and univerisity as a whole. One hundred percent of the 2013 SOAR cohort, 86% of the 2014 SOAR cohort, and 79% of the 2015 SOAR cohort have participated in an undergraduate research or internship/co-op opportunity. Many SOAR scholars cite the SOAR Career Development course as instrumental in thier preparation for these experiences. <strong><br /></strong></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/17/2018<br>      Modified by: Pamilla&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ball</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1154290/1154290_10193416_1537198257301_RetentionRates_SOARII--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1154290/1154290_10193416_1537198257301_RetentionRates_SOARII--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.
