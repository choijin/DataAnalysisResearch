<AbstractNarration>Following an earthquake, or similar natural disaster, a key problem is rapid and accurate on-site damage assessment to support local first responders; however, trained experts are typically remote from the disaster and it can be time consuming and expensive to bring them onsite. Accessing remote experts to improve the accuracy of rapid assessments is a promising method to streamline provisioning of emergency shelters and other resources.  This project focuses on new methods for improved rapid assessment of earthquake damaged building structures in Christchurch, New Zealand. The methods are based on collaboration using augmented-reality (AR) imagery, mobile phone based sensor technologies and crowdsourcing techniques for guided remote data collection. A key element of the system is intuitive remote collaboration. Our mobile AR system can be used to connect a user in the disaster zone to a remote expert via audio and shared still images and/or video, helping them to rapidly collect data on building structural integrity. A user evaluation will be performed to compare the performance between the prototype and more traditional approaches (e.g., waiting for an expert to arrive on the ground), and assessment based on imagery recorded from an untrained and unguided user. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) a collaborative mobile AR system can improve the quality and type of data collected for structural assessment 2) the time to provide data from non-experts assisted by experts to decision makers in a digestible format is dramatically reduced as compared to traditional methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach will enable rapid post-event damage assessment, streamline emergency provisioning of shelters by allowing people to stay in safe dwellings, and speed up emergency response and reconstruction.  The resulting valuable dataset will assist development of rapid assessment forms, contribute to earthquake structural damage case studies, provide key baseline to test several computer science research projects on improved disaster response, and provide key data for development of life-saving tools.  The international collaboration also provides engagement of underrepresented groups in this computing research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Following an earthquake, or similar natural disaster, a key problem is rapid and accurate on-site damage assessment to support local first responders; however, trained experts are typically remote from the disaster and it can be time consuming and expensive to bring them onsite. Accessing remote experts to improve the accuracy of rapid assessments is a promising method to streamline provisioning of emergency shelters and other resources. Situational awareness is increasingly becoming available through untrained observers, but these data are of little assistance for skilled tasks such as assessment of structural damage where detailed observations by experts are required.  In this project, we developed and investigated the use of collaborative mobile augmented reality technologies to support rapid assessments of building structures. We developed a collaborative augmented reality application that provides a live audio and visual communication channel between a "non-expert" user located in the field and an "expert" user with access to maps, building information and other knowledge accessible at an offsite location.  With these tools the expert is able to guide a non-expert in the field while provide visual feedback via an augmented reality interface that overlays notations from the expert onto the field-of-view of the non-expertÆs mobile device.  Additionally, we performed a detailed analysis of the structural damage observed following the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand on February 22nd 2011, to better understand how such a system could help non-experts in the process of performing rapid damage assessment following a similar natural disaster.  Intellectual Merit: This project demonstrated that collaborative mobile augmented reality technologies could be suitable to support rapid assessments of building structures by non-experts in the field. By providing visual and situated feedback, allowing a remote expert to visually highlight a specific object or area within the users field of view, the user may be able to better comprehend the instructions provided to them compared to an audio only communications channel.  Broader Impact: The system development and data collection exercise was motivated by an important global need for rapid, large-scale condition assessment of building and infrastructure in devastating regional earthquakes to save lives and reduce further damage. The resulting valuable dataset will assist development of rapid assessment forms, contribute to earthquake structural damage case studies, provide key baseline to test several computer science research projects on improved disaster response, and provide key data for development of life-saving tools.
