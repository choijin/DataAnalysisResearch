<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Neill Wallis and Dr. Thomas Pluckhahn will use a unique form of pottery to identify patterns of social interaction across the "Deep South" of the southeastern U.S. during the late Middle and Late Woodland periods (ca. AD 200 to 800).  Termed  "Swift Creek Complicated Stamped pottery" and  associated with the Swift Creek and Weeden Island archaeological cultures it has the potential to provide an unexpected insight into prehistoric social organization.  Before drying and firing, the vessels were decorated with impressions from a carved wooden paddle.  The unique "fingerprints" of more than 400 individual carved wooden paddles have been recognized in the impressions on complicated stamped vessels, and the same paddle stamp can be identified on vessels distributed across multiple sites, sometimes hundreds of kilometers apart.  These "paddle matches" between sites lend detailed temporal and spatial resolution to social connections.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research makes a significant contribution to the currently limited body of anthropological knowledge of social interaction and exchange among non-hierarchical, foraging, or tribal societies in a precolonial world.  It is also important in delimiting patterns of interaction that may be correlated with important trends such as village aggregation, mound-building, mortuary practice, and long-distance exchange.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates five methods of analysis: (1) Instrumental Neutron Actication Analysis (INAA), (2) petrographic analysis, and (3) digital imaging of paddle stamp designs as complementary methods for determining where vessels were made; (4) technological analysis to identify how vessels were made and used; and (5) radiocarbon dating to develop a chronology of designs and paddle matches.  Examining collections from 24 sites distributed across nine regions in northern Florida and southern Georgia, these data will be used to distinguish between alternative forms of interaction. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include facilitating future collaborative research and presenting results in a public and timely fashion.  Painstaking research has resulted in the identification of hundreds of Swift Creek paddle designs, but the research potential of these data has been limited by haphazard data management.  The project will develop a searchable database that links high-resolution images of designs with other vessel attribute data and absolute dates.  This database will integrate multiple datasets and provide the synergistic foundation for integrating a growing body of data that can enrich many other research projects, especially regionally-focused theses and dissertations.  Maintained and integrated with the collections database at the Florida Museum of Natural History, portions of the research database will also be publicly accessible.  The web accessible version of the database will provide a collaborative forum for the public and an interpretive synthesis of current research results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Neill Wallis and Dr. Thomas Pluckhahn used a unique form of pottery to identify patterns of social interaction across the "Deep South" of the southeastern U.S. during the late Middle and Late Woodland periods (ca. AD 200 to 800). The pottery, termed "Swift Creek Complicated Stamped," provides unexpected insights into prehistoric social organization.  The impressions of wooden paddles carved with an array of unique designs serve like makerÆs marks in documenting vessels finished with an individual identifiable tool (Figure 1).  Telltale attributes such as the dimensions of design elements or wood crack patterns serve to identify the impressions of a particular wooden paddle so that vessels stamped with the same manufacturing tool can be recorded.  These "paddle matches" indicate unequivocally that an earthenware vessel or a wooden paddle was transported between sites.  By combining design data, patterns of vessel form and use, determinations of where a vessel was made through its chemistry (Neutron Activation Analysis ) and mineral inclusions (petrographic analysis), and radiocarbon dating of soot on vessel surfaces, this research ascertained types of social interaction and their predominant directions and levels of intensity across multiple ecological, social and cultural contexts.  Our targeted region was the Gulf coastal plain of Florida and southern Georgia, an area of about 150,000 km2 that reflects the full range of Middle and Late Woodland social diversity.  More than 1500 pottery vessels and sherds were analyzed from 29 sites (Figure 2).  Sampled sites included eight large multi-mound-village complexes, one of which was the largest population center north of Mexico at the time, Kolomoki in southwest Georgia.  The sample also includes six assemblages from solitary burial mounds that typically accompanied adjacent villages of smaller scale.  The remaining 15 site assemblages came from middens at small to moderately sized occupation sites.   What kind of interactions or movement do paddle matches represent?  We have distilled the possibilities down to five explanations.  Paddle matches may reflect group residential mobility as hunter-gatherers carried paddles, pots, or both, during (1) seasonal rounds or (2) large-scale migrations between regions.  Alternatively, the matches may result from (3) post-marital residence patterns in which a spouse carried belongings during a move.  Finally, vessels, vessel contents, or wooden paddles may have been (4) exchanged as subsistence or utilitarian provisions or (5) exchanged or made as offerings in special contexts such as mortuary ceremonies that accentuated the symbolic qualities of objects.  We note that these explanations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, we might expect for changes in residence of a person in marriage to be also accompanied by exchanges between descent groups.  The study found that paddle matches between sites are ubiquitous and exist at multiple scales, with some more than 200 km apart.  Multiple forms of interaction are likely represented, but two trends are particularly prevalent.  Pottery assemblages from large ceremonial centers exhibit numerous design connections to distant sites that result from the transport of wooden paddles.  In contrast, burial mounds at smaller sites contain numerous nonlocal vessels and paddle matches mainly to larger centers.  Rather than migrations or seasonal group mobility, movement in our study region thus seems to have been dominated by gift offerings of vessels transported from ceremonial centers to distant burial mounds, the exchange of wooden paddles to or from ceremonial centers, and the travels of individuals or small groups among sites on journeys that almost always included one or more ceremonial centers. The largest ceremonial centers were focal points for interactions and their pervasive reach among sites reflects a degree of centralization mirrored by ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
