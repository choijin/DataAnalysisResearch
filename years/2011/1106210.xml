<AbstractNarration>Technical: This collaborative research project aims to advance both scientific knowledge and synthesis of molybdenum disulfide in its atomically thin form. The research will elucidate the distinctive physical characteristics of this new material, including its electronic properties (band structure and its response to doping), optical properties (absorption, photoluminescence, and photoconductivity), vibrational properties (phonon frequencies and lifetimes), and its electrical transport properties (mobility and gating in different regimes). The principal investigators aim to develop a method for the synthesis of atomically thin MoS2 layers by a sequence of sulfur-loading of a copper surface followed by exposure to molybdenum. If successful, the research project will lead to practical methods to produce large-area samples of molybdenum disulfide in its atomically thin form and with controlled doping.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The research elucidates the behavior in the single-layer limit of a semiconductor (as opposed to graphene, which is a semimetal and has no energy gap), contributes to our general understanding of materials on the nanoscale, and creates the basis for future applications of this and related material systems in electronics and optoelectronics. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained in an interdisciplinary environment. The project also promotes collaboration of scientists in two academic institutions with one of them being an accredited Minority Serving Institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit      The growth and characterization of MoS2 layers on metallic and other surfaces has been the focus of our joint NSF DMR grant. Growth on Cu(111) taught us the use of benzenethiol as a sulfur source and we were able to create various Mo-S-based structures with different chemical affinity (Fig. 1). Based on this, we developed a method for the growth of single-layer MoS2 on SiO2/Si(111) (Fig. 2) and extended it to a variety of different substrates.  Triangular islands of MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2 (and several alloys, Fig. 3) have been grown and investigated in this project;  to this end a modified CVD growth method employing liquid organic chalcogen sources has been developed. It allows the preparation of both triangular TMD islands and extended single layer films (Fig. 2). The islands are single-layer thin and exhibit pronounced photoluminescence (PL).   Centimeter-scale continuous single layer films with good PL can be produced by our method. This is promising for future applications in device fabrication and it allows the investigation of the film composition by spatially less resolved techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Our extended films consist of abutting single-layer islands, i.e. they contain rotational domains. The fact that the films grow over a centimeter as a single layer while being practically free of double layer formation is an astonishing property of TMD CVD growth in general. At the edges of our films we find triangular-shaped islands (Fig. 2).  Through the use of organic precursors we can adjust the vapor pressure of any chalcogen in the process region independently and grow alloy materials. Fig. 4 shows how in MoS2(1-x)Se2x alloys the optical bandgap shifts with composition; XPS spectra on our extended films allow us to correlate directly composition and apparent bandgap (Fig. 5). Films grown by our method are typically homogeneous in composition to better than &plusmn;10 meV in bandgap or &plusmn;3% in composition from the sub-micron to the millimeter scale.  We developed a method of alternating sputtering and annealing of single-layer MoS2 films,  which permits the tuning of the materialÆs bandgap post-growth (Fig. 6).  On principle, this approach opens the door for future formation of lateral heterojunctions of the material anywhere on the surface of a substrate.    The growth substrate can be varied; the majority of our growth studies have been conducted on SiO2/Si because at &gt;30nm oxide thickness the TMD films can readily be seen by optical microscopy. Thinner oxide films on Si (including native oxide) can be used and show single-layer MoS2 Raman signal.

The results reveal a superlinear response in the absence of thermal effect; this finding points to the importance of defects in the transport properties of TMDs, a subject that is of broad relevance to the application of TMD materials.       Broader Impact  This projected was spearheaded at a Hispanic Serving Institutions (UC Riverside); through its collaborative nature, it allowed UCR students access to Columbia University. At UCR, this project (and an AGEP supplement) provided (female) Hispanic graduate students with research and development opportunities.  Undergraduate research is an important part of this research effort. In the last project year alone, more than 12 undergraduate students were trained in the growth of the single-layer films (the photo shows the total number of undergraduate researchers between August 2013 and April 2014 (9 month) in the Bartels lab). These include Hispanic individuals. For several of them, it meant a stepping stone toward graduate education ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
