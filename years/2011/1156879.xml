<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the REU site located at Idaho State University with a focus on applied nuclear physics. Undergraduate students will be recruited for ten weeks of summer research and will work with ISU researchers in Accelerator, Nuclear, and Materials Science Facilities in the Idaho Accelerator Center (IAC) and associated laboratories. Weekly lectures on advanced topics in materials science and physics are also planned, as are opportunities for students to improve their communication skills through presentations on their work. Once accepted into the program, but prior to arrival at ISU, REU students will be assigned to work in pairs with one or two specific faculty mentors. Assignments will be based on prior student experience and communications between students and mentors. Each pair of REU students will spend almost all of their time working with faculty mentors on a specific research project. A variety of social activities that allow students to explore the area and to interact with other students are also planned.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported 24 undergraduate students in summer research projects at Idaho State University.  The projects were each 10 weeks long in areas of applied nuclear science.  The students worked with faculty, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and other undergraduates in laboratories in the ISU departments of Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Anthropology, and at the Idaho Accelerator Center.   All participating students gained valuable research experience in advanced computation, data analysis, and experimental methods.  They used a wide range of experimental equipment common in research and industry, including nuclear instrumentation, detector systems, electronics, gas chromatography, chelation columns, CAD software, PIXE, XRF, gel electrophoresis, and particle accelerators.  Seventeen participating students successfully completed a radiation safety course.  They learned about radiation effects, hazards, dosimetry, safe practices, and regulations on the use, storage, and disposal of radioactive materials.  All students attended weekly lectures on research topics, nuclear science, data analysis, experimental techniques, electronic instrumentation, computer simulations and modeling techniques by research faculty.  They also improved communication skills in weekly meetings where they presented project status, and in two formal seminars where they presented their work in both poster format and in PowerPoint presentations.  General descriptions of the undergraduate research projects and the numbers of supported students involved in each are as follows:  Three students investigated radiation survival and cellular genetic repair mechanisms in extremophile bacteria, and persistence under exposure to antibiotics that mimic the DNA damage caused by radiation.  They used molecular genetic techniques to introduce multiple deletion alleles into wild strains to determine if gene functions overlapped resulting in greater radiation sensitivity.  This work improved understanding of how cells react to and resist radiation damage.  Two students used positron annihilation energy spectroscopy to study temperature and annealing effects on defect concentrations in aerospace materials.  Positrons were created through pair production from a photon beam produced using a linear accelerator.   Four students investigated refinements in calibration techniques applied to pharmaceutical quality control, and spectroscopic data analysis.  These included use of principle component regression (PCR) to determine whether selection of principle components may improve prediction errors, comparisons of smooth and rough PCR models in spectroscopic analysis, advantages of pure component net analyte signal with Tikhonov regularization calibration, and comparisons of different approaches to using Sum of Ranking Differences methods to select calibration tuning parameters.  Three students worked on developing processes for photonuclear production of 67Cu using particle accelerators.  This isotope is a medical tracer and used for cancer therapy.  One student performed simulations to optimize target geometries.  The second student performed simulations to predict 67Cu activity in irradiated targets.  The third student optimized parameters for chelating ion-exchange resins used for separation of radioisotopes from activated target materials.  One student used positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy to characterize defect densities in copper following annealing.  The student provided a quantitative assessment of the annealing processes, and correlated measurements with other complementary techniques.  Two students used simulations to optimize performance of prototype quartz Cherenkov detectors.  One student measured the gain and linearity of photo-multiplier tubes used in performance tests.  The long term goal of this project is to design and construct a much larger detector for the MOLLER experiment at Jefferson National Accelerator Laboratory.  Two students constructed and tested innovative RAM devices. One student developed conductive bridging devices with multiple resistance states several magnitudes apart.  Several were irradiated, withstanding high doses of both electron and gamma radiation with only slight degradations in device performance.  The other student developed resistive devices that can be switched between resistive states by applying positive and reverse bias.    One student successfully extracted and analyzed mitochondrial DNA from seven ancient human teeth and mandible fragments with ion torrent PGM genetic sequencing.  The student was able to assign these to a specific haplogroup.  Two students applied photon activation analysis in investigations.  One student determined the amount of gold in ore samples with resolutions well below current cut-off limits in the mining industry.  The other student determined that irradiation of waste from cancer therapy can convert long-lived 226Ra into the medically useful and short lived isotope 225Ac.  One student used principal component analysis to differentiate remains of three species of extinct bison from remains of eight other contemporary and modern mammals.  The student also identified six bones as belonging to Paramylodon harlani (giant sloth).  Two students designed, constructed, and tested detector arrays to analyze prompt gamma radiation and delayed neutrons from photo-induced fission events.  The detector arrays were designed for field work in homeland security applications.  They also established correlations between cosmic ray background events to barometric pressure.  One student developed and tested solid calibration polymers for photon activation analysis, x-ray fluorescence analysis, and other radio-analytical methods.  This work was disseminated by the students supported and their faculty mentors in over 40 presentations in seminars and at regional and national professional meetings, and in at least 7 publications.
