<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) and his research team will analyze magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere before, during, and after solar eruptive events to determine the physical conditions that are required for solar active region eruptions. The PI's team will use solar vector magnetogram observations from ground-based and space-based platforms, along with a three-dimensional, data-driven, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of active region evolution, to investigate these sources and drivers of solar eruptive activity. The PI's data-driven MHD model has been recently improved and enhanced to better impose self-consistent, time-dependent boundary conditions at the solar surface, in order to correctly input the observed changing photospheric vector magnetogram measurements. The effects of sub-photospheric convective zone dynamics are directly reflected through these surface boundary conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigation will provide the space weather modeling community with an improved physics-based solar eruption initiation model and could potentially lead to better operational space weather forecasts. Graduate students will be involved throughout this research program, as well as a summer intern student and an advising professor from Alabama A&amp;M University (AAMU, a historically black college). The unfunded collaborating professor at AAMU will actively recruit minority graduate students to work on this project and will participate in training these students in the use of the University of Alabama's solar active region evolution model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project an observation-based model, that for the first time, predicted the occurrence and timing of solar eruption and their interplanetary consequences known as Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) propagation was developed and published in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Space Physics, Paper 10.1002/2015JA021615.  This composite model consists of two very-well tested MHD models which also resulted from this NSF grant and a previous NSF grant.  These two models are (i) data-driven magnetohydrodynamic active region evolution (MHD-DARE) model for the construction of observed eruptive features based on measrued magnetic field on the Sun and (ii) three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic global coronal-heliosphere evolution (MHD-GCHE) model to tract the propagation of the observed eruptive feature to Earth. Please see the two figures.  Image 1 is the Magnetic topology simulated by NLFFF model before the eruption (2011 Sept 6 22:00UT).  The Sigmoid field is the low-lying S-shaped lines; field lines touching the null outline the spine-fan topology of the null, where the lines form an X-point configuration.  The null point locates ~18 arc sec (13 Mm) above the photosphere and ~50 arc sec away from the Sigmoid in the same direction of the eruption.  The upper panel is a side view and the lower panel is the SDO view.  Compared with the lower field are the Sigmoid observed by SDO/AIA-194 channel and the circular flare ribbon observed by AIA-304 (Jiang et la. 2013, ApJ, 771, L30).  Image 2 is the time evolultion of the 3D respresentation of a flux-rope CME magntetic field for 2011 Sept 6 at (a) t =22:23:35UT, (b) t=22:25:35UT, (c) t=22:27:35UT, (d) t=22:29:35UT.  The color on the solar surface represents the Br strength which is obtained by inserting the deduced flux-rope as shown in Image 1 based on the measured magnetograms to our 3D MHD-GCHE model.  The display field topology contains three parts: (i) solar wind (open) field; (ii) active region field and (iii) the flux-rope (Wu et al. JGR/2015JA021615, Feb 2016).
