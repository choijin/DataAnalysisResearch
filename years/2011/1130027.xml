<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to explore and elucidate fundamental bonding mechanisms that occur between particles in kinetic consolidation processes, such as ultrasonic fabrication and cold spray deposition.  The developed models will describe physical aspects of particle interaction affecting structure, properties and performance of consolidated materials.  In addition, specific bonding criteria will be pursued in a range of materials systems to improve current techniques as well as critical design tools for usage of new materials.  Computational simulations of particle impact during cold spray will identify distributions of stress and temperature.  These data will be correlated with high-resolution metallographic observations on particles experimentally impacted under identical conditions.  Further, parallel microscopic studies on specimens produced via ultrasonic consolidation will provide data to explore similarities between the two techniques as well as test modeling predictions with a more controllable particle stress state.  Mechanical characterization will be explored on all specimens to develop interfacial structure-property relationships and explore deformation and failure criteria in these materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of kinetic consolidation processes for currently-used materials such as aluminum, magnesium and copper alloys as well as establish process conditions to enable new materials systems to be produced.  The primary goal of this work is to determine how contacting particles develop strong bonds when subjected to supersonic impact or ultrasonic vibratory conditions.  Results may then guide industrial practice in input parameters, tool design, material selection, and pre-/post-processing techniques.  In turn, this could improve fabrication efficiency and mechanical behavior, or accelerate insertion of these materials into new applications.  The proposed work will also expand understanding of metallurgical thermodynamics and kinetics under high plastic strain rates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit of this project: Several industrial joining processes rely on the impact or rubbing of two surfaces at exceedingly high velocity to generate sufficient energy to form a bond.  While these processes are commonly used, and their usage is expanding, the fundamental nature of such bonding is not understood.  The major reason for this is that the factors at play are not at all simple; in fact, they involve theoretical aspects of metallurgy and mechanics of particle impact that have not been developed yet.   Moreover, singly considered, little progress would likely be made in either of these two fields.  In this project, we assembled a team of experts combining metallurgical, mechanical modeling and high strain-rate processing expertise, to create new mechano-metallurgical theories, in the proper context.  As a result, we successfully created a new modeling scheme in which to insert new metallographic theories, and also determined key aspects of interfacial bonding between surfaces that point to a critical importance of initial particle state.  That is to say, our work has allowed the exploration of a range of joined surfaces, and will allow the testing of several further hypotheses.  Broader impact: Of all the industrial joining processes, cold spray (CS) is expanding the most rapidly.   In CS, particles are impacted at supersonic speed onto a substrate, where they adhere (under the proper conditions) and build up to form a coating.  CS is a prime candidate for material reclaim (surface repair) and additive manufacturing.  However, because of the nature of CS, it primarily works for dense, ductile materials, and is difficult to implement for other materials that would have a range of exciting applications across technological sectors.   This is because the impacting conditions under which they bond is poorly understood. An empirical (trial-and-error) exploration of new materials is unfeasible, given the high number of changable parameters.  Therefore, a scientific understanding of bonding is required.  In this program, we contributed to this understanding, in particular by confirming aspects of temperature changes during impact, as well as illustrating the importance of initial particle state.  Further, the models developed can be used and considered by several other research teams, to explore further theories arising from experimental observations or first-order principles.  In this way, the infrastructure we created here also provides a platform on which theorists and industrial practitioners can effectively communicate.
