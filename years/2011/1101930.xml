<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to demonstrate a low-insertion-loss integrated optical waveguide isolator. The isolator uses a lossy and high refractive index layer that is a ferromagnetic matrix in an indium gallium arsenide phosphide layer.  Key tasks include: develop software capable of analyzing waveguides with ferromagnetic layers in the presence of static magnetic fields; design and fabricate integrated waveguide isolators; and design and fabricate a semiconductor laser integrated with an isolator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the realization of a practical optical isolator technology for photonic integrated circuits, which does not currently exist.  The proposed isolator is transformative, removing the barriers to large-scale integration in photonic circuits and allowing integrated photonic component counts to equal that seen in microelectronics.  This project will also result in the first software capable of handling ferromagnetic layers in complex, multilayer photonic waveguides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the nature of the researchers, the inclusion of young researchers and the free distribution of software.  The photonics research group at SMU has always been diverse with more than 50% female graduate students. A visiting female professor from Brazil will be part of this project.   Undergraduate students and high school students will be involved in this project, helping recruitment of U.S. students for graduate study.  The ferromagnetic waveguide software developed on this project, like all the photonic software developed by the SMU Photonics group, will be made available to the photonics community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed a theory for integrated optical waveguide isolators, an optical component that allows light to pass freely in one direction but blocks light in the opposite direction. Researchers have worked on the problem of an integrated waveguide isolator since the concept of Integrated Optics in the late 1960s to early 1970s.  Although such isolators have been demonstrated, to date all such waveguide isolators suffer from extremely poor performance.  Optical isolators are important because all optical components, and in particular semiconductor lasers, are highly sensitive to both the intensity and the phase of even small amounts of unwanted reflected light.    Conventional optical isolators require a magneto-optically active material that is not easily incorporated with conventional semiconductor materials used for photonic devices such as lasers, detectors, splitters, multiplexers or electronic devices.  As a result, optical isolators in photonic systems such as fiber optics networks use large, discrete isolators.    A goal of this project was to develop a waveguide isolator that could be miniaturized and monolithically integrated with photonic components&mdash;not only semiconductor lasers, but also for use in large photonic integrated circuits that are expected to parallel in complexity the large scale electronic semiconductor chips that contain billions of interconnected transistors that make computers and the internet possible.  The realization of large scale photonic integrated circuits or the combining of numerous photonic components with electronic components on silicon (called "silicon photonics"), which can only be achieved with integrated waveguide isolators, promises to continue the exponential progression of semiconductor technologies that lead to remarkable advances in medicine, artificial intelligence and security.   This NSF work resulted in integrated waveguide isolator designs that met acceptable specifications for greatly reducing the intensity of backward traveling light ("isolation ratio" of more than 33 dB) with low loss of intensity for light propagating through the isolator ("insertion loss" of less than 2.5 dB).  However, the lengths of such integrated optical isolators, while marginally acceptable, are about five times larger than desired at 5 mm. Our future work is directed at finding material combinations and device configurations that maintain or improve the isolation and insertion loss values while reducing the length of such isolators to 0.1 to 0.5 mm.  In addition to the technical achievements, three female graduate students received Ph.D. degrees from support from this NSF project.  Two more graduate students (one male and one female) and one male undergraduate student were also supported by this project.  Professor Maria Martinez of CEFET in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil also participated in this project while a visiting Professor at SMU.  Three papers were pubished, two more submitted and one patent is in preparation, all related to and in large part supported by this project.
