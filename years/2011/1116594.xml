<AbstractNarration>This award is dedicated to the new research on the analysis of Boolean functions.  Boolean functions (i.e., mappings from n bits to 1 bit) are one of the most basic objects of study in computer science: they arise in areas as diverse as cryptography, error-correcting codes, learning theory, and circuit design.  One of the most effective tools for studying Boolean functions is by considering their Fourier transform and related analytic properties.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has been at the forefront of research on analysis of Boolean functions over the last decade and will further develop theory and applications via an attack on three important unsolved problems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The Fourier Entropy-Influence Conjecture on how "spread out" the Fourier coefficients of a Boolean function can be.  Proving this conjecture would have important consequences for learning theory.&lt;br/&gt;2. The Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture on influences of low-degree Boolean functions.  This conjecture has direct relevance to understanding the power of quantum computation.&lt;br/&gt;3. The Gotsman-Linial Conjecture on functions computable by the sign of a low-degree polynomial.  This is a major problem in the field of concrete complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of Boolean functions has had broad application throughout computer science; it has also had interdisciplinary application through its use in mathematics, statistical physics, and economics.  The PI will further develop and spread the impact of the area by writing the first textbook on analysis of Boolean functions.  The textbook will be released freely, in installments on a blog.  This will not only enhance the connection between research and education, it will foster learning for computer scientists (and aspiring computer scientists) regardless of status and geographic location.  Finally, the PI will continue to make broader impact through advising and guiding graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and through widely disseminating research results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The broad goal of this project was to develop the foundations of an area of Computer Science Theory called Analysis of Boolean Functions.  Boolean functions are one of the most basic objects of study in computer science; they are mappings on binary strings (0's and 1's), and are used to represent many important things -- the operation of computer circuits, error-correcting codes, and large networks, among other things.  The phrase "Analysis of Boolean Functions" refers to the use of the mathematical tool of "Fourier analysis" in the study of Boolean functions.  The project had several major subgoals.  Some of these subgoals were to try to solve specific important mathematical problems related to Analysis of Boolean Functions that are known to have a major impact for quantum computing, machine learning, and other areas.  Specifically, it was a goal of the problem to investigate the "Fourier Entropy-Influence Problem", the "Aaronson-Ambainis Problem", and the "Gotsman-Linial Conjecture". Over the course of the project, partial progress was made on the first two problems; the third problem was actually essentially solved by another researcher during the course of the project.  Another subgoal of the project was to do further basic research on problems connected with Analysis of Boolean Functions.  This subgoal was met very successfully, with 64 research publications in the area being produced by the PI and his students during the course of the project.  Yet another target outcome for the project was to train and students at Carnegie Mellon University and develop their research and teaching skills.  The project allowed for the support and training of six PhD students, two of whom graduated and went on to faculty positions, and four of whom are continuing their PhD.  Finally, one of the big goals for the project was the completion of the first modern textbook on the subject of Analysis of Boolean Functions.  This textbook was begun slightly before the project began, and was worked on throughout the course of most of the project.  The textbook was completed in 2015, and was published both in the traditional form and also freely on the internet.  Since its publication, it has been freely downloaded by approximately 2000 researchers (and also purchased by about the same number).  It has also been cited 100+ times, and used as a textbook for three graduate courses worldwide.  In addition, as part of the project, a new graduate course on Analysis of Boolean Functions was created at Carnegie Mellon. From it, 200+ pages of publicly available lecture notes have been produced, along with 30 hours of publicly available video lectures.
