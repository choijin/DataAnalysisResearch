<AbstractNarration>Professor Feimeng Zhou of California State L A University is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to interface surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with various analytical and separation techniques and use the hyphenated analytical tools to study molecular binding events and to identify biomarkers of relevance to neurological disorders. Three related projects are proposed. Electrochemical flow-injection SPR will be used to determine ligand-receptor binding; imaging SPR will be used for high-throughput screening of potential inhibitors of beta-secretase, which is relevant to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease; and label-free SPR will be combined with size-exclusion chromatography for the separation and detection of Alzheimer's disease-related peptides and protein fragments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed research will lead to the development of new hyphenated analytical tools which may positively impact the diagnosis and therapy of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. Undergraduate students in a minority serving institution will be trained in analytical instrumentation, device fabrication, surface chemistry, biosensor, and neurochemistry, and will be motivated to pursue advanced studies in chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: The advantages of SPR for studying biomolecular interactions and biomarker detection include high sensitivity, low sample consumption, collection of kinetic and thermodynamic information in real time, and the obviation of labeling molecules for detection. Combination of SPR with other analytical techniques facilitated the significant expansion of SPR applications and provided new insight into factors and processes that are related to the etiology of neurological disorders.

As the research projects are seamlessly integrated with curriculum development, community outreach, infrastructure building at CSULA and collaborative research projects with other groups on and off campus, they have contributed to science/engineering education and research.        Broader Impacts: The project ensured the continuation of the PI?s productive research with undergraduate and master?s level graduate students and other research personnel in the past five years.
