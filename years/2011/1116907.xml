<AbstractNarration>This research project is exploring a new way of writing computer&lt;br/&gt;programs, based on a new programming language Plaid.  Plaid is the first&lt;br/&gt;programming language to incorporate "permissions" natively into the&lt;br/&gt;language.  These permissions allow the programming language to more&lt;br/&gt;accurately model things that change--for example, a connection to a web&lt;br/&gt;site that might be interrupted and then later reconnected.  Such a&lt;br/&gt;permission-based language helps engineers coordinate on a software&lt;br/&gt;project, making engineers more productive, and reducing bugs that&lt;br/&gt;end-users see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a technical level, the project integrates permissions such as&lt;br/&gt;"unique," "immutable," and "shared" into the language via a new kind of&lt;br/&gt;type system, based on linear logic.  These permissions express aliasing&lt;br/&gt;information, and this aliasing information can be leveraged to do many&lt;br/&gt;things, including safely changing the representation of objects at run&lt;br/&gt;time and automatically parallelizing code.  The project is investigating&lt;br/&gt;the design of a single permission system that can address multiple such&lt;br/&gt;concerns; investigating how models of inheritance, composition,&lt;br/&gt;sub typing, casts, and polymorphism must be adapted to handle&lt;br/&gt;permissions; and what design choices can best make such a language&lt;br/&gt;practical for writing programs of significant scale and design complexity.</AbstractNarration>
