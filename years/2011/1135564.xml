<AbstractNarration>Advances in sensor and communication technologies and increased cyber-connectivity are enabling access to a vast amount of varied datasets. This access is interactive in that one can control what is being collected, how often it is sampled and the granularity at which it is being collected. Such cyber-enabled infrastructures are poised to revolutionize the way the physical world is monitored and field experiments are performed -- with automated, remote, real-time data collection and feedback replacing traditional manual, and time-consuming methods. Although web accessible information is being used in our daily decision making and has enabled exciting new research possibilities, it is very under-utilized in learning and classroom environments. It is not enough for the next generation workforce to be simply trained to view or utilize online data, rather they must be able to synthesize new solutions to emerging challenges by leveraging diverse cyber-infrastructure enabled data sources. The premise of this work is that training such a cyber-infrastructure literate citizen must start at the K-12 level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is to increase the exposure of K-12 teachers and student populations to sensor network and simulation based cyber-infrastructure tools. Research has shown that experiments and hands-on activities are an important part of the curriculum as they re-enforce textbook knowledge and lead to better retention. Currently, these activities often are restricted to in-class experiments subject to the available space (the classroom), instruments and resources, and are of limited duration (the span of a single class). Point data is used (e.g., holding temperature to a fixed value for the duration of the experiment) rather than time-varying input (which better models real-world systems). Further, for new, emerging areas of science and technology, students often have to rely on reading in textbooks. For example, a new Kansas Standards for Agricultural Education requires students to learn about sustainable agriculture practices, use of GPS/GIS, and the impact of fertilizers/pesticides on yield. However, due to lack of resources, students mainly rely on reading about sustainable agriculture from textbooks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the proposed project include developing sensor infrastructure for field experiments, simulation software, and curriculum and training material for K-12 education. These efforts include the following: (a) Developing software and training modules for sensor network based data collection technologies: The aim is that teachers will eventually be able to replace "in-class observing" with "real-time data" for experiments in any of their science and technology classes, and include interactive aspects involving reactions to real-time input, (b) Developing a "smart farm" simulation package in which students will manage the day-to-day operations of a virtual farm, and link it to diverse data sources including real-time data, (c) Promoting inquiry based education by developing lesson plans based on field experiments and simulation software, integrating them into curriculum and training teachers/students based on these lesson plans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include reaching out to a diverse pool of students to broaden participation. The project builds upon past successful projects in real-time embedded sensor systems design funded by NSF RET (Research Experience for Teachers) and NSF CRCD (Combined Research-Curriculum Development) programs, and the NSF GK-12 STEM Fellows program. These have resulted in strong relationships with both rural and urban Kansas schools. This project leverages these connections to train a diverse population set. The project is reaching out to rural under-served school districts in Kansas and those with significant Hispanic population. The focus on agricultural applications via Smart Farm simulations enables the project to reach student populations that have historically been underserved. By making the software web-accessible, the project is working to minimize the "Technology Gap" between those students who have broadband access and state-of-the-art computing hardware in their homes, and those who have outdated or no equipment. The team is continuing to work with existing programs at Kansas State University such as GROW and EXCITE which bring middle and high school girls to campus, and with the Kan-Ed program whose purpose is to provide state-wide collaboration and information exchange opportunities among educational institutions in Kansas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this project was to increase the exposure of K-12 teachers and student populations to sensor network and simulation based cyber-infrastructure tools.  Specifically, we developed software and training modules for sensor data collection technologies, developed a æsmart farmÆ simulation package, and conducted teacher trainings with these materials.  In-Service Teacher Development  Ten K-12 teachers were brought to our campus in the Summer of 2014 for a one-week intensive training session on agriculturally-based sensor technologies and the SmartFarm simulation software, with an emphasis on utilizing them within their classrooms in an inquiry-based instructional approach.  These teachers then took these skills and applied them during the 2014-2015 school year, reaching more than 200 K-12 students.  Sensor Technology Modules  Training modules and curriculum materials were developed for sensor technologies used in agriculture, including the use of cameras (both conventional and infrared) to assess photosynthetic biomass using Normalized Differentiated Vegetation Index (NVDI), using sensors to control irrigation systems, using cameras to compare plant phenotypes, and using subdermal sensors to track livestock movement and assess health status.  SmartFarm Software  The centerpiece of the project was an agricultural simulation game &ndash; SmartFarm &ndash; which allows students to create and manage their own farms with a mixture of real-world and simulated data.  For example, in setting up the boundaries of their farms, the students can specify the boundaries with a Google Maps interface, or use a GPS-equipped mobile device to walk the boundaries of real-world fields.  Weather can be simulated using a probability model or can be created from historical data.  The software was released under the MIT Open Source License and is available at: http://github.com/ZombiePaladin/SmartFarm.  "Hackable Glass Box" Simulations  The SmartFarm software itself went through many iterations as we tackled the challenge of incorporating 20- and 30-year old simulation software into a modern web-based game, which eventually consisted of rebuilding much of the simulation code in modern languages.  Along the way we came to realize some of the most important learning opportunities were being buried in the simulation code, which students had no direct way to interact with.  It was becoming, in engineering terms, a "Black Box", a component that takes input and output from a user without the user understanding its function.  This represented a significant loss of learning opportunities, and one we strove to overturn.  From this desire we developed the concept of a "hackable glass box" simulation, one in which not only are the underlying simulation algorithms exposed to the user (the glass box), but they are tweakable (hackable).  Each simulation model &ndash; the weather, nutrient movement in the soil, water movement through soil, plants, and atmosphere, and the plants growth, are implemented in SmartFarm using the Blockly block-based programming environment developed by Google.  Students can tweak existing models, exploring what happens when new strains of wheat can survive and thrive on 20% less water, or potential impacts climate change might have on crops.  Moreover, students can create their own models from scratch &ndash; one of our curriculum projects involved doing just that &ndash; raising test crops and statistically deriving a growth model from observations.  This idea of a hackable glass box simulation has impact far beyond this one project &ndash; it can be applied in any situation where modeling can be part of the learning process.
