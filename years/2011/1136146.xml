<AbstractNarration>A CPS is a system in which computer-based (?cyber?) technology is combined with all kinds of physical systems, such as planes and robotic-surgeons. CPSs require integration (in industry and academia) of different types of knowledge from many different domains. CPSs are built from often inaccurate, undependable components, and operate in harsh and unpredictable environments. The cyber domain, interfaces, and the physical domain are tightly interwoven and networked (distributed) and hence cannot be designed and optimized individually. The goal of this project is to create a general CPS design-science that makes the design of every CPS simpler, faster, and more dependable, while at the same time reducing the cost and the required expertise level. This project gives rise to a unified theory that can allow for specification, modeling, design, optimization, and verification of CPSs on different levels of design abstraction and different steps of projection, even across boundaries between varied technologies. The project does bridge the gap between the continuous-time physical domain and the discrete timed cyber system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has a broad and profound impact in scientific, engineering, industrial, and academic communities. By enabling a fundamentally efficient design of CPSs, the most limiting bottleneck in design technology is eliminated, paving the way for many new applications and jobs with significant economic and social impact. This project contributes to the on-line educational endeavors currently underway, allowing cross education in different disciplines of complex CPS and speeding up development of new CPS programs in engineering and computer science.</AbstractNarration>

The application of control theory to steer design decisions in the system building process. Ensured correct operations of the CPS applications in presence data, sensor and process anomalies. Robust scheduling of real-time tasks in presence of platform uncertainties and transient overload situations.   Fourth, we disseminated our findings, including the framework for a range of practical applications and to improve the education of cyber-phyiscal systems.  The applications include:  A device for real-world testing of medical ventilators. ECG-based biometric authentication that utilizes physical body properties to ensure safety and security in body area sensor networks. Timing attack aware high-level synthesis of integrated circuits by changing the open source LegUp HLS tool to mitigate physical side-channel attacks. Heating ventilation and air-conditioning system that works correctly in presence of sensor faults.     The project teaching outcomes were disseminated as follows:  An automated learning management tool in an engineering course based on interdisciplinary metrics. Web-based online programming framework and virtual lab which allows students to program and interact with a CPS on different levels of abstractions.  Two graduate level courses (CS 245, EECS 225) as well as an undergraduate level course (CS 145 A/B) at UCI Several undergraduate and graduate MS students have been exposed to research. The students have had the opportunity to contribute to research activities and author academic papers. Three graduate Students submitted and successfully defended their PhD theses.
