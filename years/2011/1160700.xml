<AbstractNarration>Linguists studying endangered languages in the field often ask their informants to describe pictures that illustrate particular characteristics of their language, such as how it uses pronouns or spatial relations or concepts of time.  This enables the field linguist to obtain natural language with minimal instruction, exercising minimal influence on what is said, so that accurate information about the language can be recorded.  Typically such pictures are prepared in advance, based upon research hypotheses about the language -- but often new hypotheses emerge in the course of sessions with informants.  Researchers at Columbia University have proposed to develop an aid to field linguists which makes it possible to test new research questions as they arise in the field.   They will adapt existing text-to-scene generation software, WordsEye, which allows users to create 3D scenes from simple English input, to produce a novel tool for fieldwork called WELT, the WordsEye Linguistics Tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WELT tool will ultimately have two modes of operation:  1) In Phase 1, English input will automatically generate a picture which can be used to elicit a targeted description, 2) In Phase 2, input in the target language will automatically generate a picture representing the meaning of the input, to verify linguistic hypotheses with native speakers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While WELT is intended ultimately for general use, it will initially be developed to study Arrernte, an endangered language spoken by ~6000-8000 Arrernte people in Central Australia.  While some aspects of this language are well documented, a number of idiosyncratic lexical and morphological features of the language that relate to describing spatial relations are not well understood.  Such features are interesting because they relate directly to how a language is used by its speakers to describe the way their perceive the world.  The language group's remote location and insular culture have made it difficult to document by traditional means, so that tools such as WELT should be particularly useful.  WELT will be tested in the field as part of an existing cooperation with Dr. Mark Dras and other researchers at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Information &amp; Intelligent Systems of the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering is [co-]funding this award as part of its commitment to support the development of computational tools and methods for the documentation of endangered languages.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This  work focused on developing the WordsEye Linguistics Tools (WELT), a  novel toolset for field linguists studying endangered languages.  WELT  is based on WordsEye, an existing text-to-scene system for English, and  includes tools for eliciting and documenting language data.  While other  fieldwork tools do exist, our work differs from these in that it will  allow a linguist to create custom elicitation materials that can easily  be modified in realtime, to document the semantics of an endangered  language, and to create a text-to-scene system that generates 3-D scenes  from endangered language input.  We  created the elicitation tool, which allows users to organize  elicitation sessions around sets of 3D scenes they have created in  WordsEye.  While eliciting descriptions of these scenes from a native  speaker of an endangered language, the field worker can easily modify  scenes and create new ones in response to data collected.  The tool also  provides the means to record audio and type transcriptions, glosses,  and notes.  We used WordsEye to create about 40 scenes representing  different spatial relations (based on the Max Planck topological  relations picture series), and elicited Nahuatl descriptions of them  from a native speaker informant.  In preparation for eliciting data from  native speakers of Arrernte, an aboriginal Australian language, we  created custom content for WordsEye that is particularly relevant to the  culture and geographic location of the Arrernte people.  We  created the tool for writing syntax-to-semantics rules, which map  syntactic structures of a language into a semantic form compatible with  WordsEye.  We used this tool to create sample syntax-to-semantics rules  for Arrernte.  By combining these an existing Arrernte morphological  analyzer and syntactic grammar, we built a demo pipeline that takes  Arrernte text as input and generates a scene representing the meaning.  We also modified the underlying semantics of WordsEye so that the  resulting scenes would reflect Arrernte culture rather than American  culture.  This included changing the default backdrops of scenes to  reflect landscapes typical of Central Australia and replacing objects  associated with American football with their Australian footy  equivalents.  Instead  of requiring the field linguists to build a computational grammar from  scratch for each language, we began investigating ways that WELT could  learn a syntactic parser based on annotated examples.  We created a  corpus of English descriptions of spatial and motion events and labeled  these with syntactic dependency relations and used previously annotated  corpora in other genres for five other languages.  We implemented an  algorithm for learning a dependency parser and ran experiments to see  (a) how successfully we could learn a parser from limited examples and  (b) which machine learning techniques were most successful.  We found  that this method performed very well across all six languages,  outperforming the baseline even when trained on fewer than ten labeled  sentences.  Of the machine learning classifiers, we found that support  vector machines performed the best overall, but there were some  cross-linguistic differences that will need to be investigated further.   Our ultimate goal is to help linguists studying endangered languages to document and analyze these languages more easily using our computational tools.  Saving endangered languages not only helps to preserve people's cultures but it provides ways that new generations can explore the languages of their ancestors and motivates them to learn and use those languages.
