<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Jennifer Whiles Lillig from Sonoma State University and colleagues Carmen Works, Steven Farmer and Jon Fukuto will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) characterization of the structure/function relationship of antimicrobial bacteriocins, (b) synthetic methodologies that allow preparation of biologically active derivatives containing the carbazole ring structure, (c) synthesis, characterization, and potential biological applications of HNO donors, and (d) characterization of small chromium(III) binding peptides and functional mimics in chromium biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Receiving this award has greatly enhanced our ability to train undergraduate research students.  The access to modern instrumentation is vital for students to be successful in graduate school and/or industry positions.  The 400 MHz NMR allowed us to expand current and begin new research projects.  These projects include the structural characterization of:  1) fluorescent compounds from local natural mushrooms and trees which could be important for medical imaging purposes, 2) antibiotic peptides with potential as antibiotics and food preservatives, 3) model compounds important for understanding photo-sensitive release of carbon monoxide and catalysis of hydrogen, and 4) small molecules in the  study of small molecule transmitters.  All of these research projects have involved the direct participation of Sonoma State undergraduate students.  Sonoma State students have also utilitzed the instrument in multiple classoom settings including project driven experiences of their own design in upper division capstone courses.  This student and faculty work has resulted in multiple publications and conference presentations with Sonoma State faculty and student coauthors.  This work has also been utilized in public ourtreach to local high schools In addition, this instrument has enabled us to make direct connections with our local junior colleges such as the Santa Rosa Junior College and Mendocino Community College as well as a smaller private university, Dominican University.  Faculty and students from these institutions have utilized the instrument for classroom experiments and to begin faculty-student research projects.  This instrument has also supported our department infrastructure with the addition of a part-time technician to our staff.  This additional support is important for instrument upkeep to ensure the continued training of our student scientists.
