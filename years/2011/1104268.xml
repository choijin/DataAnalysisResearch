<AbstractNarration>The Midwest Center for Information Technology (MCIT) builds on the collaborations developed under previous grants to further the regional cooperation among ten rural community colleges in Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, and North Dakota in partnerships with secondary schools, four year educational institutions and industry.  Prior work emphasized the faculty.  From lessons learned, the Center now focuses on the student.  A centralized virtual portal for student participation and tracking, with direct college and employer participation, is added to the CareerLink website supported by the Applied Information Management Institute.  The CareerLink site also facilitates more careful tracking of IT graduates from all ten colleges.  The Center educates the entrepreneurial technicians required by small and medium sized enterprises through the development of scenario-based learning modules that can be infused into many technical classes and can be shared through virtualization.  The Center also builds on past work to test, refine and research the efficacy of strategies to retain more women in IT programs and place them in IT-related positions.  The extensive evaluation determines the impact that scenario-based learning has on student learning, retention and employability.  The effectiveness of the virtualization platform in delivering course content relative to faculty collaboration across colleges, student performance and retention and business engagement is evaluated.  The evaluation also investigates how the technological systems and shared evaluation increase the cooperation between the colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Midwest Center for Information Technology  The Midwest Center for Information Technology (MCIT) has steadily built an active consortium of ten community colleges across four states to support increasingly skilled faculty, a shared process for ongoing faculty professional improvement, a robust articulation-supported pipeline of students, an interested and contributing business community and the integration of the innovative Careerlink system that directly connects the IT classroom with IT workplace goals.  The MCIT impact is continuing to grow as the project is sustained, with a total to date of more than 600 associate degrees and certificates awarded, over 1000 faculty over the four states trained, and hundreds of students each year sharing cloud-based educational scenarios while learning the skills most needed by IT businesses.  Most importantly, MCIT has established a viable consortium model within the context of the ten community colleges and businesses with a relationship based on trust, collaboration and shared resources.   The MCIT is facilitated by the Applied Information Management Institute (AIM) that is based in Omaha, Nebraska and works closely with the ten participating community colleges, whom together educate more than 90% of all community college students in the four-state Midwestern region.  AIM is a not-for-profit community organization that works strategically across both education and business partnerships to promote technology to empower people, enhance organizations, and create brilliant communities. The core mission is IT talent development, from early student interest - to linking people to careers - to ongoing IT career development.  MCIT has been a signature AIM collaborative initiative during the last decade.  MCITÆs collaborative innovation is steadily expanding the IT workforce pipeline in the four-state region. MCIT has already partnered with over 2,200 Midwest employers, while leveraging the online Careerlink system to make direct connections between industry needs and the school curriculums. An average of 4,250 IT jobs are now listed monthly within Careerlink that are directly linked to IT coursework and more than 30 problem-based scenarios, accessible by nearly all of the community college population across the four states.   MCITÆs efforts have been informed by consortium studies, including a Women in IT study that interviewed 43 women and 26 men IT professionals, documenting a variety of insights, such as perceived improvement in the "glass ceiling", the importance of early IT engagement for girls, and a subtle "social exclusion" of girls interested in IT.  The Youth Perceptions of IT study, which conducted 16 youth focus groups with 157 youth, resulted in insights such as: most students think of IT as an individual enterprise; students would become more interested in an IT career if given more useful coursework; and that the way some IT courses are taught make them relatively unattractive.  Based on MCITÆs collaborative studies, past successes, and the growing Careerlink resources, MCIT is continuing to build a foundation of IT program and workplace innovation that is becoming a hallmark of the consortium. The MCIT program was recently showcased in a 2015 article in the Journal of Community College Research and Practice called "It Takes a Village to Raise an IT Student: Ten Observations on Institutional Collaboration by the Midwest Center for Information Technology" and the project continues to inform other community college consortiums on how they might work together better to grow and benefit the IT pathways from "cradle to career" in their local communities.
