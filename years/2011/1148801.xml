<AbstractNarration>The NSF-funded MCTP project based at the University of New Mexico (UNM) has three main goals: to provide opportunities for students to strengthen their understanding of mathematics and its applications, to impact mathematics education at all levels, and to build an engaging, interacting community.  Led by a dynamic group of ten UNM faculty, the MCTP program at UNM will offer an intensive mathematics summer camp geared at advanced undergraduates from throughout the Southwest. This will be followed by an undergraduate honors research program at UNM in which students are closely mentored throughout the academic year. Simultaneously, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows willstudy advanced mathematics in a Qualifying Exam Preparation Seminar which will help both groups succeed in their graduate and post-graduate work.  The summer camp will include one week focused on mathematics at the high school level and incorporate high school teachers.  Its purpose will be to help participants develop a profound conceptual understanding of key mathematical ideas and on how to present them engagingly. This will provide a rich source of professional development for and interaction between current and future educators.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will develop a Graduate Student Teacher Training Seminar in which they critically analyze aspects that impact teaching and learning. An outreach program will teach undergraduates to verbalize mathematics in simple, clear, well-organized terms, which they will then present to high-school students. This will promote interaction between university and high school students.  Here, we will target less privileged schools with large minority populations.  Undergraduates at all levels will interact during the Southwest Undergraduate Mathematics Research Conference (SUnMaRC) and through Math Club activities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort is intended to provide an exciting and rich opportunity to the benefit of all approximately 300 participants directly involved. All participants will gain mathematical knowledge and breadth through various components such as the summer workshop, the undergraduate research program, and the qualifying exam seminar. The postdoctoral fellows  will have excellent conditions to develop into effective professionals.  All participants will become more aware of sound pedagogical practices which will make them better at transmitting their knowledge and giving those they teach a solid mathematics foundation.  The grant will yield outcomes that will permit us to continue the main activities with significantly fewer resources after it has expired. In particular, we will build a structure that enables us to continue the outreach program, the undergraduate research program, the teacher training and the qualifying exam preparation courses.  This program will also affect the visibility and perception of mathematics at our university. We have a thriving Math Club whose members are energetic and enthusiastic about mathematics, and we hope we can spread that enthusiasm to produce a thriving, self--sustaining atmosphere of creative enquiry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The MCTP NSF DMS-1148801 grant was awarded to the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New Mexico to support programs aimed at attracting students to the mathematical sciences and helping undergraduates, graduates, and post-graduates already in the field succeed, while also impacting mathematics education at all levels. To achieve this goal, the Department engaged in several activities supported by the grant.   ACTIVITIES  (1) The Department offered four month-long Summer Math Camps for undergraduates in each of the four years supported by the grant. These camps were open to any student in the US Southwest and also included a week-long mini-course geared toward mathematics education attended by interested students and K-12 teachers from the Albuquerque area.  In total, 125 students and teachers participated in the Summer Math Camps (54 women, 48 minorities), as well as 13 UNM faculty members.   (2) The Department's faculty mentored 27 undergraduate research projects (9 women, 6 minorities) over the timeframe of the grant, supported by the grant.   (3) The Department supported 74 UNM undergraduates' participation in the Southwest Undergraduate Mathematics Research Conference  (SUnMaRC) and another 53 from other institutions when the conference was hosted at UNM in 2013 (total of 48 women, 65 minorities).   (4) The Department started an outreach program in which undergraduates visit Albuquerque Middle and High Schools. The goal here is to share UNMs students excitement for mathematical sciences with the Albuquerque School students.   (5) The Department developed a Graduate Student Teacher Training Seminar to improve teaching skills of the graduate students, many of whom will be future mathematics teachers. A total of 14 graduate students were supported (5 women, 5 minorities). Graduate student success was also supported by a Qualifying Exam Preparation Seminar.   (6) The Department supported two postdoctoral fellows that contributed to many NSF-MCTP funded activities, mentored undergraduates, interacted with graduate students.   In total, the NSF-MCTP grant supported 293 students, including 116 women (40%) and 124 minorities (42%), in addition to the two postdoctoral fellows.   IMPACT  The following data measures some of the impact of these activities on our students.   (a) Of the 55 UNM students attending the Summer Math Camp, 15 followed up with an undergraduate research project at UNM.   (b) Out of the 85 undergraduates from the SW attending the Summer Math Camp, 33 are known to have followed up with graduate school.   (c) Out of the 41 students performing undergraduate research projects with NSF-MCTP support since 2008, 34 continued to graduate or professional school.   (d) Out of the 41 students performing undergraduate research projects with NSF-MCTP support since 2008, 34 successfully completed their project with a thesis and thesis defense, and 33 graduated with Departmental Honors.   (e) Out of the 14 graduate students supported by the grant, 7 are currently employed as faculty at universities or colleges, 1 is a teacher in an Albuquerque Public High School, 1 works as a researcher at a national laboratory, and 2 are scientists working in private industry.  The remaining 3 are completing their graduate studies.   (f) The two postdocs are now employed as faculty, one at a university, the other at a college.   It is noteworthy to point out that the NSF-MCTP activities have raised awareness and competency in mathematics. Students of all areas of study attend the SUnMarc conference. Students are attracted to the Summer Math Camp and gain breadth in areas of mathematics not typically part of the university curriculum.  Several of the Summer Camp students continue to pursue research projects, and gain interest in graduate studies. These undergraduate activities have strengthened their application to graduate schools, as evidenced by many excellent graduate programs they now attend.  Finally, we note that several of the activities initiated through the NSF-MCTP grant will be continued, including active promotion of the undergraduate research program in the mathematical sciences at UNM, participation at SUnMaRC, the Graduate Student Teacher Training Seminar and the resulting graduate student social network.
