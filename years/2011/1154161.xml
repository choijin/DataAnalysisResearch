<AbstractNarration>The Pathways to Careers in Mathematics and Computer Science (PACMACS) Bridge Expansion Program is a comprehensive package of financial, academic, and social support offered to undergraduates pursuing baccalaureate degrees in mathematics, actuarial science and/or computer science. Students are recruited from participants in pre-college programs at the college and incoming students. Once admitted to the university, students obtain financial support through the University Financial Aid Office and S-STEM funding. 18 students in three cohorts of 6 students are being provided annual awards of $10,000 each. Academic support includes faculty mentors, upper level undergraduate student mentors, tutoring services, problem solving workshops, and individualized attention in small classes. Social support includes seminars on college life and cultural diversity and peer support groups. Career support includes seminars on relevant careers, panel discussions with recent alumni, summer internships in local industry and the resources of the University Career Development Center. All support services and scholarships are being continued by the college after the award period to insure that all participants complete their degrees. By participating in this program, students are able to successfully transition from high school to rigorous undergraduate baccalaureate programs in the targeted areas; obtain degrees in these disciplines; pursue careers in science and technology; and hopefully, remain in the Philadelphia metropolitan area and become role models in their communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Although there are many pre-college programs designed to strengthen mathematical skills and raise student interest in mathematics and computer science, there is little support to assist students to transition into rigorous academic programs in these disciplines. This transition is especially difficult for students from public urban high schools with large minority populations. Many of the students are first generation college students and lack role models and family support systems. This program builds on the foundation laid by the pre-college programs and continues the academic and social support necessary for successful retention of this cohort of students. The leadership group has extensive experience with a pre-college program in mathematics and computer science, a program that targets women, and summer research programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project allows students from diverse backgrounds with limited educational and financial means to acquire the necessary skills to become a part of the challenging and rapidly evolving fields of mathematical and computer sciences. The students targeted for scholarships may otherwise not receive a college education and their talent may be lost to society and themselves. Successful graduates have the education and training to pursue careers in these disciplines, serve as role models to their peers, and thus increase participation by underrepresented groups in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The program serves as a model for other colleges to strengthen the connection between their pre-college and undergraduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes  For over a decade, Saint Joseph?s University (SJU) has sponsored a high school outreach program entitled PACMACS (Pathways to Careers in Mathematics and Computer Science). The objective of this program is to attract local, academically talented financially disadvantaged minority students enrolled in public high schools in the Philadelphia School District to mathematics and computer science programs at SJU. Participants enroll in two college level courses in mathematics and computer science for credit; and attend workshops on problem solving, college life and diversity on college campuses. Funding received from NSF in two previous awards (DUE 0220499 and DUE 0630842) provided financial aid to PACMACS students to help them transition to undergraduate programs at SJU. Most of the students were from Pennsylvania. In the current project, the lessons learned in recruiting, retaining and mentoring PACMACS students was expanded to include similar students from different areas and/or outreach programs. The students who participated in this project come from 5 states in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

The breakdown of academic majors is 8 (34.8%) computer science majors, 15 (65.2%) mathematical sciences majors (5 mathematics, 10 actuarial science). The retention rate of scholars in the program is 82.6% (19/23), with an overall GPA of 3.5 + .4. The attrition occurred among first year students in cohort 1 and 2.
