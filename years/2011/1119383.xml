<AbstractNarration>CyberSTEM is developing and testing an integrated digital gaming network that spans homes, schools, and informal learning settings, offering a suite of digital games based on cutting-edge discoveries in the life sciences. The project asks if participation in CyberSTEM leads to increased learning in six areas: interest in science, conceptual knowledge, scientific reasoning, reflection on knowing, participating in science, and identifying as a scientist. The target audience includes youth in grades 6-9.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CyberSTEM is iteratively designed, developed, tested and rolled out to the public across the three year project. Each individual game (and subsequently, the entire learning system) is developed through an iterative, research-driven process starting with laboratory studies of players designed to uncover how game play shapes their thinking, classroom-based case studies of how participation in CyberSTEM changes classroom practice, controlled studies of how participation in CyberSTEM has an impact on classroom achievement, and then how  articipation in CyberSTEM beyond the classroom (in museums, homes, or other settings) influences youth participation in science. In each phase, research designs, methods, and analyses procedures appropriate to the questions will be employed, including experimental studies involving think aloud protocols, case studies using responsive case methodology, pre- and post- tests using repeated measure ANOVAs, and exploratory data mining techniques using discourse and regression analysis. As an integrated research project, CyberSTEM will build the capacity for rapid development and deployment of science-based games through developing art and code assets, as well as a network of schools, teachers, and students who can be recruited for research. All code, art assets, and research instruments will be published online and be open sourced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CyberSTEM will result in an integrated gaming platform consisting of 5 model games that can be the basis of integrated game-based curricula. Each game will have an associated curriculum that teachers, museums, and other science educators can use to educate the public about cutting-edge science. By year three, the project will be tested in  20  schools.  The project will use  informal gaming channels such as Kongregate, iTunes, and XBox Live to reach the general public who will ultimately create the community that sustains CyberSTEM. This model of education and outreach that cuts across homes, schools, and informal science institutions has the potential to lead to a dramatic rethinking of education. Partnering organizations include Wisconsin University, the Minority Students Achievement Network and the Morgridge Institutes for Research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[CyberSTEM sought to develop a digital gaming network in which 6th-9th grade youth could play a suite of science-based games in various learning settings. The project had three main goals: 1.) To create new educational games, 2.) To build player communities, and 3.) To develop an infrastructure to support player communities. The researchers created, refined, and studied several games over the course of the project. They partnered with educators to develop supplemental curriculum for use in Wisconsin schools and after school programs. Play-testing sessions were used as opportunities to further explore playersÆ learning and engagement. The research team also designed an embedded data mining program called ADAGE (Assessment Data Aggregator for Gaming Environments), which captured playersÆ decisions and matched those actions with potential learning outcomes. Goal #1: Creating New Educational Games &bull; The CyberSTEM project has fostered the development of at least eight distinct science- based games, each with their own unique learning goals. The diverse styles represented engaged a wide variety of players. &bull; A robust set of curricular activities was created to accompany the CyberSTEM games and scaffold player learning. &bull; ADAGE was incorporated into the CyberSTEM games underlying infrastructure to capture telemetry data of playersÆ in-game behaviors and choices. &bull; A Player Portal was designed to give teachers and students a space to post text and images around CyberSTEM content. Learning &bull; For the most part, playersÆ successful gaming strategies led to the acquisition of content knowledge. Many players acquired new vocabulary to describe what they were seeing and doing within the games. &bull; Successful in-game scaffolds broke information into manageable chunks for players. &bull; When the games were combined with supplemental activities, players better described. Building models and taking on different perspectives within real-world simulations seemed to elicit the most fruitful discussions. Engagement &bull; The CyberSTEM games worked as both intense deep dives into gameplay  as well as more spaced out sets of activities (after school programming). &bull; Facilitators enjoyed using the CyberSTEM games, and thought that they were the appropriate mix of educational and fun. &bull; Players preferred games with minimal reading. They liked games with short play times with replayability opportunities (i.e. lots of variations or possibilities.  &bull; Some players were motivated by in-game challenges, while others became frustrated when they were stuck.  &bull; Many children expressed their enthusiasm for CyberSTEM games by requesting additional levels, features, and extended game play. &bull; Achievements for external prizes motivated players to remain engaged, but sometimes conflicted with the overall learning goals. Goal #2: Building Player Communities &bull; Most children showed a strong tendency toward collaborative play. They shared strategies and insights with one another, engaged in friendly competition, and enjoyed interacting. &bull; Challenges to building player communities included a lack of access to technologies that would host the games reliably, and players progressing at different rates within a particular game. &bull; Many educators have limited time and energy for incorporating supporting curriculum or participating in gaming communities with other teachers and students. With additional support they might be motivated, but unless these activities directly align with pre-existing goals it may be difficult to foster educator involvement. Goal #3: Developing an Infrastructure to Support Player Communities &bull; As a data mining tool, ADAGE has successfully tracked playersÆ in-game behaviors, allowing researchers to analyze the data for potential learning patterns. ADAGE has helped to position gameplay as a part of the learning process. &bull; The Portal was first launched as a tool for players to ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
