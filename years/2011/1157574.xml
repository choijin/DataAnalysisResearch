<AbstractNarration>This project will establish a collaboration between the University of California at Berkeley in the United States and the University of Paris-Sud and INRIA in France to explore architectures and interaction paradigms for multi-surface computing environments. Multi-surface environments are interactive workspaces that combine wall displays, handheld computing devices and traditional laptops. Such environments can be used to explore and manipulate "big data" in a variety of application domains, including product design, scientific discovery, decision-making and crisis management. &lt;br/&gt;Multi-surface computing environments raise multiple challenges: What are the appropriate interaction paradigms that make teams working in such spaces most effective? How can we facilitate successful collaboration among remote sites? What authoring tools and abstractions enable researchers to rapidly explore the space of multi-surface applications? This collaboration will contribute new theory, technology and empirical findings to understand remote collaboration in multi-surface environments. &lt;br/&gt;The project will build on the French DIGISCOPE project, which is creating a network of multi-surface environments for interactive and collaborative visualization. The researchers will extend the research from France to the US, and develop new techniques for remote collaboration between workspaces in both countries. The provided funds will be used for two main activities: 1) site visits to France to learn about the current DIGISCOPE architecture and hold research meetings; and 2) the construction of a high-resolution wall prototype at Berkeley to enable research into remote collaboration techniques. This prototype itself will serve as the primary communication tool between the US and French teams after initial visits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Multi-surface computing applications combine several display devices, computers and a variety of input devices into interactive environments. Such interactive environments are increasingly appearing in business and research settings and even in the home. However, most of today's software is only written to run on a single computer and cannot be effectively used in such environments.  This project established a collaboration between the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Paris&shy;Sud and INRIA (France) to develop ways to help programmers prototype and implement multi-surface computing applications. Researchers organized multiple workshops in the United States and in France to exchange information and develop a research plan.  The principal outcome of these efforts was the development and evaluation of a new software platform, HydraScope. This platform supports the rapid development of multi&shy; surface interactions for high-&shy;resolution wall displays by re-using and adapting existing web applications. A core insight is that many modern web applications already offer data synchronization between multiple clients. By adding a layer of state synchronization on top of web applications, multiple different applications can be coordinated across many different computing devices and many screens.      We introduce the concept of a "meta-&shy;application" which executes and synchronizes applications in parallel, with a multi&shy;user input layer for interacting with it. The primary advantage of the meta-application approach is that software does not have to be rewritten from scratch to run in a multi-surface environment. We developed concrete example applications to characterize the utility and limits of such meta-applications.         This project also introduced graduate students to international scientific collaboration and led to multiple student exchanges between France and the United States.
