<AbstractNarration>Roundworm infections cause several debilitating diseases in both animals and agricultural plants, yet relatively little is known about the factors that regulate either the population dynamics and/or infectivity of most parasitic or free-living nematode species. This proposal aims to uncover the mechanisms by which a specific set of closely related roundworm species regulate the ratio of males, females, and/or infective/dispersive larval forms amongst their offspring. A combination of cellular, chemical and genetic approaches will be used. Broader impacts of the proposal studies include establishing research and student training links between a primarily undergraduate institution (William &amp; Mary) and an institution with a large proportion of minority students (UT-Arlington). In addition, these studies may ultimately lead to new avenues for controlling roundworm infections.</AbstractNarration>

Intriguingly, our chosen species, also like many parasitic forms, exhibits skewed gender ratios that can?t be explained by standard Mendelian genetics; but unlike parasitic forms, our species eat bacteria and are easy to rear under standard laboratory conditions. This proposal sought to uncover the mechanisms by which a particular nematodes (Rhabditis sp. SB347, now called Auanema rhodensis) and its near relatives regulate the ratio of males, females, and hermaphrodites amongst their offspring.  How does A. rhodensis achieve its ratio of male, females, and hermaphrodites?  1)      If females and hermaphrodites are both genetically XX, how is this decision developmentally determined? Females and hermaphrodites were known to be born with different sized gonads, but in this study, we identified molecular compounds (pheromones) that could convert female-fated larvae to develop as hermaphrodites or could be inhibited and convert hermaphrodite-fated larvae to develop as females.    2)      At a population level, how is the species propagated? In this study, we found that populations expands primarily through male/female crosses and self-fertilization in hermaphrodites. In an unusual twist, crosses between XX females and X males yield exclusively XX feminine progeny (rather than a 50:50 mix of females and males) whereas X males are produced by self-fertilizing XX hermaphrodites which produce about 10% male progeny early in their broods.  3)      What cellular mechanisms enable A. rhodensis males to produce exclusively X-bearing sperm? Our analysis of how the structural (cytoskeletal) elements reorganize during sperm development in a variety of nematode species revealed unappreciated similarities to processes in both dividing and differentiating cells. In A. rhodensis, sperm production employs standard cellular mechanisms, but in the tiny spermatocytes, a bipolar process that normally generates two sperm and a cellular waste bag called a residual body, becomes unipolar, generating one sperm and a residual body containing the other complement of genetic material.  4)      How do A. rhodensis hermaphrodites achieve self-fertility? In an unexpected finding, we discovered that A. rhodensis hermaphrodites produce sperm in a fundamentally different way than the well-studied model nematode Caenorhabiditis elegans. Whereas the gonad of C. elegans hermaphrodites produces a small number of sperm before switching over to the exclusive production of oocytes, A. rhodensis hermaphrodite produce sperm and oocytes in a same gonad at the same time. We also discovered that one reason they can do this is that their sperm production involves a population of dividing cells that are intermediates between germline stem cells and spermatocytes (the cells that will directly divide to form sperm). Although such cells are considered a "universal" feature of sperm production, our study is the first to report such cells in nematodes.  The broader impacts of this study are two-fold. In terms of training the next generation of young scientists, these studies have provided in-depth research training in the Shakes? lab for two masters? students and ten undergraduates (including 2 Hispanics and 1 African American) .
