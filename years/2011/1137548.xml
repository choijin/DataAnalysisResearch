<AbstractNarration>Winston-Salem State University's (WSSU) Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Developing Game-Like Instructional Modules to Enhance Student Learning in Lower Level Core Computer Science Courses - will develop game-like instructional modules to enhance student learning in lower level core Computer Science (CS) courses, namely Computer Programming I, Computer Programming II and Data Structures. These three gate-keeper courses are the main barrier for student retention in the CS program at WSSU. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, there has been increasing demand for programmers who can develop applications for mobile devices generated by the emerging mobile computing technologies. This is a great opportunity for minority computer scientists to influence the computing industry by developing apps that are targeted to not only the African American population, but also to the general public.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves implementing three components: education, assessment and dissemination. The education component includes developing game-like instructional modules for lower level core CS courses. The game-like course modules will allow students to learn difficult concepts in a gaming context. The assessment component includes establishing an advisory board of experienced CS faculty, education faculty and professionals from the game industry to assist in project development and the evaluation process. The dissemination component includes developing a website for the project and organizing a workshop for faculty from Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</AbstractNarration>

Outreach: The PI hosted a Computer Science Gaming session for middle and high school girls in the GEMS (Girls Empowered by Math and Science) program at WSSU in 2011. A project website (http://compsci.wssu.edu/tip): All the games and the corresponding lab assignments have been posted on the website to publicize the project outcomes and to benefit students and faculty at other institutions. Seven conference/journal papers: The implementation details of these game modules and evaluation results have been reported in seven conference/journal papers.

Three posters: The project team had poster presentations to share the game modules at ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) conference in 2013 and at the Symposium on Computing at Minority Institutions in 2012.

Ten faculty attendees were from Saint Augustine's University, Fayetteville State University, Shaw University, Elizabeth City State University, Bennett College, Guilford College, Methodist University and NC A&amp;T State University. Most of them are Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Faculty from Bennett College and Methodist University started using these games in their classrooms since Spring 2015 and assessments indicated that studentsÆ scores on the targeted topics have been impro...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
