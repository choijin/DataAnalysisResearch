<AbstractNarration>Smart Clothing, Smart Girls is a strategy proposal using apparel design as a vehicle to attract middle school girls to STEM learning and engineering careers.  Based on a theoretical framework that supports mechanisms for engaging young, female participants in STEM, the project team has thoughtfully designed an intervention that is hands-on, collaborative, and relevant - all combinations that have shown to improve how girls develop STEM identities, build self efficacy, and become motivated to pursue STEM-related activities.  The project is developing two types of curricular models, one for on-campus experiences at Cornell and University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and one for summer camp experiences with partners at 4-H and Girls Inc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project applies iterative design research to develop and test the construction of four modules. Relevant STEM topics are introduced each module focusing on the essential components of wearable technologies, which includes understanding material properties (thermal properties, impact protection, etc.), electrical circuits and electronics, 2D to 3D visualization, and the engineering design process.  During the first year of the project, curricular modules are being designed and evaluated for a 40 hour summer experience on each campus. The second year, the camp experiences are refined and repeated, informed by evaluation of the first year. 4-H and Girls Inc. educators are deeply involved in the curricular module development so as to become familiar with the content and how to facilitate the modules. And in year three, the project team adapts the modules to formats which will be used by 4-H and Girls Inc. in off-site interactive experiences.  Dissemination materials for this project include a detailed website, interactive video clips, and teaching kits (materials and curriculum). A total of 200 girls will test the content modules over three years. Eight leaders from 4-H and Girls Inc. will also be trained in project content delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make significant contributions to the field by furthering what is known about effective engagement strategies for underrepresented populations from urban and rural environments, particularly middle school females, thus changing the way they perceive STEM and STEM careers.  It also provides ample opportunity for enhancing the way emerging technologies are incorporated into informal learning environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Smart Clothing, Smart Girls:  Engineering via Apparel Design  The Smart Clothing, Smart Girls:  Engineering via Apparel Design ITEST project tested the premise that introducing middle school girls to the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics of fashion design would engage them in these disciplines, in which women are under-represented.  A curriculum of informal learning experiences was collaboratively developed by teams of researchers at Cornell University and the University of Minnesota, and tested in partnership with 4-H and Girls Inc/YWCA.  Activities were developed from desired learning outcomes &ndash; concepts and main ideas or skills that learners would gain from each activity selected based on National Science Education Standards. Initial curriculum testing was done at camps offered at the two campuses by researchers.  Subsequently volunteer leaders were trained to deliver the curriculum themselves off-site.  The final development was a website disseminating the no-cost curriculum nationwide.  Portions of the curriculum have been implemented at schools, art and science museums, and community groups across the US with positive feedback.   The curriculum incorporates five modules: Marvelous Materials (properties of textiles and other clothing components; the physics of clothing performance interfacing with human physiology, including impact protection and thermal regulation in clothing); Patterns, Tools and Technology (the geometry of garments; spatial perception in 2 and 3 dimensions; the technologies used to produce clothing; the engineering of production processes); Smart Clothing (basic electronics; e-textiles and wearable technology); Movement Improvement (anthropometrics and physiology of movement interfacing with fabric properties and the geometry of patterns); and We Are Engineers (the engineering design process, EDP, common to many disciplines). Within each module, a selection of individual and team-based activities ranging from quick exercises to day-long development activities allow active concept experimentation and application of principles.  Sample schedules that can be adapted to varied informal science settings are offered. A complete exploration of the science of clothing includes activities from each module, culminating in a challenge project requiring application of knowledge from all five modules.  This can be structured for an intensive camp experience, or adapted to after school or weekend programs over a full semester. Suggestions are made for activities that can be completed in just an hour, a day, or a weekend program.  Style Engineers/ Fashion through Science, http://styleengineers.org, is the publically accessible presentation of the completed curriculum.  The website provides activities, leader guides, materials lists, and instructional videos for each of the top thirty-six activities that were judged most successful in the initial camps, based on student engagement. The website also provides three videos of the overall program in action; five videos (one for each module) featuring women working in the science, engineering, technology and mathematics of clothing design who can be role models for young girls; puzzles and activities for young designers; and a community forum for sharing ideas.  Feedback from adult informal science instructors who have used the website indicate that it is an effective vehicle for dissemination of the developed materials. They found the site easy to navigate, and felt that the leader guides helped increase their confidence and STEM knowledge.  Fashion design is an under-used application area for developing STEM skills and interest.  The Style Engineers curriculum identifies STEM skill sets inherent in fashion design and clothing performance that may be unfamiliar to many educators.  Further, the project has made tested curricular materials available that effectively introduce fundamental STEM concepts in a wide range of subjects through the lens of clothing design.   For instance, researchers developed novel methods for teaching spatial perception skills that are important to understanding not only the relationship between two dimensional patterns and the three dimensional body, but to developing visualization and perception skills needed for many engineering disciplines; skills that are often under-developed in students.   Pilot testing at week-long camps with rural 4-H members and inner city Girls Inc. and YWCA members indicated enjoyment of the activities, increased interest in STEM, and increased understanding of the role of an engineer.  Incorporating all modules into the framework of the engineering design process resulted in a clear understanding of that process.  Girls successfully implemented the EDP process as they solved design challenges throughout the curriculum.   Future work is planned to add additional activities to the website, to add guides for leaders to address overall advice on organizing activities for middle school girls, and to create activities designed for girls to access directly from the website. Testing of the curriculum for a wider range of underrepresented girls is also planned. The use of the website has been implemented by word of mouth only; plans to publicize the site will make it accessible for more girls across the nation.
