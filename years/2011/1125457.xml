<AbstractNarration>Project Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STEP Center project is establishing a national resource that is focused on innovation and entrepreneurship (I&amp;E) for engineers. The objective of the center is to catalyze a wave of change in undergraduate engineering education in the United States through initiatives that inspire students to envision possibilities and create viable, innovative products, services, and processes for lasting economic and societal impact. It is influencing educators and students at a national level by: 1) building upon a foundation of principles from three distinct, yet complementary fields: learning sciences, engineering education, and I&amp;E education, 2) drawing on the content and expertise of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program (STVP) and other institutions and partners to create a coherent set of learning materials and methods that are collected and curated, 3) providing a "Pathway to Proficiency" platform for teaching and learning about engineering innovation and entrepreneurship, 4) conducting scholarly research on how people learn to be innovative and entrepreneurial, and develop instruments and processes others can use to assess students' innovation skills, and 5) performing an on-going assessment and garnering feedback to improve/enhance its impact and reach. The center also offers a research and outreach web portal/hub for the creation, collection, and sharing of resources on how to educate the next generation of engineering innovators and entrepreneurs. This STEP Center is jointly funded by EHR's Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) and ENG's Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the STEP Center is to reshape undergraduate engineering education and enhance U.S. competitiveness. The STEP Center is providing a diverse set of offerings and, through a partnership with the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA), is implementing multi-faceted dissemination approaches that reach a large number of faculty and students across the U.S. It is developing tools and processes to help others measure I&amp;E skills; while investigating and pursuing additional ways to enhance STEM enrollment among underrepresented groups. Through research, the STEP Center aims to discover novel insights into how engineers become more innovative and entrepreneurial and what inhibits or blocks the development of these skills.</AbstractNarration>

The Pathways teams worked on more than 400 projects designed to implement sustained changes to the undergraduate experience. These included extracurricular programming; courses and programs; campus policy changes such as intellectual property; tenure and promotion; new positions; makerspaces; entrepreneurship centers; funding through industry partnership and grants; and dissemination of best practices through conferences and journals. The teams engaged 30,000 undergraduate engineering students at their schools as well as undergraduate and graduate students from other disciplines.

The results, shared with the individual survey campuses, generated knowledge about factors associated with students? career decisions, I&amp;E experiences and I&amp;E self efficacy. A follow-up to the EMS was launched in Spring 2016. The third wave of the EMS is scheduled for Summer 2017, and the instrument has been adapted by researchers in the U.S. and Europe who are studying I&amp;E pathways. During the NSF grant, Epicenter engaged 174 institutions in one or more initiatives. In addition to the impacts above, the team published 25 papers; gave more than 50 presentations and workshops at conferences focused on I&amp;E; administered two ASEE community surveys; supported 12 Lean LaunchPad Educators workshops with 829 participants; supported four VentureWell OPEN conferences; and co-hosted two innovation summits in Silicon Valley that brought together leaders from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Epicenter also partnered with organizations including the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, American Society for Engineering Education, Engineering Deans Institute, and National Academy of Engineering.  The three Epicenter initiatives have continued after the end of the grant. For more information, visit epicenter.stanford.edu.
