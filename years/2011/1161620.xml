<AbstractNarration>This mathematics research project will investigate problems in partial differential equations, including both evolution equations and stationary problems.  Evolution equations to be investigated include nonlinear wave equations on non-Euclidean spaces, nonlinear Schrodinger equations, and Euler and Navier-Stokes equations (NLS).  Specific goals include investigation of strong dispersive estimates for nonlinear wave equations, local and global solutions to NLS whose initial data satisfy conditions not given purely in terms of Sobolev space estimates, standing wave and traveling wave solutions to nonlinear wave and NLS equations and their stability, small viscosity limits of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations, and Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on regions with rough boundary.  Stationary problems to be investigated include elliptic boundary problems on rough domains and analysis on manifolds with weakly bounded geometry.   Specific goals include investigation of Fredholm theory for as large a class of uniformly rectifiable domains as can be managed, looking for an appropriately general version of the notion of a regular elliptic boundary problem in this nonsmooth context.  This builds on work with Hofmann and Mitrea on classes of chord-arc domains (also called SKT domains), and looks forward to more general classes, including domains with inclusions.  Investigations of these topics will result in the development of useful analytical tools for partial differential equations.  These will likely include new results in the areas of singular integral operators, harmonic analysis of elliptic operators, geometric measure theory, and singular perturbation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics research project  in the area of partial differential equations makes contact with a range of scientific issues.  The Navier-Stokes equations bear on the study of fluid flows, both how a fluid will flow through a pipe and how that flow will transport solvents, and what sorts of different behaviors govern flows in pipes with smooth or rough walls.  Nonlinear Schrodinger equations model  various real-life phenomena  and have applications to subjects such as optical cables, surface waves in shallow water, and a delicate state of low temperature matter known as a Bose-Einstein condensate.  Potential applications of the study of equations on rough domains include the investigation of hidden structures, such as sudden transitions in the nature of materials in the earth, often across rough, unknown boundaries, the knowledge of whose locations can be of substantial value.  The mathematical techniques developed in the proposed project will have the potential to impact these areas.  Taylor has directed three Ph.D. students in the past four years, who have begun to make their own contributions to such problems, and he is now beginning to train a new student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                    Project Outcome for NSF DMS-1161620                            Michael E. Taylor    This project dealt with a variety of problems in partial differential equations.  The sorts of problems treated fall roughly into categories. One consists of equations for functions defined in some spatial domain, with no time dependence, and the other consists of equations for functions that depend on both space and time.  The former are called stationary problems and the latter evolution equations.  Evolution equations studied in this project arise to model various types of wave motion.  Examples include electromagnetic waves, sonic waves, and elastic waves.  One specific problem treated in the project involves a mechanism that dampens waves, with the dampening occuring only on a proper subdomain of the region on which the wave motion is taking place. Such a region is called a control region, and a natural question is under what conditions can one guarantee that the local dampening mechanism has the global effect of damping out waves at an exponential rate.  Substantial lore has it that the behavior of rays associated to the wave equation (so called because for electromagnetic waves these are ``light rays'') has a dominant role in the control condition.  There are established results on this, going back to early work of M. Taylor with J. Rauch, in the case of a smooth medium.  There has been interest in extending this circle of results to media that are not so smooth, and work in this project succeeded in doing this for a class that is quite broad, and has a natural geometric characterization, namely media whose geometrical nature is defined by a Riemannian metric whose Ricci curvature is bounded.  Carrying this out involved pushing the theory of geometrical optics close to its limit, using tools that amalgamate microlocal analysis with a tool from harmonic analysis known as paradifferential operator calculus.  Another problem treated in this project involved establishing an equivalence between the geometric optics associated to a wave equation on the flat plane, on which a variable sound speed is imposed with the geometric optics associated to a wave on a 2-dimensional surface with a curved metric. The resolution of this problem involved some uniformization results, with good quantitative estimates, for a class of Riemann surfaces that could be shown to be holomorhically equivalent to the flat complex plane. The usefulness of this equivalence stems from the fact that a number of physical problems give rise to wave equations of the first sort, while good intuition about the behavior of rays of geometrical optics is directly available for wave equations of the second sort.  A class of problems explored in this project was the class of traveling wave solutions to certain nonlinear Schrodinger equations and nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations.  While these equations are, strictly speaking, evolution equations, the time dependence can be sorted out, and one is effectively left with a stationary problem.  This phenomenon also arises in the treatment of standing wave solutions to such classes of wave equations. In particular, Taylor and J. Marzuola considered a class of standing wave solutions to certain nonlinear Schrodinger equations that they called vortex standing waves.  This class generalized to higher dimensions what had been studied as vortex planar wave solutions to scalar NLS equations.  The project with Marzuola also made contact with evolution equations, in work that studied global existence and scattering of solutions to the evolution NLS with initial data having mass less than of the ground state vortex standing wave solution.  Work with I. and M. Mitrea and S. Hofmann dealt with problems for which time player no role.  The partial differential equations involved were of elliptic type, and the authors searched for solutions on bounded domains, subject to certain boundary conditions, sometimes of transmission type, som...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
