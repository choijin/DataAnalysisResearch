<AbstractNarration>1134119 / 1134449&lt;br/&gt;Liu / Cao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to develop a novel technique to fabricate injectable, alignable, and bioactive scaffold that uses neural stem cells (NSCs) as building blocks for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair.  This work capitalizes on the ability to manipulate superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with magnetic field remotely and noninvasively.  In this approach, the NSCs are labeled with nanoengineered cationic magnetoliposomes (CMLs) which encapsulate numerous SPIONs, and can be injected into the injured spinal cord in colloidal suspensions.  Upon the application of a magnetic field, magnetically labeled NSCs will spontaneously self-assemble into chain/column lattices and align along a virtual axis that is defined by the field flux lines, thereby forming a scaffold to guide the directional regrowth of axons.  Neurotrophic factors stored in the bilayer of the CMLs can be released by radio frequency electromagnetic triggering to promote NSC survival and axonal growth.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will transform state-of-the-art of biological scaffold fabrication in tissue engineering, when directional guidance is desired for cellular growth and expansion, and enhance the therapeutic strategies for challenging issues of experimental spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative diseases.  This work will also help to greatly expand the use of SPIONs in general clinical applications by changing their role from passive tracer (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents) to active enabler of biological processes.  The technology developed can be conveniently translated to clinical treatments of a diverse group of nervous system diseases, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and peripheral nerve disorders.  It will benefit hundreds of thousands of Americans who are have severely limited mobility or paralyzed incurring from these diseases.  Additionally, this work investigates the magnetic directed self-assembly of soft biological particles under histological conditions, and the findings will advance fundamental understanding of aggregation kinetics and phase separation in dipolar colloids, which constitutes the basis of a variety of micro/nanofluidic applications.  Through the proposed project, an integrated interdisciplinary research and education program will be established which creates vast opportunities for underrepresented groups, by actively recruiting qualified minority students for both undergraduate and graduate studies and by engaging in K-12 teacher/student outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a primary nervous system disorder, spinal cord injury (SCI) causes severe and chronic debilitation or even permanent disability to millions of people in the US and worldwide.  Despite the extensive research efforts and improvement in the rehabilitation approaches, unfortunately, SCI repair continues to be a great challenge due to difficulties in guiding the directional regeneration of damaged axons.  This research program aims at developing a novel technique to fabricate injectable, alignable, and bioactive scaffold that uses neural stem cells (NSCs) as the building block for SCI repair.  This work capitalizes on the ability to manipulate superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with magnetic field remotely and noninvasively.  In this approach, the NSCs are labeled with SPIONs that are either encapsulated in nanoengineered cationic magnetoliposomes (CMLs) or contained in hydrogels, and can be injected in colloidal suspensions into the injured spinal cord.  Upon the application of a magnetic field, the magnetically labeled NSCs will spontaneously self-assemble into chain/column lattices and align along a virtual axis defined by the invisible field flux lines, thereby forming a virtual scaffold to guide the directional regrowth of axons.  Through this research program, the synthesis of multifunctional CMLs cationic magnetoliposomes (CMLs) was demonstrated, and the cellular uptake efficiency of CMLs and SPION-containing hydrogels was studied.  The results confirmed the viability and specific differentiation of SPION-labeled NSCs.  Subsequently, magnetically directed self-assembly of SPION-labeled NSCs into aligned three-dimensional (3D) chain lattice was investigated experimentally.  A numerical model employing the distributed Lagrange-multiplier based fictitious-domain method (DLM/FD) was developed to simulate the magnetically directed self-assembly process.  Finally, preliminary results were obtained for in vivo axonal regeneration.  This project has produced 3 conference abstracts, 3 journal manuscripts,  1 PhD thesis and 1 US patent application.  This work enhances therapeutic strategies for the challenging issues of experimental SCI and neurodegenerative diseases, and could potentially offer the ultimate cure for a large variety of patients who are suffering from SCI.  The experimental and modeling results acquired reveal the relation between the pattern formation and various control parameters.  The findings will advance the fundamental understanding of aggregation kinetics and phase separation in dipolar colloids, which constitutes the basis of a variety of micro/nanofluidic applications.   An integrated research and educational program has been established at University of Houston, the most ethnically diverse major research university in the US (with 31.0% African-Americans and Hispanics in undergraduate and more than 50% minorities in the total student body).  Graduate and undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups (minorities and females), have been recruited and offered training opportunities in interdisciplinary research through this program.  One female student has graduated with her MS degree and joined the workforce in Engineering.  One PhD student has graduated, and the second PhD student (female) is progressing well toward her degree.  A team of undergraduate students (including two females) supervised by the PI successfully won the competition for NASAÆs Reduced Gravity Education Flight Program, in which they performed their experiments during 25-second bouts of weightlessness in NASAÆs reduced gravity aircraft: the "Vomit Comet".
