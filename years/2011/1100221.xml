<AbstractNarration>This research studies new mechanisms for enabling the consumer of the service to reduce the visibility of consumer computations to the service provider and thereby reduce the trust that the consumer places in the provider.   At the same time, the mechanisms allow security of the cloud computing environment to be monitored by a trusted third party.  The work also develops a quantified method to evaluate the degree to which a user's privacy is disclosed and tools for monitoring causality relationships.</AbstractNarration>

One major goal of the project is to enable user-configured privacy protection in cloud computing environments. Encryptions are being widely used to protect users' data in cloud but traditional encryptions does not allow arbitrary processing over encrypted data. Homomorphic encryption allows more processing but the performance is not practical yet.  We instead investigated architectural solutions to protect users' privacy in the clouds. The fundamental privacy problem of existing architectures is the privilege design. The cloud administrators are assigned with too much privileges, much more than necessary to manage the clouds.  We developed a new architecture using separation-of-privilege design to de-privilege the cloud administrator, such that the cloud administrator cannot look into the resource already allocated to the users.
