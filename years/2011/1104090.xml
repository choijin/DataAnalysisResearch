<AbstractNarration>Ranken Technical College is partnering with the Saint Louis Public Schools, the Saint Louis Regional Business Council, and St. Louis for Kids to implement this "Priming the Pipeline" project. The project is providing a continuum of educational opportunities for students, beginning in middle school and continuing through the attainment of at least a 2-year Associate Degree and successful job placement in a high technology field, or transfer to a 4-year Bachelor Degree program. The project activities include coordination of science, math and technology-based experiences for middle school students through summer academies and other extra-curricular activities, a dual high school-college enrollment educational program, summer internship experiences in business and industry for secondary school students, a program to allow disconnected youth to revive their educational opportunities, integrated work-based learning components that include an apprenticeship program to create pathways to employment, and professional development for secondary school educators. Through the offering of this coordinated set of activities and opportunities for students and teachers, the project is working towards accomplishment of the following objectives: 1) motivating a significant number of disadvantaged students (middle school and high school grades) to pursue an education in high technology-related occupations; 2) providing an effective peer and professional mentoring program for participating students that promotes academic and personal achievement; 3) establishing a high school-to-college academic bridge program in STEM-related technical disciplines that effectively encourages educational advancement and achievement leading to AAS and BS degrees, and to industry-recognized certifications; 4) developing a registered internship and apprenticeship program that provides opportunities with St. Louis area industries, and that is centered on job-related competencies that lead to enhanced placement opportunities; 5) developing a cadre of secondary school teachers who demonstrate improved STEM teaching skills; and 6) increasing the number of individuals who will ultimately be prepared to join a highly qualified workforce serving St. Louis area high tech companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By focusing on economically disadvantaged students from underrepresented groups in STEM, this project is expanding the pool of participants who are qualified for the many excellent careers available to trained technicians, particularly in the fields of biotechnology and advanced manufacturing, which are key growth industries in the St. Louis area. The project is replicating, extending, and enhancing various projects successfully conducted by other educational institutions, including Central Virginia Community College, Arizona State University, and Idaho State University, and in doing so is bringing together individuals and organizations in St. Louis with proven commitment and expertise to collaborate to ensure student success. This project is situated in a low-income, high minority urban setting, and has the potential to serve as a model for how to achieve long range effects that eliminate or mitigate some of the cyclical realities of generational poverty and low educational achievement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Key Findings and Conclusions   In determining the key findings and conclusions from this final project report, it is useful to be reminded of the long term summative outcomes identified earlier. Key findings are mapped to each of these long term outcomes below:   A significant number of 11-18 year old disadvantaged students exposed to and encouraged to pursue an education in high technology related occupations.  With the exception of student internships and the      dropped activities, Ranken has met or exceeded the formative outcomes of      the project. A total of 2,516 students participated in the project      activities and were exposed and encouraged to explore high technology      occupations. In addition to the large number of participants,      most of the activities also indicate a trend to increasing participation,      leading to even more students exposed to and encourage to pursue these      fields. Summer Academy results reflect an increase of      over 25% in the interest level of participating students in STEM areas      before and after the activity.    An effective peer and professional mentoring program for participating students that promotes academic and personal achievement.   The growth in the participation in the FIRST Robotics activities also led      to growth in the number of teachers/adults/coaches leading these teams.      This has provided participating students with the beginning of a strong      mentoring network.   60% of students surveyed from the Work/Study activity said they were introduced to professionals in their field of study.    An active high school&ndash;college bridge academic program in STEM related technical disciplines that encourages educational advancement and achievement leading to AAS, BS degrees and industry recognized certifications.    Ranken has documented a significant impact of the project activities on subsequent enrollment in Ranken technical programs. Ranken has identified 125 students that participated in project activities that subsequently enrolled in one of RankenÆs degree programs. An increase in both the number of participants in the SkillsUSA activity and those qualifying for state and national events indicates an increase in the size and quality of the student pipeline in these related technical fields.    Students participating in the dual enrollment program already have a sense of what career field they would like to pursue and a plan for being successful.  While this might indicate that this is not necessarily an effective way to generate interest in STEM topics, it is an excellent way to strengthen the workforce pipeline by getting more students into the pipeline earlier and accelerating their trek through it. The Work/Study activity yielded specific results that support the building of an effective bridge to post-secondary programs:   73% of respondents said their experience encouraged them to further their education at Ranken, and 100% of the respondents said they planned to complete their current degree or certificate and 73% said they were considering pursuing a higher degree.      An internship and apprentice program that provides opportunities with St. Louis area industries centered on job related competencies leading to enhanced placement opportunities.  Growth in the level of participation in the      work/study activity, along with the growth in the number of industry partners      participating in this activity are leading to more opportunities to      connect students with career opportunities in the region. The Work/Study activity yielded specific results      that indicate growth in job related competencies:   93% said their work study experience was directly related to their field of study, and 87% said they learned applicable industry standards and practices as part of their experience. 91% of students participating in summer internships demonstrated basic job skill competency.
