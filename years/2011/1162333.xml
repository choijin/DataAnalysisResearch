<AbstractNarration>Cloud computing offers IT organizations the ability to create&lt;br/&gt;geo-distributed, and highly scalable applications while providing&lt;br/&gt;attractive cost-saving advantages. Yet, architecting, configuring, and&lt;br/&gt;adapting cloud applications (latency-sensitive web applications and&lt;br/&gt;bulk data processing applications) to meet their stringent performance&lt;br/&gt;requirements is a challenge given the rich set of configuration&lt;br/&gt;options, shared multi-tenant nature of cloud platforms, and dynamics&lt;br/&gt;resulting from activities such as planned maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing novel methodologies, algorithms, and&lt;br/&gt;systems that can enable application architects to (1) judiciously&lt;br/&gt;architect applications across multiple cloud data-centers while&lt;br/&gt;considering application performance requirements, cost saving&lt;br/&gt;objectives, and cloud pricing schemes guided by performance and cost&lt;br/&gt;models of cloud components; (2) automatically learn effective&lt;br/&gt;application configurations and configuration-to-performance prediction&lt;br/&gt;models through statistical machine learning techniques; and (3) create&lt;br/&gt;applications that can adapt to ongoing dynamics in cloud environments&lt;br/&gt;through transaction reassignment over shorter time-scales, and&lt;br/&gt;application migration over longer time-scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this research is multi-fold: (1) Enable IT organizations&lt;br/&gt;to significantly reduce costs by optimally moving their operations to&lt;br/&gt;the cloud; (2) create benchmarks based on operationally deployed&lt;br/&gt;applications and collecting workload traces which will be made&lt;br/&gt;available to the research community; (3) make developed algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;systems widely available as open source software; (4) inform the&lt;br/&gt;design of a nation-wide health-care cloud in Thailand; (4) introduce&lt;br/&gt;cloud computing related topics in the undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;curriculum; and (6) train multiple Ph.D., M.S., and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students, with explicit effort to recruit and train students from&lt;br/&gt;under-represented minority groups.</AbstractNarration>
