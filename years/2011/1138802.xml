<AbstractNarration>This award supports the conduct of an National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) proposal writing workshop. The workshop will be held at a site chosen and hosted by the University of Nevada Reno, March 26 and 27, 2012. It is expected that there will be about 150 attendees. The workshop will have a one-and-a-half-day format including a training session on good proposal writing practices, testimony from previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review, and a review session during which the attendees will have a chance to obtain reviews on project summaries of their own draft CAREER proposals. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with NSF Program Directors both one-on-one and in mock panels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help to prepare young faculty for careers in education by giving them tools and skills of good proposal writing and by preparing them to write and submit better CAREER proposals. The results of the workshop include training for young faculty, better opportunity for young faculty with an emphasis on women and minority faculty, higher award success rates for the attendees, and ultimately better research resulting from better written proposals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In collaboration with the Kansas State University, an NSF CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop was held on March 26 and 27, 2012, at University of Nevada, Reno. The workshop provided future CAREER proposal submitters with proposal review experience and interactions with NSF program directors and recent NSF CAREER awardees.  143 tenure-track assistant professors at the universities all over the country attended the workshop.  Four current NSF program directors, 10 past NSF program directors, and five experienced senior university faculty members were invited to serve as facilitators for the workshop.  NSF program directors introduced the NSF CAREER program.  Two recent NSF CAREER awardees gave talks at the workshop to share their experiences.  With current or past NSF program directors and experienced senior professors serving as facilitators, mock panel review sessions were held to help the assistant professors understand the NSF review processes.  The workshop created an environment for the participants to interact among themselves and with the NSF program directors and experienced researchers.  An evaluation conducted after the workshop indicates that most participants of the workshop were very satisfactory with outcome from the workshop and would recommend this workshop to other future NSF proposal submitters.  Feedbacks after the workshop are also very positive and encouraging. "&hellip;..The venue was wonderful, the participants were great and you all helped to make this the best CAREER proposal writing workshop yet." (Quoted Dr. George Hazelrigg, NSF CMMI Deputy Director).       Last Modified: 11/13/2012       Submitted by: Yanyao Jiang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
