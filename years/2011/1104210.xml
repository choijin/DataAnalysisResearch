<AbstractNarration>The project is establishing a two semester certificate program in stem-cell technologies targeted at post-baccalaureates and individuals who have completed, or are nearing completion of, the associate degree biotechnology program. It responds to the needs of local industry.  Materials developed for this program will help the college integrate relevant stem cell techniques into an existing Associate of Applied Science degree program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Stem cell research is a rapidly emerging field and has become an integral component of many emerging biotechnology companies.  This project offers the opportunity to develop and test materials and approaches needed to produce capable well-educated stem cell technicians.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Materials developed will become available through Bio-Link, a National Center of Excellence in Biotechnology.  A faculty-enhancement workshop and national educator's conference will further extend the impact of this project to the high school students, college students, and professionals served by those educators.  Outreach efforts to institutions in the area serving students currently underrepresented in the biotechnology field, and in STEM generally, are also part of the broader impacts of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Stem cells and stem cell technology offer tremendous promise to revolutionize our understanding of the causes of disease and disorders, and they can be used to guide researchers towards new and effective methods to treat conditions such as diabetes, ParkinsonÆs disease, heart disease, and more. Current applications for stem cells and regenerative medicine include synthetic skin replacement for burn victims, cell-based therapeutics for spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and macular degeneration.  These emerging areas of research and development have created a growing demand for well-qualified employees with specialized skills and competencies to advance stem cell technology.  Madison Area Technical College completed a project to develop, deliver, and disseminate up-to-date instructional materials in the rapidly evolving and emerging field of stem cells and regenerative medicine.  These materials covered workforce-centered skills and competencies alongside critical considerations of ethical and social issues. As part of our NSF-funded project, we created a variety of learning opportunities in this area, including a 2-semester (32-week) Stem Cell Certificate, 5-day Stem Cell Short course, and a 1-day Stem Cell Short course.

In addition, through workshops, conferences, and educational forums, we have provided over 500 community college and K-12 educators with information, educational materials, and resources to adopt and integrate curricula in Stem Cell Science into their classroom experience.  The projected impact on students served through this grant award is estimated at more than 24,000 annually. This educator-based network was facilitated, in part, through synergy with the NSF ATE Bio-Link National Center for Excellence in Biotechnology and Life Sciences.  The project outcomes include access to sophisticated technologies that emerge from pioneering university research lab and industry partners to an expanded population of individuals in the technical college and community at large.

In total, we participated in over 100 outreach events, and 30 career pathway days attended by at least 2000 students. A substantial number of these students are from underrepresented, diverse communities, or economically disadvantaged populations.
