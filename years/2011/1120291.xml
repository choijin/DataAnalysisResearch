<AbstractNarration>Resistance reflexes help an animal to counter external forces that would move its limbs, thus they help maintain a stable posture. During voluntary movement, those same resistance reflexes must be disabled or reversed to allow the movement to occur. This study asks how the resistance reflexes are organized to allow an animal to maintain a static posture, and how they are disabled and transformed into assistance reflexes at the onset of voluntary movements. While these questions have been approached in vertebrates, insects and crustaceans, answers are far from complete.  The questions in the current study will be addressed in the crayfish because relevant circuitry for leg movements has been described in terms of a set of identified sensory neurons, interneurons and motor neurons, and their synaptic interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will use three approaches: (i) in vivo motion analysis and nerve recordings; (ii) a hybrid in vitro preparation/neuromechanical model; and (iii) a neuromechanical simulation of the crayfish body and nervous system. This approach will reveal how the animal controls its reflexes to help stabilize posture and assist voluntary movements underwater and on land, where the set of external forces are very different. The mechanisms discovered here are likely to be used by other legged animals. The approach employs two new tools developed by the principal investigator's laboratory, the AnimatLab neuromechanical simulation software and the hybrid neuromechanical interface that links a model to the nervous system of the experimental preparation.  AnimatLab is freely available at www.animatlab.com, and the hybrid interface will be made into a commercial-grade electronic instrument. The research will provide training in neurophysiology, behavioral analysis and computational neuroscience to undergraduate and graduate students who include members of underrepresented populations.  Those students will participate in helping to teach relevant portions of the summer B.R.A.I.N. course at Georgia State University for outstanding undergraduates from around the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project concerned the role of proprioceptive feedback in the control of posture and locomotion in the crayfish.  Proprioceptive feedback refers to signals produced by sensors in the legs that respond to movement and send signals back to the nervous system to inform it that the movement has occurred.  In the absence of this feedback, animals could not control movement of their limbs.  The crayfish has been used as a model biological system since the publication of Thomas Huxley's book, The Crayfish: An Introduction to Zoology, in 1880.   Like other terrestrial arthropods and vertebrates, the crayfish walks on the bottoms of lakes and streams and overland using eight jointed legs. The legs are controlled by neural circuitry in the central nervous system by less than 100 motor neurons and by a similar number of sensory neurons for each leg. Most of these neurons are individually identifiable, as are many of the interneurons in the central nervous system with which they interact.  When compared with the hundreds of thousands of unidentifiable sensory neurons, motor neurons and interneurons that control the limb of a vertebrate, this small number of identifiable cells makes it possible to create a complete description of the circuitry for posture and locomotion in the crayfish.  It has become clear that this circuitry is very similar to the corresponding circuitry in the spinal cord of vertebrates, as well as the ventral nerve cords of other arthropods.    Technical problems have kept a complete description of the neural circuitry for posture and walking in any animal from being obtained.  Current techniques enable investigators to observe the unrestrained posture and walking behavior of an animal while recording from peripheral sensory and motor nerves with implanted electrodes, or to record from central neurons and peripheral nerves in a dissected, anesthetized and restrained preparation that produces little or no movement, and thereby no feedback.    This project addressed this technical problem by creating the "hybrid preparation", in which an isolated nervous system is connected electronically to a computational model of the legs and body of the crayfish.  The isolated nervous system controls the model legs and body as though they were real, while permitting central and peripheral (sensory and motor) neurons to be recorded.  The computational model provides a virtual body that can respond to the motor nerve activity and generate proprioceptive feedback.    The hybrid preparation enabled the nervous system to produce postural motor commands and to respond to perturbations with the appropriate resistance (i.e., negative feedback) reflexes.  In the presence of a neuromodulator, acetylcholine, the nervous system produced positive feedback assistance reflexes and rhythmic motor bursts characteristic of walking. Interrupting the proprioceptive feedback loop stopped the rhythmic bursting and left an aperiodic train of bursts that had an average frequency 1/3 that of the rhythmic bursts.    This result showed that appropriately timed and selected proprioceptive feedback had a profound effect on the motor output. Moreover, the feedback helped to organize and shape the activity of individual motor neurons during the bursts, showing that different motor neurons were active during different phases of the burst.  These results are very likely generalizable to the control of posture and walking in legged vertebrates and invertebrates alike.     The large amount of information acquired over the last 25 years about the neural circuitry controlling crayfish legs has made it possible to create and test a model of how that circuitry works to control posture and locomotion.  To this end, a circuit model of the circuitry for one leg was developed and then linked to the computational model of the crayfish body and leg that was used in the hybrid experiments.  By substituting the circuit model for the dissected crayfish nervous system in a repeat of the hybrid preparation experiments, it was possible to test whether the model could account for the crayfish postural and locomotor activity and behavior recorded in those experiments.  The model was shown to reproduce the results of the hybrid preparation experiments, thereby demonstrating the critical role that appropriately timed positive and negative proprioceptive feedback plays in posture and locomotion in the crayfish, and very likely in other legged animals as well.
