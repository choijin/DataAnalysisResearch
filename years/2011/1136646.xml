<AbstractNarration>Earth's climate is rapidly changing and biodiversity is changing with it: species evolve or disappear locally, regionally, or globally. This research focuses on whether populations and species of forest ants are able to adapt to climate change and avoid local extinction. Forest ants process soil, cycle nutrients, disperse seeds of many understory plants, and respond rapidly to changes in air temperature. Samples of common ant species will be collected from forests throughout the eastern U.S. DNA sequencing and phylogenetics will be used to reconstruct their evolutionary history and to reveal particular genes that may have evolved in response to climate change. Genes will also be sequenced from ants collected from experimental sites in Massachusetts and North Carolina that have been continuously warmed for three years.  In controlled laboratory experiments, ants will be exposed to a range of high temperatures predicted by climate change models, and the physiological and biochemical responses of ants will be analyzed, which can provide clues as to the adaptability of ants to increasing temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will help to understand how various physiological and biochemical traits are likely to respond to climate change, potentially enabling key species to avoid extinction. Additionally, this research program will train undergraduates and graduate students and will provide public outreach and education on the effects of climate change on biodiversity. Summer high school outreach programs for both teachers and students will be enhanced, and citizen-scientists will be engaged in documenting the effects of climate change on biodiversity.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>By almost any measure, ants dominate the earth. They occur on every continent except Antarctica, and they are often the most abundant animal underfoot and overhead in the forest canopy. The nearly 15,000 ant species on earth have evolved nearly as many ways to make a living: some ants practice agriculture and raise crops; others practice animal husbandry; some ants store seeds and grains for the long winter; still other ants are specialized predators that never come aboveground but spend their lives in the leaf litter hunting springtails or spider eggs. Some ants use tools and employ antibiotics. Many other kinds of species rely on ants, either for protection or for dispersing seeds. Because ants do so much, ecosystems might change when ant communities change.&nbsp;</p> <p>But what might cause ant communities to change? We already know that habitat change, such as the conversion of forest to grassland, predictably changes the numbers and kinds of ant species that are present. These changes can have cascading effects on the rest of the ecosystem. &nbsp;But what about temperature? How will changes in air temperature affect ants and the ecosystem services they provide? This collaborative research addressed exactly this question.</p> <p>&nbsp;Ants are &ldquo;thermophiles&rdquo; (heat-lovers): most ant species are active when it&rsquo;s warm (but not too warm), and inactive when it is cold. Over a span of 5 years, we conducted an experiment that warmed entire, intact ant communities at both Harvard Forest in New England and Duke Forest in the southern US, by upwards of 10* Fahrenheit. We found some exciting results. First, ants that could tolerate warmer temperatures in laboratory experiments were most active (i.e., had more workers from the colony out searching for food) in the warmest experimental treatments. Those species that could not tolerate warm temperatures were not very active in the warmest temperatures. We found a similar pattern when we looked at ants in a more natural, non-experimental setting: ants from the warmer, southern US tolerated warmer temperatures better than did ants from the colder, northern US. And the same was true for ants in the mountains: ants from low elevations could tolerate warm temperatures, but not cold temperatures, whereas ants from high elevations could tolerate cold temperatures, but not warm temperatures. A series of laboratory experiments and molecular analyses of &ldquo;heat-shock&rdquo; proteins suggest that these differences among ants in thermal tolerance have a genetic basis.</p> <p>&nbsp;Our discovery of a genetic basis to the responses of cold and warm climate ant species to temperature suggests that these same species may have the capacity to evolve additional responses and adapt to future changes in temperature. But temperature is not the only thing that will affect ants (and the services they provide) in the future. Here is an ant &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; that you probably have already conducted yourself: if you drop a piece of a cookie on the ground on a warm sunny day, at least one ant species will arrive within minutes to pick up the crumbs. In fact, several species may show up, and those ants will fight each other for your cookie crumbs. They fight for your crumbs because this sugar reward is brought back to the nest and helps the colony (which may have thousands of workers to feed) to survive and grow. But how will temperature and competition affect ants through time? After running our warming experiment for 5 years, we found that the thermophiles (&ldquo;heat-lovers&rdquo;) were also better competitors at high temperature, whereas the cold-climate species have the home-court advantage at low temperatures. If the climate grows warmer, thermophiles will invade new areas and displace cold-climate natives because they will be more effective at competing for resources such as food and nest space. But this take-over will also cause ant communities to become more fragile and respond more slowly to other kinds of environmental change. .</p> <p>&nbsp;In sum, this research gave us new information on how ants will respond to changes in temperature and what kind of species will be winners and losers in the fight for food and nest space. The responses are predictable and tell us why ant communities are already different between New England and the southern US. &nbsp;The combination of large-scale experiments, and laboratory measurements of colony responses, genetic differences, and changes in heat-shock proteins provide insight into how communities (and the ecosystem services they provide) have evolved in the past and will change in the future.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/28/2017<br>      Modified by: Aaron&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ellison</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136646/1136646_10126644_1485649026831_LaurenNichols-20150514-IMG_6819--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136646/1136646_10126644_1485649026831_LaurenNichols-20150514-IMG_6819--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Warm ants chamer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136646/1136646_10126644_1485649026831_LaurenNichols-20150514-IMG_6819--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Warm ants chamer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This 5-m diameter open-top chamber was warmed using a forced-air heating system to explore effects of climatic change on ant functional diversity</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lauren Nichols</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ellison</div> <div class="imageTitle">Warm ants chamer</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136646/1136646_10126644_1485649172624_LaurenNichols-20150506-IMG_6742--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136646/1136646_10126644_1485649172624_LaurenNichols-20150506-IMG_6742--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Working in a chamber"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136646/1136646_10126644_1485649172624_LaurenNichols-20150506-IMG_6742--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Working in a chamber"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Port-holes in the chamber sides allowed researchers to access the chambers</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lauren Nichols</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ellison</div> <div class="imageTitle">Working in a chamber</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136646/1136646_10126644_1485649331144_LaurenNichols-20140812-IMG_3073-11--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136646/1136646_10126644_1485649331144_LaurenNichols-20140812-IMG_3073-11--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ant at work"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1136646/1136646_10126644_1485649331144_LaurenNichols-20140812-IMG_3073-11--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ant at work"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A Temnothorax curvispinosus worker moves a larva in one of the warming chambers</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lauren Nichols</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ellison</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ant at work</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
