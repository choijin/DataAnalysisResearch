<AbstractNarration>Howard University and Florida International University plan a large, empirical, three year collaborative research study with partners Prairie View A&amp;M University and University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez. The proposed research will consider persistence and identity factors in undergraduate engineering education of students at these four Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). That is, the researchers will examine the impact of students' culture and ethnicity on the development of engineering identity and the importance of previously identified persistence factors (i.e., self-confidence, attitudes toward engineering, quality of instruction, etc.) on minority student attrition in institutions where they are the majority. This project seeks to address short-comings of the Academic Pathways Study, which included two of the PIs as members of the research team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retention theory and social cognitive career theory provide the theoretical underpinnings of the study and the team will explore their evolution and current status relative to student experiences. The project team will utilize a triangulated mixed methods research design to collect and analyze data. That is, surveys will be used to collect quantitative data and a mix of individual and focus group interviews will provide qualitative data.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project directly addresses broadening participation in engineering education with a unique focus on (1) identifying how environmental factors at MSIs versus Predominately White Institutions contribute to academic and career outcomes for minority students and (2) determining potential differences in outcomes among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), among Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and between HSIs and HBCUs. The proposed work has the potential to influence how scholars approach the study of ethnic minority students, as well as how they conceptualize and study MSIs, settings that often are marginalized in the study of college students. The fact that MSIs produce a substantial proportion of Black and Hispanic STEM degrees increases the relevance and potential impact of this work. In a broader sense this project considers the relevance of context in student achievement and persistence in STEM, which is a significant issue in the education of all students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over 55 years ago the people of the United States and its military and industrial institutions awoke to the fact that the numbers of engineers and students of engineering as a profession were insufficient to meet the challenges of the Soviet Union in the development of weapons and in the race to the moon.  This effort to educate and recruit engineers was a success, but by the first decade of the 21st century the lack of U.S. trained engineers for industries was again an issue.  This time, however, there existed two pools of prospective engineers that had not been considered in the 1960s and continued to be underrepresented in the profession:  women and members of non-Asian minority groups. This study focused on non-Asian minority groups, specifically Black and Hispanic undergraduate engineering students, because prior research had indicated that while programs at secondary schools and universities designed to recruit  Black and Hispanic students had been relatively successful, the proportions of these students who successfully completed undergraduate engineering programs were lower than those of other groups.  One idea that has been put forward to account for this phenomenon is the notion that students who are members of minority groups experience the academic environment differently than do White students.  Durkheim's idea of "normative integration" suggests that  students would integrate, and therefore succeed at institutions that have values and beliefs that are similar to their own and since virtually all studies of engineering undergraduates have been carried out at Predominantly White Institutions  it may be that levels of success among minority students might be affected by a lack of match between the values and beliefs of these students and their institutions. The values and beliefs of institutions reflect those of the students who are attending them.  Therefore, it may be that minority students who attend institutions where they are in the majority find a congruence between their values and beliefs and those of the institution leading to greater levels of integration.  This study involved Black students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic students attending Hispanic Serving Institutions..  Specifically, the purpose of this study was to identify variables that would allow us to predict the success of these students.  Work by numerous authors on student retention have expanded Durkheim's notion of normative integration to explain student persistence in higher education. Vincent Tinto suggested that there are two types of student integration:  Academic and Social Integration; the former connected to students' experiences in the academic portion of their programs and the latter dealing with how students relate to their peers and their instructors. In order to measure integration, we used a well researched measure and adjusted it to apply specifically to engineering undergraduate students.  Finally, we measured engineering students' perceptions of themselves as engineers to obtain an additional indicator of participants' fit in their programs.   One hundred ninety three second year undergraduate engineering students from two Historically Black Universities and two Hispanic Serving Universities completed the integration and self-efficacy instruments during the fall semester of each of three academic years, beginning in their second year of study and continuing through their fourth year of study.  Their grade point averages were recorded in the fall and spring of the first year of the study and at the end of each academic year after that.  Data analysis conducted at the end of participants' fourth year of study indicated that the following variables were related to their persistence in their engineering programs:  1. Participants' perceptions of the quality of their interactions with other engineering students (social integration).  2.  Participants' feelings about their commitment to enginee...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
