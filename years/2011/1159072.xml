<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Concern about the recent debt crisis in Europe, as well as debt repayment difficulties in many developing countries, was motivated by past experience with the ineffectiveness of negotiations to restructure sovereign debts: delays often exceed seven years, creditors appear to lose roughly 40% of the value of their claim, and debtors typically exit default as indebted as when they originally defaulted. The fact that creditors and the debtor have trouble reaching mutually beneficial agreements is an exmaple of a widespread phenomonon, found also in, for example, union-employer bargaining, congressional lobbying, and in international diplomacy such as the negotiation of environmental treaties.&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance our understanding of inefficiencies in bargaining over sovereign debt reÂ¬structuring, and in bargaining more generally, in three ways. First, it will construct new estimates of indebtedness that allow us to more accurately map our theories of debt restructuring into observed data. These data will be of use to researchers studying sovereign debt more generally. Second, it will contruct estimates of the outcomes of this bargaining for what is close to a census of all sovereign defaults between 1980 and 2006. Third, these estimates of bargaining outcomes will be used to test the empirical validity of models that alternatively explain delays in bargaining as (1) a mechanism for signalling private information by the parties to the bargaining; (2) a result of the inability of the parties to honor the terms of the bargain; and (3) as a resu(t of collective action problems among parties to the bargain. Finally, the project advances the literature on the estimation of models of financial constraint by extending these techniques to models with defaultable debt contracts, and, in particular, to models that endogenize the punishment to default through bargaining.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Both the pricing of debt, and assessments of the riskiness of debt to its holders, depend on forecasts of the likely recovery rate in the event of a default. By constructing data on recovery rates for all defaults since 1980, the project will enable more accurate pricing of debt. It will also allow regulators assessing the adequacy of capital levels of financial institutions to more accurately monitor the soundness of their own domestic financial systems. More accurate measures of indebtedness will also improve the predictive properties of our empirical models of sovereign default. This will also improve the pricing of sovereign debt, but perhaps more importantly will allow policy makers in both creditor countries and at supranational institutions to target assistance to the most vulnerable countries more promptly. Finally, by improving our understanding of the costs of default, this project will also aid policy makers in the appropriate design of interventions in the market for international debt. To the extent that the project identifies collective action problems as important in generating social inefficiencies, the models tested can be used as the basis for assessing the role of alternative contractual structures in reducing the cost of default ex post while still encouraging appropriate borrowing by countries ex ante.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the time being, the European debt crisis has receded. But the risk of a sovereign debt crisis in the near future remains high: government debt levels in many countries are near historical highs, and central banks around the world have indicated that interest rates will be rising in the near future. If history is any guide, we can expect a sovereign country somewhere in the world to need to restructure its foreign debts in the next few years.     This project has developed both new data and new theories that will help to guide policymakers when the next debt restructuring occurs. In terms of data, the project began by constructing measures of government indebtedness that are consistent and less subject to manipulation by the governments themselves. These data should allow for a more accurate estimation of the risk of a future default, and also more accurately identify the exposure of individual groups of creditors. The analysis also pointed to concerns about the ways in which the preferences of different creditors as to the form of a debt restructuring are aggregated to reach a final agreement.     The second data product were estimates of the value of debt relief to a country as functions of that country?s debt and the state of their economy at the data of a debt restructuring. These data should allow policymakers to identify forms of debt restructuring that provide appropriate debt relief to the country while minimizing the losses imposed on creditors.     Another data products includes estimates of the de facto seniority of different types of creditors in past sovereign debt restructurings which can guide creditor expectations in the event of a debt restructuring. More importantly, this analysis points to the need for creditors, especially official creditors like the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and creditor country governments, to clearly state the measurements by which they will assess whether they have been accorded the appropriate level of seniority. Other data products include measures of the maturity of a country?s debt and its currency composition that are consistently defined and are appropriate for cross country comparisons.  These data should also allow creditors and policymakers to appropriately assess the risk of a default and debt restructuring, as well as allowing them to design a debt restructuring that reduces future risk of default while protecting the value of creditors? claims.     On a theoretical side, we have contributed to our understanding of the problems in reaching timely debt restructuring agreements by advancing a new theory of the extent to which the risk of default on future debts issued as part of a debt restructuring itself constrains the ability of creditors and debtors to reach agreement on a restructuring. We have illustrated how different theories of the delays in reaching agreement on debt restructuring rely on different assumptions about the nature of debt restructuring negotiations and derived testable predictions for these models that can be taken to the data in future.
