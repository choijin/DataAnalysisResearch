<AbstractNarration>The research team will conduct extensive follow-up observations and analysis of several thousands of transiting planet candidates that are identified by the HATNet North and South telescope facilities.  By using telescopes in both the northern and southern hemispheres, the researchers will be able to provide increased spatial and temporal coverage, which will aid in establishing the orbits of relatively long-period exoplaents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transiting planets are those whose orbits cause them to pass in front of, and behind, the host star, which provides unique opportunities for characterization through subsequent photometric and spectroscopic observations. The project is expected to have broader impacts by significantly increasing the number of transiting exoplanets available to the community, and will involve students with special attention to under-represented groups in astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the past two decades there has been an extraordinary growth in our understanding of planets around stars other than the Sun, with some 1500 so-called exoplanets having been validated to date.

We carried out follow-up observations of hundreds these candidate planets using much larger ground-based telescopes (from 1 m up to 10 m diameters) which allowed us to reject most of the candidates as false positives, and to confirm 21 new transiting planets. We measured both masses and radii for all of these planets. The planets represent a broad class of objects, from planets smaller than Saturn to some that are several times the mass of Jupiter. They range from compact planets which likely have very massive solid cores, to some of the most inflated planets known (e.g., one enormous planet, called HAT-P-40b, has a radius that is 1.7 times that of Jupiter, but has only 0.6 times the mass).

Because they orbit bright stars, it is possible to measure a number of additional properties of the planets, such as their atmospheric compositions (what are the planets made out of?) and the alignments of the orbital planes with respect to their stars (are they well-aligned like the solar system?).
