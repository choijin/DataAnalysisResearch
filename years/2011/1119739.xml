<AbstractNarration>Non-native species have large ecological effects, cause enormous economic damage, and are one of the most important and least well controlled of human impacts on the world?s ecosystems. The long-term effects of species invasions, which may differ considerably from short-term effects, are still poorly understood. Soon after zebra mussels invaded the Hudson River over 17 years ago, they had  large impacts on nearly every aspect of the ecosystem. Recently, the zebra mussel population and its effects have begun to change: survival rates of zebra mussels have fallen by a factor of 100, and some, but not all, parts of the ecosystem have recovered toward pre-invasion conditions. This award continues the investigators' long-term study of zebra mussel invasion by quantifying the zebra mussel population and its effects on water chemistry, water clarity, and populations of phytoplankton, zooplankton, bacteria, and native pearly mussels in the Hudson River. Results will lead to a better understanding of the zebra mussel (one of the world's most important invaders), and also provide one of very few detailed studies of the long-term effects of an invader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this research will be of significant value to managers who oversee with the Hudson River and who confront wide-ranging effects of non-native species. To reach beyond the scientific community, the researchers will disseminate their findings by  posting data on open websites; continuing highly successful programs for middle- and high school students; and continuing a very active program of outreach through public lectures, seminars, training workshops, and newspaper articles.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this research project was to measure and interpret the long-term changes that occurred in the Hudson River ecosystem as a result of the zebra mussel (<em>Dreissena polymorpha</em>) invasion. Zebra mussels are small bivalves native to Europe that were accidentally brought to North America in the mid-1980s. They appeared in 1991 in the Hudson, a large, tidal, freshwater river in eastern New York State. As in many other biological invasions, zebra mussels changed many parts of the ecosystem, ranging from water chemistry and clarity, to bacteria and phytoplankton, to fish and other animals. They changed both the biodiversity and ecological functioning of the river, as well as its utility to humans. Many of these changes were very large (a factor of two or greater), so it would be fair to say that the zebra mussel invasion thoroughly transformed the Hudson&rsquo;s ecosystem (see Figure 1).</p> <p>However, our recent data have shown that the relationship between the invader and the ecosystem is changing through time. Death rates on zebra mussels have risen spectacularly, in part because of predation from the blue crab, a native predator. As a result, although the number of zebra mussels in the Hudson has not fallen, their age and body size have dropped dramatically. Few zebra mussels in the Hudson now live to be more than a year old (they used to live to five years old or more), or grow to be very large. As the body size of zebra mussels fell, some but not all of the impacts that zebra mussels caused have moderated or disappeared (Figure 2). For instance, populations of zooplankton, the tiny animals that are such a key food for the Hudson&rsquo;s fish, have recovered, and growth rates of young fish have rebounded back to pre-invasion levels. On the other hand, the amount of phytoplankton (a key support for the food web) is still down by 80% from pre-invasion levels, and native pearly mussels are still declining and seem likely to disappear from the Hudson.</p> <p>Changes in populations and impacts of biological invaders are likely to be common, but have not been studied frequently because of the difficulty of maintaining a scientific research project over a long period of time. Thus, in addition to teaching us much about the ecology of a specific invader (the zebra mussel) and the workings of the Hudson River and other aquatic ecosystems, this long-term research project provides a rare example that shows how invaders and ecosystems accommodate to one another over the long term. It has therefore been included in many textbooks and scientific review papers about biological invasions, aquatic ecology, and other subjects.</p> <p>This project contributed to classroom education, public understanding of science, and improved management of biological invasions in several ways. We worked with educators at the Cary Institute, the American Museum of Natural History, and elsewhere to prepare lesson plans, classroom materials, videos and other web-based instructional materials, student-friendly data sets and data visualization tools, and a traveling museum exhibit. These materials (freely available at <a href="http://www.caryinstitute.org/educators/teaching-materials/hudson-river-ecology">www.caryinstitute.org/educators/teaching-materials/hudson-river-ecology</a> and <a href="http://www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/river-ecology">www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/river-ecology</a> ) have reached many thousands of middle- and high-school students and their teachers in New York City, throughout New York State, and elsewhere. &nbsp;Our data also are featured in the very popular Hudson Data Jam Competition (<a href="http://www.caryinstitute.org/students/hudson-data-jam-competition">www.caryinstitute.org/students/hudson-data-jam-competition</a> ) for middle- and high-school students in our region (Figure 3). Our core data sets are freely available both on the Cary Institute web site and through The Knowledge Network (<a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org">https://knb.ecoinformatics.org</a> ), and we often supply custom data sets on request. As a result, the data we collected are routinely used by researchers and environmental managers outside of the Cary Institute. We published a book for lay audiences about Hudson River ecology (&ldquo;The Hudson Primer: The Ecology of an Iconic River&rdquo;, by Strayer), which relies heavily on the research findings of this grant. Our research findings have appeared frequently in popular media, both in newspaper articles, blogs, and radio segments that we produced, and in interviews and articles produced by others (see <a href="http://www.caryinstitute.org/newsroom">www.caryinstitute.org/newsroom</a> &nbsp;for examples). Finally, New York State policy and management about the Hudson River and about biological invasions both use the results of our research.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/20/2016<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Strayer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1119739/1119739_10099312_1474403526406_FEE2(600dpi)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1119739/1119739_10099312_1474403526406_FEE2(600dpi)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1119739/1119739_10099312_1474403526406_FEE2(600dpi)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Summary of the effects of the zebra mussel invasion on the Hudson River ecosystem during its first decade.
