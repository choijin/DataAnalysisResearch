<AbstractNarration>The CCGrid international conference series, jointly sponsored by IEEE and ACM, provides a venue for researchers to share research and experiences at the intersection of Cluster, Cloud and Grid technologies. The meeting format includes keynotes, workshops, expert panels, tutorials, and poster sessions in addition to the SCALE challenge competition. The 11th CCGrid conference (CCGrid 2011) will be held in May 2011 in Newport Beach, California, USA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students attending CCGrid 2011 will be exposed to discussions of major challenges in the field; have opportunities to interact and network with experts from academia and industry; have the opportunity to hear presentations from leaders in the field; and will take part in special student events. Student events will include interactive poster sessions and a student scholar roundtable with senior researchers. To ensure student participation at CCGrid the conference organizers will award travel scholarships to a number of graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Student Support for the  11th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing   (CCGrid 2011 &ndash; http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ccgrid11), Newport Beach California  PI: Nalini Venkatasubramanian     The 11th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing provided researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government agencies with an excellent opportunity to share their research and experience at the cross-roads of Cluster, Cloud and Grid (CCG) Technology. Clusters, grids, and now clouds are clearly having an enormous impact on science, industry, and government.. This event:  1)      Provided an environment for discussion of major challenges in addressing next-generation CCG computing platforms  2)      Promoted collaboration and cooperation between industry, academia and researchers.  Students, researchers, developers, and users interacted and explored research ideas, evaluated  maturing technologies, and presented novel applications using these technologies.  3)      Communicated experiences and visions through invited talks, plenary and industrial panels from leading researchers and practitioners who have actively researched and deployed in this field, with the goal of identifying specific CCG future challenges.  4)      Motivated and engaged future generations of researchers via conference and workshop presentations, interactive poster sessions, panel and breakout sessions where researchers (Ph.D. students including minorities and female students) presented papers, software demonstrations, research projects and new ideas in emerging CCGrid applications and technologies.     Student Attendance and Involvement  at IEEE CCGrid 2011: The award enabled the CCGrid 2011 organizers to provide  a  valuable forum for our next generation of student researchers; it exposed the student awardees to leaders in the community and incorporated a broad range of students  to this important and growing field of cluster, grid and cloud computing.  The CCGRID 2011 event had approximately 50 student attendees who participated in  entire conference including tutorials, workshops, talks, poster/demo sessions and the associated networking events (at a much reduced or waived registration).  The CCGRID conference fostered  interactions between senior CCGRID community members and the younger generation of student attendees in multiple events that were designed to facilitate such formal and informal networking.     Intellectual Merit Outcomes:  Specifc technical activities and their outcomes are:  Talks, presentations and tutorials from leading researchers and practitioners informed students and provided insight into  specific challenges &ndash; (a) Prof. Larry Smarr, Director of the California Institute for Information Technology and Telecommunications; Dr. Rich Wolski, CTO and Co-founder of Eucalyptus Systems, Inc. and the "IEEE Medal for Excellence in Scalable Computing" award winner Dr. Albert Zomaya. The NSF award was used to also enable student  attendance at the conference through travel grants/stipends to partially cover the airfare, registration and local expenses of graduate students.    An interactive poster/demonstration session was organized where student researchers presented  software demonstrations, research projects and new ideas in emerging applications and technologies,  Four Tutorials on state of the art topics were selected, organized and presented at the conference and were attended by students attending the conference.  The students received training on state of the art technologies in the following specific tutorials:     Market-Oriented Cloud Computing   FutureGrid Scientific Workflows: The Pegasus Workflow Management System Example  Designing Cloud and Grid Computing Systems with InfiniBand and High-speed Ethernet     During the conference, an Interactive Student Scholar Roundtable was held where selected students had a chance to informally interact with senior researcher...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
