<AbstractNarration>Social behaviors are among the most complex and interesting traits exhibited by any organisms. Social behaviors can vary tremendously across different species, yet recent work suggests that there are often common neural and molecular mechanisms that produce such diverse behaviors. Such common themes could prove tremendously important for our understanding of social behavior and how it contributes to a range of contemporary concerns, ranging from wildlife conservation to racial bias. This project will help to launch a new scientific society, the Society for Social Neuroscience, by bringing together outstanding researchers and students from a diverse array of fields. The researchers and students will present original research findings, which together can illuminate how genes and environment interact to shape the neuronal basis of social behavior. The resulting meeting will integrate viewpoints from fields as diverse as molecular evolution, neuroethology, primatology, social psychology and economics. By immersing students and researchers in the many scholarly fields that contribute to social neuroscience, we hope to foster new, interdisciplinary insights into the basis of social behavior among humans and non-human animals. The presentations at the meeting will be available online for members of the society and the organizers are seeking publications in several journals. The society will also formulate plans for managing the wealth of genomic and neural imaging data currently being generated in attempts to advance the field by generating  useful data and knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Society for Social Neuroscience is a newly formed society dedicated to understanding how the brain interacts with social settings to guide behavior. The origins of the topic are tremendously diverse, with research traditions spanning social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral endocrinology, evolution and genetics. Because of this intellectual diversity, many researchers &nbsp;in the field come from very different backgrounds and share their work predominantly with the subset of investigators who have similar training. In 2010, the Society for Social Neuroscience was formed to facilitate integration across these many perspectives. The award helped to support the 2011 Society for Social Neuroscience meeting, in Washington D.C. The meeting had three components: 1) a Pre-meeting panel consisting of 7 panelists, the PI and many observers, focused on issues of data management in social neuroscience. The panel features presentations by&nbsp;Hakizumwami Birali Runesha of the University Chicago on super-computing and its relevance to social neuroscience, and by Martin Shumway of the National Center for Biotechnology Information on the archiving and use of genomic data. 2) A key-note, poster session and reception co-sponsored with the Society for Neuroethics. The keynote speakers were primatologists Dorothy Cheney and Robert Seyfarth, with a response provided by neuro-philsopher Patricia Churchland. 3) A main meeting including 16 speakers from around the world, all leaders in their fields. The symposia for the main meeting included the themes of "Communication and social cues," "Individual decisions and group processes," "Developmental processes and epigenetics," and a young investigator symposium that honored 2 graduate students and 2 early career researchers showing extraordinary promise. The meeting included multiple panel discussions, as well as a second poster session, all of which allowed interaction across disciplines and across career stages. A post-meeting anonymous questionnaire revealed wide-spread enthusiasm for the meeting. We found most respondents were interested in attending such a meeting if it were held every year, and nearly half reported identifying new opportunities for collaboration as a result of the meeting.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/10/2013<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;M&nbsp;Phelps</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
