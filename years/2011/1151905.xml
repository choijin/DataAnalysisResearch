<AbstractNarration>This CAREER grant explores the basic biological phenomena that underlie displays of the psychological states of elevation and altruism.  Elevation refers to the emotional response experienced after witnessing acts of great virtue or moral beauty.  When people witness these acts, they too can be uplifted and inspired to improve their own character and perform altruistic acts.  The research is particularly novel in that it incorporates a multi-method and cross-sectional approach by including measurements of elevation, altruistic behavior, oxytocin secretion, autonomic regulation of the heart, and genetic and epigenetic profiles of the oxytocin receptor.  The investigator will investigate how elevation and altruism are mediated by individual differences in the neuropeptide system of oxytocin. The 5-year CAREER project focuses on understanding how naturally-occurring variations in oxytocin influence the experience and expression of elevation and altruism in young children, young adults, and older adults.  The series of experiments will reveal the biological processes underlying the brain-body coordination of elevation and subsequent altruism as well as how these profiles compare and contrast across the lifespan.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project enhances the investigator's educational goals including teaching and encouraging scientific inquiry and prosocial behavior in community groups ranging from children to the elderly.  An integral component of this plan involves the formation of a partnership with the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) and the Cross-Cultural Mentorship Program at the Oregon State University (OSU) in order to introduce underrepresented and first-generation college students to a variety of scientific research opportunities on campus. Another educational endeavor includes the investigator's involvement in the NSF-funded Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program, which is designed to facilitate and encourage diversity in students who wish to pursue a career in health psychology research on the topic of healthy aging.</AbstractNarration>
