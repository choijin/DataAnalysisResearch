<AbstractNarration>Darwin's finches of the Gal√°pagos Islands stand as one of the most impressive examples of evolution.  After colonizing the islands, a single ancestral finch species eventually diversified into 13 species of different sizes, bill shapes, and ecologies.  The suboscine passerine birds exhibit a similar history, but their diversification was not limited to a small set of islands; instead they are found throughout South America, Central America, North America, and parts of the Old World. There are now 1,300 species that differ dramatically in body shape and size, feeding behavior, and nest architecture. The primary goal of this project is to use DNA sequences to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these species, and to use this model system to investigate why the tropics are so biologically diverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vital component of this collaborative project between U.S. and Brazilian scientists is the research training it will provide. With fieldwork planned in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, and Viet Nam, young scientists from a diversity of countries will be exposed not only to a diversity of natural environments but will also interact and forge relationships with their international peers.  By working together to reconstruct perhaps the most spectacular evolutionary radiations of birds in the world, the researchers will learn how evolution works on a continental scale while training a new generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Suboscine birds include about 10% of global bird diversity, but most of the group is restricted to the Neotropics.  Because of their variation in ecology, behavior, and morphology, suboscines feature prominently in studies of diversification and macroecology. However, such studies have been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the relationships among all of the various species and higher taxonomic units.  This project amassed the largest DNA sequence data matrix yet assembled for the group by using recently developed genomic library preparation and next-generation sequencing methods.  Analysis of this large matrix revealed that our knowledge about the group was incomplete or incorrect; many taxonomic groups (species, genera, families) comprised unrelated lineages.  Our new perspective on relationships in the group now allows more informed analysis of the tempo and mode of diversification in this large component of the Neotropical avifauna.  The project provided extensive training to graduate and undergraduate students in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics techniques.  An initial cohort of students and professors attended a training workshop at a collaborating institution. Subsequently, informal training and formal seminars extended to many other students the expertise to produce, process, and analyze thousands of genomic markers. These abilities have transformed the types of questions that graduate students and professors can ask in their study systems.  Familiarity with scripting and bioinformatics prepared graduate and undergraduate students to enter the workforce in STEM fields and compete in a competitive job market.
