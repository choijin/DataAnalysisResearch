<AbstractNarration>This project applies two recently introduced evolution equations to fundamental issues in hydrodynamic turbulence.  The first equation is for the determining modes of a differential equation of Navier-Stokes type. A set of low modes is determining, if for any solution on the global attractor, the high modes of the solution for all time, can be produced from only the low modes (for all time). Extending this relationship to the Banach space of bounded functions from the reals into the low modes leads to a determining form, an evolution equation that is globally Lipschitz, and dissipative. The global attractor of the original differential equation is contained in the long time behavior of the determining form.  This provides an alternative to the theory of inertial forms which is not known to be applicable to the Navier-Stokes equations. The other evolution equation is for the radius of analyticity in the spatial variable.  We will use this equation to study the domain of analyticity for solutions on the global attractor and its effect on aspects of fluid flow such as intermittency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluid motions at large scales, for instance in ocean and atmosphere, display erratic, seemingly incomprehensible (turbulent) features when viewed locally and for short times. However, over time, consistent global statistical patterns emerge. The purpose of this research is to develop a rigorous understanding of the nature and origin of such patterns, and of deviations from it, with a view towards diverse applications such as ocean modeling and weather forecasting. For instance, weather forecasting is done by solving a large system of equations which model the state of the atmosphere over a period of time.&lt;br/&gt;The current state of the atmosphere is needed as input in order to compute the state in the future.  As there are always limited measurements of the state of the system, this input inevitably contains some error. The inherent sensitivity of the system to such an error means that as time goes on the computed solution diverges from reality. The technique of data assimilation uses the limited measurements of the system at not just a single moment of time, but rather over an extended time period in the past, to arrive at a more accurate input.  This project applies recent mathematical discoveries to develop new variations on this technique. It will lead to new algorithms that will be implemented and tested by the research team.  Graduate students will play an essential role in this collaborative effort, thus serving to train future generation of scientists in the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many mathematical models of physical systems depend on both space and time.  To determine the behavior in the future, the sate of the system must be specified at some initial time.  For instance, in weather forecasting models the temperature, pressure and wind velocity along with other variables would need to be known at some instant at every physical location in the atmosphere. As an approximation, computer forecasts represent these variables at a large, but finite set of locations.  We do not have weather stations at such fine resolution.  We do, however, have nearly continuous in time data over a long period from a fraction of the locations.  It is possible to insert data for the state variables from this coarse set of locations into the model and ultimately recover the state of the system over the remaining locations.  This is called data assimilation.   Data assimilation is connected to another aspect of our work.  The values of state variables over a set of locations over a long period of time can be thought of as a trajectory in a high-dimensional space.  In data assimilation each trajectory for a subset of locations determines one for the other locations.  Based on this notion we have developed an alternative to certain physical models called a determining form in which the state itself is a trajectory over a small subset of locations.  Thus an initial condition for the determining form is itself such a trajectory.  The way in which this determining form is structured allows for the ready identification of trajectories of the original physical model of interest.  We have constructed such a determining form for various important physical systems, including the Navier-Stokes equations for velocity in fluid flow, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation for propagation of a laser beam, and the Korteveg-de Vries equation for shallow water waves.  Each model requires a different mathematical approach.   Another model couples the Navier-Stokes equation with one for the advection of temperature.  We have developed an algorithm for data assimilation for this model which uses velocity data only; the temperature is not specified at all, yet is recovered.    We are also concerned with more delicate issues regarding the Navier-Stokes system.  A major open mathematical question for this equation, when the spatial domain is three-dimensional, is whether solutions continue to exist for all future times.  It is known that there are a variety of reasonable additional assumptions which will guarantee this.  Under one such assumption we have derived bounds on the energy and another measure of the velocity from turbulence theory called enstrophy.  We have shown that even if the solution does exist for all future time, the enstrophy, though bounded, could conceivably spike to extraordinarily large values.  This has significance for efforts to settle the open question by computer simulation; a solution could appear to start to fail to exist by seeming to approach infinity, when in fact it will remain bounded.
