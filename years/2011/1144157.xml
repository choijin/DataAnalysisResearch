<AbstractNarration>The organizations and institutions which historically have borne the responsibility for the curation, management, preservation, and retrieval of information contained in physical objects now find themselves confronted by the similar need to manage digital data though the challenges of doing so are distinctly different.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will convene a committee of experts from the National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Research Data and Information (BRDI) to:&lt;br/&gt;- Conduct a three day public workshop public of key stakeholders for intensive structured discussions in order to obtain a better understanding of the unprecedented challenges of managing what has been called an "exaflood" of data.  &lt;br/&gt;- Design and implement a focused study to better understand the needs and opportunities for a workforce with blended skills and expertise necessary to effectively manage and preserve diverse digital resources and workforce changes as "digital natives" enter the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;- Generate a report that will inform the community on the education and training needs and requirements, career alternatives, and workforce development in regards to digital curation.</AbstractNarration>
