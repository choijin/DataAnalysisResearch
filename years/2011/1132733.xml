<AbstractNarration>The project supports participation of graduate students enrolled in PhD programs at US universities in the 10th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2011) to be held at Koblenz, Germany. Specifically, the project supports travel to the conference for those who might not otherwise be able to attend for financial reasons, and  participation in a doctoral consortium that provides for one-on-one interactions  and mentoring for the students from the world's leading semantic web researchers. Students benefit from  exposure to state-of-the-art semantic web research, opportunities to attend tutorials on emerging research topics.  Collectively, these activities help integrate graduate students into the established semantic web research community and provides a natural avenue for integration of research and education.</AbstractNarration>
