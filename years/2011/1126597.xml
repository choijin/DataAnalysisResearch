<AbstractNarration>1126597&lt;br/&gt;West&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding for a high accuracy, gravimetric analyzer which will be used as a key part of a larger mission to study and understand the gas-sorption behavior of two classes of ionic liquids: CO2-absorbing ionic liquids and anesthetic gas-absorbing ionic liquids. They are focusing on the design, synthesis and characterization of these classes of ionic liquids for gas absorption with the goal of eventually developing them into practical separation agents. The approach is to design these compounds using their expertise in thermodynamics and organic chemistry. They will use computational methods to screen a preliminary library of prospective compounds for high gas solubility, from which they will synthesize promising candidates. Once synthesized, these compounds will be characterized in terms of their equilibrium, kinetic and thermal properties of absorption for a variety of gases and vapors. These analyses, along with existing measurement capabilities, including thermal (DSC), density and viscosity measurements, will provide the necessary data to determine which compounds are good candidates for practical use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the impact of man-made gases released into our atmosphere was one of the most important scientific and societal discoveries of the 20th century. From greenhouse gases, such as CO2 and fluorocarbons, to ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, the previous century showed us that fugitive emissions of colorless, seemingly harmless substances are not necessarily a benign addition to our environment. In the 21st century, we must be proactive in addressing the effects of gaseous emissions from all sectors of industrial and commercial enterprises. Rather than focusing on removing highly diluted atmospheric gases, the solution lies in capturing the harmful emissions at their source, preventing their release into the environment.  But to do this, appropriate separation materials must be found though designed, synthesis and characterization of novel materials (whether liquids or solids).  Through this award an instrument was acquired which allows for the accurate measurement of gas capture from vapor streams; research utilizing this instrument has been focused on energy and environmental applications.  The instrument, a Hiden Isochema Intelligent Gravimetric Analyzer, allows the absorption (into the substance) or adsorption (on the surface of a solid) of a gas or vapor in/on a novel material, such as an ionic liquid or porous material, to be measure to high accuracy.  This enables the screening of materials for their ability to remove specific substances from gas streams over a broad range of temperatures (0-500&deg;C) and pressures (~0.5 psi to 290 psi). With this acquisition, the University of South Alabama obtained cutting-edge instrumentation to carry out this critical research.  Although the University of South Alabama has had a significant capability for materials synthesis for a number of years, including the description of the first ionic liquid to capture CO2, it has not had a significant characterization capability with respect to gas capture.  This capability is essential as it is part of the design cycle (design-synthesize-characterize-iterate) of any material development process.  The PIs have used the instrument to further work funded by the NSF (award 1126597) which relates to the design, synthesis and characterization of lipidic ionic liquids; novel non-volatile, environmentally benign replacement solvents design to have high solubilities for nonpolar solutes, such as methane.  The PIs have used data from the instrument to demonstrate that these ionic liquids have higher solubilities for ethane than ethylene, a result counter to that for virtually all traditional ionic liquids.  As such, these experiments have been key in demonstrating that these species do have "nonpolar-like" solvent properties; that is, solvent properties more similar to nonpolar species (hexane) than polar species (water), even though they are ionic compounds which are innately polar.   As such, they have great promise as separations agents for nonpolar gases which could reduce energy consumption and environmental emissions.   The acquisition of the instrument has had a broader impact on research at South Alabama, with significant additional infrastructure being developed and researcher interest growing around developing sorptive materials.  Furthermore, three Assistant Professors have used the instrument to collect preliminary data for proposals, furthering their research efforts.  Continuing research involves screening materials for CO2 capture, methane and hydrogen storage, ethylene/ethane separations and catalytic materials synthesized using supercritical fluid deposition.  In addition to the research listed above, a number of students (four graduate and six undergraduate students, two of whom were underrepresented minorities or women) were trained on the operation, theory and modeling of data collected using the instrument, giving them access to world-class research resources and experiences, contributing to their preparation to enga...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
