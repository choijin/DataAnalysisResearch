<AbstractNarration>The Delaware State University Center for Research and Education in Optical Sciences and Applications (CREOSA), in response to OISE Solicitation NSF 11-508, Catalyzing New International Collaborations (CNIC), is awarded funding to support planning visits to Mexico. The trips facilitate a new research collaboration with the Centro de Investigacion en Ciencia Aplicada y Tecnologia Avanzada (CICATA) at the Instituto Politecnico Nacional (INP-Mexico) in Mexico City. The subject of the collaborative research is the development of photothermal infrared and visible imaging and especially near-field microscopy for nanometric systems.  Photothermal imaging offers an interesting approach to high-resolution microscopy because it offers high sensitivity with scatter-free image acquisition for non-destructive testing. The expertise and experimental facilities at CICATA complement those of CREOSA. Both Centers emphasize student education and industrial technology transfer. This award supports students from Delaware to visit the laboratory in Mexico to initiate the collaborations, and Mexican students will subsequently visit CREOSA to strengthen the partnership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit aims to establish an international research collaboration that can contribute new experimental techniques required to overcome scattering problems in the non-destructive imaging of nanoscale structures, including biological and physiological systems, and thus to provide cleaner, high-resolution images.  New and improved imaging technology can have broad impact in medical applications as well as supporting research on new materials. The proposed program will actively involve students in both the initial planning and exploratory activities as well as in the subsequent joint research. Delaware State University is an HBCU so the program will contribute to enhanced diversity in the research community.</AbstractNarration>

IPN is a major institution in Mexico focused in the education and research in Engineering and Technology. The institute has more than 100,000 undergraduate students and more than 7,000 graduate students. CICATA is one of the 15 research centers of IPN. Collaboration with scientists from IPN is of great importance for our university. US scientists and students are also members of the National Science Foundation Center for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (NSF CREST) Optical Science Center for Applied Research (OSCAR) located at DSU campus. The collaboration started with a visit of two US scientists and two US graduate students to Mexico in May-June 2012. Members of the US team learned about the advances of the Mexican team in the uses of the photothermal wave method in photopyroelectric and photoacoustic microscopic systems. Photopyroelectric method measures electrical signals generated by heat that results from the absorption of light. Photoacoustic method measures sound generated by absorption of light photons. Both methods have important applications in microscopy and analysis of material properties. The designed in Mexico scanning photopyroelectric microscope provides microscopic nondestructive analysis of solid nontransparent surfaces with penetration depths of up to few millimeters. Thermal diffusion properties of solid material can be conducted. Mexican scientists have also developed new low cost practical technique for coating of thin films on silicon substrate for application in the development of infrared detectors. All members of the US team completed presentations at CICATA and discussed future collaborations with Mexican partners. Lectures for US students about the principles of photothermal wave detection were presented by Mexican scientists. The US team members also completed a visit to the Center of Nanosciences and Micro and Nanotechnology (Centro de Nanociencias y Micro y Nanotecnologia) in the central campus of IPN, in Mexico City. This state of the art facility provides services of X-ray diffraction, electronic microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, ionic lithography and other services needed for characterization of materials and structures for the demanding area of micro- and nanotechnology. In a second part of the project a graduate Mexican student funded by the Mexican agency CONACYT, visited the DSU team from September 2012 until March 2013. During this time he participated in the development of a photothermal spectrophotometer based on an arc-lamp source. The device was used for spectroscopic analysis of scattering samples. Four US graduate students (two minority students, one female) and three minority undergraduate students were directly or indirectly involved in the research and educational activities of the project. Two US graduate students completed also their research on photothermal lens spectrometry of scattering samples and photothermal lens microscopy. Ideas of Mexican scientists on photothermal wave detection and photothermal scanning microscopy were used in these works. The corresponding Master of Science thesis of the students and other scientific communications are currently under preparation.
