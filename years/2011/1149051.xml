<AbstractNarration>Malicious software (a.k.a. malware) is at the basis of most cyber-criminal operations, causing significant financial loss and posing great risks to national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research creates novel network-centric behavior-based malware detection systems that automatically learn how to identify malware-compromised machines within a network, and that can self-tune to achieve the best possible trade-off between malware detection rate and false alarms for a given network. This self-tuning property is achieved by combining models of malware-generated network traffic with models of legitimate user-generated network activities to build hybrid detection models that can adapt to a specific network environment and accurately detect malware-generated network traffic crossing the network perimeter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new approach to malware detection takes into account events that occur within an entire network, rather than focusing on events that occur at each single host, and focuses on adaptive detection of all types of malware, rather than being limited to a specific malware type (e.g., botnets). Therefore, the detection systems resulting from this research will provide new effective detection capabilities that can complement current anti-malware technologies and significantly contribute to a better defense-in-depth strategy against malware.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Malicious software (or malware) is the tool of choice used by cyber-criminals to perpetrate a large variety of computer and network attacks. For instance, attackers can infect thousands, or even millions of machines with malware, and remotely control them to launch devastating coordinated attacks against victim networks. This CAREER project focuses on the network behavior of malware as a way of detecting malware-infected machines and blocking their malicious activities.     Detecting malware infected machines Because modern malware typically needs to communicate with a remote attacker to receive commands, report stolen information, launch further attacks, etc., a malware-infected machine will inevitably generate anomalous network traffic. This research therefore focuses on modeling the network behavior of malware using statistical machine learning approaches. This allows us to generate statistical fingerprints that can be matched against a machine?s network traffic to determine if the machine has been infected with malware.    One of the main challenges related to using statistical models to detect malware-generated network traffic is the possibility of false positives, namely benign activities that are misclassified as malicious. To mitigate false positives, this project focuses on building hybrid statistical models that capture the inherent features of both malware-generated network traffic and the "background" benign traffic generated by the networks where the malware detection models are to be deployed.    Following the approach outlined above, we have developed several systems that aim to advance the state-of-the-art of network-based malware detection. For instance, ExecScent is a system dedicated to detecting malware-infected machines in large enterprise networks, by focusing on analyzing web traffic, which is often used by malware as a way to hide in plain sight among the huge amount of legitimate web traffic generated by the victim networks.
