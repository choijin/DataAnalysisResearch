<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Will Perkins undertook an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship at Georgia Tech to work on problems at the intersection of probability theory, computation, and statistics.   The primary question he addressed is "What are the computational barriers to statistical inference problems?"  This problem lies at the heart of theoretical computer science as it asks how to characterize hard instances of computational problems. Understanding hard instances is crucial for designing efficient algorithms but also for designing cryptographic tools that make use of hard computational problems.  The importance of probability theory is that "typical" instances of a computational problem can be modeled as arising from a probability distribution over instances; and generating a hard computational problem at random is exactly what is required for cryptographic applications.  One of the main aims of his fellowship proposal was to understand "planted distributions" of random combinatorial structures.  These are random structures (graphs, hypergraphs, boolean formulae) with a solution planted in advance and random noise added on top of the solution.  The computational problem is to recover the planted structure despite the presence of noise.  This is a very typical statistical set-up: a ground truth "signal" is corrupted with noise and the statistician must recover the signal.    One major series of publications resulting from the project dealt with random satisfiability problems with planted solutions.  These are random boolean formulae drawn from a distribution that guarantees a specific (unknown) assignment is satisfying.  The model arises is cryptography as it can be used to create a one-way function.  The work done (with coauthors Vitaly Feldman, Laura Florescu, and Santosh Vempala) identified algorithmic thresholds for identifying the planted assignment in such a random formulae.  In other words, the research identified the threshold of noise below which the solution can be recovered using an efficient algorithm, and above which a large class of algorithms requires an enormous amount of time to find the solution.  The series of works included the development of new algorithms as well as new methods for proving algorithmic lower bounds.  A second aim of the proposal was to study random graphs "beyond Erdos-Renyi", where the Erdos-Renyi random graph is the simple but fascinating model of a graph on n points in which each possible edge is present independently with probability p.  While the model has beautiful properties, it lacks geometry: all nodes and pairs of nodes have the same behavior.  Most interesting graphs or networks in the real world or in models from physics have a geometric aspect.  A significant part of the research done during this project was on random geometric graphs: random graphs with a important geometric properties governing which edges are present.  One publication (with coauthor Milan Bradonjic) established general theorems on how sensitive global properties of these graphs are to small variations in parameters (in physics language, theorems on the sharpness of phase transitions).  Another publication made connections between the random geometric graph and models from statistical physics.
