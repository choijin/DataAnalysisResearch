<AbstractNarration>With support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Harold Dibble will conduct a series of experiments directly relevant to the understanding of how stone tools (lithics) are made.  While modern flintknappers (those who replicate stone tools) are able to reproduce forms found in the archaeological record, most of the fundamental processes involved are not well understood.  These experiments, building on an earlier set of experiments also funded by NSF, will extend the results of those experiments to investigate the effects that raw materials may have on fundamental aspects of lithic manufacture and use.  Among the independent variables to be tested are (a) different rock types that were used by prehistoric peoples and (b) how subjecting those materials to heating affects their properties both in terms of manufacture and use.  The two major sets of dependent variables to be examined include (a) "flakeability" (including the amount of force required to remove flakes as well as the degree of variation -and thus predictability - of flake size and shape produced under identical conditions), and (b) edge sharpness and durability (i.e., two primary considerations for using stone tools for tasks such as cutting and scraping).  The results of these experiments will directly address criteria that may have been used in the past for selecting certain kinds of rocks and altering their properties through heat treatment for the manufacture and use of stone tools.    &lt;br/&gt;Stone tools constitute a principal source for understanding most of the last two and a half million years of human prehistory and constitute a prime source of archaeological data. Researchers wish to understand how they were manufactured and to do this they must understand the properties of the raw materials from which they are made.&lt;br/&gt;The research to be conducted  has a goal that is much broader than understanding a particular technology or identifying specific processes in the production of particular lithic types.  Rather, the goal is to test specific relationships among the independent variables used by all knappers (prehistoric and modern alike) to control the sizes and shapes of flakes.  As such, it speaks directly to the fundamental processes underlying the knapping process and is intended to give lithic archaeologists a much better understanding of how these independent variables affect the morphology of flakes.  In this way the results of this experiment will be relevant to virtually all geographic areas and temporal periods that yield lithic assemblages.  &lt;br/&gt;This experiment will also form the focus of an undergraduate course at the University of Pennsylvania in experimental archaeology.  This will give them first-hand experience in experimental design and methodology.  As has been the case with all research done by the PI, the experimental operation and results will be made accessible to the larger public through a website designed specifically for this purpose (www.oldstoneage.com).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ About 2.5 million years ago, early humans began developing a new technology &ndash; the manufacture and use of stone tools &ndash; that allowed them to exploit an entirely new subsistence pattern based on the consumption of animal products, primarily meat and fat.  A reliance on stone tools, or lithics, continued to develop and quickly became the primary technology for at least 99.9% of human existence, up until about 10,000 years ago with the invention of ceramic technology, followed by metallurgy several millennia later.  It has long been argued that lithic technology not only opened up an entirely new subsistence base, but was also one of the main catalysts behind the development of human cognitive abilities and ultimately modern human culture.  Understanding how this technology works, to reconstruct how early humans were able to create these implements, is fundamentally important to developing an accurate understanding of a major aspect of human evolution.   Lithic technology was ultimately replaced, primarily by the use of metals, and by the time of the development of Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) archaeology in the later part of the 19th century, it had become virtually extinct.  This meant that although archaeologists had literally billions of prehistoric stone artifacts available for study, they had to rediscover for themselves how to make and use these kinds of implements in order to understand many of the factors underlying the variability that we see in them.  Much of the rediscovery process was based on simple trial-and-error &ndash; archaeologists themselves tried various techniques to order to find ones that allowed them to replicate the kinds of objects found in the archaeological record.  It has become very clear, however, that lithic manufacture is a very complex process, in which several independent variables play a role, including how one strikes the stone (how much force is applied, the angle at which the stone is struck, the material used to strike it, etc) and how the stone must be prepared to achieve particular desired results.  Understandably, a trial-and-error approach, with virtually no control and quantification of the independent variables, yielded only anecdotal evidence that was both incomplete and even incorrect.  This project, and one that preceded it, allowed the PI to develop a new laboratory-based research program featuring a newly-designed and highly controlled, objective, and quantified experiment on stone tool manufacture.  The design of this experiment represents a significantly different approach to furthering our understanding of how stone-tool makers, or flintknappers, manipulate various independent variables to achieve particular results.   There have been several important results of this research that have relevance to the interpretation of prehistoric stone tool manufacture.  The role of several, in fact most, key independent variables (i.e., those under the control of the knapper) have been investigated:  exterior platform angle, platform depth, angle of blow, exterior core morphology, hammer materials and application of force, and platform beveling.  These results not only have implications for our understanding of how flakes are formed, but also on how knappers can manipulate particular variables to produce specific results.  Even more importantly, by applying this understanding to archaeological materials, it is possible to show how prehistoric changed their knapping strategies to achieve more economical flakes (as measured by edge length in relation to mass) through the earliest stone technologies through to the end of the Pleistocene.  A primary focus of the current experiments has been on the role that various raw material properties (toughness, elasticity, brittleness, stiffness) plays in producing flake variation, as well as the effects of heat treatment on various materials.   The flake products of lithic technology vary both in size and shape, and thus far these experiments have isolated the effects that particular independent variables (those under the control of the knapper) result in such variability.  it has been shown, for example, that flake size is influenced primarily by exterior platform angle and platform depth, and to a lesser extent by angle of blow and platform beveling.  Variation in flake shape has been shown to be influenced by exterior core morphology, coupled with interaction between exterior platform angle and platform depth.  Other lithic attributes, such as platform lipping, have been shown to be influenced by the material of the hammer.  Preliminary results thus far show that various raw materials (obsidian, flint, and basalt) do show the same general relationships between the studied independent and dependent variables, though differ significantly with regards to the force necessary to initiate fracture and the relationship between independent variables and flake weight.  Preliminary studies also suggest that heat treatment of particular lithic materials also affects the force required for fracture initiation.  Experiments on edge sharpness and durability of these various raw materials will shed light on why particular materials were chosen to be used for particular tasks.
