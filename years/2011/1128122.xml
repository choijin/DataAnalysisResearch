<AbstractNarration>The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a suite of research infrastructure rapidly taking shape in prototype form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for at-scale experiments in future internets. Nationwide experiments began in summer 2010, and GENI now supports a wide range of interesting research experiments across the nationwide meso-scale GENI prototype, built from GENI-enabled commercial equipment, that spans 14 US campuses and the two national research backbones (Internet2, National Lambda Rail [NLR]). Research teams presented 9 major demonstrations of live, nationwide experiments at the 9th GENI Engineering Conference in November 2010. About 20 research experiments are now starting to drive GENI?s evolving design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will fund the third round of development and prototyping for GENI, effectively completing the transition from building GENI to using GENI for at-scale research. This effort includes 1) enhancing the meso-scale build-out to include six major regional research networks across sixteen states, connecting campuses to Internet2 an NLR; 2) increasing the campus WiMAX deployments via multi-cell sites, android handsets and vehicular experiments; 3) creating, deploying and operating ~54 GENI racks within campuses, regional networks and national backbones; 4) deploying and operating two robust, complementary instrumentation and measurement systems; and 5) expanding the GENI experimenter community by creating educational materials, running workshops and summer schools and starting ongoing operations and helpdesk support.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Note: GENI is supported by multiple NSF awards. This outcomes report summarizes overall GENI-related outcomes. The specific work of this award, "Solicitation 3 Design and Prototyping," addresses the nationwide deployment of GENI infrastructure and supporting capability development. GENI's Goals The Global Environment for Network Innovations - GENI - is a suite of research infrastructure that comprises a distributed laboratory deployed across the United States. (See Figure 1.) GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems by providing a suite of infrastructure for "at-scale" experiments in future internets. GENI supports a wide variety of experiments, including the following:  Experiments ranging from small to "at-scale" experiments. Both experiments that are compatible and experiments that are incompatible with today?s Internet. Not only controlled, repeatable experiments, which which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks, but also trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today?s Internet and that engage large numbers of users. A variety of classroom and research experiments.  Although GENI?s goal is to support "at-scale" experiments on future internets, our plan has never been to build a separate, parallel set of infrastructure "as big as the Internet," which is clearly infeasible. Instead, the approach has been to "GENI-enable" existing testbeds, campuses, regional and backbone networks, cloud computation services, and commercial equipment to be programmable, virtualized and sliceable, so that they can support end-to-end experiments.  GENI's Results GENI has addressed its initial purpose of supporting innovative research, and it has gone beyond these goals in a number of ways.
