<AbstractNarration>The ability to transfer information securely, to guarantee privacy, and to authenticate users in wireless networks forms the basis for confidentiality and economic advantage in today's information society. Contemporary wireless security systems evolved from schemes developed for traditional wireline applications, ignoring the special features of radio propagation channels. Meanwhile, the secrecy of wireless networks can be strengthened by exploiting the physical properties of these radio channels. Current research activities in this direction have largely ignored radio interference that can affect the secrecy of communication in a fundamental way. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize the various effects of interference (conventionally considered deleterious for communications) on network secrecy, as well as to develop techniques that exploit intrinsic properties of interference and radio channels for improving network secrecy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research establishes foundations for the intrinsically secure exchange of information within wireless communities formed by spatially distributed legitimate users, interferers, and eavesdroppers. Principles and concepts from multiple disciplines such as communication theory, information theory, statistical inference, probability theory, stochastic geometry, and graph theory are employed to characterize the role of interference on network secrecy. In particular, this research (1) establishes a framework to determine the secrecy rate in large-scale wireless networks; (2) determines the properties of the iSI-graph, a random geometric graph that characterizes intrinsic secrecy in the presence of interference; (3) analyzes network secrecy in the presence of colluding eavesdroppers; and (4) evaluates the performance of secrecy enhancing techniques, including deliberate interference generation and sectorized transmission. This research provides a deeper understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of interference on network secrecy, paving the way to a more secure and safer information society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This research is motivated by the need for providing an additional level of secrecy to contemporary security systems that are based on cryptographic primitives. In this project, we have developed foundations for the design and analysis of intrinsically secure communications in wireless networks. In addition, we have also designed interference engineering techniques that generate desirable interference for secrecy protection in a wide variety of network topologies such as large scale point to point wireless network, heterogeneous network, and self-organizing multilevel wireless networks (MWNs). The goal is to understand the role of the network interference in communication secrecy and to develop effective strategies to enhance the secrecy through interference engineering.   Our research has focused on the problem of intrinsically secure networks with a particular emphasis on the role of network interference. We have developed a framework for network secrecy that accounts for (a) the spatial distributions of legitimate, eavesdropping, and interfering nodes, (b) the physical properties of the wireless propagation medium, and (c) the presence of an intentional interfering network. We introduced the concept of distributed network secrecy (DNS) and developed a framework for design and analysis of confidential MWNs. Various interference engineering strategies have been proposed and evaluated under this framework leading to valuable insights on the development of competitive strategies that exploit properties inherent in wireless networks to enhance network secrecy. The role of interference engineering strategies (IES) on wireless network secrecy is determined, guiding the design of IESs for a new level of communication confidentiality. Finally, we have established a mathematical framework for secret-key generation using common unknown deterministic sources (UDSs), and determined the secret-key rate via an information-theoretic analysis. As a case study, the reciprocal wideband channels in mobile wireless networks is considered as a common UDS, and the secret-key rate is derived as a function of various network parameters such as mobility and transmission bandwidth.
