<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a major need in the glass&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing industry by developing a wireless sensor for 3?]D imaging of glass furnace walls to identify&lt;br/&gt;refractory erosion and molten glass leaks. The furnace walls are comprised of insulation and AZS&lt;br/&gt;(Alumina, Zirconium, Silica) refractories which are highly lossy and very dispersive at high temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;A conventional approach would inevitably be constrained by its system dynamic range, and thus the&lt;br/&gt;most important molten glass?]AZS echo would be virtually invisible regardless of the sophistication of&lt;br/&gt;digital processing on the measured results. This project takes a holistic approach from antenna design to&lt;br/&gt;imaging algorithm to sensor architecture in order to tackle very demanding requirements of the furnace&lt;br/&gt;wall. It aims to accomplish (1) accurate characterization of attenuation and dispersive properties of the&lt;br/&gt;furnace walls (2) optimal antenna design to match with minimum inter?]coupling, (3) high resolution&lt;br/&gt;imaging algorithm that leverages prior knowledge of wall properties, and (4) hardware architecture with&lt;br/&gt;the highest possible dynamic range in such a high temperature environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it offers a 3?]D sensor that will enable a&lt;br/&gt;maintenance program based upon the real condition of the furnace to realize longer life span of high&lt;br/&gt;temperature furnaces and make informed local maintenance without a major interruption in the&lt;br/&gt;production. This translates to significant financial savings for the glass manufacturing industry given the&lt;br/&gt;multi?]million dollar initial capital investment is required to build a furnace, followed by a multi?]million&lt;br/&gt;dollar spending to maintain it. Further, several catastrophic accidents have occurred in the past due to&lt;br/&gt;molten glass leaking from the furnaces. These catastrophic accidents resulted in death of several&lt;br/&gt;employees, significant financial damage and severe production disruption. Therefore, this project will&lt;br/&gt;enable safer manufacturing environment for the glass manufacturing industry since potential areas for&lt;br/&gt;molten glass leakages and structural health of furnace walls will be assessed with the 3?]D imaging&lt;br/&gt;technology being developed under this project. Lastly, this research will also lead to new design&lt;br/&gt;concepts for sensing through dispersive and high loss media in extremely high temperature&lt;br/&gt;environment, thus introducing new approaches for wireless sensing technologies in harsh environments.</AbstractNarration>
