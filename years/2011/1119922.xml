<AbstractNarration>Organic carbon, in the form of dissolved molecules transported in stream water, is processed for energy by microorganisms that live on the streambed. That processing constitutes a critical link in the global carbon cycle. The sources of much of the stream carbon are the upper layer of soils within small watersheds and algae that live in streams. Looking out over a drainage network, the investigators will explore how the quality of the organic molecules changes with distance downstream and how those changes influence the composition of the communities of streambed microbes using that food resource. To characterize the thousands of individual organic molecules dissolved in stream water and the vast diversity of microorganisms living in streams, the research team will exploit novel methods that link the new frontiers in molecular microbiology and analytical organic geochemistry. This proposal will be carried out in waters that range in size from small streams to small rivers within temperate and tropical forests. The research goals include advancing knowledge of stream ecosystems across drainage networks and forging a broad model of stream ecosystems in the global carbon cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the global carbon cycle is a critical scientific need of society and recent studies suggest that freshwater streams and rivers play a significant role within it. By better understanding the relationships between stream microorganisms and the organic carbon in freshwater streams, this study will contribute to our overall understanding of a key component of the global carbon cycle. Because microorganisms are invisible to the naked eye, getting students excited about the diversity of microorganisms and organic molecules and the complexity of their ecological interactions is difficult. The research team will develop educational materials that depict the basic concepts in microbiology and organic geochemistry with an emphasis on the vital roles that microorganisms play in aquatic ecosystems. At facilities within each of the study catchments the investigators and their educator colleagues will hold two-day summer teacher workshops to expose secondary school teacher to the microbial world of streams. The workshops will be timed to allow participants to mirror the field and laboratory activities of the scientists. In addition, 1 graduate student, 1 post-doctoral scientist, and 7 undergraduates will receive training during the project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The River Continuum Concept, developed in early 1980s, has provided an important conceptual model for river ecosystem research.

In using individual molecules as food, microorganisms can alter the chemical nature of dissolved organic matter.

In headwater streams, dissolved organic matter provides energy sources and building blocks for the microorganisms that are very important to the functioning of river ecosystems. In using individual molecules as food, microorganisms can alter the chemical nature of dissolved organic matter.

These are:  How does the composition of dissolved organic matter effect the community composition of steambed microorganisms? How does the community composition of steambed microorganisms effect the composition of stream water dissolved organic matter?  How do these relationships change with changing stream order (See Figure 2 for diagram explaining stream order).     Principle investigator Findlay?s role in this collaborative proposal was to direct a team that determined the structure of the streambed microbial communities.  Our main collaborators (and lead institution) was a research team at the Stroud Water Research Center and they were responsible for characterizing the stream water dissolved organic matter and the streambed bacterial communities.  Three well-characterized forested watersheds with streams ranging from the smallest streams (1st order) that constitute the beginnings of river systems through mid-sized rivers (5th order) were included in this study: Neversink in New York, White Clay Creek in Pennsylvania, and Rio Tempisquito in Costa Rica (Figures 3 and 4). Twelve successful sampling campaigns were conducted and a total of 492 samples were collected. A graduate student (T. Brannan) was excited to be able to travel to these sites to collect samples. The Findlay research team used a technique based on the chemical components membranes, phospholipids, to measure the amount of microorganisms present in each sample and to develop a "fingerprint" of each community.  The technique goes by the abbreviation of PLFA (or phospholipid fatty acid) analysis.  We were also responsible for aiding in the analysis of a series of stable (i.e., non-radioactive) isotope studies used to show consumption of stream water dissolved organic matter by microorganisms.  These studies go by the abbreviation of SIP (or stable isotope probing) and are usually hyphenated with the type of molecule used, such as PLFA-SIP or DNA-SIP.  A significant effort of this project is integrating the findings of the different research teams to answer the questions posed. Significant findings from the project include:  Stream waters from the different watersheds contained distinctive dissolved organic matter compositions. Streambed microbial communities from different watersheds were distinctive. Stream waters from 1st-order streams contained a greater number of unique dissolved organic matter molecules PLFA-SIP indicated that all heterotrophic microorganisms consumed stream water dissolved organic matter, although some microorganisms to a greater extent than others. DNA-SIP samples are still being processed but should add a greater taxonomic resolution to these studies. Dissolved organic matter from 1st-order streams was more readily consumed by steambed microorganisms than dissolved organic matter from 3rd-order stream water. This project is rewriting the roles of and interactions among streambed microorganisms and steam water dissolved organic matter within the River Continuum Concept.   This project has contributed to the education of three graduate students (two masters and one PhD).  One student is female and another was born in Nigeria (currently teaching in Ohio).  It allowed on student an opportunity to conduct field research in Pennsylvania, New York and Costa Rica.  Findlay was excited to share the results of this study with a group of ~40 citizens at the Oscher Lifelong Learning Institute, Tuscaloosa, AL.Its contributions to its general field include a significant modification the River Continuum Concept and further refinement of the stable isotope probing &ndash; in particular the use of complex 13C-labled dissolve organic matter (as opposed to a single compound such as glucose).  It?s greater understanding of dissolved organic matter will also contribute to our ability to provide safe drinking water in that dissolved organic matter is known to interact (many times in negative ways) with disinfectants during water purification processes.
