<AbstractNarration>The American Meteorological Society (AMS) Education Program is partnering with Second Nature, administrator of the American College and University President's Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), to implement the AMS Climate Studies course at 100 minority-serving institutions (MSIs) over a five-year period.  This project focuses on introducing and enhancing geoscience components of MSIs that are ACUPCC signatories and/or members of the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP).  During the first four years of the project, AMS is conducting a weeklong AMS Climate Studies course implementation workshop for about 25 MSI faculty members per year.  This workshop leverages the climate expertise of scientists from NOAA, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, University of Maryland, Howard University, George Mason University and other local climate educational and research institutions.  Faculty participants are immersed in the course materials, receive presentations from high-level speakers, and are trained as change agents for their local institutions.  Following the workshop, the faculty will work on their local campuses to expand geoscience curricula, thereby bringing change from within. They will offer AMS Climate Studies as an introductory geoscience course in the year following workshop attendance, and be encouraged to implement the AMS Weather Studies and AMS Ocean Studies courses.  AMS is conducting follow-up meetings with faculty as they work toward institutional geoscience curricula change.  The major outcomes of this project will be a large network of faculty trained to be change agents in their institutions, sustained offering of AMS undergraduate courses within MSIs, and the introduction of thousands of MSI students to the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>

The Project introduced the AMS Climate Studies introductory-level curriculum package in climate science and global climate change to 147 faculty members at 120 minority-serving institutions (MSIs).

Climate change is explored with proxy records from the past, observations in the present, and with climate models into the future, looking at both natural and human influence. AMS Climate Studies details how human energy use and policy affect climate change, as well as how we are affected by it and how society views climate change. Participating MSIs locally offer the course in face-to-face, blended, or completely online learning environments. &nbsp;With a focus on the most recent real-world climate data, the course is a primer for scientifically-literate participation in the discussion of climate change.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The AMS Climate Studies Diversity Project was based on the highly successful, NSF-supported AMS Weather Studies (2002-07) and AMS Ocean Studies (2005-09) Diversity Projects, which included 170 MSIs.

Many of the institutions that offered Weather and Ocean also have faculty who participated in the Climate Diversity Project.
