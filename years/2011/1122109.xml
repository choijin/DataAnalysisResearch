<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: Trypanosomes are kinetoplastid protozoa that contain a unique mitochondrial genome known as the kinetoplast (kDNA). When genes within the kDNA are expressed, the corresponding messenger RNAs that are synthesized are extensively edited in reactions directed by hundreds of small guide RNAs (gRNAs). This project concerns the maturation of these gRNAs. Precursor RNA molecules are synthesized that include multiple gRNAs, and these precursors are processed by unknown mechanisms and enzymes that precede editing. This research characterizes a novel enzyme termed mRPN1 (mitochondrial RNA precursor-processing endonuclease 1), which is required for efficient gRNA biogenesis in Trypanosoma brucei.  mRPN1 cleaves double-stranded RNA with a specificity that is reminiscent of bacterial RNase III and eukaryotic Dicer, and it forms a complex with three protein subunits, which is thought to facilitate entry of gRNA into the RNA editing pathway.  The role of mRPN1 and its associated subunits in the mRPN1 complex will be investigated.  Since gRNA biogenesis is virtually an unexplored field in trypanosome RNA biology, these studies should open new questions and potentially new paradigms in early divergent kinetoplastids. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This research involves a strong team of collaborators at Texas A&amp;M and other institutions, and its educational component directly impacts a graduate student, who is an ethnic minority, a postdoctoral fellow, and an undergraduate student. The findings will be communicated to the scientific community through the publication of data in prominent research journals, and at local and international meetings. The discovery of mRPN1 and its involvement in gRNA biogenesis was reported in the spring 2011 at both the Gordon Research Conference on RNA editing and the Kinetoplastid Molecular Cell Biology Meeting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ WHAT ARE TRYPANOSOMES? Trypanosomes and related organisms generally known as kinetoplastids are ancient single celled flagellates that diverged from other eukaryotic lineages 100-400 Ma and are known for several paradigms in biology, including antigenic variation, trans-splicing of nuclear polycistronic units, mitochondrial DNA replication and U insertion/deletion RNA editing. Nuclear and mitochondrial transcription is largely polycistronic, hence kinetoplastid gene expression is primarily regulated post transcriptionally making it fundamentally distinct from most organisms. These important organisms have a complex life cycle including insect (procyclic) and bloodstream forms. Infections with T. brucei are transmitted by tsetse flies and cause human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness.  WHAT IS THE CENTRAL QUESTION UNDER STUDY? This NSF funded research by the Cruz-Reyes lab addressed a dramatic processing of mRNAs in mitochondria involving specific and often extensive insertion and deletion of uridines. In T. brucei, this "RNA editing" remodels over 3000 sites in reactions directed by hundreds of small guide RNAs (~40-55 nt) that partially anneal to the  mRNA targets. The central editing enzyme, termed RNA editing core complex (RECC), exhibits substrate specificity and is controlled during the life cycle but its basic regulatory mechanisms remain a mystery. This study provided significant insights on the molecular basis of editing regulation in kinetoplastids.  WHAT WAS LEARNED?  Long-standing questions in the kinetoplastid RNA biology include: How does the RECC enzyme access the editing substrates and how is editing activity controlled? Importantly, purified RECC has little or no RNA and lacks the editing processivity found in vivo. To directly address these questions, this study focused on an accessory editing complex known as mitochondrial RNA binding complex 1 (MRB1) which contains gRNA and at least 25 proteins. MRB1 is essential in both life cycle stages and has received significant attention in recent years since inducible RNAi-based knockdown of several protein components inhibits editing. However, most of its proteins lack bioinformatically recognizable motifs, reflecting the early divergence of kinetoplastids. MRB1 was originally defined as a dynamic complex with gRNA and common and variable proteins. NSF-funded studies by the Cruz-Reyes lab generated important insights on the functional roles and physical organization of MRB1. The central contribution is a proposed new paradigm of RNA editing regulation, which opens new mechanistic questions, experimental approaches and moves the field forward.  This new model based on NSF-funded studies adds the following concepts:  (1) MRB1 complexes carry mRNA editing substrates and products, and serve as scaffolds for assembly of mRNA-gRNA hybrids and catalysis by RECC enzyme.  (2) mRNA and gRNA are partitioned into distinct RNP subcomplexes of MRB1: a regulatory mRNP (including mRNA, REH2 and specific protein cofactors) and structural gRNPs variants (with gRNA and several proteins) (Fig 1)   This model and supporting data were reported at the Gordon Research Conference on RNA editing (2015), Kinetoplastid Molecular Cell Biology (2015), and Molecular Parasitology Meeting (2015), also in two published papers and a paper submitted for publication.   BROADER IMPACTS OF PROPOSED WORK. These NSF funds supported one Research Scientist, and two Ph.D. students. Vikas Kumar will graduate with a Ph.D. by mid 2016, and Damien Terry (African American) graduated with a non-thesis master degree. Eight undergraduate students (including ethnic minority from campus at TAMU) worked on this project. A Hispanic student (Irene Martinez) came under the NSF-REU program, and two students funded by sources in South Korea and India, respectively. A few high school students participated in the project during the summer. Dr. Cruz-Reyes directly supervised these students to implement lab safety gu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
