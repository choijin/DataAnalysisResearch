<AbstractNarration>All organisms must allocate limited resources towards competing functions. These functions can be grouped into two broad categories: reproduction and self-maintenance. Reproduction can increase fitness through production of offspring, whereas self-maintenance can increase fitness by improving survival to a time in the future when the individual can reproduce. One central factor influencing strategies of investment in reproduction or self-maintenance is "reproductive value", or the relative fitness benefit of current versus future reproduction. We currently do not understand the mechanisms allowing animals to adaptively allocate resources to reproduction and self-maintenance in the face of changing environmental conditions, resource availability, and reproductive value. Glucocorticoids, or stress hormones, are crucial for maintaining energetic balance, and might play an important role in mediating allocation to reproduction and self-maintenance. This project will test three hypotheses about the role of glucocorticoids in mediating resource allocation through experimental manipulations of glucocorticoids, reproductive effort, and blood parasites in free-ranging Tree Swallows. Results of this work will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying variation in reproduction and survival and the evolution of strategies of resource allocation. This information is valuable because it will improve our understanding of evolution and physiology, and will also have implications for management of species of conservation concern. Glucocorticoid levels increase in response to habitat disturbance, and so, an understanding of how these hormones affect reproduction and survival can inform our understanding of dynamics of populations in disturbed habitat. Finally, because glucocorticoids are found in all vertebrates, including humans, the findings from this study might have important implications for human health.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The major goal of the project was to understand the role of glucocorticoid hormones in regulating the allocation of resources between current reproduction and long-term survival. These hormones, commonly called stress hormones, regulate the behavior and physiology of vertebrate animals in response to energetic demands and challenging conditions and situations. The balance of investment in current reproduction and long-term survival is critical for determining an individual&rsquo;s lifetime reproductive success (i.e., its fitness). The optimal strategy for investment in survival and reproduction varies depending on the environment an individual confronts, and so an individual must integrate both external environmental and internal physiological cues to attempt to match its life history strategy to its conditions. Glucocorticoid hormones have long been thought to play a central role in this process, but the manner in which they regulate investment in reproduction and survival is still unclear. We originally proposed two hypotheses to test as part of this project:&nbsp;<strong>the Life History Tradeoff (LHT) Hypothesis</strong>&ndash; Increasing baseline glucocorticoids induce the reallocation of resources to survival and reproduction independent of current environmental and internal conditions, and the<strong>Context-Dependent Tradeoff (CDT) Hypothesis</strong>&ndash; Increasing baseline glucocorticoids induce the reallocation of resources to survival and reproduction in a context-dependent manner that varies with current environmental and internal conditions. We tested these hypotheses in two systems, tree swallows and red-winged blackbirds, and found some support for the CDT hypothesis. We found that how swallows respond to environmental challenges depends on their current glucocorticoid levels. Individuals with experimentally elevated levels of glucocorticoids abandoned their nests more quickly, in response to a storm, than individuals with low glucocorticoid levels. Further we found that reproductive effort can be related to glucocorticoid levels, but the direction of that relationship can change from negative to positive across stages of breeding. Female tree swallows with higher glucocorticoids duringthe incubation period lay lighter clutches, but just a few weeks later, females with higher glucocorticoids during the nestling period are the ones that laid heavier clutches of eggs. Using an approach that integrated across numerous physiological and condition-related indices in breeding tree swallows, we found evidence that oxidative stress and telomere length predicted reproductive investment and survival. Interestingly, in this study, we did not find that glucocorticoids were related to these other physiological or fitness-related traits. With the red-winged blackbirds we found that how an individual responds to being parasitized (does it tolerate or resist the infection) also depends on its glucocorticoid levels. Individuals with naturally elevated glucocorticoid levels had a greater tolerance of infection by malarial parasites. However, when we experimentally elevated glucocorticoids, individuals had both diminished tolerance and resistance to malarial infections. We also found that female red-winged blackbirds with naturally elevated glucocorticoid levels laid lighter clutches of eggs, and spent less time incubating those eggs. In this study, glucocorticoids were not predictive of reproductive success. In summary, our work has helped to advance our understanding of the role of glucocorticoids in regulating behavior and physiology and thus, ultimately, fitness,.
