<AbstractNarration>This project supports the participation of Arctic indigenous scholars in the United Nations and Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) joint workshop on Indigenous Peoples, Marginalized Populations and Climate Change: Vulnerability, Adaptation and Traditional Knowledge to be held in Mexico City, 19-21 July, 2011. The focus of the workshop is to ensure that indigenous peoples' perspectives on global environmental change and their adaptation strategies are fully taken into account in the next IPCC Assessment report. The purpose of this specific request is to ensure that Arctic indigenous people have a chance not only to interact with scientific community to discuss issues of global environmental change, but also to relate their own experiences, challenges, and strategies for ensuring the long term sustainability of their communities in the Arctic. The proposed funding is entirely in Participant Support Costs and will support the travel and participation of Arctic indigenous scholars to the workshop.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop provided a key opportunity to ensure that experience, sources of information and knowledge (scientific, indigenous and local), along with data and literature (scientific and grey), focusing on vulnerable and marginalized regions of the world will be made available to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report authors and the global community.  Key outputs include:  1.   Publication of a comprehensive meeting report "Indigenous Peoples, Marginalized Populations and Climate Change: Vulnerability, Adaptation and Traditional Knowledge. Proceedings of Indigenous Peoples, Marginalized Populations and Climate Change. Mexico City, Mexico 19&ndash;21 July 2011". The report on workshop proceedings includes key summaries of presentations and is available from http://www.unutki.org/news.php?news_id=128&amp;doc_id=102;  2.  Fifty presentations made at the workshop considering the role of traditional knowledge of indigenous/marginal populations in addressing climate change. Written abstracts were incorporated into booklets made available in English and Spanish, oral presentations on adaptation were made available in English and Spanish through professional interpretation and PowerPoint files from presenters were made available on our website. Further information is available at http://www.unutki.org/default.php?doc_id=200.  3.  Incorporation of workshop presenters input into a pilot database and multi-lingual knowledge portal of best practices, methodologies and case studies of traditional knowledge-scientific knowledge co-creation for enhancing climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts.  4.  Publication of an authoritative academic and technical report on the interaction between traditional and scientific knowledge creation in climate change titled "Weathering Uncertainty: Traditional Knowledge for Climate Change Assessment and Adaptation". This book provides an overview of the published scientific literature (primarily peer-reviewed, but also gray literature) relating to the contribution of traditional or indigenous knowledge to our understanding of global climate change: observations, impacts and opportunities for adaptation.

This report is available from http://www.unutki.org/news.php?news_id=135&amp;doc_id=101.  5.  Creation of various education materials for key stakeholders (e.g. funders, United Nations agencies, research institutions, local communities) on establishing and sustaining processes that lead to equitable, reciprocal and respectful traditional knowledge-scientific knowledge co-creation. This includes articles (e.g. http://unu.edu/publications/articles/why-traditional-knowledge-holds-the-key-to-climate-change.html) and videos (e.g. ?Land Use and Adaptation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzBQZwpRhI0&amp;feature=relmfu).
