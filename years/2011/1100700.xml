<AbstractNarration>This research project aims to identify the related material processing parameters, feasibility of scaling up CNT coated filler production to create relatively large samples and develop/extend suitable mechanical characterization methods to study the behavior of the composites under static and dynamic loading conditions.  Creation and characterization of novel, cost-effective, lightweight, structured, particle-filled polymer foams is the primary goal of this research.  The resulting composites based on  microwave radiation could offer hierarchical materials where carbon nanotubes (CNT) grown directly on hollow microfillers improve the ability of the filler to anchor to the matrix by enhancing tensile/fracture characteristics without compromising the compression properties,  circumventing agglomeration effects, and/or improving electrical characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, it is conceivable that a new class of engineered particulate composites can be introduced based on this research.  Multifunctional lightweight structural foams and composites are of great value in a variety of engineering applications including aerospace, transportation and marine industries.  Additional societal benefits of the proposed research include education of graduate students in multidisciplinary areas of processing and characterization of materials.  Students from underrepresented groups will be attracted to this research through existing on-campus programs at Auburn.  Also K-12 outreach resources will be utilized to expose students to aspects of microscopy and mechanical testing.  A display will be presented during graduate recruitment events to attract domestic students to engineering programs at Auburn.  The findings of the research will be disseminated through topical symposia as well as archival publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview: Development and mechanical characterization of novel, cost-effective, lightweight, nanostructured, and particulate composites was the primary goal of this research.  Creating organic and inorganic microscale substrates (e.g., ceramic microballoons, milled fibers) covered with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown directly on them using microwave irradiation was among the novelties.  The hypothesis of this research was that if such hierarchical micro-/nano-fillers are uniformly dispersed into a polymer matrix, it would result in a novel composite with improved mechanical properties.  The improvements would be a direct result of (a) the ability of the filler to anchor to the matrix better due to high surface area offered by the CNTs, and (b) avoiding filler agglomeration normally encountered when dealing with the dispersion of nano-particles.  As a result the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and fracture toughness of the composite would be improved. The project also aimed at material processing parameters, feasibility of scaling up CNT coated fillers to create relatively large samples to conduct mechanical characterization under static and dynamic loading conditions.  Technical Outcome: Among the successful outcomes of the project was the production of micro-/nano-fillers covered with CNTs using the proposed microwave irradiation approach.  Hierarchical micro-/nano-fillers were attempted using soda-lime glass microballoons (solid and hollow), milled glass fibers and milled carbon fibers.  These substrates were coated with conducting polymers before subjecting to microwave irradiation in a commercial microwave oven in the presence of a catalyst (ferrocene) for approximately 30 seconds.  This resulted in CNT growth on the substrate and coverage ranged between 30-50%.  Examples of good CNT coverage on different substrates are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. They demonstrate the feasibility of the method developed during this research.  Substrates such as solid microballoons and milled glass fibers showed a tendency to fuse together during the microwaving phase due to the resulting high temperatures and the CNT growth on individual particles varied significantly between batches.  Although hierarchical filler processing was scalable, repeatability of the process in terms of CNT coverage were found less reliable. Agglomeration of CNT-grown fillers was an additional difficulty encountered during this project as well (see, Fig. 3).   Another successful outcome was the development of an experimental methodology for characterizing fracture behavior of particle-filled composites due to high strain rate loading and high spatio-temporal resolution.  An impact loading facility involving an instrumented Hopkinson bar was developed for use in conjunction with the digital image correlation (DIC) method and ultrahigh-speed photography (see, Fig. 4).  The feasibility of the experimental methodology was demonstrated on conventional particulate composites (milled glass fiber-filled epoxy) and examined relative to unfilled material (Fig. 5).  Representative pre- and post-crack initiation stress intensity factor histories are shown in Fig. 6. Similar experiments were conducted on conventional and hierarchical composites developed using microwave irradiation approach.  The results are shown in Fig. 7 for the case of a hollow microballoon filled epoxy (also called syntactic foam, or simply SF).  The results suggest hierarchical composites with CNT decoration improve the dynamic fracture performance.  However, the enhancements are relatively modest at the moment due to the difficulties in terms of CNT coverage, filler fusion and continued agglomeration effects.  Broader Impact: Lightweight structural foams and composites are of great value in a variety of engineering applications including aerospace, transportation and marine industries.
