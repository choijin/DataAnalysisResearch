<AbstractNarration>Enhanced Porosity Concrete (EPC) is a relatively new class of concrete having higher than normal porosity and pore connectivity, thus facilitating applications such as storm water runoff control, and highway noise mitigation.  The fundamental objective of this CAREER proposal is to link the pore structure features and performance of EPC to its material design parameters through a multi-disciplinary approach that involves stereological methods, fracture properties, porous media flow, and mathematical optimization.  Geometrical data from two dimensional EPC images will be stereologically interpreted using stochastic geometry, and a novel porosity prediction method based on particle packing theory developed to establish correlations between material design parameters and pore structure features.  Pore structure features will be related to: (i) mechanical behavior using a fracture criterion that involves both toughness and strength, thus providing an understanding of the competition between crack-blunting and higher void fraction, (ii) permeability using X-ray tomography, three-dimensional reconstruction of planar images, and fractal models, and (iii) pollutant retention efficiency using multi-phase flow theories and reconstructed models.  Since EPC systems need to be designed for more than one performance requirement, a multi-objective optimization procedure will be used to arrive at a feasible set of material design parameters. This will facilitate the development of relationships between material design and performance through the pore structure features. &lt;br/&gt;This CAREER proposal will result in a much needed performance-based design methodology for EPC systems, and enable predictions of performance. This will aid in the development of test methods to determine EPC properties, and will facilitate the transition of EPC design to a scientific process from the currently employed trial and error methods.  The educational plan in this proposal is strongly tied with the research component through problem-based design and learning, development of a teaching lab course, and K-12 outreach program.  A conceive-implement-design-operate (CDIO) approach will be used to put the problem-based learning and design into practice where the students will be responsible for designing, constructing, and evaluating a few small EPC test bed systems.  A teaching lab course, where the undergraduate students can do research on structured topics related to cement-based materials will be developed.  The existing GK-12 program at Clarkson will be used as a vehicle to emphasize hands-on activities and engineering problem solving to middle and high school students using EPC as a model porous engineering material, thus integrating research and outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
