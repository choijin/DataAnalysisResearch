<AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support of a workshop titled, "Data-at-Risk: Developing a Plan for Preserving Astronomy's Archival Records". The goal of the workshop is to bring together the world's experts on non-electronic astronomy archival data where they will develop a Plan of Action that will promote the preservation of irreplaceable data. The PI notes that there are over 3 million glass plates or films currently in archives with over half of that data being stored in North America. These archives contain both imaging and spectroscopic data that extends back roughly 120 years. The archives represent a rich resource for long-term variability studies and offer scientific information that cannot be otherwise obtained. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless positive action is undertaken soon most of the data in these archives, particularly those being stored in non-optimal conditions, will simply not survive the next decade. The broader impacts of the proposal are inherent in the preservation of the data archives. The impact of data preservation has the potential to affect all facets of observational astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

The second day began by dividing the participants into small groups tasked with discussing six specific topics deemed critical in developing the preservation plan. The final session was a culminating general discussion on what the plan should include and on how to proceed with implementing it. Detailed notes of the discussions, decisions and recommendations were kept and circulated after the workshop to the participants.   The main outcomes of the Workshop was the determination on the general features that the preservation plan should contain. It was agreed that:   The prime objective of the Plan will be to preserve heritage materials that constitute observational records and their metadata on behalf of the astronomical (or wider) community and to have it in a readily accessible and scientifically useful form in order to enable the production of new science. A secondary objective will be to preserve records that are of historical interest.   To realize the objectives, the following activities will be the key parts of the Plan:  (a) Identify the items and collections covered by the Plan.

Exclude instruments, documents of purely historical nature, and data routinely archived elsewhere (e.g., by NASA, by the American Association of Variable Star Observers).   (b) Establish protocols and standards for the preservation of the materials and, where necessary, their conversion to electronic form.

(c) Develop standardized systems for classification, organization and listings of holdings of archival data.

A more formal group is needed to oversee the work on the Plan and putting it into operation. The first step in implementation therefore will be to prepare a proposal for the creation of a Working Group for Time Domain Astronomy (WGTDA) under the auspices of the American Astronomical Society; a committee was selected to prepare a proposal. The proposed WGTDA will be charged initially to (a) finalize the Plan and prepare a document that describes it and which is suitable for general distribution, (b) disseminate the plan to ob...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
