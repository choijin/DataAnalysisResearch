<AbstractNarration>This project is co-funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) and Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Programs in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: This project is on synthesis, spectroscopy and dynamic studies of colloidal quantum dots and represents a comprehensive effort to evaluate the photophysics of colloidal dots in the mid-infrared spectral range from 3 to 10 micrometers. The research uses quantum confinement to create mid-infrared electronic transitions. The materials are the semimetal HgTe and the wide band gap semiconductors Cd(Te, Se, S). HgTe becomes a tunable mid-infrared gap semiconductor at small sizes while the Cd(Te, Se, S) colloidal dots have strong intraband transitions in this mid-infrared spectral range. The effects of confinement on energy relaxation, thermal properties, and low- and high-excitation levels are investigated by using picosecond mid-infrared time-resolved laser spectroscopy. Ligands on the colloidal dots introduce coupling of the infrared electronic excitations to molecular vibrations. Processing is developed to eliminate or reduce the effect of organic ligands, which will allow slower phonon relaxation and Auger processes, facilitating photodetection and lasing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials research, with potential technological impacts. Success of the research will expand our fundamental understanding of the infrared properties of colloidal quantum dots in a spectral range from 3 to 10 micrometers. Potential applications of these quantum dots include infrared photodetector and lasers. Infrared detection is useful for thermal imaging and molecular detection. Infrared lasers are useful for spectral analysis of atmospheric contaminants and telecommunications. In this project, graduate and undergraduate students are trained in an interdisciplinary environment that combines materials science, physics, and chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The infrared spectrum is used for molecular fingerprinting, night vision and astronomical detection of molecules on far way worlds, through the earth atmosphere. It is a fascinating region of the optical spectrum at our fingertips.  Current detection technology are based on expensive ultrasensitive cryogenically cooled crystalline semiconductors or low sensitivity bolometers.  One key material is HgCdTe, a ternary semiconducctor where the wavelength of detection is determined by the composition ratio of Hg and Cd.   The NSF grant supported research on an alternative materials based on colloidal nanocrystals of the binary Hg chalcogenides semi metals.  The work pionneered HgTe, HgSe and HgS colloidal quantum dots, where simply tuning the size leads to the shift of the wavelength of detection.    Further research on these materials allowed to demonstrate infrared detection using photoconductive and photovoltaic modes, covering the particularly important regions of the 3-5 microns and 8-12 microns which are where the atmosphere is transparent and infrared imaging is most effective.   This had never been done before with colloidal semiconductors.  The research achieved other unprecedented results as well.  This includes the first evidence of the carrier doping in ambient conditions, in the lowest quantum dot states, and as a result, the first observation of intraband photoconductivity and photoluminescence in any colloidal semiconductor system.   Furthermore, the doping was demonstrated to be sensitive to the surface composition, leading to a novel and general approach to doping nanostuctures.   Funding from the NSF grant allowed the scientific breakthroughs.  These are now being transitionned to research in industry in an effort ot make a new generation of infrared devices that will combine the high sensitivity of crystalline materials with the low cost and higher operation temperature possible with the colloidal quantum dots, and it is this grant that allowed and motivated this transition.
