<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professors Carlos R. Cabrera at University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, Professor Yi Jia at University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez and their groups are developing a Label-Free Electrochemical Capacitance DNA Sensing with Passive Wireless Radio Frequency Identification Sensor Technology. Detection and characterization of DNA immobilization and hybridization processes are important in many applications including environmental monitoring and biomedical sensing. Current techniques for DNA detection and characterization often requires sophisticated equipment and complicated sample treatment. The supported research focuses studies on DNA capacitive sensing mechanism and the DNA/surface interfacial conformational characterization during DNA immobilization and hybridization processes with passive wireless integrated RFID sensor technologies, with the aims of developing an innovative, low cost lab-on-a-chip DNA sensing technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of the proposed low-cost, label-free DNA sensing technology will enable the use of the device for different diseases (e.g. tuberculosis) or hazardous materials (e.g. anthrax) detection at point of care, such as at home or clinic. The proof-of-concept preparation of the label-free wireless RFID biosensor will create spin-offs that may benefit our students and society. In addition to the specific scientific contribution and technological advances that will be the direct result of the proposed research, this work will improve human society by broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in an important area of biosensor technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will benefit the University of Puerto Rico by reinforcing existing biosensor research and educational programs in the areas of wireless sensor and integrated sensing technology, provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and enhance competitive research capability at UPR. The project will also impact the society by disseminating the new scientific knowledge, technological innovation, and educational course materials through conferences, journals, project website and open house for K-12 students and teachers. The students participating in the proposed project will be of Puerto Rican origin, and thus the requested funding will lead to an increase in the number of Hispanic and women students pursuing advanced degrees and professional careers in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our research project is focused on the developing of a biosensor technology for DNA hybridization or elongation detection. Specifically, the primary goal is to contribute with an interdigitated gold microelectrodes array design that may perform test in patients and to develop a point-of-care biosensing system. The most used method to develop this type of biosensor is using self-assembled monolayer (SAMs). Gold surface modification with SAMs changes the electrochemical capacitive behavior of their surface that can be measured by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).&nbsp; The use of this technology offers several advantages over existing technologies: it will be robust, non-invasive, inexpensive, flexible, small, and less complicated than existing technologies and will help us to detect early signs of the disease, in a short period of time with high efficiency. In addition, by avoiding the use of optical sensors we can provide a DNA microchip biosensor for complex or unpurified biofluid samples commonly encountered in remote and underdeveloped communities, in a hospital operation room (OR) or in medical office. All these features will have a tremendous impact on biochemical sciences since it will fill the existing absence of methods that can detect DNA in a direct readout at the point-of-care location. The incorporation of integrated antenna for readout of DNA sensing is the foremost goal. The main outcome has been the development of a telomerase cancer bioelectrochemical sensor by using our biosensor design. This biosensor has been done using an electrochemical interdigital design developed in our laboratory and prepared at the&nbsp;NSF-NSEC Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing (Grant No. CHM-CMMI-0531171). A patent application was submitted titled "Electrochemical Impedimetric Biosensing Microchip for Real Time Telomerase Activity Detection", Application No.: 62/089,290.&nbsp;Our team, through the NSF-I-Corps program learned about the possibility of commercialization of our biosensor for telomerase activity measurements as a way to detect endometrial Cancer.
