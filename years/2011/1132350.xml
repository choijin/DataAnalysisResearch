<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the 31st annual meeting of the Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conferences on Differential Equations (SEARCDE), held October 21-22, 2011 at Georgia State University. The conference financially supports participation by students and recent Ph.D. recipients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting includes plenary lectures on topics of current research interest and also especially encourages lectures by students and recent Ph.D. recipients. The conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research in differential equations, with emphasis on providing opportunities for new researchers to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
