<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The Nanoelectronic Devices for Defense &amp; Security (NANO-DDS)&lt;br/&gt;Conference is a bi-annual science and technology event which has been organized for the&lt;br/&gt;purpose of reviewing the evolving research and development (R&amp;D) activities in the&lt;br/&gt;arena of nanoelectronic devices that have direct relevance to critical capability needs for&lt;br/&gt;national defense &amp; security in the future. The charter of this special conference is to unify&lt;br/&gt;and focus the very broad array of nanoelectronic and supporting nanotechnology&lt;br/&gt;activities that are currently engaged in reaching the long expected applications payoffs in&lt;br/&gt;core defense and security related areas such as sensing, data processing, computation and&lt;br/&gt;communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The inherent multidisciplinary nature of the nanoscale science &amp;&lt;br/&gt;technology (Nano-S&amp;T) field and the potential for impacting high priority objectives&lt;br/&gt;motivate the unique organization of this 2011 conference. The conference will support participation of many new faculty and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

All of the supported attendees participated in the technical program of the conference.  The conference has been organized as a formal bi-annual meeting for the purpose of reviewing research and development (R&amp;D) activities in the arena of nanoelectronic devices that have direct relevance to critical capability needs for national Defense &amp; Security in the future. The charter of this special conference is to unify and focus the very broad array of nanoelectronic and supporting nanotechnology activities that are currently engaged in reaching the long expected applications payoffs in core defense and security related areas such as sensing, data processing, computation and communications.  The scientific and technological information and the resulting nanoscale devices and systems Roadmap was widely disseminated throughout academia/universities, government and industrial institutions and the public at-large (including the entire international community). The attendee program that was supported by the NSF funding was very successful in bringing young researchers to the NANO-DDS Conference which both broadened the academic experience of the attendees and provided an education opportunity for future scientists and engineers.  Thus, the participation of students and young faculty truly enhanced the technical program at the meeting.          Last Modified: 12/12/2012       Submitted by: Carl P Tripp]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
