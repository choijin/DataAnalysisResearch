<AbstractNarration>The Microbiology &amp; Cell Science Department at the University of Florida (UF) and Miami Dade College (the largest minority-serving institution in the country; MDC) are collaborating on an innovative project that develops a bridge program where students receiving their AA degree from MDC progress to their BS degree at UF.  The program is designed to overcome many of the barriers that often reduce broadening participation in STEM by students who often lack the resources or interest in relocating to geographic locations where STEM educational opportunities are better developed.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although innovative, the project includes commonly implemented best practices to improve minority retention in STEM fields such as peer to peer tutoring, career mentoring, undergraduate scholarships, and undergraduate research.  Activities with a demonstrated impact on retention and success become a permanent feature of the Distance Education program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The UF-MDC partnership represents the cornerstone of the Microbiology &amp; Cell Science Department's Distance Education program as the program expands statewide by developing partnerships with other 2-yr institutions over the next three years.  This project tests an innovative approach to developing a bridge degree program that brings a research university curriculum to the students in their community.  In doing so, the project is providing much needed data addressing important and contemporary questions concerning the efficacy of distance learning and the role that technology should play in the education of our nation's undergraduates.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Because MDC is in an urban environment with diverse communities of students, including many from background underrepresented in the STEM fields, the project is preparing and developing a much larger talent pool of undergraduates that have an interest in STEM (but who otherwise may not have the opportunity) by implementing a program that is designed to offer educational opportunities and meet their needs closer to home.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This STEP award had two fundamental long-term major goals representing its <strong>intellectual merit</strong>: 1.) to increase the number of students receiving their Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in life sciences and 2.) to increase the diversity of individuals receiving their BS in life sciences.&nbsp; To accomplish these goals, the Microbiology &amp; Cell Science (MCS) department at UF developed an innovative online 2+2 transfer program that begins with a student receiving their Associates in Arts degree from a two-year institution and then transferring to the MCS online BS degree program. This program is called the Distance Education Microbiology and Cell Science B.S. program at the University of Florida, which will be referred to as DE MCS program. This award supported students through best practices such as scholarships, undergraduate research experiences, and peer-led tutoring to increase recruitment, success and retention in the program. A <strong>broader impact</strong> of this award was to collect and analyze data to demonstrate a new model of a 2 + 2 transfer program that uses distance education as a way to increase access, retention, and diversity in STEM.&nbsp;Two Hispanic-serving Institutions, Miami Dade College and Valencia College, were key partners in this project.</p> <p>This award had several outcomes in support of its three main goals. To increase the number of students receiving their B.S. degrees, 136 MCS undergraduates received $1200 STEP scholarships for each semester they maintained eligibility, and 85% of the STEP scholarship cohort were transfer students enrolled in the DE MCS program. Through the life of the award, 77% of the STEP-funded DE MCS students were retained (61% of the STEP award students in the DE MCS program have graduated and 16.5% are currently still enrolled). This retention level is higher than the 2-year and 4-year retention rates in the DE MCS program: 68% and 57%, respectively. &nbsp;The completion rate translates to 70 current graduates from the DE MCS program.

The STEP-funded students with undergraduate research also had higher GPAs than those without undergraduate research experiences (3.5 GPA vs. 3.26). Previous research by others has shown that undergraduate research enhances academic success and retention in traditional face-to-face STEM programs. This STEP project shows that the benefits of undergraduate research extend to other settings including this hybrid online transfer program.</p> <p>Post-graduate outcomes are difficult to track, but we used data from the National Student Clearinghouse to identify students who had received any type of degree or certification post-B.S. degree.

Seventy-percent of the STEP-supported students were female and fifty-three percent of the students were from racial/ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM. Although the DE MCS cohort is more diverse than on-campus programs, the STEP award enhanced the participation even above DE MCS levels (65% women and 45% underrepresented minority students). &nbsp;Of the 70 STEP-funded graduates to date, over half are URM students with 35% being women of color.
