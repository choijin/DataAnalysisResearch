<AbstractNarration>Cognitive robotics has been identified as a research area of common interest to Japan and the US; in addition, it is of mutual benefit to both countries to explore areas for collaborative work where each side brings complementary strength to the project. Moreover, there is already a good start in collaborative research among some US-Japan roboticists. We propose to propel this joint cooperative research to a higher level of impact by holding a joint NSF-JST workshop which brings together the best researchers from both countries and have them discuss and exchange ideas about the most opportune research directions, then work at a deeper level on some specific challenges in these areas in order to be well-positioned for a next round of collaborative funding opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop has the potential to result not only in new research directions which could ultimately impact many industries (e.g., elderly care, logistics, security, medical, exploration, monitoring, etc.), but also lead to broader international opportunities for faculty and students. The goal is to have the results of this workshop result in high-impact collaborative US-Japan research with student and faculty exchanges and long-term visits. This renders our students and faculty more globally aware and competitive.</AbstractNarration>
