<AbstractNarration>It is now recognized that long-lived (detachment) faults and the formation of core complexes are common, accounting for ~50% of the extension along 2500 km of the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Not only do detachment faults allow the architecture of the lower ocean crust and upper mantle to be examined, but they change the way we think about the very composition and structure of ocean crust, fluid flow, and hydrothermal venting and associated ecology. But many critical questions remain: Why does a fault continue to extend, rolling over to form a core complex, while another stops after extending only for a short time? Is detachment fault formation associated with overall and/or local magma budget? Are adjacent detachments linked? The goal of this project is to try to answer these questions. In particular, to 1) constrain the processes controlling the formation, evolution, and linking of mid-segment detachment faults and; 2) examine the relationship between magma supply along the ridge axis and detachment fault formation. the chosed study area near 16.5 degrees N at the MAR presents a dramatic demonstration of a new mid-segment detachment fault near to the axis interrupting the overall development of a longer, older and still active detachment fault whose breakaway is farther off-axis. The PIs plan is to obtain regional multibeam bathymetry and magnetic data to understand the spreading history out to 5 Ma. High-resolution multibeam bathymetry, magnetic, CTD and optical sensor data will be collected from the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Sentry, and photographs from the WHOI Towcam. These data will be used to characterize the detachment faults and their terminations, assessing where they are active and examining how they might link along the axis. The data also will allow assessment of the nature of volcanism at the axis. A dredging program will confirm the inferences made from bathymetric analysis as to the mantle, plutonic or volcanic origin of basement, how crustal architecture varies across the region, and will establish the degree to which the regional magma supply has been constant over detachment fault formation and possible relationships to local magma supply variations. This work will place strong constrains on models for detachment fault formation and its relationship to magma supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed study addresses several issues identified by the community at the AGU Chapman Conference ?Detachments in Oceanic Lithosphere: Deformation,Magmatism, Fluid Flow, and Ecosystems? as critical to move forward our understanding of faulting at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges. The project has a component of international cooperation through the participation of J. Escartin and his graduate student (IPGP, Paris) and H. Zhou (Tonji University, China). Three MIT/WHOI Joint Program students will receive sea-going&lt;br/&gt;experience, and two of them will collect data that will contribute to their PhD theses. W. Zhu and two undergraduate students from U. Maryland will participate on the cruise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During normal magmatic spreading at slow-spreading ridges such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, faults that border the ridge axis slip a few hundred meters before the faults are abandoned and carried away from the axis. New faults then initiate closer to the ridge axis resulting in a series of linear faults on the ridge flanks.  Long-lived faults (detachment faults) also form at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge and can reach horizontal offsets of 10s to &gt;100 km. Long-lived detachment faults are important because they exhume lower crust and upper mantle rocks to the seafloor and thus, provide information on the nature and variability of the oceanic crust. Detachment faults are also an integral part of the hydraulic system that controls fluid flow and hydrothermal venting and thus, the composition of vent fluids and their associated ecosystems.   It is known that detachment faulting generates broad portions of seafloor in the slow-spreading Atlantic, but scientists have been unable to estimate their full extent because of a limited understanding of the different styles of detachment faulting. Our multifaceted study of the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 16.5&ordm;N provided many new insights into detachment faulting and have been published in peer-reviewed journals. We identified different styles of detachment faults including massifs with corrugations on the fault surface, non-corrugated massifs, and steep-sided ridges marking the tops of the detachment faults. In addition, the high-resolution data we collected revealed one other detachment morphology that we had not seen before; a low-angle, irregular surface in the regional bathymetry was shown to be a finely corrugated detachment fault. In our study area, active detachment faulting currently is limited to the western side of the ridge axis. However, we found detachment fault morphologies over a large portion of the eastern flank of the ridge axis as well, indicating that within the last 5 Ma detachment faulting has dominated this region. Also, for the first time we used near-bottom CHIRP profiles, which provide cross-sectional images of shallow sediment cover, to demonstrate that a detachment fault bordering the ridge axis is actively slipping.   The formation of detachment faults is likely dependent on a balance between several factors, but magma supply to the ridge axis has always been considered a key variable.  Numerical modeling suggests that detachment faults form when magma supply is less than that supplied during normal magmatic spreading.  In our study area, however, we observed active detachment faulting bordering a ridge axis with robust volcanic activity.  Thus, the true relationship between magma supply and faulting style is probably not simple.  These results provide important constraints for further modeling of spreading at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges.  Five graduate students (4 international and 1 U.S.) participated on the research cruise and obtained valuable sea going experience.  Four of these students now have their Ph.D.  One of them, currently a postdoc at the University of Cambridge was lead author on a paper published in a peer-reviewed journal and is currently writing a second paper using the data we collected.  Three U.S. undergraduate students participated on the cruise and also gained sea going experience. One of these undergraduate students has entered the MIT/WHOI Joint Program as a graduate student and is working on the rock samples we collected. Another of the undergraduate students did his Senior Research Paper at the University of Maryland using data from the cruise and is now a graduate student at University of California, Santa Barbara.  He is currently writing up his results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and will be lead author on the paper.  The data collected have been submitted to data archives and are publically available.              Last Modified: 09/08/2015       Submitted by: Deborah K Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
