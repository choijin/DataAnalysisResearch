<AbstractNarration>The mission of the Materials Interdisciplinary Research Team (MIRT) is to investigate the unusual properties of transition-metal oxides while producing a next generation of scientists and engineers well-trained in the area of advanced materials. The MIRT integrates materials researchers at the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) and the University of Virginia with educational outreach programs involving K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MIRT consisting of leading scientists with diverse theoretical and experimental expertise will investigate transition-metal oxides on three fronts: (i) developing a thorough and deep understanding of the change of d-electron properties from bulk to surface, which is critical for catalytic as well as insertion-compound electrodes for electrochemical energy conversion and storage, (ii) addressing strategically the long-standing problem of the localized to itinerant electronic transition, which is relevant to high-transition-temperature superconductivity and to the solid-state theory of magnetic interactions in orbitally disordered systems, and (iii) synthesizing new transition-metal oxides by novel approaches including high-pressure synthesis, soft chemistry synthesis, and growing high-quality crystals exhibiting exotic physical and chemical properties. The MIRT also focuses on emerging research topics such as oxide topological insulators, which includes exploring new magneto-optical effects in a sandwiched structure consisting of a topological insulator and a ferromagnetic layer, superconductivity, and new quantum states with potential application for quantum computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental understanding of the unusual surface and bulk properties of transition-metal oxides is anticipated to have a profound impact on new materials development for the next generation of electronic and electrochemical energy devices. The project will establish broad collaborations with scientists at synchrotron and neutron facilities in the U.S. and abroad. The project would provide research training to graduate students with advanced equipment/facilities and specialized coursework that offers an interdisciplinary view of the physics, chemistry, and materials science phenomena that drive the key outstanding questions addressed by this MIRT. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graduate-undergraduate research environment, through the Graduates Linked with Undergraduates in Engineering (GLUE) program in partnership with the Women in Engineering Program (WEP) at the University of Texas, will provide not only a graduate-level research environment for female undergraduates, but also career and professional development. The planned recruiting and mentoring of Hispanic undergraduates will motivate them to pursue graduate studies in advanced materials. The undergraduates will receive hands-on training on various instruments available as shared user facilities or in the MIRT faculty laboratories and participate in research projects involving materials synthesis, characterization, and physical-property measurements. The MIRT faculty and students will give lectures and/or demonstrations of clean energy technologies involving oxides to Magnet Program students at middle and high schools as well as to the general public and K-12 students at Explore UT, a campus-wide open house.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific Outcomes  The MIRT project has identified the anticipation signaled in a high-temperature paramagnetic phase where there is no static orbital order; the magnetic order found at a lower temperature that is shown to depend on an orbital ordering occurs only below the magnetic transition temperature. This finding indicates there must be a dynamic orbital order in the paramagnetic phase, but it awaits experimental verification.   The different roles of the Pb2+ ion in the PbMO3 perovskites have been explored with different transition-metals M. In PbTiO3, the Pb2+ ion enhances the ferroelectric transition of BaTiO3 and confines the Ti(IV) displacements to a single axis with a smaller V(IV), and two empty 3d orbitals form stronger &pi; bonding with two filled O-2p orbitals on a neighboring oxide ion to create the vandyl V = O bond; the Pb2+ ion orders the bond direction to a single axis as in PbTiO3. In PbCrO3, only one &pi;-bonding 3d orbital on Cr(IV) is empty. The MIRT project has shown that at ambient pressure, the Pb2+ stabilizes in this case the disproportionation reaction 3Cr(IV) = 2CR(III) + Cr(VI) with the smaller Cr(VI) having only four rather than six nearest oxygen neighbors. However, under hydrostatic pressure, PbCrO3 is transformed to a cubic metal. In PbRuO3, the Pb2+ ion stabilizes an oxygen-deficient pyrochlore structure, but it is transformed under pressure to a cubic perovskite. The MIRT has shown that at still higher pressure, the cubic perovskite is deformed by a formation of an unprecedented Pb-Ru covalent bond. The two half-filled &pi;-bonding 4d orbitals of Ru(IV) form a single covalent Pb-Ru bond, but the two half-filled 3d orbitals per Cr(IV) undergo disproportionation.   The &pi;-bond orbitals of the Ru(IV) ion in the ARuO3 perovskites (A = alkaline earth) has provided the opportunity to study the crossover from itinerant-electron to localized-electron behavior in a narrow &pi;* band 2/3-filled. However, the study of the Sr1-xBaxRuO3 system had to await our ability to prepare the cubic-perovskite phase of BaRuO3 under 18 GPa hydrostatic pressure at 1,000 &deg;C temperature. The Sr1-xBaxRuO3 system exhibits itinerant-electron ferromagnetism in which the magnetic ordering temperature Tc decreases with x (indicating a broadening of the &pi;* band) despite a stretching of the Ru-O bond length. This result signals an important competition of the Ru(IV) and the A2+ cations for bonding with the same oxide-ion orbitals. The Sr1-xBaxRuO3 system, on the other hand, exhibits a segregation into a diamagnetic localized-electron phase and a metallic, ferromagnetic phase with the ferromagnetic Tc falling to zero with increasing x before reaching CaRuO3.

This observation suggests that in a narrow band ferromagnet with a band more than half-filled, a segregation into localized majority-spin electrons and itinerant minority-spin electrons may occur.   Two kinds of magnetic spin-spin interactions have been postulated for mixed-valent ferromagnetic conductors, the superexchange interaction via virtual electron transfer as in single-valent electronic insulators, which may be antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic, and a double-exchange ferromagnetic interaction associated with a real change transfer. The MIRT has undertaken a systematic investigation to demonstrate conclusively that the double-exchange mechanism is insignificant compared to the superexchange interaction where it has been invoked.   A simple magnetic diagnostic has been developed ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
