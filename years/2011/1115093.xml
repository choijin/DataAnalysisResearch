<AbstractNarration>This project will create InvertNet, an on-line virtual museum comprising &gt;50 million insect and related arthropod specimens housed at 22 Midwestern institutions, focusing on the research theme of effects of land use changes on the biota of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi River drainage basins.  These collections document 160 years of environmental change and are an invaluable and irreplaceable resource but, at present, are largely inaccessible to scientists and the general public.  Most previous efforts to capture and disseminate invertebrate collection data have focused on label data alone.  InvertNet will use advanced digitization and networking technologies to capture and display 2D and 3D images of specimens and labels, and incorporate them into a searchable database. These new techniques should reduce the cost of digitizing insect specimens substantially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By allowing users to find and view detailed images of specimens of particular species and their associated data labels, InvertNet will provide universal access to collections previously restricted to researchers.  It will include links to the popular BugGuide.net insect identification website and to other biodiversity data portals used by researchers, educators, and the general public.  This will facilitate and support many aspects of biological research and education, including species discovery and identification, pest management, ecology and biogeography.  InvertNet will serve as a model, applicable to other kinds of biological collections, for the use of efficient, computer-assisted procedures to increase the speed and accuracy of collection data capture. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project are to photograph all insect specimens in the Purdue Entomological Research Collection (PERC), to digitize and database the label data on species and collection date and place, and to serve the images and collection data to the public and other researchers through the internet.  The images are taken with very high resolution photography, using either a photographic robot for drawers of pinned specimens or a high-resolution scanner for microscope slides and samples in liquid-filled vials.  This work is ongoing and we are continuing to collaborate with InvertNet, and will be adding images of new material as it is incorporated into the PERC.  We will keep abreast of efforts to capture specimen-level occurrence data through a crowd-sourcing application under development at the University of Illinois.  Images uploaded so far can been seen at the InvertNet.org website, invertnet.org.  We have finished photographing all 12,000 microscope slides and most of the aquatic insect types in the collection.  Photography of insects on pins is ongoing.  Once complete, anyone will be able to use the website to explore the insect fauna in their area, as represented in the Purdue collection, or any of the other 20+ collaborating collections.  Researchers will be able to use the data to examine the influence of, for example, land-use change, climate change, or water quality, on insect communities in the Midwest over the past century.
