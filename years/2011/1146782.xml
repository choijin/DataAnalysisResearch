<AbstractNarration>During the early development of some animals, the secondary body axis is patterned by a global signal, often called the embryonic organizer. This event is crucial for the development of vertebrates including humans, but its origins are unclear.  Studies in several model organisms have suggested that the Dpp/BMP2-4 signaling pathway is involved in this event, raising the possibility that this pathway mediated organizer signaling in the last common ancestor of animals.  To establish this, the role of the pathway needs to be examined in the large group of animal phyla known as the Spiralia.  The embryo of the mollusc Ilyanassa has important practical and experimental advantages, making it a useful model for understanding development of the Spiralia.  This group of researchers has discovered that the Dpp/BMP2-4 pathway is mediating organizer signaling in the Ilyanassa embryo, and they have evidence that the pathway is also acting later to pattern the nervous system.  This project will demonstrate that Dpp/BMP2-4 signaling is mediating organizer signaling in Ilyanassa, characterize the mechanisms of signaling, and establish the role of the pathway in neural patterning later in development.  These results will significantly enhance our understanding of the role of the pathway in ancestral animals.  The work will also train young scientists at the graduate and undergraduate levels for future careers as independent researchers and scholars.  It will also involve students at a nearby predominantly undergraduate institution, affording them the opportunity for an in-depth research experience.</AbstractNarration>

This pathway is involved in dorsal-ventral patterning in many animals, including humans and fruit flies.  In some cases the role of the pathway is very similar, for instance in repressing neural specification; however, the function of the pathway has not been examined in enough different taxa to be sure that such similarities are homologous.  We examined the expression and function of Dpp/BMP4 signaling in the embryo of a mollusc, an experimentally tractable representative of the large and understudied group of animals known as the Spiralia.  We found that Dpp expression is mainly on the dorsal side of the embryo including the "3D" cell, which is known to act as an embryonic organizer, by signaling to establish the correct pattern of cell fates along the dorsal-ventral axis.  We used an antibody against the activated form of the Dpp transduction protein, Smad1, to determine the pattern of activation across the embryo; this was initially ubiquitous, then biased towards the dorsal side, consistent with a role in dorsal-ventral patterning.  We knocked down the activity of Dpp in the embryo, and surprisingly found that essentially no differentiation occurs, indicating that Dpp signaling is required for all fates in the embryo.  We overactivated signaling, and found that this caused the formation of extra eyes, which are a marker of neural tissue.  This directly contrasts results from some other systems where the pathway inhibits neural specification, and indicates that the roles of the pathway may not be as conserved as previously argued.  These results have been recently published in the journal Current Biology (Lambert et al, 2016).  During this project, we have also completed a new high-resultion lineage tracing study. We have initiated work on lineage specific ancient genes, and on the growth and patterning of the mollusc shell.   This project has also had broader impacts beyond new scientific understanding.  Two graduate students have been trained on the project, as have three undergraduates, including two women, both of which are bound for graduate school.  We have particpated in a number of outreach programs for students from urban, high-poverty schools, exposing them to biological concepts and experimental reasoning.  Finally, the PI has included results from his course in his undergraduate teaching.       Last Modified: 09/07/2016       Submitted by: J. David Lambert]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
