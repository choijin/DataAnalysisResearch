<AbstractNarration>The 2011 Society for In Vitro Biology (SIVB) Conference will be held in Raleigh, North Carolina, June 4 - 8, 2011.   The conference will provide a venue for presenting the science, novel technologies and advances of in vitro biology for both plants and animals.  As such, the meeting provides an outstanding opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers. Funding provided by NSF will broaden participation by defraying the costs of participation for students and postdoctoral associates with specific emphasis on women and those from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

A number of student events were organized in this conference that included an evening workshop "Writing and submitting a scientific paper", a student networking luncheon, and oral presentation competitions for postdocs and students.  Funds supported  registration fees and one-year society membership for 61 students from US academic institutions, and 4 from developing countries (China and India).  Partial travel awards were given to 9 students belonging to US institutions or developing countries.   The selection process for student awardees emphasized student presentation opportunities and diversity, in terms of gender, institutional affiliation, and geography.  Abstracts of oral and poster presentations are published in In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology-Animal vol. 47, the standard publication for the SIVB conference abstracts.  Plenary Sessions and Symposia covered the following topics:  RNAi in plant biotechnology Physiological disorders in tissue      culture Single molecule sequencing      technology Scientific and regulatory issues      of biotechnology Herbal medicines Transformation technologies (3      sessions) Micropropagation Bioinformatic/Statistics tools in      biological research Crop biotechnology Bioenergy feedstocks Systems biology Crop biofortification Emerging tree biotechnologies Plant metabolic pathways and      engineering Cotton biotechnology    Examples of US and foreign speakers and topics included:  Lila Vodkin, University of Illinois, Endogenous small RNAs that downregulate      pathways in soybean and transgenic RNAi approaches Todd P.
