<AbstractNarration>This project establishes a high resolution light microscopy imaging facility for biology and chemistry research and undergraduate research training at Occidental College.  Grant funds will be used to purchase a Leica TCS SP5 II Spectral Confocal System for a shared microscopy core facility.  Occidental faculty will use the SP5 Confocal System to study diverse problems in biology and biochemistry including the regulation of microtubules and axon outgrowth during C. elegans neural development, ion channel physiology in zebrafish, cone-snail prey-capture mechanisms, nutrient uptake and urease activity in tropical bromeliads, microbial symbiosis in newly discovered marine invertebrates, and the chemistry of bacterial biofilms.  The imaging facility will update and greatly improve research and training capabilities, enable the current biology faculty to undertake new and collaborative research projects and provide undergraduate students with skills in advanced research technologies they are likely to use in their future graduate studies and work environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occidental College is a nationally recognized liberal arts college located in Northeast Los Angeles that serves a diverse student population.  Between 2005 and 2011, 54 percent of science majors have been women, and 22 percent were underrepresented ethnicities.  Occidental has been a leader in integrating research and undergraduate education, encouraging students to engage in collaborative research with faculty throughout the academic year.  The college sponsors an annual summer research program that has grown to include over 150 students each year and a K-12 science education initiative to prepare recent graduates for careers in science teaching at Los Angeles area schools. The Leica TCS SP5 II Spectral Confocal imaging instrumentation will help Occidental improve the quality and range of research opportunities available to students.  The project will have a long-term impact on maintaining excellence in research and undergraduate training at Occidental College and supports development and retention of a talented and diverse STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>
