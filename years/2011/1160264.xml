<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to further explore the results from a pilot project that indicated that students who come to college under-prepared academically but who develop an engineering professional identity early in the curriculum perform better and are more likely to be retained.  By understanding the role of identity on retention and academic success, more effective curricula can be created.  A second aspect of the study is to examine, using the national MIDFIELD data set, the potential pool of students from under-represented groups, who can benefit from similar programs, and how identifying such students can expand the pool of qualified students to draw from. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises from the potential to dramatically increase the pool of students who have the ability to succeed in undergraduate engineering programs.  If the project succeeds in verifying the hypothesis that there is a large pool of students from under-represented groups capable of success, this can significantly increase the STEM pipeline for these groups, and address pressing workforce issues.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Changes in College Demographics. At the University of Colorado Boulder, over the course of this research grant, several broadening participation strategies were implemented and continually refined across the engineering college. The results are profound: minority first year engineering student enrollment grew from a long-stagnant 7% in 2008 to a remarkable 20% in 2016, while enrollment of first year women grew from 20% to 32%.  And, persistence of minority students to graduation increased markedly, as did their academic performance (graduating GPA). To a large extent informed by this research, these results soundly demonstrated that increasing diversity breeds excellence; our engineering college now boasts the strongest and by far most diverse student population in our college?s history.  Replication. Our college?s broadening participation results were achieved by myriad changes in admission policies and practices, curriculum, and culture&mdash;culminating in a replicable system to scaffold profound change. And, the resulting GoldShirt Engineering Program for next-tier students has been replicated at two engineering colleges, and three more have just received NSF S-STEM scholarship support to replicate the program at their sites. We envision a not-too-distant time when engineering colleges nationwide will invest in such pathways to open their doors to next-tier students, providing them the opportunity to excel, earn their engineering degrees and join the profession.  Quantifying the Pool. The quantifying the pool component of the research demonstrates that engineering college admission policies and practices commonly used nationwide preclude reaching parity with respect to race/ethnicity and gender.

A seismic move towards test-optional admissions requires engineering educators and admissions officers to re-examine fundamental beliefs in the accuracy of standardized exams for assessing student preparedness and aptitude for collegiate engineering success.  Factory Model of Engineering Education. Our research further revealed the many ways that next-tier GoldShirt students at times struggled within the factory model prevalent in our engineering college. This curricular system uses techniques of mass production&mdash;designed for efficiency&mdash;by standardizing processes in the form of relatively inflexible curricular paths within any given major. Some system "waste" is expected, and quality is assured by periodic assessments of the students, in the form of grades, as they flow through the assembly line of prerequisite curricular requirements. Only those who have demonstrated themselves as capable will emerge from the manufacturing process and be granted undergraduate engineering degrees. An important aspect of this factory model is that the college is systematically indifferent as to which students graduate and which go elsewhere; standardization of the process and objective assessments are assumed to ensure fairness.   Our research on the GoldShirt program leads us to challenge the assumptions and outcomes of the factory model. First, the standardized engineering curriculum proved to be ill-suited to the level of pre-college preparation and pace of some GoldShirt students, who demonstrated themselves to be capable of meeting curricular demands at a high level when given sufficient time and favorable circumstances for mastering the material. Second, the standardized curriculum, when taken for granted as the best (or only) way to become an engineer, privileges the ways of knowing and learning that have been historically privileged in American schools, and specifically those of the white middle class.

Systematizing Inclusion versus Exclusion. Our overall findings, quantitative and qualitative, thus reveal a need to deeply question our fundamental beliefs, practices and structures which rely on categorizing students as deficient or capable based primarily on standardized testing both at the college admissions level as well as individual course levels. In investigating what the "right" variables are to determine a student?s success or failure in engineering, we find a better question to ask is if a single number can ever be appropriately representative of a whole person, a student.  Consequently, in order to truly broaden participation in engineering we recommend that alternatives to past diversity-limiting practices be identified, and that we actively transform our past systems of exclusion into modern systems of inclusion. In moving towards an asset-based model of engineering education, we purposely distance ourselves from historical legacies of elitism and indifference and instead create structures which recognize and institutionally value students? unique backgrounds and experiences over their numerical performance on standardized tests.
