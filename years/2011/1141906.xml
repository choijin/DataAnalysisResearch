<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The United States Polar Rock Repository (USPRR) was established to curate and loan geologic samples from polar regions to researchers and educators. OPP established the USPRR in part to avoid redundant sample collection and thus reduce the environmental impact of polar research. The USPRR also provides the research community with an important resource for developing new research projects. The USPRR acquires rock collections through donations from institutions and scientists and makes these samples available as no-cost loans for research, education and museum exhibits. Sample metadata is available in an on-line database. The database also includes rock property information, such as magnetic susceptibility and specific gravity, which are useful for geophysical studies. Researchers may request samples for analysis using an online request form. The USPRR fulfills several data management directives, including the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, Antarctic Data Management directive of providing free, full and open access to both metadata and the samples. The intellectual merit of the USPRR lies in the global dissemination of scientific information to researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the USPRR include lessening environmental impacts resulting from redundant fieldwork in Polar Regions. The USPRR provides educational information about Antarctica via the website, by visiting the repository or borrowing a "USPRR rock box". Working at the repository provides students with opportunities to learn about the geology of Antarctica as well as doing research, learning new skills in digital imaging, curation and database management.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Geological field expeditions in polar regions are logistically difficult, financially expensive and can have a significant environmental impact on pristine regions. In addition, the lack of outcrop in Antarctica (98% ice-covered) makes previously collected rock samples very valuable to the science community. The Polar Rock Repository (PRR) curates and loans geologic samples from polar regions to researchers and educators. The National Science Foundation - Division of Polar Programs established the PRR in part to avoid redundant sample collection and thus reduce the environmental impact of polar research. The PRR offers the research community an important resource for developing new research projects. The online database and in-house digital metadata archive provides a unique logistics planning resource by providing detailed outcrop and field logistics information (camp locations, transport methods, weather conditions etc.). The PRR acquires rock collections through donations from institutions and scientists and makes these samples available as no-cost loans. As of March 2016, the PRR collection included ~42,000 samples from rocks, unconsolidated material, cores, marine dredges and a small collection of lichens and moss.  The PRR acquired 17 external and plus 10 internal sample collections.     The existence of the PRR provides significant monetary and environmental cost benefits to the US Antarctic Science Program.  Over the course of the last 5 years, use of samples from the Polar Rock Repository has resulted in the savings tens of millions dollars in logistics and personnel cost in not having to revisit Antarctic outcrops to recollect the samples.     In order to make the samples available to researchers around the country, the PRR developed during this project, an online database and shopping cart for researchers to request samples for analysis. An advanced search engine for the PRR allows scientists and the public to "drill down" into search results using categories and look-up object fields similar to websites like Amazon. Results can be viewed in a table, downloaded as a spreadsheet, or plotted on an interactive map that supports display of satellite imagery and bathymetry layers.  The layers are presented in a Google Maps-like interface and users can pan-and-zoom to any location on the Antarctic continent.  There are multiple ways to request samples.  Users can check the boxes next to the Thumbnail images or the Search Results List, or click on the ?Request Sample? icon on an individual sample result page to place samples in the Shopping Cart.  In the past 5 years, almost 4000 samples have been used for research and more than 9000 for educational outreach.     Outreach is an important part of the PRR?s activities.  Teachers may borrow a no-cost "Polar Rock Box" containing ~40 representative rock, fossil and mineral samples, books and activities about geology and Antarctica.  The Polar Rock Box is ordered online from the PRR website.  Over the last 5 years, more than 16,000 students (mostly elementary and middle school) from 29 states have used the Polar Rock Box (240 rock boxes were sent out) in their geology/earth curriculums.
