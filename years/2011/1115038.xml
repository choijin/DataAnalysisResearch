<AbstractNarration>Lichens and bryophytes share biological traits that make them some of the most sensitive indicators of environmental change. The goal of this project is to provide high quality data to address how species distributions change as a result of major environmental events across time and space. Specifically, this project will digitize the label information (the what, when, where and by whom collected) and images for approximately 2.3 million biological specimens curated in North American lichen and bryophyte herbaria. These collections represent well over 90% of all specimens collected in Canada, the United States and Mexico and held by over 60 US non-governmental institutions. New, on-line digitization techniques will be made publically available at at http://symbiota.org/nalichens/ and http://symbiota.org/bryophytes/, and will allow interested members of the public to be involved and learn about biodiversity alongside the professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Availability of nearly the entire North American bryophyte and lichen collections on-line will greatly accelerate knowledge and evaluation of the biodiversity of these organisms by fostering collaborations between professionals and the general public. Additionally, models developed from these digitized data will aid future mapping projections of large scale species distributions and identification of biodiversity hotspots as prime candidates for protection. These endeavors will help to elucidate regions where changes are imminent and likely to have substantial impact, as well as to facilitate proactive initiatives to alleviate such changes. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Federal Award ID: 1115038 &ndash; Outcomes Report  The primary goal of this project was to digitize the labels of the more than 50,000 research quality lichen and bryophyte (mosses and liverworts) collections in the M.L. Bean Life Science Museum at Brigham Young University.  This collection is one of the largest research quality lichen and bryophyte collections in North America.  The digitized labels (fully annotated and databased) have now been uploaded to the CNALH(Consortion of North American Lichen Herbaria) portal which provides ready access to the label information of our collections to colleagues in the worldwide community of lichenologists and bryologists. Our team also secured, annotated, digitized, and uploaded to the CNALH portal the lichen specimen labels for the University of Idaho collection - which contains more than 11,000 specimens.  The Idaho lichen collection is now secured in the Bean Life Science Museum Herbarium of Nonvascular Cryptogams.  The value of this information to the broader scientific community is related to the following categories of scientific research - 1) basic systematics research which examines the patterns of phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships between various lichen and bryophyte species and their relative positions in the tree of life; 2) basic ecological research concerning the distribution, relationships, roles, and restoration requirements for the lichen and bryophyte components of communities and ecosystems; and 3) Evaluation of the distribution patterns of lichen and bryophyte sensitive indicator species over time, based on historical herbarium collections, for early detection and accurate prediction of air pollution and global climate change effects worldwide.  Project outcomes - Availability of this level of authoritative, research quality information about these collections (nomenclature, location, and substrate information over time) allows lichenologists and bryologists worldwide to ask and more effectively address important research questions about the diversity and complexity of life on earth; information which in turn can be used to more accurately consider and ultimately address critical issues about the stability and in some cases recovery potential of ecosystem health and essential services.  We live in a rapidly changing world where human-related species extinction rates and simplification of natural ecosystems have accelerated to an alarming level. The products of this NSF funded research will effectively tie together critical information that scientists can now use to provide better and more comprehensive answers to modern day challeges to the earth;'s biodiversity and ecosystem health.
