<AbstractNarration>Two people can encounter the same stimulus (e.g. a movie) and believe that they have either very similar subjective reactions to that stimulus (e.g., "We both thought that scene was heartwrenching") or very different subjective reactions (e.g., "I thought the scene was heartwrenching; she thought it was cliched").  Often, when two people encounter the same stimulus, they feel more connected to the extent that they believe that they share the same response to that stimulus.  Drawing from William James' distinction between the "I" -- or, the subjective experience of self -- and the "Me" -- or, the objective experience of self, Dr. Elizabeth Pinel (University of Vermont) refers to the belief that one has shared an identical subjective experience with another person as "I-sharing."  Dr. Pinel posits that I-sharing promotes social harmony and explores the reasons this might be the case.  Specifically in a series of experimental studies, Dr. Pinel will explore whether I-sharing promotes empathy, perspective-taking, self-regulation, and reduced hostile cognitions and whether these, in turn, lead to greater levels of conflict resolution, accommodation, and helping.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to advance the scientific understanding of social harmony and could inform interventions designed to reduce social conflict and promote prosocial outcomes. If it turns out that boosting I-sharing can appreciably increase social harmony, this could have important implications in many different arenas of social life including violence and bullying in schools, marital satisfaction and divorce, even political conflicts. Also, the research will offer training to undergraduate and graduate students in the rigorous methods of social psychological research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funded research tests the basic hypothesis that I-sharing promotes prosocial consequences.  I-sharing refers to those moments when two or more people believe that they have the same exact experience of a stimulus.  Inferences of I-sharing are most likely when people respond simultaneously and identically to the same stimulus, such as when people laugh simultaneously at the same offbeat joke, answer a question with the same response at the same time, or shed tears together over a shared loss.  I-sharing can happen between anyone, from strangers to loved ones, from foreigners to next door neighbors.  When I-sharing happens, it fosters a feeling of closeness because it calms feelings of existential isolation (i.e., the feeling of being alone in one's experience of the world).  The research tested is based on the argument that whereas existential isolation makes people feel psychologically ill at ease, I-sharing makes people feel comforted and meets their self-needs for belief validation and belonging. With these self-needs so met, people who have had an I-sharing experience can turn their attention to others.  In short, I-sharing, because it satisfies people's needs for belief validation and belonging, fosters prosocial consequences.    We tested this basic tenet in multiple ways in the funded research.  We manipulated whether or not people believed they I-shared with an interaction partner, and we asked whether this experience of I-sharing fostered: liking for outgroup members, more favorable impressions of outgroup members, selflessness, and the intention to help.  In all cases, I-sharing had a positive effect.  Research on the "why" behind these effects shows that I-sharing works because it makes people feel similar to others in terms of their subjective experience.  We also pursued the study of existential isolation and observed that people high in existential isolation have unmet self-needs that in turn predict a lack of egalitarianism and humanitarianism.  The work pursued under this grant has broad implications for interpersonal and intergroup relationships, as well as for clinical practice.  I-sharing appears to offer a unique way to connect with people, one that bridges the existential divide that often keeps people feeling painfully alone and that correlates with negative attitudes toward others and mental health issues.  The PI and her collaborators hope to continue to pursue these broader implications in follow-up research.       Last Modified: 06/29/2016       Submitted by: Elizabeth C Pinel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
