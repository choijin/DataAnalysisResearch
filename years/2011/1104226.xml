<AbstractNarration>A team of researchers and practitioners from the University of Wisconsin, Madison and four 2-year colleges (Fox Valley Technical College, Moraine Park Technical College, Northcentral Technical College, and Waukesha County Technical College)is developing activities to increase student success and retention in Manufacturing Engineering Technologist and Technician Education (METTE) Programs and examining key factors associated with these activities.  The project examines the influence of student participation in coursework that is part of articulation agreements between secondary and post-secondary institutions and the influence of post-secondary factors (e.g., the availability of financial aid and participation in academic and student support activities) on student performance and retention in METTE.  The study examines the link between participation in dual-credit programs in high school with student outcomes, such as likelihood of earning a diploma, persistence to the second semester of college, higher Grade Point Average on year after high school graduation, persistence in college 2 years after high school graduation, transfer from 2-year to 4-year program, and post-graduation labor market success.  The study also examines post-secondary factors on performance and retention in METTE, such as student engagement in institutional support activities, academic experiences and enrollment in remedial courses, and external demands such as employment and family responsibilities.  In addition,  Local Leadership Teams (LLT) at the 2-year colleges are engaged in campus-level action research studies to examine locally or regionally important issues associated with strengthening student success and/or improving their METTE programs to meet the workforce development needs of the locale or region.  Findings will be disseminated through publications and national and local presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This technician education research project aimed to improve student success in WisconsinÆs technical college manufacturing and engineering technology career pathways.  Using multiple student success indicators, we sought to identify the individual, educational, and environmental factors influencing studentsÆ short-term and long-term success in the educational setting and the workplace. A large integrated, longitudinal student-record database was provided and updated annually by the state education agencies (containing nearly de-identified 400,000 students records for 2005-2013 technical college students).   The database was supplemented with student engagement survey data, as well as survey and interview data to address additional campus-specific research and innovation questions.     Working collaboratively with Local Leadership Teams (LLTs) on four Wisconsin Technical College campuses, we designed and supported networked METTE improvement communities.  With assistance from a university-based research facilitator, these inter-departmental teams used locally focused analytics to implement targeted teaching/ learning/ student support/ assessment innovations designed to improve student progress, retention, completion, and/or transfer in one or more of the fifty METTE career pathways.  Across the 11 research and innovation studies completed during the project, mathematics proficiency and pre- or early student program choices emerged as significant challenges for METTE programs and students.  Studies revealed the importance of contextualizing the METTE math curriculum and helping students complete math requirements early. Additionally, selected factors and practices associated with high school dual credit course completion (e.g., enrolling in college directly, completing summer college courses) predicted success in METTE pathways.  Based on these findings, promising innovations were implemented on some of the partner technical college campuses.  Most notably, the Milwaukee Area Technical College team systematically revamped several math courses within METTE programs.  Several student success-focused products were generated describing findings, conclusions, and recommendations for improving METTE student success. Project team members made 20 national and state conference presentations.  Additionally, 10 articles or chapters were published in or are currently under review by peer-reviewed research journals.  The portfolio of research and innovation products and outcomes generated is available on the project website, mette.wceruw.org       Last Modified: 10/05/2015       Submitted by: L.
