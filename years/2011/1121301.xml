<AbstractNarration>The nearly endless diversity of floral shape, color, and size, has captivated humans throughout history. How gene changes affect these traits is a compelling question in biology. Close observation of diverse flowers uncovers significant constraint on how they form. Approximately 70% of flowering plant species falling into a group that fundamentally have five parts (e.g., five petals) and strict patterns of how these parts are oriented. The greatest distinction is between flowers that are radially symmetrical, with all the petals equidistant from each other, and flowers that are bilaterally symmetrical with a single plane of symmetry that divides the flower in half from top to bottom. This project uses Dipsacales (honeysuckle and its relatives) to examine the genetic basis of evolutionary shifts in flower symmetry. Diversification in the Dipsacales shows multiple shifts between radially symmetrical groups and different forms of bilateral symmetry. The shifts to bilateral symmetry correlate with duplications in certain genes, suggesting that multiple copies of these genes are needed to form a more complex bilaterally symmetrical flower. This project will build on previous evolutionary examinations of these "floral symmetry genes" to determine how shifts in where and when these genes operate affect shifts in floral symmetry among related groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly all scientists had an inspirational teacher or parent who exposed them to science, highlighting the need to reach as many students as possible with active science education. St. John's University, situated in the most diverse county in the country, with a student body dominated by under-represented groups, provides investigators the opportunity to expose students from all levels and backgrounds to science. The project will provide research opportunities for diverse undergraduates as well as high school students from Forest Hills High School. These students will learn modern molecular biology techniques through hands on experience and close mentoring.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant integrated multiple genetic approaches to understand the evolutionary mechanisms underlying flower development. &nbsp;Specifically, we examined the way that petals are arranged, comparing radially and bilaterally symmetrical flowers across a group of plants called the Dipsacales. &nbsp;Flowers in the Dipsacales range from radially symmetrical in groups such as <em>Viburnum</em> to varying types of bilaterally symmetrical in groups such as honeysuckle and <em>Scabiosa</em>. Dipsacales also contains species that have multiple types of symmetry in a single spray of flowers on a single plant. This has allowed us to examine fine scale changes in gene expression across the plane of symmetry of the flower and across multiple floral variations. We have also pinpointed gene duplications in gene families involved in floral symmetry as well. Our research has shown that some of these major gene duplicates are also likely involved in the floral symmetry pathway and should therefore be examined in other groups as well. Additionally, we have shown that the floral symmetry pathway is more complex than is currently thought, by showing that major changes in morphology are correlated with significant gene expression changes in the &ldquo;lower&rdquo; petals of the flower and not the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; petals that much of the research has focused on. This grant has helped train two postdoctoral researchers, one of whom has gone on to successfully get a separate research proposal funded. This grant has supported the research training of two undergraduate students who went on to Ph.D. programs in plant sciences, one student who went to medical school, and two undergraduate students who are currently applying and on their way to graduate school. These later students also set up a teaching module for local Girl Scout troops. One student visited troops of 3rd to 4th graders and taught them about flower diversity and helped them extract DNA from bananas. The Girl Scouts were thoroughly engaged and excited.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Dianella&nbsp;Howarth</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
