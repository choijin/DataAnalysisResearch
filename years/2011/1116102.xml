<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to explore technology for low-power reconfigurable computing at extreme environment, i.e. at a temperature &gt; 250Â°C and at high radiation (1-30 Mrad), where conventional electronics fail to work reliably. The project seeks to develop the computing platform through a device-circuit-architecture co-design approach. The platform uses polycrystalline SiC nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) switches to achieve nanoscale dimension, superior mechanical and chemical stability at extreme conditions and virtually zero leakage. The project studies a novel switch structure with multi-layer cantilever beams to realize the reconfigurable building blocks with high density and robustness. Possible hybridization with SiC junction field effect transistor (JFET) will be explored to address the issue of cascading mechanical logic blocks with limited driving capability. The project also investigates a novel computational model and architecture to adapt to failures and to achieve low interconnect overhead. Considering the lack of simulation models for NEMS switches and circuits, it will develop appropriate circuit-compatible models. Operation of the building blocks at high temperature will be validated through simulation as well as fabrication and measurements of test chips. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed low-power reconfigurable hardware design approach can provide enabling technology for extreme-environment computing in number of application areas including automotive and industrial applications, space, avionics, combustion engine, and intelligent propulsion systems. It can provide an order of magnitude lower power and area than state-of-the-art SiC transistor based electronics. The simulation models can be valuable research tool for analysis of nanoscale mechanical switches. The research will integrate education and training through development of a new undergraduate course, interdisciplinary senior projects, and an internet group on harsh environment electronics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this device-circuit-architecture project, the major outcomes and achievements in the development of a novel computing fabric with a nano-electro-mechanical system switch (NEMS) using silicon carbide (SiC) material have been the following.  (1) It has explored the science of operation of SiC NEMS devices and extensively studied and reported the device level properties through number of publications and presentations. It has developed novel logic and memory circuits using these devices and reported promising simulation as well as experimental results. These results create new pathways for using these devices in diverse applications including low-power sensing, reconfigurable computing as well as novel security primitives.     (2) Our research has established SiC as the only material that has enabled truly robust, genuinely nanoscale NEMS switches and logic circuits for nanocomputing with abrupt switching, zero leakage, and long lifetime.  (ii) Our devices achieve &gt;107 to 1010 switching cycles recorded without device failure at both room and high temperatures (up to 500&deg;C) and in ambient air (such lifetime and reliability performance far surpass the lifetimes in all other genuinely nanoscale NEMS switches reported to date).  (iii) Our devices feature ultrasmall motional volume (~1mm3).  (iv) Our devices feature low switching-on voltage (Von,dc~1V) for quasi-static switching, very high speed (switching time approaching ts~1 to ~10ns), and milli-Volt switching in energy reversible resonant-mode operations (Von,res~10 to ~100mV level) for &gt;1010 to 1012 cycles without failure.  (v) Our devices have versatile geometric configurations and signal readout schemes, scalability and manufacturability including hybrid NEMS-transistor integration.  (3) The research has led to the discovery of a unique nanomechanical device, namely a nanomechanical antifuse, which has excellent properties with respect to realizing a secure reconfigurable platform. We have demonstrated the first SiC NEMS antifuse devices and NEMS antifuse based novel FPGA devices/circuits with potential for significant power reduction in FPGA circuits.   (4) Finally, in studying the devices through device/circuit level simulations as well measurements on large batch of fabricated devices, we have developed a suite of robust high-precision measurement techniques for accurately characterizing the SiC NEMS logic devices as well as other nanomechanical structures targeted for diverse sensing and computing applications, in quasi-static, frequency-domain, and time-domain measurements.  These would continue to prove important toward the development of ultralow-power NEMS logic and computing systems.
