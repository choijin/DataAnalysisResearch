<AbstractNarration>This S-STEM project is Increasing Diversity in Next-Generation Computing (IDNGC) in two related majors, Computer Science and Management Information Systems. Students within Computer Science and Management Information Systems share a close relationship in curriculum and have significant overlap in student experience, including student organizations, colloquium talks, student tutoring sessions and alumni mentoring. The program will emphasize participation by students from underrepresented groups, including women and minority students, first-generation college students and students from economically challenged areas of Alabama. The project: 1) recruits qualified students, 2) provides a support infrastructure to enhance success as students, 3) provides financial assistance for students who have demonstrated a commitment to their studies in these fields, and 4) exposes students to new advances in computing. The project provides scholarships for 24 undergraduates over a four-year time period, with 12 scholarships for the Computer Science Department and 12 for the Management Information Systems Department. Providing the scholarships alleviates some of the financial risks for students in these fields. The project establishes a formal structure for assessing and assisting students during their academic careers, including faculty, peer and alumni mentoring, and exposure to new advances in computing, such as cloud computing, security, business intelligence and robotics. The result is to enhance their professional development and participation in research, which can increase their future success in a STEM field in either industry or academia. This project builds on research results regarding the recruitment, retention and matriculation of students who are members of underrepresented groups. Incorporating formal assessment cycles as part of participants' academic careers not only provides for improved retention, but also provides further insight into the difficulties experienced by these students and allows for the development of new techniques to enhance student success. Increasing the students' knowledge and exposure to cutting edge ideas in the field help them create solutions to future problems. All of the faculty serving on this project are members of underrepresented groups who serve as role models for the students, who in turn serve as role models to students at lower academic levels. Furthermore, emphasis on next generation computing helps to prepare students in our programs with the knowledge and tools to innovate and lead in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Increasing the diversity of students participating in the many fields of computing will only come about through the deliberate efforts of educators in those fields.  This project builds on known research results regarding the recruitment, matriculation and retention of students who are members of underrepresented groups in the fields of computer science and management information systems.  Our program establishes a structure for assessing and assisting students during their academic careers, including faculty, peer and alumni mentoring, and exposure to new advances in computing.  Over the five years of our program, we funded a total of 69 students, 29 students in computer science (CS) and 40 students in management information systems (MIS), 93% of whom are members of our target group.  Overall, 36% of our participants are female, 42% identify as African American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Asian, Native American/Alaskan or Multiracial and 43% are first generation college students.  In addition, many of our students are from economically challenged areas.  Of the 29 students funded in CS, 31% are female, 31% identify as African American, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander or Multiracial and 28% are first generation students.  Of the 40 MIS students funded, 40% are female, 37.5% identify as African American, 12.5% identify as Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander or Multiracial, and 55% are first generation college students.    94% of the participants in our program completed next generation courses such as cloud computing, security, business intelligence and robotics. We retained 97% of our students as only two students left the program before it ended. One of these students transferred to an MIS program at another state school and subsequently graduated.  The remaining student did not complete his degree although he is currently working in a STEM field.   Two students did not graduate before the program ended, but they are both enrolled and on track to graduate.  Of our 69 participants, 66 have graduated and are working in a STEM field or are attending graduate school in a STEM field, and two more are expected to graduate in May.  As a result we can claim a 99% success rate for our S-STEM program.  In exit surveys students reported the impact of our program on their success was due to the following factors: the scholarship money eliminated the need for many of our participants to work at additional part-time jobs, the program provided a strong cohort for study groups and sharing ideas in courses, mentoring aided in knowledge of courses and resources, and next generation computing courses helped them to be more competitive when searching for employment.  The experiences gained by the students participating in this program provided a positive influence on their lives.  Emphasis on next generation computing helped to prepare students in our program with the knowledge and tools to innovate and lead in the field.  Furthermore, upon graduation, increased diversity in the workforce in computing impacts our society at large.
