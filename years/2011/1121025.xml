<AbstractNarration>The brain consists of billions of neurons, and it is the connections between neurons that provide most brain-specific functions. To form these connections, a neuron extends an axon along a selected pathway following a series of molecular cues present in the developing embryo. Molecules on the surface of the axon called ?receptors? detect these cues and transfer this environmental information to molecules inside of the cell, which in turn regulate the cytoskeleton used to steer the axon as it navigates to its target cell to make a neuronal connection. This investigator will use the fruit fly (Drosophila) as a model organism to study how one receptor molecular (Frazzled) interacts with the Abelson tyrosine kinase inside of a neuron and steers axons across the midline to make connections on the opposite side of the brain. Biochemical techniques are being used to define exactly how Frazzled and Abelson interact with each other. To understand how Abelson regulates the cytoskeletal machinery, each domain of Abelson will be tested for its ability to change the shape of cells in culture and to help guide axons in a developing embryo. All DNA, cell, and fly reagents generated in the study will be made available to the scientific community. Similarly, a database containing all the binding and functional information generated in this study will be linked to Flybase [http://flybase.org/], a major repository of Drosophila research. This study will impact our understanding of a universal problem in brain biology by establishing how bilateral connections are formed in the developing nervous system. The work will also increase our understanding of how Abelson, and related proteins, regulate the machinery underlying the movement of other cell types, including immune cells fighting an infection and cancer metastasis. Finally, the investigator has a strong record of undergraduate and graduate training at an institute with a high percentage of minority and first generation college students.</AbstractNarration>

It generally works to link upstream membrane events to the cells machinery that generate movement.  Once born, neurons must extend an axon over long distances to find targets cells and form functional connections.  Abl plays a key role in this process of axon guidance. It works downstream of a receptor to help convert the directional information of an external cue to the cytoskeletal machinery providing outgrowth and steering. The goal of this work was to help elucidate how Abl might function in neurons as they develop these functional connections.              Much is known about the conserved catalytic core and autoinhibitory regions at the beginning of the protein, yet all family members exhibit a long tail region, referred to as the C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD is known to be important for function and viability, but it functions remains elusive. Accordingly, we took advantage of the molecular genetic approaches available in Drosophila to assess the functionality of the CTD of Drosophila Abl during formation of axon tracts in the nerve cord and adult viability.  Surprisingly, our early work (as well as work by others) demonstrated that conserved sequence elements within the CTD play only minor roles.  Thus, we took a different tack and create a battery of mutants (over 30) that systematically deleted large segments of the CTD (called quarters) or added them back to the N-terminus alone (which is not sufficient for proper function), and assessed the ability of these new proteins to rescue the axon guidance defects and adult lethality observed when the normal Abl gene is lost.              Our data suggest that in different contexts, the whole CTD can have additive effects on Abl activity, but two areas also have relatively specific functions.  That is, we identified a novel region (the third quarter of the CTD) that helps localizes Abl to axons, and a second region (the first quarter) as a critical regulator of Abl function; its removal causes "extra" defects during axon tract formation.  Moreover, we demonstrated that the whole CTD is characterized by long stretches of intrinsic disorder, a feature shared in both vertebrate and invertebrate Abl.  As such, we proposed that that intrinsic disorder, rather than sequence conservation, is critical to CTD function.               Most proteins fold in very specific three-dimensional structures related to their function. But it is now recognized that some regions of a protein remain ?unfolded" or disordered, and these regions are thought to allow flexible and promiscuous binding to different partners. Importantly, stretches of intrinsic disorder are also a structural feature of many "hub" proteins, which, like Abl, participate in a many different cell processes. Thus we hypothesize that the disordered regions are being use by Abl to help form a variety of different signaling complexes used during axon pathway formation.  Moreover, if disorder underlies protein interactions, future work will need to use proteomic tools to understand how these large disordered regions participate in protein complex formation, both by themselves and in the context of the whole CTD.  Indeed, on-going proteomic work is attempting to identify partners helping localize Abl to axons, and to regulate its function during axon guidance.                In addition to furthering out understanding of Drosophila Abl it self, given conservation of disorder and function of Abl, our concept of a hub protein should extend to other members of this kinase family, present in almost all species, and involved in many different cellular processes.  This includes, secretion, organelle movement and a cells response to infections.
