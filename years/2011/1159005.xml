<AbstractNarration>The investigators will develop a unified nonparametric theoretical framework to study stochastic network models and design scalable algorithms (and software) to fit these models. They intend to carry out the development and validation of their methods with collaborators in biology who have gathered extensive new data for the assessment of protein structure and determination of biological pathways particularly in Drosophila. Such problems are omnipresent in genomics and they expect their methods to carry over widely. They will also use networks with uncertainty measures to study relationships between words and phrases in a newspaper database in order to provide media analysts with automatic and scalable algorithms. In all cases they will focus on methods of general statistical confidence which have been lacking in work so far. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our world is connected through relationships, among "actors" who can be people, organizations, words, genes, proteins, and more. Advancements of information technology have enabled collection of massive amounts of data in all disciplines for us to build relationships between these actors. These relationships can be effectively described as networks, and properties or patterns in these networks can be random or knowledge. Responding to this recent data availability and a huge potential for knowledge discovery, research in networks is attracting much attention from researchers in physics, social science, computer science, and probability. While contributing to the development of core statistical research, the proposed research will directly impact the interdisciplinary field of network analysis and the study of complex networks. The applications of their research results are diverse and well beyond the two fields studied in the proposal: genomics and media analysis. They include national security, communications, sociology, political science, and infectious disease. The statistical tools developed are unifying and could change how many scientists approach network analysis. As a result, statistical research will become more prominent in the networks community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on developing new sophisticated tools for the analysis of network data, either observed directly or inferred from other information on the units of analysis (people in social networks, proteins in tissue samples, etc).   Our specific focus has been on the problems of learning connections between units from multivariate observations, discovering communities in networks, and predicting missing links.   In all contexts, we developed new models and methods that incorporate features commonly encountered in real data, proved they have desirable properties whenever possible, and developed computationally efficient algorithms that scale well to large networks and work well even for sparse networks, where the number of edges is comparable to the number of nodes, which often happens in practice.   A total of nine PhD students and one postdoc have worked with the principal investigator at Michigan during the life time of the project, training in cutting edge theory, methodology, and computing for modern data science.   The postdoc and three former PhD students are now tenure-track faculty at peer institutions, two former PhD students are working as data scientists in industry, and four PhD students are still at Michigan working on their dissertations.  All results of the project have been widely disseminated to the scientific community via publications, presentations, and publicly available software.   Some of the tools developed under this project are now being adapted for use with brain connectomics data in collaboration with psychiatrists studying neural origins of mental illness, and are thus having an impact on the field of neuroimaging in psychiatry.
