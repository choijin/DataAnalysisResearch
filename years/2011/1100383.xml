<AbstractNarration>This award focuses on a class of constrained optimization problems in which data are uncertain, and some decisions need to be made before uncertainty about the data clears (first-stage). The remaining decisions are made once the data becomes more reliable (second-stage).  In addition, these problems involve both discrete and continuous decisions, and hence are referred to as Two-stage Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programs (SMIP). The goal of this project is to integrate recently developed integer programming tools based on multi-term disjunctions, and stochastic programming ideas based on decomposition and coordination. These tools will provide the basis for sequential convexification of SMIP problems, and will allow their solution via a finite sequence of approximations. These algorithms will be implemented and rigorously tested on a wide variety of instances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will allow engineers to add greater intelligence to software that is used in engineering design, contingency planning in manufacturing, military operations planning, and many more. For these and other real-world engineering problems, the exact setting of future operations is impossible to predict accurately, and SMIP provides a formal basis to cope with the uncertainty. While these issues are ubiquitous in most operations, there is a serious paucity of methodologies that can solve such computational problems. The widespread applicability of the proposed methodology is expected to transform the way in which discrete decisions are made in an uncertain environment. Moreover, results from this project will build a unifying theory for discrete and continuous optimization under uncertainty.</AbstractNarration>

The algorithms we developed are based on decomposition and coordination of a large number of scenarios representing the uncertainty. These tools allow the solution of SMIPs via a finite sequence of approximations, which converge to a provably optimal solution.  Previous studies of SMIP models were restricted to models in which discrete decision variables were restricted to binary choices (e.g. investment (or not) in new technologies, deployment (or not) of existing technology etc.).  Because of advances made possible by this project, models for sizing can also be accommodated within SMIP.  Such sizing questions arise in models that go beyond binary choices. For example, in many capital-intensive undertakings (e.g. building ships for the Navy), the quantitative level of investment (e.g. number of ships) is important to mission capabilities, as well as costs/budgets.  As a result of this project, one should be able to address such investment/deployment planning models under uncertainty.  Other examples include models for location and sizing of servers in a communications network, location and sizing of wind farms, and so on.  The outcomes of this project are the  Design of provably finite Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programming (SMIP) algorithms for models in which integer variables appear in both first and second stages. Implementation and testing of the scalability of the new SMIP algorithms. Application of these algorithms in electric power, telecommunications, and other networked systems.  Our computational experience indicates that the proposed algorithms are effective in solving several classes of SMIPs, which were unsolvable by the state-of-the-art software without decomposition. Five PhD students received partial funding from this grant to support their dissertation research. In addition, the investigators integrated the research results into the content of their PhD classes.       Last Modified: 08/19/2014       Submitted by: Simge Kucukyavuz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
