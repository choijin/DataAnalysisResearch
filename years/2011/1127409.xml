<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to prepare 20 students in engineering disciplines admitted to Auburn University, by engaging them into variety of activities needed to successfuly complete a program of study in engineering at Auburn University. This is the second summer bridge program, as the PI has conducted the first bridge program in summer of 2010. This bridge program is to provide mentoring activities, and to enhance the engineering curricula. Academic preparation is a major focus for this summer bridge program. The program provides credit hours of english and pre-calculus courses. Time management, counselor interaction's leadership and communication skills' seminars, are also provided during this 5 weeks bridge program. At least 50% of the students are females.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will have an opportunity to learn about college life, how to balance their academic curricula, time management, and communication skills. The students will bond together, and help each other succeed. This bridge summer program will provide them with the gate keeper courses that they need to start a successful engineering freshman year. This program will help increasing the  students' retention from the underrepresented groups that are enrolled in engineering programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The AUM Community College/High School Summer Bridge Program for Prospective Engineering Students was a five-week program designed to provide rigorous mentorship of and a smooth transition from high school to college and from community college to the university for women and underrepresented minority students with an interest in majoring in engineering.  Seventeen students (9 females and 8 males) from various counties throughout Alabama participated in the AUM Community College/High School Summer Bridge Program for Prospective Engineering Students.  Academic preparation was a major focus of the AUM Summer Bridge program with students were enrolled in two for credit classes. English and Math tutors were available in the evenings (Monday &ndash;Thursday) to assist students with course material.  In addition, students participated in the following activities to assist with the development of ideas related to the engineering-related posters and essays:  i. Met and networked with Auburn University Summer Bridge students as well as members of National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE).  ii. Participated in field trips to Alabama Department of Transportation, US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, AL, Civil Rights Museum, and the Rosa Parks Museum.  The influence of the AUM Summer Bridge Program on student achievement was notable; that is, the overall grade point average (GPA) for Summer Bridge participants was 2.94, compared to a 2.66 GPA for part-time freshmen AUM students in the School of Sciences.  The fifteen recent high school graduates have successfully completed their freshman year at various colleges and universities throughout Alabama, with three successfully completing their work in the Auburn University system, while the two community college students have continued their studies at the university.   A summer bridge program for high school graduates that are potential engineering majors is an excellent way to enhance the freshman year for engineering majors at colleges and universities across the nation. Such a program provides students with a new level of confidence as they enter the major, which requires more credit hours than most other majors. In addition, the inclusion of both recent high school graduates and community college students in a summer bridge experience proved to be quite beneficial for both. Moreover, such programs are excellent recruiting tools for engineering programs. It raises recruitment to another level in high schools by providing an opportunity for potential engineering majors to earn credit as well as pocket change during the summer prior to the freshman year.
