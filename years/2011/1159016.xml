<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to define and understand the concept of critical thinking in engineering, determine differences in how engineering students and engineering faculty view and instantiate critical thinking, and differentiate engineering's definition from those of other disciplines.  This work explores and will clarify foundational definitions within engineering education that are common across many degree programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project, if successful, will be to help faculty and curriculum designers in supporting the development of critical thinking in engineering degree programs.  Additionally the research technique that will be used may help engineering educators understand how different groups define and enact critical thinking.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting existing fields.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Critical thinking is generally recognized as an important skill, and one that is a primary goal of higher education.  Much of the rhetoric regarding education and its reform revolves around teaching students to think and question critically.  Within engineering, although critical thinking does not appear on the list of ABET outcomes, many programs have adopted critical thinking as an ability which they wish to impart to their students. In general, definitions of critical thinking provide a list of skills that describe what critical thinking is composed of, and includes items such as analysis, making judgements, and deciding on actions. Less work has been done to define critical thinking specifically within the context of engineering.  The majority of the studies on critical thinking in engineering focus on problem solving as the area in which critical thinking is applied. Within the literature, there are few studies agreeing on the attributes of critical thinking, which is somewhat surprising considering its perceived importance.  The research study addressed three basic questions to establish a baseline for critical thinking in engineering:  What are the expectations that engineering faculty have for critical thinking, and is this different from faculty in non-technical skills? How is critical thinking enacted by engineering students, and is this different from students in non-technical fields? Do the ways in which students enact critical thinking match the expectations of faculty?   A qualitative study that combined constructivist grounded theory to develop a new theory with thematic analysis based on existing theoretical frameworks was developed and conducted.  The use of emergent coding was important as many themes evolved from the interviews with faculty and students from within the college of engineering, and from faculty from literature and humanities.  The research resulted in a hierarchical code structure with six main elements or themes. These themes were analyzed to see how they compared between faculties of technical and non-technical fields, as well as between faculty and students.  Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. English and Materials Science &amp; Engineering students differed in the specific way critical thinking was viewed. A major theme that arose for engineering students was that critical thinking was often similar or equivalent to problem solving. However, English students saw critical thinking as a way of forming opinions, forming and defending an argument, and making connections.
