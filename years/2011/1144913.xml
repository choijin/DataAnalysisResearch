<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigators (PIs) will observe the upcoming solar eclipses of 2012 (to be seen in northern Australia) and 2013 (to be seen in west Africa) by exploiting multi-wavelength spectral and polarimetric imaging. The goal of these solar eclipse observations is to capitalize on the diagnostic properties of many coronal forbidden emission lines in order to infer electron temperatures, ion densities, abundances, and charge states, as well as the properties of the coronal magnetic field, while applying state-of-the-art image processing techniques. The proposed observations will extend the PI's eclipse data base to span almost a full solar activity cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs explain that the spectral emission lines they plan to measure will enable an unambiguous study of the evolutionary track of coronal density structures, of the transition from a collision-dominated plasma to a weakly-collisional plasma where the ion charge states observed in interplanetary space are established, and of the transition from closed to open magnetic field lines in the corona. These data are essential for simulation and modeling of the expansion of the coronal plasma, the physical processes that control the heating and acceleration of the solar wind, and the evolution of the solar magnetic field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are female scientists who will mentor graduate and undergraduate students, with graduate students participating in the eclipse expeditions and with undergraduates being introduced to research through summer projects. The PIs will develop educational material to be used at both the undergraduate and graduate level, as well as for public outreach. Results will be disseminated to the research community through presentations at conferences and through refereed scientific publications, where it it will be used to help plan instrument development for the next generation of solar corona observing tools.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Earth, the Moon and the Sun, have been providing humanity with an event of unsurpassed beauty throughout the millennia. The clockwork of planetary motions, the relative sizes of the Moon, and the Sun, and the distance separating them, make it possible for the Moon to totally block the light from the Sun in a swath on earth of approximately 100 miles wide, once every 12 to 18 months. During those few minutes of daytime twilight, the Sun casts the Moon&rsquo;s shadow on Earth and a total solar eclipse occurs. The glory of the solar atmosphere is revealed, with wispy fine filaments expanding away from the Sun trying to escape its gravitational pull.&nbsp; To those who are lucky to be in that shadow, this spectacle is not to be forgotten. It was only a few hundred years ago that inquisitive minds decided to explore this event for the sake of knowledge, and a deeper understanding of our closest star. With the advent of&nbsp; photography, it soon became possible to capture, on photographic plates, some of the secrets of the Sun that the eye could see. It also became clear that the light from the corona held the secrets of the underlying chemistry and magnetism that define it. The &ldquo;Solar Wind Sherpas&rdquo; are a team of dedicated and enthusiastic solar physicists, engineers and mathematicians, who have decided to embark on countless journeys to remote areas of the Earth, whenever a total solar eclipse occurs, to try to unravel the secrets of the Sun. Taking advantage of new detector technology, and image processing techniques, and carrying their most sensitive equipment in backpacks, they try to capture these secrets in a few minutes. Each expedition has led to new discoveries. In this cycle of funding, covering the total solar eclipses of 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016, the team has made several discoveries. Their latest discoveries reported here, pertain to the temperature of the corona, and to prominences that control the Sun&rsquo;s wrath. The team found that the temperature of the corona, known for almost a century, to be over a million degrees, is not stable.&nbsp; It varies in tandem with the magnetic activity of the Sun. While this activity is most evident in the number of sunspots that pepper its surface, prominences, namely filaments of very cool and dense material that snake across the solar surface, are the culprit. They increase in area across the surface as the number of sunspots increases, leading to a rise of the temperature of the corona. And, although they occupy a very small fraction of the solar surface, prominences seem to be the tail wagging the corona, as their eruptions can wreak havoc in solar atmosphere, as well as in the magnetized environment of the earth.&nbsp; Occasionally, prominences decide to break loose from the Sun without warning. At those moments, they cause large bubbles of overlying million degrees gases to expand away from the Sun. What the team recently found was that bits of prominences are entrained with these large bubbles, but retain their cold identity in their travel through space at dizzying speeds of up to 1000 miles per second, forever escaping the Sun. The reason behind this behavior remains a mystery, hopefully to be solved with future eclipse observations. The Solar Wind Sherpas is a team, led by a woman scientists. It strives to include undergraduates and graduate students in their expeditions. The team continues to be engaged in public outreach and education in preparation for the 2017 total solar eclipse that will traverse the US. They are committed to spreading the excitement of scientific exploration of the Sun, our closest star.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/06/2016<br>      Modified by: Shadia&nbsp;R&nbsp;Habbal</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1144913/1144913_10148782_1475733235047_Tse_2015_Svalbard_800mm_Nikon_D810-print--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1144913/1144913_10148782_1475733235047_Tse_2015_Svalbard_800mm_Nikon_D810-print--rgov-800width.jpg" title="White light image of the total solar eclipse of 20 March 2015"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1144913/1144913_10148782_1475733235047_Tse_2015_Svalbard_800mm_Nikon_D810-print--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="White light image of the total solar eclipse of 20 March 2015"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image of the solar corona was taken from Svalbard on 20 March 2015.
