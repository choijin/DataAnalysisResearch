<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Howard Fairbrother of Johns Hopkins University. Prof. Fairbrother and his research group will study the surface interactions that regulate the behavior of nanoparticles in aqueous environments by measuring particle-surface interactions of carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticles in model environmental systems. The study will make use of state of the art instrumentation to study these interactions including atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy. Surface properties will be assayed using zeta potential measurements, potentiometric titrations and chemical derivatization techniques in conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will lead to a significantly improved fundamental understanding of nanoparticle behavior in aquatic environments, which will enable the rational synthesis of safe-by-design nanoparticles. The development of safe materials, including nanoparticles is a priority area for NSF and the nation. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in an area of research of great societal importance.</AbstractNarration>
