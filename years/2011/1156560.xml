<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Nebraska led by Andrzej Rajca, Mark Griep, and Marilyne Stains for three summers, commencing in 2012. The site will support nine students per summer in a ten week program. The projects focus on chemical assembly and are specifically tailored to stimulate student curiosity by provoking students to ask, "Why?" and "How?" about their research. Sample projects include: (1) assembling nanocluster catalysts; (2) late stage introduction of fluorine into drug-like molecules; (3) synthesis of conjugation/linking elements for nanohybrid materials; (4) rapid analysis of drug-protein interactions; (5) electrochemical sensors using biomolecules; (6) organic radicals for organic magnets, spin labels, and MRI contrast agents; (7) composite biomaterials for bone grafts; (8) assembly of graphene nanostructures with semiconductive properties; (9) macromolecular assembly as a switch for protein function; (10) noble metal nanocrystals with high index facets. In addition, students will develop skills in communicating their research to scientists (meeting abstract, poster and oral presentations) and science learners (development and enactment of a mini-lesson), they will learn about careers in both industry (through field trips) and academia, and they will be trained on state of the art instruments and in ethics. Through a competition, five students each year will receive a travel grant to travel and to present their research at a regional or national meeting of the American Chemical Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in chemical assembly of relevance to innovations in the areas of information technology, targeted medicines, functional materials, energy storage, and beyond. The site will provide opportunities for research to a significant number of students who might not otherwise be reached. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This outcomes report completes three years of our NSF-funded REU program, from 2012 to 2014. Our target was to recruit at least 60% of the students from underrepresented groups and for at least half our participants to present posters at a national or regional ACS meeting. We exceeded both these targets with the actual percentages being 74% and 59%, respectively.   During the three years of our REU program, we were very successful in attracting a large population of undergraduate student applicants, which enabled us to surpass our recruitment goals. The number of completed applications and, more importantly, qualified applicants (called First Filter) have increased every year of the program (Figure 1).   Specific Objectives and How They Were Reached:  (1) Develop skills in communicating their research to scientists (ACS Meeting abstract, poster and oral presentations)  All students attended 7 one-hour discussion sessions on the topic of communicating research to scientists. One of the outcomes was that each student wrote a research abstract in the style of an ACS poster style that emphasized first the societal good of the research, then stated the research area, hypothesis, methods, and finally the major research result. The other outcome was that each student prepared a poster that could be used to present her or his research at a national science meeting and practiced giving a 5-minute oral presentation. All students presented their posters in a competition at the UNL Chemistry Summer Research Symposium and at the UNL-wide Summer Research Symposium.  (2) Develop skills in communicating their research to science learners (development and enactment of a mini-lesson).  All students attended 4 one- or two-hour discussion sessions on the topic of communicating research to the public. The outcome was that each REU student prepared a slide show that described her or his research in terms of the topics encountered in either a General Chemistry course or an Organic Chemistry course and then presented it to the high school students working in the Department. In the second year of our program, we added a feature in which all REU students were shadowed for 4 half-days early in the summer by a high school student participating the UNL Upward Bound Math &amp; Science (UBMS) program. The goal was for each UBMS student to prepare a 5-minute slide show about the REU studentÆs research after visiting with the REU Student, the REU StudentÆs graduate mentor, and the REU StudentÆs Research Advisor. The UBMS students returned to the Department later in the summer to hear the REU students present a talk about their research. Our interactions with the UNL Trio office to set up the UBMS shadowing program led us to the parallel training of two or three high school students each summer in an ACS-sponsored Project SEED experience.  (3) Learn about careers in both industry (through field trips) and academia  Each year, there were field trips to three companies located within three miles of the UNL campus. The list of companies changed each year and included: Celerion, GSK (formerly Novartis Consumer Health), LI-COR, Lincoln Industries, Neogen Geneseek, Rieke Metals Inc., and Teledyne/ISCO. Prior to each trip, the students read either a newspaper article or promotional material about the company. Each trip lasted about one hour, began with an overview of operations by a researcher in that company, included a tour of the facilities, and ended with a question &amp; answer session.  (4) Trained on state of the art instruments  All students received an overview tour (30 minutes each) of the NMR, AFM, and Mass Spectrometry labs but then receive one-on-one training on their instrument of choice.   (5) Trained in ethics  All students attend the Scientific Ethics lecture given by one of the law college students working in the UNL Ethics Center. The focus is on authorship ethics, one case study, and awareness of online resources (http://ethics.unl.edu/ethics_res...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
