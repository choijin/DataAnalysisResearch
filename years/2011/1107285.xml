<AbstractNarration>The contribution of coastal margins to regional and global carbon budgets is&lt;br/&gt;not well understood, largely due to limited information about the magnitude, spatial distribution,&lt;br/&gt;and interannual variability of carbon sources and sinks in coastal waters. The Ocean Carbon &amp;&lt;br/&gt;Biogeochemistry (OCB) Program has been collaborating with the North American Carbon&lt;br/&gt;Program (NACP) over the past two years to develop a Coastal Interim Synthesis Activity as part&lt;br/&gt;of the NACP Interim Synthesis activities, the goals of which are to bring together relevant&lt;br/&gt;observations, data, and modeling efforts in an effort to identify and quantify key sources, sinks,&lt;br/&gt;stocks, fluxes, and associated processes in the North American carbon budget. The objective of&lt;br/&gt;the Coastal Interim Synthesis Activity is to synthesize individual, small-scale observational and&lt;br/&gt;modeling studies from different regions of the North American continental margin across&lt;br/&gt;broader spatial and temporal scales to improve quantitative assessments of the North American&lt;br/&gt;coastal carbon budget. Because the coastal oceans have important and complex linkages with&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial, atmospheric, and open ocean biogeochemical cycles, it is important to provide for the &lt;br/&gt;participation of researchers focused on both organic and inorganic carbon, as well as nitrogen&lt;br/&gt;and phosphorus cycle topics related to carbon balance and related issues such as hypoxia&lt;br/&gt;impacts on continental margins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support through this award to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), OCB &lt;br/&gt;scientists from WHOI, the University of Alaska - Fairbanks, and the University of South Florida &lt;br/&gt;will convene two workshops to facilitate data gathering and synthesis efforts related to coastal &lt;br/&gt;carbon budgets in five regions?East Coast (including Gulf of Maine), West Coast (including Gulf &lt;br/&gt;of Alaska), Gulf of Mexico, Arctic (including marginal seas such as the Bering, Chukchi, Beaufort, &lt;br/&gt;and Baffin-Labrador), and Great Lakes.  Additional funding to support these efforts will be provided &lt;br/&gt;by NASA and NOAA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Coastal margins represent a significant unknown in the North American&lt;br/&gt;carbon budget. By leveraging the shared community expertise of two leading U.S. carbon cycle&lt;br/&gt;science programs (NACP and OCB), this project will improve coastal carbon sink/source&lt;br/&gt;estimates and facilitate the community interaction needed to ensure a seamless transition&lt;br/&gt;between land and sea in our understanding of the most important processes driving the North&lt;br/&gt;American carbon cycle. The proposed approach convenes scientists with specialized&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of regionally important physical and biogeochemical processes to develop robust&lt;br/&gt;regional coastal carbon budgets that more effectively account for some of the inherent spatial&lt;br/&gt;and temporal variability of coastal systems. Another key outcome of this project will be a&lt;br/&gt;tremendously valuable historic dataset that will improve our understanding of the carbon cycle&lt;br/&gt;and inform public discussion and policy making on issues related to climate change, human&lt;br/&gt;health, and fisheries, all of which are intimately linked to carbon cycling. Recovery of these data&lt;br/&gt;and their incorporation into a publicly accessible data base will enhance the development of&lt;br/&gt;predictive models for coastal regions and also enable more comprehensive linkage of land,&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere, and ocean modeling of carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle. There are currently&lt;br/&gt;&gt;50 years of observations in most U.S. coastal regions, providing much-needed historical&lt;br/&gt;context to monitor the health of coastal ocean ecosystems, which are becoming increasingly&lt;br/&gt;vulnerable to threats of ocean acidification, eutrophication, and hypoxia.</AbstractNarration>
