<AbstractNarration>Social monogamy has long been of interest to anthropologists, primarily because it is a rare social system in mammals, but appears to be more prevalent among primates, and is especially common in humans. Although pair-bonds are considered an important component of human mating and parenting strategies, we understand relatively little about the dynamics of male-female relationships. Reviews of social monogamy across a wide range of taxa, including human societies, have demonstrated significant variation in male-female relationships, which has contributed to a longstanding debate regarding the functional significance of pair-bonds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project by doctoral student Amy Porter (University of California, Davis), supervised by Dr. Lynne Isbell, investigates comparative aspects of pair-bonding and territorial behavior in two socially monogamous primates, red titi monkeys (Callicebus discolor) and equatorial saki monkeys (Pithecia aequatorialis), in which males and females differ in their degrees of parental care and contributions to territorial behavior. This research will test the hypotheses that 1) differences in direct paternal care and the potential costs of cuckoldry and/or abandonment are related to differences in pair-mate relationships and male-female mate guarding strategies; and 2) vocal communication in titis and sakis is a component of their mate guarding strategies. The hypotheses are tested using systematically collected behavioral data and vocal playback experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fine-scale analysis of social interactions between pair-mates will contribute substantially to broader theoretical issues in evolutionary biology, especially those that relate to mating and parenting strategies. These data are particularly relevant to understanding our own species, where there is substantial variation in male-female relationships and the patterning of gender roles, both within and between populations. This research also will contribute to the field of ornithology by providing comparative data on how two socially monogamous mammals use vocal communication in mate-guarding and territoriality, two common behaviors in birds.</AbstractNarration>

Reviews of social monogamy across a wide range of species, including humans, have demonstrated considerable variability and flexibility in grouping and mating patterns. Empirical data that describe and quantify the variability remain rare, however. We conducted a 22-month comparative field study on red titi monkeys (<em>Callicebus discolor</em>) and equatorial saki monkeys (<em>Pithecia aequatorialis</em>), two phylogenetically closely related species that are both considered socially monogamous and territorial but show dramatic differences in their social relationships and the extent of paternal care. The main goal of our project was to develop a better understanding of pair-mate dynamics to assess the range of variation and flexibility that underlies monogamous social systems. During our study, we followed three groups of titis and three groups of sakis. We described pair-mate dynamics by quantifying species/sex differences in their relative contributions to affiliative behaviors (e.g., maintenance of social proximity/contact and grooming relationships), which we used as a proxy for investment in the pair-bond. We also monitored group demography and documented all observed interactions with extra-group individuals. Our observations revealed that sakis can frequently experience dynamic social environments, which can increase the reproductive options available to individuals. We documented the occurrence of groups with multiple adult males and described how these grouping patterns can affect the dynamics between group members, especially established pair-mates. More importantly, our observations are the first to describe sakis forming multi-male groups through immigration. Until now, immigration had only been described from animals moving into groups lacking same-sex residents. Our comparative study of two socially monogamous primates has relevance to mammalogy and especially to ornithology since 90% of birds are socially monogamous and pursue multiple and diverse mating strategies, including accepting/tolerating secondary males. Understanding pair-mate dynamics and how animals respond to changing social environments also contributes to broad theoretical issues in evolutionary biology, especially those involving mating and parenting strategies. Furthermore, these data provide key insights into the behavioral mechanisms that both maintain monogamy and/or lead to its dissolution. During the project we provided month-long internships to four undergraduate students and a one-year field assistantship position to a recent college graduate. Students were trained in field methodology to 1) collect behavioral data on titi and saki monkeys, 2) locate and follow animals using radio telemetry and natural tracking skills, 3) use GPS for territory mapping, 4) use GPS/maps/compass for navigating dense Amazonian forest off trail, and 4) manage data in Microsoft Access and Excel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/10/2014<br>      Modified by: Amy&nbsp;Porter</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
