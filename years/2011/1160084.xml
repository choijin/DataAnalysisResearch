<AbstractNarration>1160084&lt;br/&gt;Lin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal-organic-frameworks (MOF) represent a new group of microporous materials as membranes for gas and liquid separation applications. However, several fundamental issues unique for MOF membranes such as synthesis of thin MOF membranes and effects of adsorption induced structural change and thermal gradient on membrane separation properties have not been studied, and the unique separation properties of MOF membranes unattainable by traditional microporous inorganic membranes have not been explored for practical applications. This project is directed toward synthesis and characterization of thin, high flux microporous IRMOF-1 and ZIF-69 membranes and to study permeation and separation of these MOF membranes with a focus on understanding the effects of the adsorption induced structural change and thermal gradient on membrane transport properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will explore the unique property of large pore MOF membranes, i.e., the carbon dioxide perm-selectivity increases with pressure for high pressure separation of carbon dioxide from natural gas. All existing membranes exhibit a decreasing perm-selectivity with increasing pressure. The work includes developing synthesis methods for preparation of thin (less than 5 Ã¬m) large pore MOF membranes, identifying an adequate method for characterizing the quality of the MOF membranes, studying the permeation and separation properties of the MOF membranes at high pressures, and investigating adsorption induced structural change and thermal gradient on membrane characteristics. The membranes will be prepared by the secondary growth method with nano-sized MOF crystal seeds. A molecular probing method will be developed to examine the quality of the MOF membranes. Gas permeation of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen and hydrogen and separation properties of binary mixtures of these gases, particularly carbon dioxide/methane, for the IRMOF-1 and ZIF-69 membranes will be studied in a large pressure range (1-70 atm.) at 25-150C and compared with the results of modeling and molecular simulations. Structural changes and thermal gradient across the membranes during gas permeation will be studied and correlated to the gas permeation and separation properties of the membranes. The research conducted in this project will be transformational as it will address several major issues in synthesis, characterization and separation properties of membranes made from a new group of microporous materials. The results will be the basis for practical use of MOF membranes for separation of carbon dioxide from gas mixtures, in particularly natural gas, at high pressures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental work on synthesis and property study of IRMOF-1 and ZIF-69 membranes will expand inorganic membrane science which has so far been focused on metallic and metal oxide materials. The project will result in development of high performance membranes with good separation properties for gas mixtures containing CO2 at high pressures. One of the major applications of the membranes will be for natural gas purification to produce high pressure natural gas that is ready for transport in pipelines. The membranes will find other applications such as CO2 separation in pre-combustion carbon dioxide capture processes and will serve to increase industry's awareness of the many opportunities that exist for applying these new membranes. The combination of the unique properties of the MOF materials and thin film membrane technology represents a transformational approach to development of new membrane technologies for efficient separation of gas mixtures and will contribute to ensuring US competitiveness and technological lead in the area of CO2 capture. The project will also educate and train graduate and undergraduate students. In particular, female and minority students will be trained to become leaders in membrane science and separation technologies. An ASU graduate course in Inorganic Membranes and Membrane Separation Processes will incorporate the expanded perspectives resulting from the successful development of these MOF based gas separation devices. The project will also include the establishment of a laboratory demonstration unit using membranes for carbon dioxide separation for high school teachers and students as part of Arizona State University's "Science for Fun" outreach program.</AbstractNarration>

The membranes will find other applications such as CO2 separation for production of high purity CO2 and pre-combustion carbon dioxide capture processes. These high performance CO2 selective membranes will serve to increase industry?s awareness of the many opportunities that exist for applying these new membranes. This project was directed toward synthesis and characterization of two large pore metal organic framework membranes and study of separation properties of CO2 containing gas mixture by these membranes.  In this project, high quality IRMOF-1 and ZIF-68 membranes were reproducibly synthesized by improved seed or reactive seeding methods.  The IRMOF-1 and ZIF-68 membranes were found structurally stable in a myriad of organic solvents.  Mixture gas separation results with these membranes show high perm-selectivity for CO2 over N2 or CH4 due to preferential adsorption of CO2 on the IRMOF-1 framework. The selectivity is significantly enhanced at high CO2 partial pressure or molar fraction.  Such perm-selectivity for CO2 is not observed on ZIF-68 due mainly to weaker interaction between CO2 and ZIF framework. The project demonstrated application of the IRMOF-1 membrane with unique separation properties at high CO2 molar fraction and feed pressure for production of high purity CO2 from the low grade CO2 gas mixtures.  Lab-scale cross-flow gas separation tests with the small IFMOR-5 membrane disk show that high grade CO2 could be efficiently produced with industrial grade or lower CO2 feed gas by this novel IRMOF-1 membrane.   The project also trained three ASU Ph.D. students and three undergraduate students, including two female and one African American student.  Through working on the project, the Ph.D. students were trained with skills in chemical engineering and materials science.  In addition, the project trained three international exchange Ph.D. students and a post-doctoral fellow, who are becoming leaders in membrane research in their home countries.   The project provided opportunities not only for research and dissemination of ideas through publications in refereed journals, but also for outreach activities to get elementary and high school students involved in learning the impact of membranes on chemical and environmental industries.
