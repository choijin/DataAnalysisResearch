<AbstractNarration>Development in humans and other higher organisms creates complex,&lt;br/&gt;precisely defined multicellular structures and patterns. These&lt;br/&gt;structures are the result of molecular programs that are stored in the&lt;br/&gt;sequences and concentrations of biomolecules and are executed when&lt;br/&gt;molecules interact and change state through chemical reactions. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of this proposal is to understand how biochemical systems can be&lt;br/&gt;reliably programmed to form asymmetric patterns with multiple layers&lt;br/&gt;of organization. This proposal is part of a general goal to understand&lt;br/&gt;how to program global behavior and structure based on local rules,&lt;br/&gt;which a key intellectual challenge in many areas of computer science.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose that complex, hierarchical chemical patterns can be formed&lt;br/&gt;by systems in which the molecules collectively execute a molecular&lt;br/&gt;program for pattern formation.  The PIs will develop a&lt;br/&gt;chemical programming language in which information from simple input&lt;br/&gt;patterns is integrated by logical operations to form new pattern&lt;br/&gt;regions.  These logical operations are then systematically integrated&lt;br/&gt;into larger programs, allowing the generation of patterns with&lt;br/&gt;complex, multiscale structure similar to that seen in&lt;br/&gt;biology. Designed synthetic DNA molecules that together act as circuit&lt;br/&gt;elements will be used to implement this language. DNA molecules are&lt;br/&gt;ideal substrates for a molecular programming approach because they&lt;br/&gt;have complex sequences with predictable behaviors and interactions.&lt;br/&gt;This research is tightly integrated with an outreach program that will &lt;br/&gt;develop an educational program dedicated to teaching the&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary skills that are necessary to be successful in&lt;br/&gt;molecular programming.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Biology use molecules and reactions between them to generate cells,tissues and organismal body plans of staggering complexity.  Afundamental challenge in science and engineering is to understand howsuch structures can emerge and to create design principles forbuilding these structures.  One important question here is how basicorganizational principles can be scaled to produce structures ofincreasing complexity.  Computer science has developed many tools toask how to understand scaling and in this award we used thesetechniques, in combination with new ideas from molecular engineering,to understand how to build chemical "programs" for creating structurethat can scale. Our specific focus was on reaction-diffusion processes.  Within such aprocess, molecules may react with one another, changing their state oreliminating or creating species, and molecules may move according tothe laws of diffusion.  It is understood that these two processestogether could enable molecules which initially appeared well mix toeffectively differentiate into patterns such as stripes or spots,where stripes or spots had high concentrations of one type of moleculeand and other areas had relatively low concentrations.  But couldthese processes create patterns more complex than stripes or spots? During this award, we developed a theory to show that in principle,the answer is yes: *any* spatial pattern may be constructed give asingle, simple input pattern and the ability to design the reactionsbetween many molecules, the rates of these reactions and theirdiffusion rates. We also showed using the same model that suchpatterns could also change over time, much as the body plan of ananimal grows and changes.  These results suggest thatreaction-diffusion processes could be powerful agents of patterngeneration for structures and shapes of tissues or organs, not justsimple patterns like spots or stripes.  Further, our methods alsoshowed how we could build such patterns using a simple "patternprogramming language" and the ability to design molecules, reactionsand their diffusion rates. We felt that this development was of new interest at the time of theproposal's award because recent developments showed how a greatvariety of reactions could be engineered using syntheticoligonucleotides, or short DNA molecules.  Exchanging which DNA strandwas bound to which is a form of a reaction, as the shape of a bound"complex" can determine how species diffuse and react in the future.We developed a plan for constructing DNA molecules that couldimplement our reaction-diffusion processes based on experimentallytested models of DNA binding and exchange (called stranddisplacement), and we build these molecules with the goal ofimplementing reaction diffusion processes in the laboratory. WE found, as is often the case with experiments, that details of theconstruction and design of the molecules mattered a lot in terms oftheir function.  We found that in some cases it was difficult to buildmolecules that implemented only the desired exchange reactions withoutreacting in other intended ways.  We have, however, build a firstversion of these molecules and are preparing two papers forpublication about them. We also found that it was more challenging than expected to createenvironments where reaction-diffusion processes could occur in acontrolled fashion.  Diffusion occurs when convection is absent, butin many of our setups it was difficult to eliminate convection.  Thischallenge has been shared by other researchers.  After a couple ofyears of work we have now developed two setups for exploringreaction-diffusion processes.  We implemented a simple process thatshould be a building block for creating the reaction diffusionprocesses that we designed.   This work has served a building block for understanding patterngeneration using molecules and the simple physical processes ofreactions and diffusion.  During our explorations we also realizedthat reaction-diffusion processes may have interesting applications inmaterials design, making it possible to pattern and repatternmaterials as they are perturbed or damaged.  We are exploring ideasbehind self-healing chemical patterns in a new project.          Last Modified: 11/01/2016       Submitted by: Rebecca Schulman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
