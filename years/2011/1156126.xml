<AbstractNarration>Mechanical Nanofabrication, Nanopatterning, and Nanoassembly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal CMMI-1156126 seeks travel awards for graduate students, post-docs, as well as under-represented and junior faculty to attend and present at the four-day symposium on Mechanical Nanofabrication, Nanopatterning and Nanoassembly, to be held during the 2011 Materials Research Society Fall Meeting.   This symposium will bring together researchers in the area of basic mechanics, nanomechanics, and mechanics of materials with the engineers and industrialists developing and using mechanical means of nanoscale scalable manufacturing.   It will provide a forum to define and present problems and solution pathways through expanded scientific understanding of the underlying processes and multi-scale interfacial phenomena that govern mechanically based fabrication spanning nanoscopic to macroscopic dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of mechanics of nanofabrication is making rapid advances with the potential to greatly impact future scalable manufacturing strategies.   It is critical to assemble a diverse community that embraces this work at the interface. This community will promote continued scientific advancement and to encourage the development of new inter-disciplinary researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;?Encourage an inclusive community of researchers with interdisciplinary perspectives working on the mechanics of nanoscale manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;?Publicize recent advances in the mechanics of nanomanufacturing applied to industrial problems as well as novel fundamental theoretical insights&lt;br/&gt;?Initiate exchange of ideas and promote new multi-disciplinary collaborations among mechanical engineers, material scientists, chemists and industrialists&lt;br/&gt;?Enable junior scientists (including graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and junior faculty) to present their research findings and to interact with the community of established and prominent researchers in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds provided by NSF will be used to award 20 symposium participants with travel support of $500 each.   The goal of this support is to broaden the participation of a diverse group of junior researchers including women and underrepresented minorities who otherwise may be financially restricted from attending the symposium to present their research.</AbstractNarration>
