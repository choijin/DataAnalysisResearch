<AbstractNarration>The Great Tohoku Tsunami of 11 March 2011 has generated massive quantities of data that will be invaluable in helping to validate tsunami models such as the GeoClaw software being developed by the PI and his collaborators. This RAPID project will provide short-term support for two postdoctoral fellows and two graduate students to assist in collecting data and performing simulations. The main goals are to further validate the software and constituent numerical algorithms as tools for tsunami modeling, and to compare a variety of proposed earthquake source mechanisms for this event that have been developed by different groups of seismologists. Data sources will include NOAA DART buoys, tide gauges, videos and photographs, and post-tsunami surveys, both in the near field and far field. The postdoctoral fellows are experts in tsunami science who have experience in working with a variety of tsunami data, also have experience working with the GeoClaw software in their thesis work. The software implements high-resolution finite volume methods for the nonlinear shallow water equations, with provisions to robustly model inundation. Adaptive mesh refinement is incorporated to allow the efficient solution of the problem over the vast range of spatial scales required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tsunamis pose a severe threat to many coastal regions of the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The offshore Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) running from Northern California up to British Columbia periodically produces a magnitude 9 earthquake, generating a tsunami of magnitude similar to that seen in the Indian Ocean in 2004 or from the Japanese tsunami of 2011 (The last major CSZ tsunami was in 1700). The entire West Coast, Hawaii, and Alaska are also at risk from tsunamis arising from many other potential sources.  Hazard mitigation and early warning systems require accurate computer simulation tools based on mathematical models of the generation and propagation of tsunamis and the subsequent flooding and inundation along the coast. It is important to test these models against real events, and the 11 March 2011 Great Tohoku Tsunami provides a wealth of data from a variety of sources. Performing a careful series of computational experiments will assist in validating the computational model developed at the University of Washington and will guide the development of further improvements to the model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The GeoClaw software has previously been developed by the PI and collaborators  to compute approximate solutions to the fluid dynamics equations that model the propagation of a tsunami across the ocean and the inundation of coastal regions.  Tsunami models are an important tool in understanding past earthquakes and tsunamis and for hazard assessment and real-time warning.  Validation of tsunami models is necessary to assess how accurate they are, and comparison of model results with observations from past events is an important aspect of validation.  The primary goal of this project was to use the wealth of data generated by the 11 March 2011 Tohoku Tsunami off the coast of Japan to help validate the GeoClaw code for more general use in tsunami modeling.  Two detailed studies have been performed.  The first involved comparing observations of the tsunami at four locations in the Pacific Ocean with simulations, and comparing the computed and observed inundation on the Sendai Plain and at four other locations along the Sanriku coast of Japanese, north of Sendai.  In addition to comparing observations with simulations, this study involved also comparing 10 different tsunami "sources" that have been proposed for this event by different research groups using different inversion models.  Each "source" is an estimate of how the seafloor moved during the earthquake.  Since the seafloor motion cannot be measured directly, tsunami simulation is an important tool in studying the mechanics of the earthquake.  The second study compared the current velocity measured at gauges near Hawaii with velocities computed as part of the GeoClaw simulations.  Most past comparisons of tsunami models with observed data have concerned the height of the wave and/or the depth and extent of inundation. Until recently, few direct measurements of tsunami velocities existed to compare with model results. During the 11 March 2011 Tohoku Tsunami, 328 velocity gauges were in place around the Hawaiian Islands that captured time series of water velocity in 18 locations, in both harbors and deep channels, at various depths. This provided a rich set of data to perform comparisons of the velocities produced by the GeoClaw model with observations of this data.  Using one of the tsunami sources that was found to match observations well in the first study, the second study compared the GeoClaw results with the observations at 10 of the gauge locations around Hawaii.  Very good agreement was observed at most of the gauges, indicating that this simulation software may be useful in modeling tsunami currents as well as inundation.  Modeling tsunami currents could be extremely important in hazard modeling and real-time warning. The Tohoku tsunami alone is estimated to have caused $90 million in damages in the U.S., even though the highest waves arrived near low tide and there was little on-shore inundation. Most of the damage was to ships and infrastructure in harbors and marinas. Validation of the code for modeling flow velocities is thus quite important.  Testing the ability of GeoClaw to model tsunami currents is also an important step in the future goal of extending this model to handle sediment transport. Much of what is known about past earthquakes and tsunamis has been learned from the study of tsunami deposits, layers of sand and other marine sediments that are found far inland. Using numerical tsunami codes in the study of sediment transport, erosion, and deposition requires the ability to accurately estimate flow velocities and accelerations.
