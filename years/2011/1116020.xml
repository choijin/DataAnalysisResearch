<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial support for young physicists to attend either of the two sequential 46th Rencontres de Moriond conferences to be held in La Thuile, Italy: (1) Electroweak Interactions and Unified Theories (March 13-20, 2011) and (2) QCD and High Energy Hadronic Interactions (March 20-27, 2011). Moriond meetings in 2011 are transitional since, besides the experimental results to be reported from U.S.-based CDF, D0, PHENIX and STAR, increasing importance will be placed on the preparation for the LHC physics and commissioning of the detectors, in which the U.S. scientists play a major role. With LHC experiments being in the full commissioning mode with the first LHC beam data and vast amount of cosmics collected with the fully operational detectors in their underground experimental halls, one expects an increased number of LHC talks at the 2011 Moriond conference. Consequently, the 2010 Moriond remains a unique and excellent opportunity to both advertise the impressive U.S. science program in particle physics and at the same time to give our most talented young scientists extra visibility by allowing them to deliver their latest results at these two major European forums. Special efforts will be made to encourage women and minorities to participate.</AbstractNarration>

This partial support provided by the NSF grant allowed many young US high energy physicists to participate in these conferences which is very important for their career development. This also allowed US to capitalize on the recent particle physics successes by presenting new important results at the major European fora.
