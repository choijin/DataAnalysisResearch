<AbstractNarration>CURE is a year-round (though summer-centered) REU site that provides Astronomy-based research opportunities at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for underserved community college students from selected colleges in the Los Angeles area. Students (approximately 8 per year) work full time for 10 weeks during the summer, and have the option of continuing part-time during the academic year under the supervision of JPL scientists on various Astronomy-related projects, both at JPL and at JPL's Table Mountain Observatory. Research topics include high precision astrometry of occulting asteroids, photometry of near-Earth asteroids, design and testing of a compact Doppler magnetograph, and research into space optical communications systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CURE students are drawn exclusively from community colleges. In addition to being remarkably diverse in virtually every way, these students have often overcome great obstacles and challenges to get where they are. CURE provides them with a priceless opportunity to experience real science and real research ? an opportunity usually available only to four-year college and university students. In addition to providing underserved and minority students (many of whom are first generation college students) with valuable professional research experience, CURE's impact extends beyond the students it serves.  CURE connects community college faculty with cutting-edge research, keeping them up-to-date in the field, strengthens the relationship between community colleges and professional researchers, and provides valuable inspiration, incentive and modeling to all STEM students at the participating community colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CUREÆs primary function is to provide underserved two-year community college students with outstanding research opportunities at NASAÆs Jet Propulsion Laboratory that propel them to transfer and thrive at four year universities in STEM fields. CURE does this by carefully selecting, mentoring and guiding the students from application to the program, through preparation for the internship environment, then through the internship itself with carefully chosen JPL mentors, group activities and counseling, and finally ending with guidance through to transfer.  This end-to-end format has proven highly successfully, with virtually all CURE interns successfully transferring to four-year universities in STEM majors.  This is especially noteworthy given the often challenging circumstances of the community college students: many of them are first-generation college students, many have limited economic means, some are single parents, most have second jobs, and all have little access to academic resources and attend schools with limited or no support for academic research programs.  This iteration of CURE (it has been funded continually in one form or another for about 12 years) marks its transition to a completely community-college based program, based at Los Angeles City College.  CURE students are chosen from one of six consortium two-year schools: L.A. City College, L.A. Valley College, East L,A. College, Pasadena City College, Moorpark College and Victor Valley College. All but Moorpark College are HSIÆs. Students at community colleges almost never have access to research projects or the kind of high-level research environment that CURE affords them. For almost all of our students, CURE is their first foray into the "real" academic/research world, and it is, without exception, a transformative experience for them, their families, and the schools from which they come.  CURE has served 34 students over the last three years, 23 of whom were either women, minorities or older "second chance" students who were entering (or re-entering) the academic world after changing their life circumstances for the better. All but one have gone on to transfer to four-year universities in STEM fields, and credit CURE with greatly facilitating (or even inspiring) that transition.
