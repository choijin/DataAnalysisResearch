<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Glenn Schwartz and an international team of colleagues and students will conduct two seasons of excavation and geophysical survey at Kurd Qaburstan, southwest of Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan (Kurdish Regional Government).  This work will study the emergence and functioning of a large urban center of northern Mesopotamia, as a counterpoint to the well-known trajectories of urbanization in southern Mesopotamia.  The study of Mesopotamian urbanism and its possible variability is of particular importance because Mesopotamia was the first civilization to produce cities and urban societies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the largest sites (118 hectares) on the Erbil plain of northern Mesopotamia, Kurd Qaburstan has a small high mound and an extensive lower town enclosed by a city wall.  According to surface materials, the lower town was occupied in the early second millennium BC (Old Babylonian period, ca. 2000-1600 BC), while the high mound was inhabited from ca. 3000 BC to 500 AD.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary analysis suggests that Kurd Qaburstan is ancient Qabra, capital of the Erbil plain in the second millennium BC.  The capture and defeat of Qabra by the Mesopotamian conqueror Shamshi-Adad ca. 1800 BC was the subject of two monumental stone steles now housed in the Louvre and in the Baghdad Museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the lower town at Kurd Qaburstan is primarily datable to the Old Babylonian era, it provides an excellent opportunity to study a northern Mesopotamian city from that period in great detail.  The depositional accumulation on the lower town is relatively modest, so excavation can expose very large extensions of occupation from one period.  The project will provide new information on the layout, neighborhoods, households, and public structures of a north Mesopotamian metropolis preserved below the present-day surface at Kurd Qaburstan.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will thus provide a rare opportunity to study an entire Mesopotamian city at one point in its history.  Such a study was attempted in southern Mesopotamia by Elizabeth Stone at Tell Abu Duwari but was cut short by the first Gulf War.  Stone proposed a model of heterarchy to understand the organization of southern Mesopotamian urban populations.  However, there is reason to suspect that north Mesopotamian urbanism took a distinctly different form from that of southern Mesopotamia, given the ecological differences between the two regions.  Therefore, the project will test Stone's model to see if it is applicable to a north Mesopotamian city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also study urban and socio-political development through focusing on under-researched variables like ritual, religion and ideology.  In the center of Kurd Qaburstan is a conical mound likely to be a ziggurat, part of a temple complex.  Excavation in such a complex with an anthropological approach, studying faunal, archaeobotanical, and microstratigraphic debris, will illuminate the functioning of religious organizations in the development of early urbanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geophysical survey will be implemented on the lower town to produce a map of subsurface architecture and acquire a picture of the early second millennium town plan.  Such data will also supply useful information on areas for excavation.  Excavation on the high tell will include a step trench to document the stratigraphic sequence of the site history and horizontal exposures of the presumed temple area.   On the lower town, excavations will aim for broad exposures of Old Babylonian period occupation.  The retrieved artifacts, animal bones and plant remains will be studied by relevant specialists to determine patterns of economic and social organization and lifeways in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kurd Qaburstan project will have a number of broader impacts.  Most broadly, the project will expand our understanding of ancient urbanism and of cities in general, why people began to live in cities, and how city life functioned.  The project will include and train colleagues and students from Iraqi Kurdistan, which is only recently developing its own archaeological infrastructure after suffering extensively under the regime of Saddam Hussein.  Students and colleagues from the U.S., U.K., Italy, Belgium, and other countries will also participate and undergo training in archaeological field techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Johns Hopkins University Kurd Qaburstan project conducted three seasons of archaeological excavation and one study season at the site of Kurd Qaburstan on the Erbil plain of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq in 2013-2017. Through this work, the project has acquired new insights on the nature of urban life and urban civilization in northern Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC (Middle and Late Bronze Age).  Although Mesopotamia is well-known as the birthplace of cities and urban civilization, archaeology has previously focused on southern Iraq and neglected the north, partly due to political reasons.  The Kurd Qaburstan project is correcting this imbalance with the study of urbanism at a site in northern Iraq/Kurdistan, providing new information on the layout, neighborhoods, households, fortifications, and temples of this ancient city.    Our research has demonstrated that Kurd Qaburstan was a large, walled city (109 hectares, 273 acres) in the Middle Bronze period (ca. 2000-1600 BC), perhaps ancient Qabra, capital of a powerful Middle Bronze Age kingdom.  Excavations of the Middle Bronze occupation has revealed residential architecture, a storage area with extensive collections of complete ceramic vessels, and a large paved open area ("plaza").    Further, the excavations have exposed the city wall and dated it to the Middle Bronze Age, as well as a fortification wall and tower ringing the central high mound and a public building adjacent to it with walls preserved 3 meters (9 feet) high. These excavations supply the first sizeable body of Middle Bronze artifactual materials from the Erbil plain and make an important contribution to Middle Bronze archaeology in northern Mesopotamia in general.  Complementing the excavations are the results of magnetometry survey, providing a map of ca. 45 hectares (113 acres) of the site, revealing the complex make-up of the Middle Bronze settlement. Neighborhoods of houses and streets are observable, as well as open spaces (markets?) and the city wall, with towers at 20 meter intervals.  This dense occupation contradicts ideas of Kurd Qaburstan as a "hollow" (sparsely populated) city, which Middle Bronze cities are sometimes theorized to be.    Particularly remarkable among the magnetometry results is a large building with two square courtyards, probably a temple, given close parallels to religious buildings elsewhere in Mesopotamia.  Brief excavations at the end of the 2017 season confirmed the Middle Bronze date of the building, a structure that clearly deserves further investigation.  After the Middle Bronze period, the city was drastically reduced in size.  Occupation in the Late Bronze Age, the period of the Mittani empire (ca. 1500-1300 BC) has been studied in excavations on the high mound.  Here, high status residential architecture had a bathroom and toilet and elaborate drainage facilities.  A workshop for the manufacture of bone tools was excavated, and four graves provided information on Mittani burial practices, including an unusual set of clay human statuettes (ancestral figures?). These results provide the first substantial information on the archaeology of the Mittani period on the Erbil plain and a major infusions of Mittani period data for all of Kurdistan/northern Iraq.  Analyses of plant and animal materials from the 2nd millennium levels at the site have generated important results.  Archaeobotanical analyses of flotation samples have revealed a range of plants, with barley and wheat predominant.  The analysis of animal bones shows the popularity of sheep and goat in both periods, but surprising is the frequency of cattle and pig, indicating a relatively wet environment despite expectations of a period of aridity in the second millennium BC.    In addition to 2nd millennium BC results, the project has also acquired data on a cemetery from the period of Achaemenid Persian empire (ca. 550-330 BC).   The Achaemenid era is poorly documented in northern Iraq, so the acquisition of burial material is an important step in learning more about life in this period.  The burials yielded informative artifacts like bronze personal items and stone and frit cylinder and stamp seals, in addition to the human remains.  In conclusion, the Kurd Qaburstan project has produced a substantial body of data on the nature of urban life in the 2nd millennium BC in a northern Mesopotamian city, allowing us to test hypotheses on social and political organization, economy, and other issues.  Since northern Iraq, and particularly the Kurdistan region, has had relatively little archaeological documentation of the 2nd millennium BC, this research fills an important gap, both on local developments and on the nature of Mesopotamian urbanism in general.
