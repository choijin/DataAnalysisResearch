<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Colorado State University to continue an REU Site program that will provide research training for ten undergraduates for 10 weeks, during the summers of 2012-2014. Students will participate in a program that exposes them to a broad range of research areas and approaches in biochemistry and molecular biology. Students will work with mentors from College of Natural Sciences (Biochemistry and Molecular Biology). Students will be involved in their own research project where they learn how to formulate and test hypotheses, design and execute experiments, analyze results in the context of the hypothesis, and use state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation. Interactions with faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and professional research staff provide a mechanism for learning about the latest advances in biochemistry and molecular biology. Students receive a stipend, free housing in a university residence hall or apartment building, a meal allowance, and an allowance to defray travel to/from the site. At the end of the program, students will present their research results orally and through a poster, and produce a final report in manuscript form. In addition to research, students will engage in activities that will enhance their knowledge of the environment such as an educational hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park. Field trips to nearby government labs and biotech companies as well as workshops on GRE preparation, the ethical conduct of research, and scientific careers are also planned. The program will use the BIO REU Sites common assessment tool to obtain feedback and assessment data for improving the program. Students with limited opportunities for research and those from groups under-represented in science are especially encouraged to apply. For further information, students may visit http://www.bmb.colostate.edu/reu.cfm, or contact Yvonne Bridgeman at 970-491-5602 or reubiochem@colostate.edu, or the Program Director, Paul Laybourn, at 970-491-5100 or Paul.Laybourn@colostate.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Molecular Biosciences Summer REU Site: </strong>Program participants receive a $5,250 stipend for the 10-week program, a $1,800 food allowance, a room in a university apartment building, student campus services, up to $800 to defray travel to/from the site, and $400 toward their research expenses. The <strong>objective</strong> of this program is to expose undergraduates to the broad range of research areas and approaches that constitute the modern discipline of molecular life sciences. The <strong>targeted student participants</strong> are from institutions with high concentrations of underrepresented minorities and where opportunities for research are limited. The <strong>intellectual focus</strong> within the context of the individual research experiences is for the students to learn how to formulate and test hypotheses, how to design and execute experimental tests, how to problem-solve and trouble-shoot, how to analyze results in the context of the hypothesis, and how to use state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation. Both the individual research experiences and the interactions with faculty and lab members provide a mechanism for learning about the latest advances in molecular life sciences. Briefly, the participant timetable is to begin communicating with the mentor in the month prior to arrival to obtain background information and to begin formulating possible projects. By the second week of the program participants have learned many new techniques and turned in a preliminary project proposal. By the fourth week of the program participants are well into their projects and have submitted a formal project proposal. In the tenth week the participants wrap up their projects, present their results orally and through a poster and turn in a final report in manuscript form. In the first three weeks the students get to know each other and participants in other summer programs through a ropes course, white water rafting, and hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park. They also take field trips to nearby government labs and biotech companies, participate in an ethics workshop and panel discussion on scientific careers. &nbsp;Two alumni return during the last week of the summer session each year.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> This REU site trains and encourages gifted undergraduate students to pursue a career in molecular biosciences.
