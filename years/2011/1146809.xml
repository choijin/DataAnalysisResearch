<AbstractNarration>Nerve cells communicate by sending electrical impulses along thin protrusions called axons.  One mechanism by which animals increase velocity of electrical impulses is to expand axons' cross-sectional area.  This expansion is caused by an accumulation of microscopic space-filling protein polymers called neurofilaments, which are transported into axons where they form a dynamic scaffold. This collaborative project will use microscopic imaging in conjunction with computational modeling to test the hypothesis that neurofilament accumulation in axons is caused by a slowing of neurofilament transport, much as cars pile up on highways when the traffic slows. This project will provide a rigorous and quantitative framework that relates the size and shape of axons, which is a key influence on their electrical properties, to the motile behavior of their internal constituents.  This work will also shed light on the mechanism by which neurofilaments accumulate abnormally and excessively within axons in many neurodegenerative diseases.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a unique training opportunity at the interface of computational and experimental biology for students with diverse backgrounds in the physical and life sciences. An emphasis will be placed on mentoring undergraduates lacking prior research experience, including women and minorities, through annual Research Experiences for Undergraduates fellowships. The investigators will also reach out to undergraduates by participating together in the Research for Undergraduates: Adventures in Mathematical Biology and its Applications curriculum at Ohio State University, which is an NSF-funded Undergraduate Biology and Mathematics program, and by serving as joint mentors in the Undergraduate Summer Research Program of the NSF-funded Mathematical Biosciences Institute at Ohio State University. Lastly, a neurofilament wiki page will be developed featuring information and resources on mathematical modeling of axonal transport to support these outreach activities and to facilitate the exchange of data between the two laboratories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This was a collaborative interdisciplinary project between a biologist at Ohio State University (Anthony Brown) and a physicist at Ohio University (Peter Jung).  A unique feature of this project was the tight integration of experimental and computational modeling approaches to test hypotheses about a fundamental problem in neuroscience.  This project focused on neurofilaments, which are microscopic protein polymers in the cytoplasm of nerve cells.  Nerve cells extend long cytoplasmic processes called axons, which conduct nerve impulses. Neurofilaments are space-filling architectural elements in the cytoplasm of nerve cells that function to increase the cross-sectional area of axons, thereby increasing the rate at which they propagate nerve impulses.  The expansion of axon caliber during development is caused by an accumulation of these polymers, but neurofilaments also accumulate excessively in axons in many neurodegenerative diseases, and mutations in neurofilament proteins can cause peripheral neuropathy.  It is therefore important to understand the biology of neurofilaments and how their accumulation in axons is regulated.  Our laboratory has discovered that neurofilaments are transported along axons in a rapid intermittent manner, which that can be likened to ?stop and go? traffic on a highway.  We believe that nerve cells control axonal neurofilament content, and thereby axonal morphology, by regulating the number of moving neurofilaments and the average velocity at which they move.   We also believe that perturbations of neurofilament transport may explain the abnormal accumulation of axonal neurofilaments that occurs in neurodegenerative diseases.  Previous studies have shown that the accumulation of neurofilaments in developing axons is influenced by myelinating cells, which are cells that wrap axons in an insulating sheath called myelin. Neurofilaments accumulate preferentially in myelinated axons, suggesting that myelinating cells may influence neurofilament transport.  In our project, we developed computational and experimental approaches to analyze the kinetics of neurofilament transport in myelinated axons.  We used fluorescence microscopy to observe the movement, and computational modeling to extract information about the neurofilament velocity and pausing behavior from the experimental data.   Our research had two goals.  First, we investigated the influence of myelination on neurofilament transport and axonal caliber.  We found that myelinating cells induce axons to expand by locally slowing of neurofilament transport. We showed that this slowing is due principally to an increase in the proportion of the time that the filaments spend pausing.  This implies that myelinating cells can regulate axonal morphology by signaling locally to regulate neurofilament transport in the axons that they invest.  Second, we investigated the regulation of neurofilament transport at nodes of Ranvier, which are sites along myelinated axons at which nerve impulses are propagated.  Intriguingly, axons are also constricted abruptly and locally at these sites. Using computational modeling, we showed that these constrictions are important functionally because they further increase the conduction velocity of myelinated axons.  However, they also represent potential bottlenecks for neurofilament transport.  We found that neurofilaments navigate these potential bottlenecks by accelerating locally in the constricted regions, much as the current increases where a river narrows its banks.  In this way, axons maintain a stable morphology across these important sites.  Thus, this project has established a link between neurofilament transport and axonal morphology that has important implications for axonal physiology.  More broadly, this work has also fostered a vibrant interdisciplinary training environment for graduate, undergraduate and high school students at the interface of physics and biology, and has resulted in 5 publications as well as 3 others that are in preparation.
