<AbstractNarration>Arid ecosystems cover one third of Earth's land surface, and many have levels of endemism as high as tropical biomes. Despite supporting a rich biodiversity, arid ecosystems are generally overlooked as models for investigating evolutionary processes. The southern Africa region is characterized by a high interior plateau bounded on three sides by a steep escarpment, the presence of a west-to-east gradient of increasing moisture, and hyper-arid to humid habitats. This complex topography and climatic variation is reflected at the landscape level with seven distinct vegetation types or biomes. Despite a large number of endemic species (the greatest regional concentration in Africa), the role of evolutionary, ecological and climatic processes in shaping bird population histories has been sorely neglected in southern African arid ecosystems. This proposal aims to understand the processes that have driven the diversification of 12 bird taxa in the southern African arid zone by fully utilizing the tools provided by molecular ecology and species-distribution modelling.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collaboration between the University of California-Berkeley, Texas A&amp;M University, and several southern African institutions -- including universities, museums and conservation agencies -- this proposal will include the training and exchange of graduate and postdoctoral scholars, and involve undergraduate students in research.</AbstractNarration>

Despite supporting a rich biodiversity, arid ecosystems are generally overlooked as model systems for investigating evolutionary processes that may have led to high diversity. Southern Africa has 98 endemic and 62 near-endemic bird species whose evolutionary ages range from the Oligocene to the Pleistocene. The region is characterized by a high interior plateau bounded on three sides by a steep escarpment and the presence of a west-to-east gradient of increasing moisture, resulting in hyper-arid to humid habitats. This complex topography and climatic variation is reflected at the landscape level with seven distinct vegetation types. The southern African arid zone comprises five distinct biomes: Succulent Karoo, Nama Karoo, Fynbos, Grassland and Kalahari Savanna. Despite having these distinct biomes, the southern African arid zone is often regarded as a continuous landscape. However, the few phylogeography studies of southern African small mammals and reptiles have revealed a strikingly congruent pattern of divergence within the arid zone, between NW and SE clades, and there is a strong indication that these taxa are geographically structured in association with particular biomes; similar studies are generally lacking for birds. The structure evident in small mammals and reptiles is suggestive of a pattern of ecological specialization, but our knowledge of spatial genetic structure within southern African vertebrates and the underlying processes (e.g. climate change and landscape heterogeneity, especially across ecotonal boundaries) driving populations&rsquo; histories remains poor.

Our second study of another endemic arid-associated bird species complex remarkably showed this same pattern.
