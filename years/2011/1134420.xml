<AbstractNarration>1134420/1134121&lt;br/&gt;Porter/Sarkar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bubbles with diameters less than 7 Âµm with a narrow size distribution will be created that can help in diagnosis of several diseases through ultrasound imaging. They will be chemically engineered with a lipid shell such that they are 1) of a single size, 2) able to attach to molecules associated with a specific disease, and 3) have a unique acoustic signature based upon size and shell material properties. Targeting different bubbles to different molecules expressed by diseased cells, one can develop an accurate and cost effective ultrasound-based diagnostic system.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: One of the main innovations of this effort lies in the ability to control the size of these bubbles. It will allow an accurate investigation of their acoustic properties, specifically their resonance frequency&amp;#61630;where they are most efficient to reflect diagnostic ultrasound&amp;#61630;as a function of radius, acoustic pressure, and lipid shell composition. The other innovation is physics-based accurate modeling of bubble behavior. Mechanistic models that can accurately relate the molecular composition of the encapsulating lipid shell to a bubble?s acoustic signature will be developed. Experimental and theoretical methods will be utilized to evaluate the relationship between the nonlinear viscoelastic properties (i.e. the rheological relations between the stress and the deformation) of the shell and the ultrasound excitation.  The distinctive feature of the model development is the dual experimental approach, where two separate sets of experiments will be used for the determination of model parameters and the independent model validation. There will be a close connection between the model development and the experiments where each effort will be constantly guided by and calibrated against the other.  The results from the experimental measurements and theoretical predictions will be used to formulate a suite of lipid-coated microbubbles with distinct scattering spectra.  Finally, tests will be performed to assess the ability to detect small concentrations of monodisperse lipid-coated microbubbles and distinguish echogenic signatures from distinct populations.  The knowledge gained from this study will lead to the development of novel imaging schemes to specifically detect lipid-coated microbubbles targeted to multiple biomarkers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The new frontier for molecular imaging is the simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers of disease with a single diagnostic imaging modality.  This is possible provided contrast agents for a specific modality targeting different biomarkers can be distinguished from each other within an image.  Ultrasound may be used for this molecular imaging application provided targeted lipid-coated microbubbles with unique frequency-dependent scattering characteristics (i.e. radiated pressure signal) can be engineered.  Because the scattering characteristics depend upon microbubble radius and shell material properties, tight control over the microbubble size distribution and the viscoelastic properties of the lipid shell are required to achieve this goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education: One graduate student in each university will be involved in this project working towards their doctoral dissertation. Both PIs are committed to spread engineering to minority students. PI-Porter serves as the faculty advisor the student-governed Minority Engineers' Society at BU, and will provide research opportunities for its members during the academic year. PI-Sarkar has already established a contact with a Professor (letter of support) in Morgan State University (HBCU) to recruit minority student intern in his lab for the summer. PI-Porter will host at least two undergraduate students each summer research student funded by the BU Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (letter of support) to work on the production and characterization of targeted lipid-coated microbubbles. PI-Sarkar has a history of involving undergraduates in his contrast microbubble research, resulting in a publication coauthored by an undergraduate. Two undergraduate students will be working in his lab on this project. He will also connect the research lab to the very successful ?Engineering Cool Stuff? program run by the UD Engineering Outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Diagnostic ultrasound imaging is used heavily for evaluating the health and function of the cardiovascular system.  Contrast agents are used to improve the quality of the images and thus the ability of doctors to detect abnormal function.  Microbubbles coated with lipids, a major component of cell membranes, are the preferred contrast agent for diagnostic ultrasound imaging.  When subjected to an ultrasound pulse, microbubbles oscillate and radiate sound waves back to the ultrasound probe.  The radiated sound waves are strongest, and the contrast enhancement is optimized, when the microbubbles are excited at their resonance frequency.  In this project, we tailored the resonance frequency for lipid-coated microbubbles by controlling bubble radius and varying the composition of the lipid shell.  By measuring the attenuation coefficient, which represents the power loss from a wave traveling through a microbubble suspension, over a range of frequencies, we were able to identify the resonance frequency for different lipid-coated microbubble suspensions.  Unexpectedly, the resonance frequency varied with the pressure amplitude of the transmitted ultrasound pulse.  This behavior is not observed in fluids or tissues and is a unique feature of the lipid-coated microbubbles.  A systematic study was conducted to understand the relationship between bubble size, lipid coating, and pressure-dependent resonance frequency.  Theoretical models that simulated oscillations of lipid-coated microbubbles were employed to estimate the elasticity and viscosity of the shells as a function of lipid composition. This allowed for direct quantitative comparison of lipid-coated microbubbles with respect to shell properties and oscillatory behavior.  As a result of the studies, we learned that coating microbubbles with larger lipids led to an increase in resonance frequency and weakened the dependence of resonance frequency on transmitted pressure.  Additionally, the experimental and theoretical tools developed through the project can be leveraged for the production of lipid-coated microbubbles with predetermined acoustic properties, including resonance, attenuation, and scatter.  The newfound insight into the unique nonlinear behavior of lipid-coated microbubbles can be utilized in the design of ultrasound pulsing and processing schemes, which will lead to enhanced image contrast and quality and improve the diagnostic value of the imaging modality. Lastly, the project has provided numerous undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to enrich their academic background and acquire new skills in multiple disciplines, including materials science, biochemistry, fluid mechanics, physics, and acoustics.
