<AbstractNarration>Biologists know a great deal about how the process of development makes a brain, but less about the mechanisms employed during the evolution of brain diversity. The proposed research integrates the disciplines of ecology, evolutionary genetics and molecular biology to determine how some of the earliest events in an organism's lifetime lead to differences in brain organization, and ultimately to differences in behavior. Expected outcomes include the identification of developmental signaling pathways that organize embryonic brains and the means by which changes in these pathways drive ecologically relevant brain diversification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include (i) an integrative understanding of the relationship between animal development and behavior, (ii) the training of female and science-minority postdoctoral scientists, and (iii) creative educational programs for inner city Atlanta elementary schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Our research project has changed the way scientists think about how brains evolve and develop over time.  The textbook interpretation of how brains evolve diversity (that is, how and why a human brain is different than a mouse brain) has held for some time that relatively late changes in embryonic development are the root cause. This theory is called "late equals large."  Our research, using genetics and molecular biology in Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, showed that very early developmental changes can also play a role in brain evolution. In particular, changes in molecular signals at gastrula stage, when the 'brain' is only a single-cell thick sheet called the neural plate, seem to be paramount.  Our research thus expands the developmental window within which evolution is known to 'tinker' with brain development, and adds early stages as important phases of evolutionary development.  In addition, our research team used brains, Lake Malawi cichlid diversity and animal behavior &amp; development to interact with young learners in the Atlanta Public School system. We participated in helping to craft lesson plans for new elementary school standards in the state of Georgia, and implemented a video conferencing strategy to reach many students. Our video conferencing units donated to are elementary schools allow students to participate in educational objectives beyond this project.
