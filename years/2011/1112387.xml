<AbstractNarration>In this proposal, Professor Stoll of Georgetown University will synthesize and characterize nanostructured electron doped magnetic semiconductors. The work is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry.  A new route was discovered to produce both nanoparticles as well as nanorods of lanthanide chalcogenide semiconductors, which is easily adapted for doping studies.  These novel materials may have useful applications in microelectronic devices, and should provide important mechanistic details of electronic and magnetic coupling in these unusual materials.  Nanoparticles have been prepared by solution thermolysis of molecular precursors to form Eu1-xGdxS materials. The ferromagnetic ordering temperature can be increased by tuning the doping level, x.  In addition, using hydrothermal synthesis it is possible to synthesize Eu2O3 nanowires and nanorods that can be chemically converted into EuO nanomaterials maintaining morphology and single crystal structures.  This procedure should provide a route to forming Gd doped EuO materials.  This proposal will study the effect of electron doping (Gd) on magnetic semiconductors EuS and EuO, as well as the effect of morphology (nanoparticle diameter and nanowire structures).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the study of magnetic semiconductors which have applications in both data storage and information processing.  The work is highly interdisciplinary between chemistry and physics, and involves both the synthesis and characterization of novel nanostructured magnetic materials.  The team spans the educational ladder from high school seniors to senior graduate students, who work in a collaborative laboratory setting.  In order to fully characterize these materials, a new collaboration has been established with a faculty at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris.  The PI is also involved in outreach programs as co-Director of Science in the Public Interest, which introduces science students to science policy in government.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF award (CHE-112387) for the proposal, "Electron Doping in Magnetic Semiconductors", began September 2011 with a no-cost extension to November 2015. The goals of this project were to study the conversion chemistry of single crystal Eu2O3 nanowires into nanowires of the magnetic semiconductors EuO, EuS and EuSe, in addition to investigating gadolinium doping.  The europium chalcogenides have demonstrated potential as materials for spin filters, magnetic tunnel junctions, magnetic random access memory, and colossal magnetoresistance.  Our interest was to develop the synthesis of shape and composition controlled nanowires of magnetic semiconductors.  In investigating the possibility for shape controlled synthesis of magnetic semiconductors, our initial strategy was to chemically transform materials in a step-wise fashion from single crystal nanowire hydroxides.  In the first step, we found that the hydrothermal synthesis of single crystal nanowires of Eu(OH)3 can produce single crystal nanowires of Eu2O3 under controlled conditions.  We studied this transformation as a function of temperature under vacuum, we were able to demonstrate that single crystal Eu2O3 nanowires are formed only when the material transforms through a crystalline EuO(OH) intermediate.  In air, the transformations occurred at higher temperatures, through an amorphous intermediate, in which case all morphology was lost.  The advantage of single crystal Eu2O3 nanowires as a starting material is the ability to prepare EuO (reaction with Eu vapor), EuS (reaction with H2S vapor), and EuSe (reaction with H2Se vapor) while maintaining the overall shape.  A manuscript detailing the template conversions of Eu2O3 into magnetic semiconductors and the factors that influence morphology, composition, and crystallinity was reported in Chemistry of Materials.  We were also invited to write a review of europium chalcogenides, which recently appeared in Coordination Chemistry Reviews.               In our studies of the conversion of Eu2O3 to EuS, we discovered unintentional sodium doping forming Eu1-xNaxS for x = 0-0.5.  Doping with the non-magnetic alkali metal has an impact on the magnetic properties, as well as the europium valence, which we studied using 151Eu M&ouml;ssbauer Spectroscopy and reported in Chemistry of Materials.  We have recently discovered we can control the structure of the alkali metal doped material, whether it is an ordered aNaFeO2 (i.e. NaEuS2) or a disordered rock salt structure, and are currently investigating the consequences of order on the optical and magnetic properties.  This award has contributed to the training of 4 PhD students, an MS, and 4 undergraduates.  This work was central to an invited talk at the Inorganic Chemistry Gordon Conference (summer 2012), as well as invited talks at the ACS National Meeting in Indianapolis, invited talk in the Cotton Synthetic Inorganic Awards session in honor of Greg Robinson (New Orleans 2013), workshops in Japan and India, as well as 7 University seminars.  One student, Nick Rosa, recently continued this work in Japan on the NSF-East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes for Graduate Students in the summer of 2015. Students have presented this work at:  National ACS meetings (San Diego 2012, Anaheim 2011), Mid-Atlantic Regional Meeting (2012, 2011), Nanomaterials Symposium at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (student won a poster award) as well as the Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) in Scalable Functional Nanomaterials in Costa Rica 2011 (2 student travel awards) and CERM (Pittsburg 2014).
