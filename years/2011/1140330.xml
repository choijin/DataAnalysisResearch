<AbstractNarration>This project is connecting the biology and chemistry curricula as well as increasing the number of inquiry-based laboratory modules by incorporating a common research theme into select courses. The General Chemistry lab is being revised to introduce all biology and chemistry students to fundamental scientific concepts using a discovery-based approach to solve real-world problems such as carbon dioxide release and biofuel combustion. Research experiences are being introduced into four additional courses - two in biology and two in chemistry. These linked courses are introducing students to the purest form of inquiry by having them synthesize anticancer ruthenium complexes and conduct research on the chemical and biological properties of this new class of drug. All modules incorporate elements of the gradualism approach in which students start off with highly structured, well-defined tasks that focus on building basic skills and then progress to more open-ended projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes of this project include improved critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. The activities are helping students develop an integrated view of modern science as they tackle a real-world problem - drug development - from both biological and chemical perspectives. Student collaborations on research within and across courses is building a stronger sense of community among biology and chemistry majors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was to increase the amount of inquiry in biology and chemistry course-associated labs at Birmingham-Southern College (BSC).  This goal was achieved through development and implementation of research and research-like experiences wherein students focus on "real world" problems including cancer treatment, carbon dioxide release, and biofuel combustion.  Specifically, we revised BSCÃ†s General Chemistry (CH 120) labs and integrated bona fide research on anti-cancer ruthenium complexes into four other courses &ndash; one lower and one upper level course in each discipline.  The revised labs impacted a total of 422 students and the effects on students were thoroughly assessed using multiple evaluation approaches including observation, surveys, focus groups, and analysis of lab reports. Combined these data demonstrated that the revised laboratory curricula improved student confidence as well as their ability to (1) apply scientific skills, (2) articulate cross-disciplinary concepts, and (3) conduct high quality undergraduate research.

In addition to verifying the benefits of inquiry- and research-based laboratory activities, this project demonstrated that added value can be gained by linking courses from different disciplines with a shared research theme. This project also documented uninformed overconfidence as a potentially confounding variable in pedagogical research.  Specifically, data generated through this work suggests that studentsÃ† lack of experience with specific skills can lead them to overestimate their abilities.  Thus discipline-based education researchers should be encouraged to assess student self-perceptions not only before and after a pedagogical intervention, but also in the midst of administering the revised curriculum. The additional data that results can aid in correcting for uninformed overconfidence.
