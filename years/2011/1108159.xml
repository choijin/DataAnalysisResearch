<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The neuron has a very distinct morphology. Most neurons have three major parts to their anatomy: the soma (cell body), dendrites, and axons. The dendrites receive information from other cells, which is passed to the soma. The axon provides the output for the cell to transmit information to other cells.The axon initial segment (AIS) is the part of the axon closest to the cell body and is characterized by a high density of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels. It is responsible for the integration of the inputs the cell receives and the initiation of output, known as an action potential. The action potential is then propagated down the axon to the axon terminal where it is connected to other cells. Thus, any changes in the properties of the AIS may affect the overall output of the cell.     A large body of evidence shows that the brain is plastic or able to change. It undergoes many changes during development and throughout life as a consequence of learning, disease, aging, and other experiences. Traditionally, plasticity has been associated with changes at the synapse, the connections between different brain cells.
