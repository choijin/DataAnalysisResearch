<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  Molecular and genetic studies have shown that proteins work in multimeric complexes to direct cellular events, and that transcription factors, in particular, can use selective interactions to differentially regulate gene expression.  Existing methods for detecting these interactions are limited in the information that they provide, usually because the method of detection is most appropriate for studies done in cell culture or in single-celled organisms.   This project involves developing a transformative method to detect transient interactions among transcription factors within the nuclei of the cells of living animals.  The project will use the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, a small multicellular worm commonly used for developmental and genetic studies.  Fluorescence imaging will be used detect interaction between a transcription factor tethered to the nuclear membrane and a fluorescently-labeled partner.  Proof-of-concept experiments will be carried out with known interactors and,once established, the method will be applied to discover novel interaction partners. The research is novel and potentially of high significance because it would allow unprecedented in vivo detection of interaction between transcription factors throughout the life cycle of an organism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Undergraduate, Masters, and PhD students from Georgia State University, an ethnically and racially diverse urban institution, will participate in all aspects of this project.  In addition to providing research training, this project will provide an international research experience for two college students.  The project will also enhance the research infrastructure at Livingstone College, a historically black college, through a combination of summer research experiences for Livingston College faculty and students and academic year lectures/visits to Livingstone by Georgia State University faculty.  Furthermore, a postdoctoral fellow will gain supervised and guided teaching experience in both undergraduate and graduate classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

For the EAGAR award, we sought to: (1) develop a method that would allow us to monitor protein-protein interactions in living animals so that we could eventually see these interactions as they occur among the REF-1 family proteins; (2) to further characterize the role of one REF-1 protein, HLH-25, in directing growth and maturation; and (3) to broaden participation by recruiting students and faculty from a minority serving institution to participate in the research project and by performing outreach to local high schools through Georgia State University?s BioBus Program.  We attempted to protein::protein interactions as they occur in living animals by tethering one bHLH protein to the inner nuclear membrane using SUN/Kash domain proteins, and allowing the second protein to freely diffuse in the cell.  SUN/Kash proteins are found throughout the animal kingdom, and are needed to link proteins to the inside of the nucleus of the cell.  We tested the expression pattern of the GFP::SUN domain fusion proteins  and then challenged the limit in resolution for this new detection method in cells with large and small nuclei.  We successfully showed HLH-2 and HLH-8 interactions in life C. elegans using this system.  We also uncovered putative roles for HLH-25 in regulating genes required for cell division and cell cycle progression (see figure).
