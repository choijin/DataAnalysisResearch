<AbstractNarration>The Raman-shifted Eye-safe Aerosol Lidar (REAL) observing platform, now based at the California State University at Chico, was originally designed and assembled with support from NSF and NCAR (the National Center for Atmospheric Research).  It supports a combination of lower-atmospheric research and university-based instruction led by the Principal Investigator.  REAL operates at a wavelength 1.54 microns, and is capable of mapping distributions of urban pollutants and naturally occurring dusts/aerosols.  By tracking the movement of aerosol features, REAL provides high-resolution depictions of air motions adjacent to the earth's surface, while backscatter depolarization of returned signals provides information on the shape of encountered particles.  This RAPID-type award will promptly support required refurbishment of high-precision mirrors used to accurately and efficiently direct lidar energy, and restore full functionality to REAL's beam steering unit.  Associated upgrades to site security will ensure reliable operation of the system at an off-campus CSU-Chico research farm location.  In-house design and fabrication of a small and portable crane will allow safe and reliable removal and replacement of the elevated beam steering unit from atop the shipping container in which REAL's transceiver and associated instrumentation reside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this work rests in restoring and maintaining the ability of the REAL to collect high-quality observations, and adequate protection of the platform for future use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of this effort will include increased safety for students and staff involved in REAL's operation, and its continued availability for support of on-site educational activities scheduled for early 2011.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Raman-shifted Eye-safe Aerosol Lidar (REAL) is an observational asset developed with NSF funding and used in atmospheric research to map the distribution of particulate matter in the lower atmosphere.  By tracking the movement of aerosol features, REAL also provides wind fields on over areas on the order of 10 &ndash; 20 square kilometers.  The objective of NSF AGS 1104342 was to promptly secure and restore functionality to the REAL at the California State University Farm so that it could be used in an autumn 2011 field experiment.   Specific actions completed as a result of this award included: (1) the procurement of a pair of custom, high precision, 40 cm by 60 cm mirrors used to direct the lidar beam in the atmosphere; (2) construction of a custom jib crane to raise and lower the lidar beam steering unit for maintenance, repairs, and/or storage; and (3) installation of items to secure the facility such as an electronic alarm and video surveillance system, improved locks, and exterior lighting.  The work was completed and the autumn 2011 experiment was conducted.  A conference paper summarizing the scientific results of the field project was presented in the 2012 European Aerosol Conference.   The jib crane was designed and fabricated by senior undergraduate mechanical engineering students as their capstone project.  The improvements to the facility will enable continued use of the asset at CSU Chico for research projects related to micrometeorology, wind energy, and air quality.  References  Held, A., T.
