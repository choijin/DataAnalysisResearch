<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting Professor Jon D. Stewart of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida to develop new enzyme catalysts for asymmetric conjugated alkene reductions.  To date, the overall impact of these enzymes on synthetic chemistry has been modest because the wild-type enzymes accept only a limited range of substrates, provide one possible stereoisomer and lack long-term stability.  To overcome these problems, existing flavin-dependent reductase enzymes will be systematically varied at amino acid positions rated most likely to yield improved mutants.  X-ray crystallography will be used to understand how substrates bind in the active sites of improved enzymes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve mentoring high school students (U.F. Precollegiate Training Program), undergraduates (NSF REU), graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, including members of historically underrepresented groups in chemistry.  Moreover, the work will provide diverse training in chemistry, x-ray crystallography, molecular biology and biochemistry to these coworkers.  In terms of scientific broader impacts, this work is directed at efficient, environmentally benign methods for producing chiral building blocks for medicinal, agrochemical and industrial chemical applications.  In addition, the insights gleaned from combining protein engineering, structural studies and catalytic assays will provide new information on flavoproteins, an important class of biocatalysts involved in a diverse set of reactions at the chemistry/biology interface.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our goals in this project were  to solve two serious problems with one class of protein catalysts.  The protein is called Old Yellow Enzyme and it was originally isolated from brewers' bottom yeast (a by-product of beer-making).  The protein got its very strange name because of a quirk of history.  In 1932, it was the first protein ever found that had a color (bright yellow), so its discoverers (Warburg and Christian) called it gelbe ferment (Yellow Enzyme).  A few years later, Warburg and Christian discovered a second yellow enzyme, different from the first.  To distinguish between them, they called the first one "Old Yellow Enzyme" and the second, "New Yellow Enzyme."  While the second name never really caught on, the Old Yellow Enzyme name has stuck to this day and that's how it's known in the scientific literature.  Our first job was to change the orientation between Old Yellow Enzyme and  the reaction starting material (substrate) in order to make the protein more useful to chemists.  The first image shows how the substrate (green) enters Old Yellow Enzyme through the tunnel near the bottom.  Unfortunately, when we tried to fit the substrate into the protein's active site (outlined in white), it doesn't work - the substrate penetrates the wall and sticks outside.  This obviously can't happen.  However, by changing the Old Yellow Enzyme's shape, we created a new version with the structure shown in the second image.  First, notice that the protein shape is quite different - the accessible volume inside is much bigger.  Now we have no trouble fitting the substrate into the protein in the orientation we need.  We also carried out parallel studies with a relative of the Old Yellow Enzyme from a different kind of yeast (Pichia stipitis).  By changing the shape of this protein, we were also successfull in changing the orientation between the substrate and the enzyme.  The second problem with using Old Yellow Enzyme - especially in industry - is that they are not terribly stable.  Proteins have to maintain a very specific three-dimensional shape to remain active.  If they unfold (denature), they lose their ability catalyze chemical reactions.  We analyzed Old Yellow Enzyme to identify places that appeared least stable, then changed the protein in these areas.  The goal was to make variants with greater abilities to withstand high temperatures.  While we did identify some useful variants, the improvements were very modest.  One important impact of this project was that the lab acquired a very important new skill (x-ray crystallography).  In order to know the shape of the protein, or how substrates interact, or which parts are least stable, you first need to know the three-dimensional shape of the protein.  Before we began this project, we had no experience in this work.  Now, every graduate student has learned how to carry out these experiments.  This is a skill that will be expected from Ph.D. graduates in biochemistry in the future, and this project provided the impetus for us to learn.  A second impact of this work beyond the specific project here involved a collaboration on improving starch content in corn.  One of the key proteins involved in making cornstarch is also not very stable, so we applied the technology we developed here to overcome this problem.  The improved enzymes are in corn plants now and being evaluated for their effects in the field.       Last Modified: 09/29/2016       Submitted by: Jon D Stewart]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
