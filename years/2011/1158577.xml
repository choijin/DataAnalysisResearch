<AbstractNarration>This project presents a multiscale computational approach to studying the effects of the environment on protein folding and aggregation. In vivo, proteins fold in a dense environment, rich in interfaces (ranging from membranes to surfaces created by other biomolecules) and with a host of species present that can act as crowding agents.  Both crowding and surface effects can dramatically alter protein folding mechanisms as well as affect aggregation pathways.  Surfaces play an equally important role in aggregation processes related to biomaterial and biotechnological applications. The PI will use a combination of state of the art fully atomic enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with novel coarse-grained models that will be developed in the context of this project.   The fully atomic simulations will focus on two model systems, the Islet Amyloid  Polypeptide and a novel construct of the Tau protein. The folding and early aggregation of these peptides will be studied in the bulk, in the presence of solid model surfaces of different degrees of hydrophobicity (ranging from mica to graphene) and in the presence of the biologically important glycosaminoglycan heparin. Novel coarse-grained models will be developed to probe the effects of crowding and surfaces (including model membrane surfaces) on folding and aggregation. Because coarse-grained models can reach time and lengths scales that far exceed those accessible using fully atomic simulations, they enable the study of the entire aggregation process from monomer folding to full-fledged fibril formation. The proposed integrated multiscale approach aims at elucidating some of the fundamental principles that differentiate in vivo from in vitro folding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing  protein folding and aggregation will have impacts in a number of disciplines ranging from biotechnology and biomaterials. The research is inherently interdisciplinary, and results from the simulations will be used to guide new experimental studies. All computational models and algorithms developed in the context of this project will be made freely available to the public. The PI is actively involved in the mentoring of under-represented groups in science (both minority and women) and in curricular developments. The PI is involved in chemistry outreach activities to local Santa Barbara elementary school children, including weekly science demonstrations to fifth grade students, as well as monthly "Science Night" events. The PI will expand her outreach to the fifth grade students by introducing new demonstration modules and by expanding the scope of the program to include a significant number of students stemming from primarily Hispanic schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly supported by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research carried out in the context of the NSF grant MCB-115877 focused on the development of computational models to probe how environmental factors influence protein folding and assembly.  Intellectual Merit  The major research activities are summarized below.  Effects of surfaces on protein folding  Protein-surface interactions are ubiquitous in the crowded cytosol, where proteins encounter a variety of surfaces, ranging from membranes surfaces, to the surfaces presented by chaperone molecules. Protein-surface interactions are also at the heart of a number of emerging technologies, including protein micro-arrays, biosensors and biomaterials. We considered the folding of helical and sheet mini-proteins (TrpCage, TrpZip and GB1) on graphene and graphite surfaces with tuned degrees of hydrophobicity, and on hydrophobic and hydrophilic self-assembled monolayers (SAM). An important result from our simulations is that surface hydrophobicity alone cannot be used as a predictor of protein stability on surfaces. Rather, the direct interactions between the protein and the surface dominated over water-mediated interactions, with strong protein-surface interactions leading to protein denaturation on surfaces.  Atomistic and coarse-grained simulations of protein aggregation  We have explored key aspects of protein aggregation, including the initiation of oligomerization through simulations of dimers and other small oligomers, the interaction of inhibitor molecules with oligomers, and we have proposed fibril structures from simulation. We have focused on both model systems (fragments of full length aggregating peptides, such as the YVIFL peptide, the Ab(25-35) peptide, and aggregating fragments of the Tau peptide), as well as full-length aggregating systems (in particular, the Ab(1-40) peptide and the IAPP peptide).

Solvation thermodynamics of amino acids in mixed-osmolyte solutions   We have investigated the solvation thermodynamics of a range of amino acids in urea and TMAO solutions using molecular dynamics simulations and Kirkwood-Buff theory.
