<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Security threats are increasing by the second and the cost of compromised systems are quickly forcing security to be a first-order design requirement in computer systems in addition to the traditional requirements of speed, energy-efficiency, cost, programmability and usability. This emphasis on security, coupled with the prohibitive performance cost of purely software security solutions, and increasing hardware budgets, provides a golden opportunity to architects to contribute towards mitigating the threats posed by this important problem.    The purpose of the tutorial was to introduce computer architects to security concepts, and vice versa, and inform two groups of researchers about threats and solutions with the goal of stimulating interdisciplinary research in security and architecture. Specifically, the tutorials  discussed security concepts and principles --- such as why security problems arise, the nature of security threats, and how hardware can help mitigate some of the security challenges. We discussed some state-of-the-art hardware security research. The tutorial was intended to discuss guidelines for interdisciplinary architecture and security research.     Broader Impacts  Cyber security education is of strategic importance to the United States. A direct broader impact of this project was training of the several architecture students on important aspects of security towards this strategic need. About 150 students, researchers and practitioners attended our tutorials over four conferneces. As these participants take on newer challenges and designs, we hope that they will consciously consider security and privacy ramifications of their design decisions.    Indirectly, support for this tutorial served three important purposes:  First, NSF support has helped grow and strengthen the hardware security community.  Second, in addition to benefiting the students, the tutorial provided feedback to the presenters on security topics that are confusing to architecture researchers. This feedback has helped us become better teachers.  The third and final benefit is a move towards development of a common vernacular for hardware security research. This tutorial helped created a set of lecture notes that can be integrated into coursework.       Last Modified: 07/24/2014       Submitted by: L Sethumadhavan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
