<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical and&lt;br/&gt;commercial feasibility of a novel approach called Power Fingerprinting (PFP) for integrity assessment&lt;br/&gt;and intrusion detection in critical embedded and wireless systems based on side-channel analysis by an&lt;br/&gt;external monitor. Such integrity assessment approach is fundamental for protecting critical&lt;br/&gt;systems from cyber attacks in government agencies, financial institutions, military command,&lt;br/&gt;and industrial control. PFP treats cyber security as a signal detection and classification problem and&lt;br/&gt;introduces tangible quantitative metrics for security and trust. Phase I objectives include: (1) demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;the feasibility of characterizing kernel modules and core applications for embedded systems; 2) extract&lt;br/&gt;behavioral signatures to improve performance; 3) develop techniques to compensate for variations in&lt;br/&gt;power consumption due to manufacturing and environmental variations; and 4) create a general&lt;br/&gt;architecture for the application of PFP. The research will be performed using Angstrom Linux on a&lt;br/&gt;Beagleboard embedded platform, from which PFP signatures will be extracted and used to detect&lt;br/&gt;malicious intrusions in blind tests. The expected result is to achieve over 95% accuracy in detecting&lt;br/&gt;execution anomalies during blind tests and provide a baseline to develop a commercial PFP monitor&lt;br/&gt;prototype in Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the development of an innovative&lt;br/&gt;mechanism for early detection of cyber attacks to critical infrastructure from well-funded adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;Such attacks, if not promptly discovered, that can steal state secrets and intellectual property with&lt;br/&gt;devastating consequences to national security. PFP brings a new perspective to cyber security treating it&lt;br/&gt;as a signal detection and classification problem and introducing tangible quantitative metrics for integrity&lt;br/&gt;and trust. PFP addresses a growing need to secure critical embedded systems. PFP is very difficult to&lt;br/&gt;evade, adds little overhead in the processor being monitored, and is effective against zero-day attacks. In&lt;br/&gt;comparison, traditional cyber security monitoring approaches are susceptible to evasion and ineffective&lt;br/&gt;against new attacks because they depend on known malware signatures. These features make PFP capable&lt;br/&gt;of detecting sophisticated covert attacks and rootkits, such as the recent Stuxnet worm. PFP has dual&lt;br/&gt;application in the commercial and government markets, particularly for resource-constrained and&lt;br/&gt;embedded platforms, including smart phones, smart grid, critical industrial control, and tactical&lt;br/&gt;communication devices. PFP has the potential to become a fundamental player in cyber-security by&lt;br/&gt;protecting the nation?s infrastructure and promoting further development of the economic base and&lt;br/&gt;employment.</AbstractNarration>
