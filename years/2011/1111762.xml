<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Heather Allen of Ohio State University. Prof. Allen and her students will develop and apply phase sensitive vibrational sum frequency generation (PS-VSFG) spectroscopy to investigate water organization and orientation as a function of vibrational frequency at air/aqueous salt interfaces. Research will encompass air-aqueous interfacial investigations of mono- and divalent ions which have not been investigated previously using PS-VSFG. These studies will elucidate how and to what extent these ions organize water at the air-aqueous interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemical systems to be studied have direct relevance to atmospheric aerosol chemistry of marine and continental regions. The study will increase our understanding of the aging processes of aerosols. Additionally, these same systems have direct correlation with understanding the surface of the ocean at a molecular level where the ions investigated are common constituents of the ocean surface waters. The study will provide an excellent educational opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to carry out a fundamental research project at the interface of chemistry and atmospheric sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF research investigated the organization of ions at the air-water interface to better understand the driving forces behind surface propensity of ionic species.  The inherent direction and magnitude of the electric field at these surfaces was probed with nonlinear ultrafast spectroscopy that is selective for information at aqueous surfaces, and is not sensitive to bulk information.  The surface itself presents a driving force for certain ions, typically those of lesser surface charge density and those that are larger and more polarizable.  We also found that divalent ions, even though they typically prefer to reside below their counter cations at aqueous surfaces, their geometries and hydrogen bonding ability, as well as hydration energies, play a huge role in their lack of surface propensity.  For example, we found that sulfate dianion outcompetes magnesium divalent cation for the interior regions of the liquid, far from the surface. Sulfate is a strong hydrogen bonding ion, it has a minus two charge, and therefore prefers symmetric solvation, which is mainly found deep in the bulk of a water solution.  Ions that have higher concentrations nearer or at the aqueous surface are typically thought of as being easy to desolvate.  This of course is always relative, as it is a competition between cations and anions.  This finding is particularly interesting because sulfate is a dominate species in atmospheric aerosols and in cloud droplets in most regions, therefore it is also thought to be important in the electrification of cloud droplets in thunderclouds. This research also involved the education of several chemistry graduate and undergraduate students that now are better trained for industrial, academic, and research laboratories in that they understand surface chemistry and organization at aqueous surface. These students also now understand the relationship between ions, their surface activity with that of atmospheric aerosol chemistry and bio applications.  The finding have general application to a multitude of processes from environmental to materials to biological.       Last Modified: 12/10/2015       Submitted by: Heather C Allen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
