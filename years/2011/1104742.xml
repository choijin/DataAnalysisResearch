<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of the research in this single investigator award is the transformation under extreme compression of canonical simple free-electron metals, such as the alkali metals, into materials with highly anomalous electronic properties. These properties include superconductivity at relatively high temperatures, metal-semiconductor or metal-insulator transitions or even Pauli paramagnetic to itinerant ferromagnetic transitions. This project will study in depth to ultrahigh pressures the superconducting phase diagram and critical magnetic field behavior of selected alkali metals as well as their alloys and compounds. The systematics derived from this study will shed light on the properties of hydrogen under pressure which has been predicted to become a metal at multi-Mbar pressures with possible superconductivity near room temperature.  Further phenomena of interest are possible insulator-metal transitions and superconductivity in highly polarizable insulators such as solid xenon and beryllium hydride BeH2, as well as the extension of our previous hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure work on the optimally doped Hg-1201 cuprate into both the underdoped and overdoped regimes. The proposed experiments give undergraduate and graduate students an excellent opportunity to learn and develop important laboratory techniques and collaborate with groups both in the US and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple materials are easier to understand but complex materials are more interesting and more likely to lead to innovative applications. In this single investigator award extremely high pressures, as high as 2-3 million atmospheres, are applied to very soft and simple materials, like the alkali metals. Such extreme compression is able to continuously transform these metals into surprisingly complex materials which may be superconducting, ferromagnetic or even insulating. The fact that a single sample can be brought through extreme compression to exhibit such anomalous behavior allows one to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying processes involved. This enhanced understanding, on the other hand, facilitates the design of materials with interesting properties at ambient pressure. Such studies provide insight into a possible superconducting state near room temperature in metallic hydrogen under millions of atmospheres of pressure. The proposed experiments give undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to learn and develop a multitude of essential experimental techniques; these students will also benefit from scientific collaborations with groups both in the US and abroad.</AbstractNarration>

The premier device for generating extremely high pressures is the diamond anvil cell shown schematically in figure 1. On the right side a metal disk is shown with a small hole drilled through. The sample is placed in this hole along with some liquid pressure medium like oil or alcohol. Two diamond anvils with tiny flats (e.g. 0.3 mm diameter and 3 mm diameter girdle) press directly onto the area around the hole and compress its contents, generating very high pressures.

As seen in the lower graph, the temperature where this materials becomes superconducting first rises as pressure is applied, but at 2.1 GPa (21,000 atmospheres) the superconductivity suddenly disappears and does not reappear all the way out to the highest pressure applied, namely 25 GPa (250,000 atmospheres).

The crystal structure of a sample can be determined by shining x-rays through the diamonds. On the other hand, measurements of the electrical resistivity are also possible to extremely high pressures. A student from South Korea, Jinhyuk Lim, is shown in figure 3 preparing a pressure cell under a stereo microscope. Great dexterity and patience are required. The fruit of his labors is the central part of the pressure cell shown on the lower left in the figure where four thin platinum strips are shown contacting the tiny 30x30 micron sample of the lanthanide dysprosium (Dy). From the temperature dependence of the resistivity the value of the temperature <em>T</em><sub>o</sub> where Dy orders magnetically can be determined. As the pressure increases it is seen that <em>T</em><sub>o</sub> goes through several gyrations as the crystal structure of Dy changes. The most interesting and important result, however, is that above 80 GPa (800,000 atmospheres) the magnetic ordering temperature of Dy begins to increase VERY rapidly, passing through room temperature and heading toward 400 K at the highest pressure reached, namely 1.6 million atmospheres. This is the highest temperature ever reached by a member of the elemental lanthanide series. If we can understand why <em>T</em><sub>o</sub> goes to such a high value, this may help us construct a material that is a much stronger permanent magnet than what is available today.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/17/2016<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;S&nbsp;Schilling</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1104742/1104742_10112718_1474131617328_Dy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1104742/1104742_10112718_1474131617328_Dy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1104742/1104742_10112718_1474131617328_Dy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Resistivity measurements on Dy metal to extreme pressures.</div> <div class="imageCredit">James S.
