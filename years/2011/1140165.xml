<AbstractNarration>Engineering ethics is an important topic in engineering education. There is considerable interest in the engineering education community for an instrument that can be used in ethics education.  This collaborative project addresses the need for such an instrument. The project team plans is building upon their current research-based SEED (Survey of Engineering Ethical Development) instrument which is grounded in theory and has been completed by 3,914 respondents at 19 partner institutions across the nation. The project has four goals: 1). Create a practical instrument for assessing individual ethics initiatives (SEED-PA); 2). Use the SEED-PA to conduct four separate studies addressing important research questions and demonstrating the utility, reliability, and validity of the instrument; 3). Develop the SEED-PA User's Guide to assist in research design, administration, data analysis, and results interpretation; 4). Broadly disseminate the online SEED-PA and the SEED-PA User's Guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is advancing discovery about assessing individual ethics initiatives and has the potential to transform undergraduate education in engineering ethics. The instrument developed can be used by engineering programs to address ABET learning outcomes on engineering ethics. The project includes a multifaceted dissemination plan with focused and broad dissemination mechanisms.  The collaborating institutions span a range of institutional types with diverse student bodies. The studies are likely to yield results that are widely applicable.</AbstractNarration>

We successfully completed development of the SEED-PA instrument;  however, attempts to conduct pilot studies were seriously hampered by  difficulties in recruiting partner institutions to host the pilot  studies and by a very low response rate to our online survey instrument.    Consequently, we collected pilot study data from a relatively  small sample of engineering students in only a limited range of  educational contexts.  This meant that the statistical power of our  analysis was unable to demonstrate that the SEED-PA instrument could  reliably and validly demonstrate changes in students' ethical  development during the time of the ethics intervention experienced by  our pilot study participants.  Therefore, we were unable to show that we  had successfully developed a useful instrument at this time. However,  we hope to continue our data collection and analysis and to increase the  impact of our instrument.        Last Modified: 05/31/2016       Submitted by: Trevor S Harding]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
