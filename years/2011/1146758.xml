<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the development of endothermy - the ability to maintain a high, internally regulated, and constant body temperature ? in birds that span a range of functional maturity at hatching.  All vertebrate embryos are ectothermic, for which metabolic rate and body temperature decrease as ambient temperature decreases. The "thermostat" and cellular "furnace" of ectothermic stages are unable to maintain a high constant body temperature without an external heat source. Endothermy develops in birds as they mature from an embryo to a free-living hatchling. An endothermic phenotype matures rapidly in precocial birds that hatch with feathers and quickly develop a high basal metabolic rate. In contrast, the endothermic phenotype develops gradually in altricial birds that hatch featherless, with little motor control, and limited metabolic capacity. The metabolic transition from ectothermy to endothermy has been well documented at the whole animal level, but the biochemical and cellular basis governing this transition remain unclear.  Research proposed here will elucidate the physiological ontogeny of endothermy in birds by 1) correlating organism level physiology with cellular level physiology of ATP production and consumption in tissues serving as the cellular furnace and 2) manipulating levels of thyroid hormones to examine their role in regulating this metabolic conversion.  The research questions will be addressed using a comparative approach that focuses on precocial and altricial species that develop endothermy at different rates post-hatching and compares them with out-group species that remain ectotherms throughout life. Experimentally, thyroid hormone levels will be manipulated in precocial and altricial species to determine its regulatory role in this energetic metamorphosis.  Elucidating the developmental trajectories of whole animal metabolism, mitochondria function, and cellular processes and the role of thyroid hormones associated with attaining endothermy will provide a major new interpretation of important developmental events, leading to a better understanding of the evolution of endothermy.  This project features collaboration of labs at University of North Texas, Kalamazoo College, and North Dakota State University.  The research project will include educational and research training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Endothermy, the ability to regulate body temperature through internal heat production, was one of the key transformative traits in the evolution of birds.   In contrast, other reptiles are ectothermic and cannot generate sufficient internal heat.  For this reason, they must rely on environmental sources of heat to regulate body temperature.  Although all juvenile and adult birds are endotherms, they begin life expressing ectothermic traits and rely on their mothers for the heat needed to regulate body temperature. The endothermic phenotype develops at different rates post-hatching depending on where a species falls along the precocial to altricial spectrum of developmental functional maturity. Precocial species develop endothermy rapidly at hatching, while altricial species can take up to three weeks after hatching to develop endothermy.  One of the goals of this project was to understand how whole animal metabolism and mitochondria function from heat generating tissues - in the case of birds the skeletal muscles - develop to allow altricial and precocial birds to transition from an embryonic ectotherm to a neonatal endotherm.     Birds rely on skeletal muscles for shivering heat production and must have sufficient mitochondria to produce the energy required to fund shivering.  We examined the development of skeletal muscle mitochondria function in six different species of birds including two altricial species and four precocial species. We compared the development of mitochondria function in the bird species to that of two non-endothermic reptiles. When compared with the two non-endothermic reptiles, skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity was higher in birds at all times in development.  Skeletal muscle mitochondria function did not change in the non-endothermic reptiles from the later embryonic stages through the first year of life. Skeletal muscle mitochondria function improved rapidly in precocial species at hatching and was highly correlated with the animals attaining endothermy.  In the altricial species studied, skeletal muscle mitochondria function matured prior to the nestling becoming endothermic; therefore, another aspect of their physiology must be dictating the timing for when they become endothermic.   Thyroid hormones have been proposed to be the proximate mechanism by which endothermy evolved.  To examine the importance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and the associated thyroid hormones in regulating the development and timing of attaining endothermy in birds, we manipulated thyroid hormone levels in Pekin ducks, red-winged blackbirds, and American alligator to produce hyperthyroid or hypothyroid conditions within the developing animals.  We examined the developmental responses of whole animal metabolism, lung ventilation, and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function to thyroid manipulations.  The non-endothermic alligator responded strongly to both hyperthyroid and hypothyroid conditions with either an increase or decrease in mitochondria function and whole animal metabolism, respectively.  In contrast, development of metabolic processes in the endothermic species was not strongly influenced by hyperthyroid conditions.  This may be due to the high levels of thyroid hormone already present in the developing embryo and hatchling.  The endothermic species were much more susceptible to hypothyroid conditions during development, resulting in decreased mitochondria function, decreased metabolism, and delayed development of endothermy. A surprising finding was that hypothyroid manipulation during development compromised breathing function in both altricial and precocial species, specifically the volume of each breath and the frequency of breathing.  These thyroid manipulation studies are beginning to reveal the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in development and regulation of endothermy and metabolic capacity.  During the project, a diverse population of eight graduate students, twelve undergraduate students, one high school student, and one post-doctoral fellow all received training in biochemical, molecular, and comparative physiology methods.  The PI, graduate students, and undergraduate students presented their scientific findings in over 25 presentations at the top national and international comparative physiology meetings and to date have published 8 peer-reviewed papers on the findings.  Equipment purchased under this award allowed for expansion of the techniques and questions addressed by undergraduate students in a research course taught by the PI during three of the project?s years.
