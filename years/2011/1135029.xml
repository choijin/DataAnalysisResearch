<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to explore, simulate, and validate new seismic design concepts for light-frame residential construction that will dramatically improve its life-cycle seismic performance with minimal impact on construction costs.  New strength and stiffness enhanced unibody framing systems and low-cost seismic isolation systems will be investigated to achieve cost-efficient resistance to earthquakes.  In contrast to conventional seismic design practice, where large structural ductility demands can result in extensive damage to architectural and mechanical building systems, the considered systems will achieve reduced deformations and damage by integrating structural and architectural building components in a lateral system with high strength and stiffness.  High-fidelity simulation models will be implemented to accurately assess the seismic performance, including models for seismic isolation and the unibody space-frame systems.  Physical and computational simulations will provide the basis for new seismic design criteria for light-frame residential construction to meet appropriate collapse safety goals and incorporate life-cycle concepts to control damage and loss of building function. The research is organized around an integrated plan of quasi-static testing, shake table testing, and computational simulations of structural fasteners, subassemblies, and systems.  The research team from Stanford University and California State University, Sacramento, will use the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) facilities at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, San Diego.  Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES Project Warehouse data repository at http://www.nees.org.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Much in the same way that automotive construction advanced from "body-on-frame" to "unibody" construction in the 1970's, this research has the promise to help revolutionize light-frame residential construction by integrating structural and architectural components into a unibody building system.  When combined with seismic base isolation, the resulting integrated system will substantially reduce the damage and repairs due to earthquakes.  Building owners, communities, and other stakeholders will benefit by the economies achieved through optimized design approaches and integrated building systems. By reducing earthquake damage, the new framing systems have the potential to dramatically improve the resilience of communities by allowing residents to "shelter-in-place" and quickly recover from large earthquakes. The project has a natural educational component through the research participation of graduate and undergraduate students and strong participation of industry through an advisory group to promote technology transfer to building codes and professional practice. This award is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Experience from past earthquakes has shown that, despite improvements in modern building codes, light-frame residential houses are susceptible to damage from earthquake ground shaking that can lead to significant financial loss and displacement of residents.  In response, this research has developed innovative concepts for the design and construction of unibody framing and low-cost seismic isolation that can dramatically reduce the risk of earthquake damage to residential houses.  The proposed unibody design concepts for light-frame house construction are inspired by innovations that revolutionized the automobile industry in the 1970?s.  The basic concept behind unibody design is to engage all the interior and exterior walls of a house in resisting inertial forces and deformations caused by earthquake ground shaking.  This contrasts with approaches in current building codes that concentrate the earthquake resistance in just a few seismic shear wall panels, which can lead to large damaging deformations.  Implemented using construction adhesives and enhanced tie-down devices, the unibody houses are up to five times stiffer and several times stronger than conventional wood frame construction.  A major challenge in the research has been to overcome traditional building code approaches and to demonstrate how the unibody system dramatically reduce damage under moderate to strong earthquakes, while maintaining required safety to extreme earthquakes.  The second focus of the research has been to develop cost-effective seismic isolation systems for residential houses.  While seismic isolation has been used previously for seismic protection of buildings, its application has been limited to special or critical facilities, such as hospitals or landmark buildings, due to its high cost.  In this project, low-cost isolation is achieved using sliding isolators that are engineered for the unique characteristics of light wood-frame houses.  Constructed with high-density polyethylene and galvanized steel, the sliding isolation systems take full advantage of the light-weight and high stiffness and strength of wood-frame houses. The innovative unibody framing systems and low-cost seismic isolation have been developed and validated through an extensive research program that involved design, testing and computational modeling of building components and systems.  The research culminated in testing of a full-scale house on an earthquake shaking table, which provided a proof of concept and scientific data to validate analysis models and design concepts.  Throughout the project, the research team has engaged engineering professionals to advise on the research and to facilitate its adoption into building codes and design and construction practice.  When properly implemented, the innovations developed in this research hold the promise to make residential housing dramatically more resistant to earthquake damage and communities more earthquake resilient.
