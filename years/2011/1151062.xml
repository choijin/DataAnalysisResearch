<AbstractNarration>Atmospheric aerosol particles play an important role in the Earth's climate system through their ability to absorb and scatter solar radiation and influence the properties of clouds.  To a large extent the specific influence of aerosol particles on climate is determined by their composition, yet much remains unknown with respect to their formation, chemical evolution and removal, especially when considering organic aerosols.  As a result, the climate forcing due to atmospheric aerosols remains highly uncertain, thus hampering current understanding and predictions of future climate change.  This CAREER award supports detailed experiments and analysis that will address fundamental questions related to gas-particle partitioning of organic compounds in atmospheric aerosols, with a particular focus on making connections between particle composition, phase and volatility. Currently, there exists a significant discrepancy between ambient and modeled organic aerosol volatility, indicating that the physical properties of the modeled aerosol are incorrect.  Absorptive partitioning theory forms the basis of most regional and global models that include organic aerosol formation, thereby determining the eventual impacts on air quality and climate.  Recent experiments suggest that absorptive partitioning theory may not be as broadly applicable as is typically assumed, perhaps because the organic aerosol exists with a glassy, as opposed to liquid-like, phase.  If correct, this finding has implications for understanding not only organic aerosol formation, but also the lifecycle of organic aerosol in the atmosphere.  The studies will address, through laboratory experiments and analysis of field data, our understanding of under what conditions partitioning theory does (or does not) work to describe the physical behavior of organic aerosols, to what extent this is determined by particle phase, and how this influences particle volatility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational activities will include: (1) Authoring a new chapter on global climate change for the textbook Physical Geology, which is used in hundreds of introductory geoscience classrooms across the country; (2) Developing and teaching a module focused on air pollution issues in Mexico City for incorporation in an introductory-level "place-based" geoscience course with the objective of engaging Hispanic students, who are extremely under-represented in the geosciences.  The module will provide a new, hands-on element for the students, provide some of them with research opportunities in the principal investigator's laboratory and serve to strengthen ties between UC Davis and nearby California State University, Sacramento, which is a predominately undergraduate-serving institution.  Graduate students will be involved at all stages of the development and teaching of the module, providing them a chance to develop as educators; and (3) Organizing a multi-institution, web-based joint group meeting that involves early-career faculty members whose research focuses on atmospheric chemistry.  The primary intention of this project is to provide graduate students opportunities to more frequently engage with their peers, develop a greater sense of community as scientists and to obtain feedback from a broad spectrum of people at the "in progress" stage of research.</AbstractNarration>

This is depsite the particles shrinking substantially, owing to the OH radicals reacting with and splitting apart molecules at the surface, with the latter evaporating. However, when these same OA particles are liquid the reactions occur throughout the particles, inducing both shrinking and substantial changes in composition. We also showed that chemical pathways change when OA that is produced from the chemical reaction of a molecule commonly emitted by trees (a-pinene) coats OA that is representative of vehicle or cooking emissions (squalane). Here, reaction of OH radicals with squalane speeds up when a-pinene OA mixes with the squalane OA. These results indicate that coatings do not necessarily protect internal components from chemical reaction, and can actually enhance their chemical loss. We also examined how OA composition influences particle evaporation, which is important for understanding how particles change as they are diluted in the atmosphere. We found that the extent of evaporation and the concomitant change OA composition are generally independent of both the OA concentration and the OA composition&mdash;at least for OA having complex composition and that were formed from reaction of a wide range of gases. However, we also showed that when various complex OA are collected on filters and then slowly allowed to evaporate, that the various evaporating components exhibit distinct behavior that can be grouped together (&ldquo;clustered&rdquo;). This clustering is allowing for development of new insights into OA particle composition. Finally, we also developed a new numerical model to describe the chemical formation and evolution of OA that forms from vapors produced from chemical reaction of precursor gases. This so-called secondary OA is chemically complex, with a wide diversity of compounds having distinct vapor pressures and reactivities contributing. We used this model to describe secondary OA formation in laboratory chambers, demonstrating that such experiments can be subject to potentially large negative biases relative to the atmosphere owing to interaction of the vapors with the chamber walls. We also used this model to predict the efficiency of secondary OA formation from various gas-phase species for which no experimental data existed, which allowed for estimation of how much OA is formed in urban environments from such compounds. We found that a substantial fraction of secondary OA in urban environments derives from sources such as paints, solvents, lotions, and perfumes, among many other non-vehicle sources.
