<AbstractNarration>1138279&lt;br/&gt;Phillips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports a community workshop to define strategic directions for applications of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) for rapid high resolution surface mapping of natural and manmade features and how the geosciences community can best realize support for the technology.   TLS is based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology and offers the capability to map surfaces with centimeter to sub-cm resolution with applications to the mapping of fault scarps, geologic outcrops, volcanic features, glacial features, barrier beach morphology; watershed drainage features; forest canopy and vegetative cover; and civil structures.  The combination of repeat TLS surveys tied to GPS referenced locations allows for subtle change detection for the study of surface deformation in response to active tectonics, climate change and extreme events, and active volcanism.  Long range TLS capabilities exist to map surfaces out to 1-2 km and thus offer advantages for rapid mapping of features that can pose human hazards using more traditional mapping techniques.  High resolution TLS mapping complements spaceborne and terrestrial radar and LIDAR mapping modalities for studies requiring cm to sub-cm surface analysis   A three day workshop is planned for late October, 2011 in Boulder, Colorado and will bring together approximately 50 geoscientists and students with experience and interests in exploiting TLS for the advancement of Earth system process understanding.  The organizing committee will produce a final workshop report that will make recommendations for the advancement of TLS data acquisition, processing, analysis, and distribution to all levels of the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

The convergence of participant ideas and experiences, a large and growing demand for TLS data and equipment, and clear consensus on issues repeatedly reached during the workshop resulted in several recommendations outlined below.     The workshop group recommended that product levels include: (L0) raw sensor data, (L1) sensor data in a sensor-independent exchange format, (L2) merged, aligned point cloud data, and (L3) derived data products such as digital elevation models (DEMs).     In addition, participants recognized that TLS metadata and best practices are required for each data level. The workshop group agreed that standardized metadata formats such as E57 (American Society for Testing and Materials International) are necessary, and should be informed by community needs and set the standard for archived datasets.     The group also noted that there is demand for community training in TLS data acquisition, processing, analysis, and exploration through workshops, short courses, online resources and user forums.
