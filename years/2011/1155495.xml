<AbstractNarration>Sea level rise reconstructions and predictions are currently limited in accuracy by our incomplete understanding of dynamic ice sheet behavior. Recent research indicates that sea level rise during the Last Interglacial (LIG) period may have been similar to what is projected for later in the 21st century; thus far, however, it has not been possible to produce consistent reconstructions of eustatic sea level change for this period, underscoring the need to better understand the influence of changing ice sheet volume and extent. Glacio-hydro-isostatic effects can obscure the eustatic sea level change signal at sites located near ice sheets, necessitating investigations of sea level change at far-field sites (e.g., the Indian Ocean and Caribbean) where these effects are less severe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, led by a faculty member at the University of Florida in collaboration with Australian scientists, uses fossil corals in the Seychelles to reconstruct eustatic sea level via diagenetic assessments, Uranium-series dating, and surveying integrated with geophysical (glacio-hydro-isostatic) modeling. LIG sea level markers across the Caribbean will be also be surveyed. Together, the dataset and model results will place constraints on past ice sheet volumes and extents, which will help to resolve serious disparities (+4 m) in sea level reconstructions, as well as facilitating the generation of a best-estimate eustatic sea level change curve. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of sea level change data and geophysical modeling involved in this research aligns closely with the objectives of PALSEA, a PAGES/IMAGES working group created to place empirical constraints on future sea level rise using the paleo record. The work will involve close collaboration between the lead researcher and her international colleagues. Educational impacts include the involvement of undergraduates at the University of Florida enrolled in a "Geology of the Bahamas" course, who will directly participate in the field component of this project; in addition, these students will participate in a series of lectures placing the work in context. The project will also be featured in a multimedia exhibit promoting STEM research at the Florida Museum of Natural History. This award will support the professional development of an early-career researcher, as well as the training of a PhD student and several undergraduate assistants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project reconstructed peak sea levels during the Last Interglacial period, a warm period that existed about 125,000 years ago, using new data and samples from field sites in the Caribbean and Western Indian Oceans.  The integration of evidence from multiple sites combined with new age and elevation data of fossil corals that lived near the sea surface and geophysical modeling led us to the conclusion that sea level peaked at about 6 to 9 meters above present during this time period.  Additional geophysical modeling of the earth's mantle, which affects vertical movement at the earth's surface, further led us to conclude that it may not be possible to refine this estimate to a narrower range based on the potential influence of mantle dynamics over the past 125,000 years.  The field work conducted also enabled us to conclude that integration of important metadata, such as reef architecture, stratigraphy, and types of corals present are critically important to the robust interpretation of the past position of sea level that is reconstructed using fossil corals.  Our work in Jamaica also revealed the influence of vertical tectonic motions across the island that have occurred in the past 125,000 years.  Results from this research were integrated into a high-impact review paper that assessed the amount of sea level rise during past warm periods in the last 3 million years.  This work showed that at least 6 m of sea-level rise has occurred during these past warm periods when global mean temperatures increased by only 1 to 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, indicating a strong sensitivity of the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.    The results of this research were dissemenated during outreach events at local to international venues, were broadly disseminated in media coverage associated with several publications, and were integrated into two displays at the Florida Museum of Natural History.  This research also contributed to the training and development of multiple undergraduate and graduate students and fostered several successful international collaborations.
