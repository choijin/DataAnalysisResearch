<AbstractNarration>The neural circuits, called central pattern generators (CPGs), underlying rhythmic behaviors (e.g., walking, breathing, chewing) are functionally flexible, producing multiple versions of a particular behavior (e.g., walking, running, swimming). A central goal in neuroscience is to determine how the output of a behaviorally-appropriate circuit is selected from such multifunctional circuits. Projection neurons are a major source for altering circuit output and, like most neural circuits, CPG circuits provide feedback to their projection neuron inputs. However, little is known regarding the function and modifiability of this feedback. Thus, this proposal aims to determine whether the strength of CPG feedback to projection neurons is modifiable and, if so, how such modulation alters projection neuron activity and the resulting CPG output pattern. To this end, multiple electrophysiological techniques will be utilized at the level of the projection neuron, CPG and muscle. It is anticipated that this project will provide the first demonstration of long-term modulation of CPG feedback and a cellular-level analysis of its functional consequences. It will also emphasize the under-appreciated concept that neural systems do not operate via a unidirectional flow of information, but require bidirectional communication between so called hierarchical levels. Both general principles and specific circuit mechanisms determined in the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system used in this proposal have effectively translated to other systems, including the mammalian CNS. The demonstration that circuit feedback is modifiable would open a new line of research in other systems, where feedback was not previously considered as a site of plasticity in determining CPG output. This project will provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, comprising cellular- to systems-level experimentation and analysis, including comprehensive training in electrophysiology, an experimental area in which women and other groups are particularly underrepresented. Students will have opportunities to present their work and interact with colleagues at local, national and international meetings each year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Different versions of rhythmic behaviors (i.e., walking versus running, different chewing patterns) are generated by the nervous system in response to changes in the internal and external demands facing an organism.  A single group of neurons, i.e., a neural circuit, can produce multiple different patterns of electrical activity to generate different variants of a rhythmic behavior. Distinct rhythmic activity patterns can be selected from a neural circuit by activity in inputs originating in higher order regions of the nervous system.  These higher order inputs commonly receive feedback from the circuit that they act on.  Yet, little is known about the function of such feedback or whether the feedback itself is flexible.  In this project we used a well-described system underlying chewing and filtering of food in crustaceans (stomatogastric nervous system).  We asked whether feedback from chewing and filtering circuits to higher order inputs is flexible, and if so, what consequences a change in feedback strength has for the higher order inputs, the circuits, and the muscles which ultimately produce the chewing and filtering behaviors.  Although the presence of feedback is well-established, for the first time we demonstrated that feedback in a rhythmic motor system is flexible.  A stimulus that activates a particular chewing version, enhances the strength of feedback from the circuit onto higher order inputs.  This has important implications, as we found that the feedback cannot alter the activity of the higher order inputs when at its baseline strength, and as a consequence, the activity pattern of circuit neurons and of the muscles is different, which will result in a different chewing rhythm.  These results raised the possibility that any activation of a neural circuit would enhance the strength of feedback.  However, we found that a second feedback pathway is enhanced by one stimulus but not another, demonstrating that there is specificity in the regulation of feedback strength to higher order inputs.   By regulating feedback strength, different stimuli activate higher order inputs with distinct activity patterns and rates.  We therefore determined how the effects of feedback on higher order activity regulated the patterns produced by the filtering and chewing circuits.  We found that the effects of feedback were able to alter circuit output regardless of the level of activation of the circuit.  Further, the manner in which the effects of feedback changed activity of the filtering versus the chewing circuits was similar for some aspects, but different for other aspects of circuit function.  These data provided the first analysis of the effects of circuit feedback across a full physiological range of activity of a higher order input.   As part of our goal to enhance understanding of how inputs communicate with their targets, we found that there appears to be more tightly constrained structural relationships than expected between cells which enhance feedback and their target higher order neuron. In examining communication from the nervous system to muscles, we found that multiple muscles can interpret neural signals differently.  Further, across the typical range of activity of the chewing system, the extent of differences in muscle responses varies.  Overall, our results not only identify feedback from a circuit to its higher order inputs as a site of flexibility in a motor pathway, but also reveal the complex way in which feedback can shape the particular activity pattern produced by circuits, how muscles will interpret those activity patterns, and therefore the particular behavioral version that will occur.  Extensive previous research has revealed parallel organization and function across circuits, supporting the high likelihood that similar regulation of circuit feedback will be identified in future studies in other rhythmic motor systems.  Additionally, circuit feedback is prevalent in other types of circuits, suggesting that these results will likely also provide a framework for future studies on other types of neural circuits.   This project provided training opportunities for two graduate students, each of whom completed a Master?s degree, and eight undergraduate students.  Students participated in protocol development and experimentation, data analysis, figure and manuscript preparation, and presented their findings at local, regional and national meetings and contributed as co-authors on peer-reviewed publications.  The PI?s lab provides a unique opportunity for both graduate and undergraduate students to actively participate in single cell and circuit level electrophysiological experiments at Miami University.  Students from the lab have been accepted into graduate and medical school programs and a graduate student obtained a position in pharmaceutical research. Students and the PI have participated in outreach activities introducing elementary school students to the study of the nervous system, and in a program for underrepresented groups in STEM fields at the high school level.  Results of this project have been disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, many presentations by the PI and students at scientific conferences, and in lectures in the Neural Systems and Behavior course at the Marine Biological Laboratory, which are publicly available.
