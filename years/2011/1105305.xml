<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to further explore and understand different geometric structures on surfaces and natural induced dynamical systems on the corresponding moduli spaces. We intend to study the dynamics of natural geometric flows on the cotangent bundle of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of a given genus. Most of the results and questions in this area are based on analogies between these flows and unipotent flows on homogeneous spaces. We also plan to investigate the asymptotic behavior of intersection pairings of tautological line bundles on the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces of genus g as g goes to infinity. This could shed some light on geometric properties of random hyperbolic surfaces of large genus in different models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main problems motivating our proposed project are centered around the geometry of Riemann surfaces and their deformations. Moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces appear naturally in various contexts, for example in algebraic geometry and string theory. This research proposal is interdisciplinary and has connections to different branches of mathematics, especially dynamical systems, low dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, hyperbolic geometry and geometric group theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A translation surface is a surface made by gluing together polygons in the plane by Euclidean isometries. The Euclidean metric on the plane induces a (singular) metric on the surface which can be interpreted as a holomorphic quadratic differential on the underlying Reimann surface structure determined by the metric..    The set of 2x2 matrices with real entries and determinant 1 is denoted by SL_2(R).  Applying such a matrix to the polygons that make up a translation surface determines a new translation surface and a new quadratic differential. The set of all such quadratic differentials obatined from a single translation surface by applying all such matrices is called an orbit.  Typically an orbit is dense in (a stratum of) the moduli space of quadratic differentials.  However, sometimes it can have a closure that it is smaller than the entire space.  Such closures have an interesting algebraic and analytic structure that is called an affine invariant manifold.  This project was focused on proving results regarding the classification and properties of orbit closures and invariant measures for the SL_2(R) action on the moduli spaces of quadratic differentials. It also studied the geometry of individual translation surfaces and the statistical occurrence of various properties like short geodesics between singularities.
