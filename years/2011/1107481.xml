<AbstractNarration>The scientific goals and methods that address the intellectual merits of the research are: (1) Expand on existing lake monitoring sites in northern Alaska by developing a network of regionally representative lakes along environmental gradients from which we will collect baseline data to assess current physical, chemical, and biological lake characteristics.  This will allow the project scientists to make spatial and temporal comparisons to determine the impact of warmer temperatures, changing cloud cover and precipitation patterns, permafrost degradation, and direct human impacts on lakes; (2) Implement a multiscale (hierarchical) lake instrumentation scheme such that basic data is collected from 51 lakes, while a subset of lakes are more intensively instrumented; (3) Provide regional scaling and extrapolation of key metrics through calibration and validation of satellite imagery with ground measurements; and (4) Develop and implement standardized protocols to enable inter-site comparison and to prepare for expansion towards a pan-Arctic network. The education/outreach goals that address the broader impacts of the research outlined above are: (1) Incorporate indigenous observations of lake physical and biological characteristics and changes. Innovative interactive methods of sharing information will be developed and made available through native and local organizations. Scientific and technical training will be provided to IÃ±upiat students for monitoring lake and drinking water quality; (2) Develop a demonstration monitoring network based on the Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) architecture and link this network to research centers, indigenous communities, and other power- and connectivity-challenged environments; (3) Develop and refine data management, visualization, and archiving activities with A-CADIS; and (4) Provide an introduction to Arctic science for several beginning investigators.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The global distribution of lakes is much higher in northern latitudes partly due to vast regions of permafrost terrain that form lakes (Figure 1). In Arctic regions underlain by permafrost, the climate is changing more rapidly and there is much interest in how vast numbers of lakes are responding to these changes. The CALON (Circum-Arctic Lakes Observation Network, www.arcticlakes.org) project begins to address this need by systematically collecting baseline datasets from lakes across Arctic Alaska landscapes using year-round sensor networks, synoptic sampling campaigns in the late winter and mid-summer, and remote sensing.

These data are archived with the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS) for other scientists, resource managers, and the general public to access. Our team has already used these datasets to answer questions about how lake ice-out timing varies by lake and with changing climate and provides a linkage to evaporation rates (Figure 5). Understanding this relationship between winter ice growth, lake depth, and water balance has implications for how regional hydrology, water supply, and habitat for fish, waterbirds, and other organisms will respond to changing Arctic climate. &nbsp;Lake temperature at the water-sediment interface (lake bed) and measured maximum ice thickness data were also used to develop new models to predict how lakes impact permafrost.

We expect that these and other CALON datasets will continue to be used to develop new models, serve as a baseline for future comparison, and improve our understanding of the Arctic where freshwater systems play a such a dominant role. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/09/2016<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;D&nbsp;Arp</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1107481/1107481_10128896_1473378125551_CALON_ProjectOutcomes_Fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1107481/1107481_10128896_1473378125551_CALON_ProjectOutcomes_Fig5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1107481/1107481_10128896_1473378125551_CALON_ProjectOutcomes_Fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The relationship between ice-out timing and lake evaporation rates are clearly demonstrated with data collected from the CALON observation network.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Arp, C.
