<AbstractNarration>To address the lack of rigorous geoscience classes in high schools and geoscience career awareness among students, California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB) has been supporting dual-credit physical geology classes at two schools in the Kern High School District (KHSD) for many years.  Students completing the classes receive transferable university credit.  With this award, CSUB is enhancing existing dual-credit KHSD physical geology classes through augmentation of school geoscience teaching materials, field experiences, guest speakers from professional geoscientists, and stipends and scholarships aimed specifically at recruiting students into CSUB and area community college geology programs. CSUB is also implementing a rigorous assessment program that will collect evidence on the effectiveness of the dual-credit classes in improving the pipeline from high schools to college geoscience programs, particularly with regard to the participation of Hispanic students.  Funds are also being used to help propagate the model program through creation of similar classes at other schools in the region.  The overarching goal of this project is to document the effectiveness of dual-credit classes in recruiting students into geoscience majors and identify the most effective elements and strategies of these classes, with a focus on minority students.  The findings will be used to guide others interested in developing similar classes and strengthen the case to school districts, principals, and university faculty and administrators for offering them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A key obstacle to recruiting students into geoscience majors is the lack of rigorous geoscience classes in high schools and the resulting lack of knowledge about the relevance of the field and the excellent career opportunities it offers.  One approach to address this problem is through dual-credit classes which are supported by universities.  The opportunity to earn college credit attracts students who intend to go to college and are capable to be successful in a geoscience major.  California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB) Geology faculty have long supported year-long dual-credit Geology classes taken by about 90 seniors per year at South and Ridgeview High Schools in the Kern High School District (KHSD).  The main goals of this project were to evaluate the effectiveness of the classes and to expand them to other schools. The grant has allowed expansion of the classes to five additional schools in Kern County and beyond. The classes are now taken by about 400 high school students per year. About 300 of these students with a grade of B and higher receive college credit. The classes have been effective in recruiting student into geoscience majors. For example, in 2014, 13 of CSUBÃ†s new geology freshmen came from the high school classes. Many others are likely pursuing geoscience majors at other universities. Student surveys show that even among students who do not pursue geoscience majors, knowledge of the geosciences and appreciation of their value increases strongly. The project has supported the evaluation of the classes through a recently completed doctoral dissertation and the dissemination of the model through presentations at professional meetings of the Geological Society of America and the National and California Science Teachers Associations.
