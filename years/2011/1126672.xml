<AbstractNarration>The primary purpose of the ARIANNA Ultra-High Energy (UHE) Neutrino project is to observe ~40 cosmogenic neutrinos per year originated by the GZK mechanism with sufficient precision to determine their energy spectrum and interaction properties. The energy spectrum of GZK neutrinos provides important insight on the production mechanism and source distribution of the cosmic rays. In addition, a statistically significant measurement of the angular distribution of the diffuse cosmogenic neutrino signal can be used to infer the interaction cross-section at energies beyond those probed by Large Hadron Collider. While the physics of the GZK mechanism is straightforward (extragalactic UHE protons collide with cosmic microwave background photons, producing pions that eventually decay to neutrinos), answering how the cosmic rays were accelerated to very high energies is especially difficult because cosmic rays are bent by magnetic fields in our Galaxy, and their range is limited by the GZK mechanism to ~100 megaparcecs. There is now a long legacy of successful high-energy neutrino programs that utilize the abundant and transparent ice of Antarctica. In particular, ARIANNA relies on the detection of radio pulses generated after neutrino interactions in dense media by the Askaryan effect, capitalizing on several remarkable properties of the Ross Ice Shelf near McMurdo Station, the hub of U.S. Antarctic Program operations: (1) the ice is impressively transparent to electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies, (2) the water-ice boundary below the shelf behaves like a good mirror to reflect radio signals from neutrinos in any downward direction, and (3) background noise levels were quite modest in the frequency band of interest. Its close proximity to McMurdo Station provides a number of suitable options for logistical support, and ARIANNA's scalable architecture allows it to follow the science. This award allows the project to develop the data acquisition electronics required by the ARIANNA autonomous stations. Experience gained in operating the hexagonal array with precision, low power electronics would frame the performance requirements needed to expand the array in the future. The project will continue contributing significantly to the training of next generation of scientists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with technology and instrumentation development, field observations, and scientific analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The origin of Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) cosmic rays remains one of the great mysteries of astrophysics. Cosmogenic neutrinos created by these cosmic rays come hurtling towards the Earth at energies between 1016-1020eV, well above the energy scale of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, but until recently had never been detected. In 2013, high energy neutrino astronomy began when the IceCube neutrino detector at the South Pole announced that it had discovered 28 of neutrinos, though at energies too small to be cosmogenic neutrinos. Researchers do not know what is creating these neutrinos.  This broad goal of this project is to open the extreme energy window of neutrino astronomy by constructing an array of 1296 ARIANNA stations. This state-of-the-art neutrino telescope exploits the revolutionary Askaryan radio technique to target the extreme energy spectrum, defined here to be 1016-1020 eV.  ARIANNA will improve source identification because it can measure the direction of extreme energy neutrinos with 3 degree precision compared to 10-15 degrees for IceCube. Conversely, IceCube can measure the events with better energy resolution. Since both detectors view almost the same sky at extreme energies, there is even greater power when results are combined. For example, the observation of a rare, explosive source by two independent telescopes with different systematic uncertainties is almost a scientific necessity for such an important discovery.  Known astrophysical processes and events, such as Fermi acceleration of protons in a magnetic field, break down at the energy scale of UHE cosmic rays, thus another source for their generation must be found. Neutrinos - uncharged, nearly masses subatomic particles - interact with other matter through only the weakest of natureÆs forces, so offer a unique tool for investigating these cosmological processes. On account of this, however, they are among the most difficult particles in the universe to detect, requiring new technologies deployed over an area the size of the city of Los Angeles.  This October, for the second time in 13 years, the Nobel committee cited pioneering science arising from the use of neutrino telescopes.

ARIANNA will allow researchers to understand and perhaps visualize the sources of extragalactic cosmic rays by the detection of cosmogenic or hard-spectra neutrinos. Moreover, ARIANNA is uniquely capable of measuring the mysterious IceCube events if they extend to even higher energies, allowing researchers to unravel their origins. ARIANNA was designed to pursue the unknown in the neutrino sky at extreme energies, and the path forward begins with the first phase, known as ARIANNA-1.   NSF-funded a 7-station pilot program of ARIANNA, called the Hexagonal Radio Array.  It has been operating successfully since December 2014, and has demonstrated superior performance to competing concepts such as the Askaryan Radio Array.

ARIANNAÆs technology is far less costly than IceCube, so it is expandable, and unlike the fossil-fuel-dependent drilling and power sources of other concepts, it is a "green" surface array powered solely by the sun.    In Phase 1, we propose to construct and deploy 100 detector stations, each with 8 log-periodic dipole antennas, in a rectangular grid on the surface of the Ross Ice Shelf. The stations will communicate with the Iridium satellite network.  Based on the 4-antenna models utilized in the ARIANNA Hexagonal Array pilot study, the antenna stations detect reflected conical Cherekov pulses produced by any downward traveling cosmic neutrinos that interact in the ice....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
