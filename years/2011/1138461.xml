<AbstractNarration>Northwestern University proposes to develop computational thinking (CT) activities that can be embedded throughout existing high school STEM curricula. The approach casts a wide net, introducing a diverse range of students (including those from traditionally underrepresented groups) to CT skills through STEM courses that they are already taking. The intent is that students understand that computing is more than programming, it is a vital skill set that pervades modern STEM fields. In addition to the embedded CT activities, the project will develop a full-year course that explores the use of computational methods across a range of disciplines including math, physics, chemistry, biology, and earth/environmental science. This project builds on existing partnerships with local schools and teachers and on an NSF GK12 program, Reach for the Stars, that pairs graduate students in CS/STEM disciplines with local middle and high school teachers to develop CT activities based on the graduate students' research. The current proposal will use this rich set of initial CT activities as a starting point for developing 60 refined CT activities that can be embedded in traditional STEM courses. Two summer professional development workshops and ongoing Saturday sessions will be used to train a team of 30 pilot teachers to test the CT activities in their STEM classrooms. These professional development resources will then be revised for larger-scale replication of our CT curriculum. Evaluation studies will document the CT learning and attitudinal gains for both teachers and students and provide initial evidence on the success of our embedded CT approach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computation is transforming nearly all modern STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) disciplines, yet relatively few students take courses in high school that adequately prepare them for the increasingly technological nature of these fields. There is a pressing need to train future scientists, engineers, and mathematicians who understand and make use of computational thinking (CT) to address complex and increasingly data-driven challenges. Further, the students who do study computational topics tend to not reflect the overall student body, with female and minority students being disproportionately underrepresented.  Emerging national science standards recognize the practice of "using mathematics and computational thinking" (NGSS Lead States, 2013), which reflects this growing importance of computation and digital technologies across the scientific disciplines.  However, it provides little guidance for teachers who will be required to realize it in their classrooms. Much of the difficulty stems from the fact that the practices collected under the umbrella term "computational thinking" have not been clearly defined in terms of their use in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  To address these challenges, this project first developed a definition of computational thinking for the STEM fields in the form of a taxonomy consisting of four main categories: data practices, modeling and simulations practices, computational problem solving practices, and systems thinking practices. In formulating this taxonomy, we drew on the existing computational thinking literature, interviews with STEM practitioners, and exemplary computational thinking instructional materials.  Using this taxonomy of CT skills in STEM as a framework, this project explored the strategy of embedding computational thinking lessons into regular high school STEM coursework.  This approach has a number of advantages. First, by embedding CT into regular STEM courses, we do not face the task of developing and implementing brand new courses in an already full high school curriculum. Second, because students are already required to take math and science courses in order to graduate from high school, we do not need to mount a campaign to recruit a diverse student population to take new elective computation courses. Third, because high school math and science teachers are already prepared to teach their courses, we do not face the challenge of recruiting and training teachers in computation from scratch.  Rather we can simply help them integrate new computational activities into their existing curriculum. Finally, we have an opportunity to enliven science education through the use of computational tools, while doing a better job reflecting the real work of modern STEM practioners.   The results of this project provide promising evidence that our strategy has merit.  We developed a library of nearly two-dozen CT activities for high school biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics classes.  We also developed a set of CT assessments that can be used to measure the growth and development of CT skills in students.  Both our materials and assessments are available on the web at http://ct-stem.northwestern.edu to support the broadest possible use by educators and researchers.   The project also developed teacher professional development materials for use in preparing teachers to understand CT and to implement our CT activities in their classrooms.  This project engaged over 60 teachers from 21 schools in and around the Chicago metro area.  Of these, 5 schools participate in our research study.  Over 1000 high school students benefitted from new CT instruction in their classes.  An analysis of those students who participated in our research study indicated that we were successful in broadening participation to a diverse student population that reflected the overall makeup of the participating schools:  Students were 48% female and 52% male; 33% Afr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
