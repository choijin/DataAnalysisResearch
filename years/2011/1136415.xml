<AbstractNarration>Math for America Los Angeles (MfA LA) is a non-profit organization formed by the University of Southern California (USC), Claremont Graduate University (CGU) and Harvey Mudd College (HMC) whose mission is to raise student achievement by addressing issues of teacher recruitment, retention and quality in the greater Los Angeles area. In concert with current efforts to recruit talented new secondary mathematics teachers through the MfA LA Teacher Fellowship Program, MfA LA is developing a cadre of 24 experienced mathematics teacher leaders. Because of chronic shortages in qualified mathematics teachers in California and the high cost of recruiting and training teachers due to teacher attrition, it is critical to ensure that the most talented teachers do not leave the profession, but instead find avenues for professional growth.  MfA LA has designed a novel, research-based program to give passionate teachers a comprehensive package of training, resources, professional development experiences and connections to become leaders who can enact school change and raise student performance. A key idea of the MfA LAMaster Teaching Fellowship Program (MTFP) is that there is no better way for teachers to develop their leadership capacity than to directly engage them in the work of designing and orchestrating student-centered changes in their schools and districts, with the support of other experienced teachers and STEM educators. Pairs of teachers who work at the same school apply to the program, and if selected, must agree to participate in the program together for at least five years during which time they receive a $10,000 annual stipend, receive training in mentoring, mentor beginning teachers, participate in the three-week Park City Mathematics Institute Secondary School Teachers Program, receive mentoring and support from local STEM faculty and other Master Teachers through regular professional development meetings,  present their work at regional or national mathematics education conferences, and  receive training and support to become certified by the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards. In total, this Master Teacher Fellowship Program includes roughly 300 hours of professional development over five years.  Assuming that one teacher reaches 200 students a year, the 24 MfA LA Master Teachers can directly reach 24,000 students over five years of service while bringing about systemic changes in their schools and districts to improve student performance and helping their colleagues and other beginning teachers improve their practice.</AbstractNarration>

Supported by funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF# 1136415), the M<em>f</em>A LA MTF program was developed to attract experienced and highly-educated math teachers to work in pairs or teams at their school to improve the teaching of mathematics in their schools and districts. The MTF program focused on enhancing teacher practice and leadership skills to ultimately improve student achievement. Specifically, the five-year program involved multiple program activities, such as monthly professional development (PD) meetings; support for regional and national conference attendance; a partner-based school site project with another MTF; an additional common planning period to enact a school site project; and support for National Board Certification. With the support of NSF, M<em>f</em>A LA supported 24 MTFs.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Intellectual Merit</em></p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fellow Retention</span>. The M<em>f</em>A LA MTF program sought to retain the best teachers and help them improve their leadership skills to improve student outcomes in mathematics. MTFs consistently reported the community and support provided by M<em>f</em>A LA was one of the greatest benefits of their participation in the program. The facilitation of community and support provided by M<em>f</em>A LA was a primary reason Fellows attributed to remaining in the program and the teaching profession. Of the 24 supported MTFs, only one did not complete their five-year commitment to the program. Of those who completed, 100% were in the classroom for the 2018-19 school year. A total of 20 (83%) have continued to remain in the program in some capacity including either renewing their commitment or continuing their involvement in program activities.&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teacher Practice and Leadership</span>. Analysis of pre-post MTF observations and self-reported surveys at the beginning and end of the program indicated that MTFs? teaching practice as well as transformational and instructional leadership increased throughout their time in M<em>f</em>A LA. Teaching practice and quality was assessed via classroom observations at the beginning and end of MTFs? participation. Overall, MTFs showed improvement across all five domains over time including: mathematics content, pedagogy, classroom management, classroom culture, and physical environment. Leadership skills of MTFs were assessed via transformational and instructional leadership scales at the beginning and end of the program. Overall, there was a notable difference in both the transformational and instructional leadership skills of the MTFs who completed the program, such that MTFs reported their transformational and instructional leadership skills were higher after completing the program.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effects on Students</span>. Analysis of multiple data sources revealed students of M<em>f</em>A LA Fellows have more positive attitudes towards mathematics and are more likely to pass and achieve a higher score on the Smarter Balance Assessment Consortium (SBAC). Students of M<em>f</em>A LA Fellows reported notably higher perceptions of their teacher, more positive attitudes about their math self-concept and math motivation, and lower math anxiety at the end of the school year, suggesting students of M<em>f</em>A LA Fellows have more positive attitudes towards mathematics compared with students with a mathematics teacher not in the program.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Broader Impacts</em></p> <p>Overall, it is estimated that the 24 teachers supported reached approximately 200 students a year over their five-year commitment. Therefore, the supported MTFs reached an estimated total of 23,600 students.</p> <p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em>MTFs spent numerous hours reading research on best practices in the classroom, attending mathematics or education conferences, attending Monthly Saturday PD Meetings, and developing their site-based projects. In addition, MTFs frequently facilitated or led PD within their school (1,110 hours total), district (176 hours total), monthly PD meetings (414 hours total), or other PD (347 hours total). MTFs also presented at regional and national mathematics or education conferences, with half presenting at least once and some presenting as many as 8 times during their Fellowship.&nbsp;</p> <p>Supported MTFs provided insight into how their participation has affected others across their department and school.

MTFs frequently described the opportunities to learn from other Fellows at monthly PD meetings and the opportunity to present in various formats (e.g., Burst Sessions, conferences) as central components in their leadership development and facilitating systemic changes within their schools and districts. As one MTF reported, ?? <em>I have a wide range of knowledge from MfA LA that my colleagues don't have access to... I feel that I am way ahead of the curve compared to my peers because of MfA LA</em>..." MTFs also reported an increase in trust within their department through collaboration and sharing resources. In addition, curriculum revisions and teaching strategies were spread widely throughout departments.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/14/2021<br>      Modified by:
