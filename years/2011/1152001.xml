<AbstractNarration>Packet transmission is one of the primary operations conducted by Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). All the existing work for packet transmission in WMNs is based on the Deterministic Network Model (DNM), where a pair of nodes is assumed to be either connected or disconnected. However, this assumption is not always practical and reasonable. Mesh clients are usually connected wirelessly to mesh routers resulting in unstable links. This project seeks a new exploratory study on one-off/continuous convergecast and broadcast scheduling under a more realistic Probabilistic Network Model (PNM), where a certain communication success probability is assigned to each link. Factors, such as different MAC protocols, pipeline technologies, and multi-radio multi-channel, are also taken into account for a comprehensive design and theoretical capacity analysis. For convergecast, the following four aspects are investigated: network model definition, network partition methods to identify non-inference zones, scheduling techniques for concurrent transmissions, and capacity analysis. For broadcast, Connected Dominating Set based schemes are developed. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms and the pipeline techniques are evaluated theoretically and through simulations and experiments. The success of this project provides a general framework for packet transmission in probabilistic WMNs with unstable links. Furthermore, this project also has great impacts on other kinds of wireless networks which similarly demonstrate the probabilistic characteristic. The research results will be integrated into education, and widely disseminated through conference/journal publications.</AbstractNarration>

A network is firstly partitioned into small square cells. The average number of wireless nodes and the upper bound of the number of wireless nodes in a cell are calculated. Secondly, the best size of Compatible Transmission Cell Set (CTCS) is derived such that all the CTCSs can conduct data transmissions simultaneously in an interference-free manner. Thirdly, a data collection tree is constructed and a Cell-based Multi-Path Scheduling (CMPS) algorithm is proposed based on the data collection tree. We also proved the algorithm is order-optimal.  2)      We studied the continuous convergecast problem under the probabilistic wireless network model. We introduced the Compressive Data Gathering (CDG) technology and demonstrated that CDG can be used for continuous convergecast algorithms. A Zone-based Pipeline Scheduling (ZPS) method was then proposed. We demonstrated that the proposed continuous convergecast algorithm is order-optimal.  3)      We investigated one-off distributed convergecast in asynchronous wireless networks. Firstly, to avoid data transmission interference, we derive an R-Proper Carrier-sensing Range under the generalized physical interference model, where R is the satisfied data receiving rate threshold. We derived the best range of R. Secondly, based on R-PCR, we proposed a Distributed Data Collection (DDC) algorithm with fairness consideration. The achievable network capacity is order optimal.  4)      We studied distributed data aggregation in wireless networks under the Poisson node distribution model. We first apply R-PCR to the distributed data aggregation problem. Then data aggregation can be performed through a Connected Dominate Set. The achievable network capacity of data aggregation was analyzed.  5)      We designed a data collection algorithm for reconstructing the 3D physical world. Two physical world aware data acquisition algorithms based on Hermit Interpolation and Spline Interpolation were proposed. A continuous time curve to show the variation of the physical world can then be obtained. After that, a physical world reconstructing algorithm was proposed to make use of the sensed curves.  6)      We studied converagecast when the wireless nodes are not static. The proposed algorithm, Data Collection with Probabilistic Guarantees (DCPG), can adjust the system parameters to guarantee that the average data collection ratio is greater than the user specified data collection ratio.
