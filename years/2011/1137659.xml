<AbstractNarration>This project will conduct the first comprehensive demographic study of solar and space physics and related scientific disciplines. This includes scientists who investigate: 1) the Sun; 2) the nature of the region of space affected by our sun; and 3) the response of Earth and the rest of our solar system to this space environment.  The disciplinary areas in which these scientists operate include: solar physics, space physics, magnetospheric physics, aeronomy, and upper atmospheric physics.  The project is a collaboration between the co-chairs of the Education &amp; Workforce working group associated with the ongoing National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey in Solar and Space Physics with the American Institute of Physics (AIP).  The objective of the project is to assess the demographic health of these tightly coupled areas of scientific endeavor.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main components of this research were:  1) a National Demographic Survey of professionals in the solar and space physics field; and 2) a Pathways Study of graduate students to identify factors that lead college undergraduates to do graduate work in solar or space physics. The research helped to inform the development of a 10-year strategic plan for solar and space physics.  This work is significant because:  1) there had been no prior demographic study of this scientific domain;  2) the professionals being studied are the stewards of millions of dollars in federal funding;  and 3) the field being studied is highly relevant to society.  The field informs how solar storms affect vital space-based and ground-based assets (e.g. power grids, communication, weather &amp; navigation satellites), and how variations in the SunÃ†s output relate to other important issues such as ozone depletion and climate change.  This project collaborated with the American Institute of Physics (AIP), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and multiple professional societies to compile the most complete data base of solar and space physics professionals to date.  This in itself was a rather large challenge because practitioners in solar and space physics are trained in many areas of science (from math to physics to astrophysics to chemistry to atmospheric science to computer science to engineering), and they work in a variety of academic departments and types of institutions (government labs, non-profit organizations, industries, and universities).

The research team interviewed a total of 48 graduate students (29 males and 19 females currently in graduate programs at US institutions,) who volunteered to discuss in small group settings what attracted and retained them along their pathways leading to grad school.
