<AbstractNarration>This award funds the establishment of a Research Data Center (RDC)  at the University of Washington.  RDCs offer researchers secure access to data collected by the Census Bureau and other participating government agencies.  The centers  meet all physical and computer security requirements for access to confidential data and they allow researchers to use Census Bureau data files to study relationships between social, economic, environmental, and health process and outcomes in a unique way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This center is the first center in the Pacific Northwest and joins a network of 12 other RDCs located in Washington DC,  Boston, Ann Arbor, Berkeley, Los Angeles, North Carolina, Chicago, New York, Texas, and Atlanta.  This RDC will be used by researchers from a variety of institutions; besides the University of Washington, other users will come from Washington State University, the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, and Portland State University.  All research projects conducted at the center will go through a review process to protect data confidentiality.  Researchers using the center include economists, sociologists, statisticians, health scientists, and civil engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center will provide new facilities for graduate student training and will lead to new collaborations between university researchers, private foundations in the Seattle area, and local governments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project helped establish the Northwest Federal Statistical Research Data Center (NWRDC) at the University of Washington, Seattle in 2012.   A Federal Statistical Research Data Center (RDC) is a Census Bureau facility staffed by a Census Bureau employee that meets all physical and computer security requirements for access to confidential data.   These facilities used to be called Census Research Data Centers but have been renamed Federal Statistical Research Data Centers to reflect their provision of restricted data from multiple federal agencies.   At RDCs, researchers from academia, federal agencies, and other institutions with approved projects receive restricted access to Census Bureau data files - including decennial census, economic, health, and environmental data - that are not publicly available. Many of these datasets provide unique opportunities to study relationships between a variety of social, economic, environmental and health processes/outcomes. Such data are vital if one wants to investigate relationships at microspatial scales with individual, establishment or institutional data.    The NWRDC yielded INTELLECTUAL MERIT by providing local access to restricted-use data sets for faculty at UW and other regional higher education institutions in the Northwest working in social, economic, health, environment, public policy and other fields. These data enhance the capacity of researchers in all of these areas to conduct scientifically meritorious research and to produce findings of benefit to the Census Bureau and other government agencies that provide access to restricted data through RDCs.    The NWRDC created BROADER IMPACT by providing opportunities for graduate and postdoctoral research training on projects requiring confidential data. As such, the NWRDC has enhanced skills for young social scientists and thereby increased their ability to pursue successful research careers.   The NWRDC has also attracted young researchers to UW, increasing the local pool of talent working in the social sciences, public policy and health fields.  The NWRDC is a physical facility - a computer lab with secured entry and monitoring equipment - near UWÆs campus that was remodeled with UW funds and supplied with equipment funded by UW, NSF, and the US Census Bureau. UW pays the ongoing operating cost of the facility, including all personnel costs. The facility has 12 thin clients that provide access to restricted use datasets stored on census servers in Maryland via an encrypted VPN. The lab is secured with a security system and actively monitored by the RDC administrator (a census bureau employee, paid by a subcontract from UW to the census bureau). Only approved researchers can enter the lab and the only output that can be released has to be approved by the census disclosure review process to ensure confidentiality. Having the facility on UW's campus enables UW researchers in social sciences, public policy, and public health to access restricted use data without having to travel to site far away.  Researchers gain access to the lab by submitting a proposal for census bureau and other agency review.  Only after a successful review and approval, and with security clearance, can they gain access to the lab and the data.  Here is a brief listing of projects that have used the lab during the three years of its operation: 1. Understanding Informational Barriers to Trade Using the Scope of Exported Products and U.S. State Exporting Promotion Programs.  PI: Andrew Cassey, Washington State University.   2. Firm Dynamics Across Sectors and Countries. PI: Mu-Jeung Yang, University of Washington.    3. A spatial-demographic analysis of the imputation of race and ethnicity in US population and survey data. PI: Michael Babb, University of Washington.   4. How Much does Access to Health Insurance Influence the Timing of Retirement?  PI: Norma Coe, University of Washington.    5.
