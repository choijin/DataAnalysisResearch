<AbstractNarration>The proposal describes several projects related to algorithmic and asymptotic aspects of group theory:&lt;br/&gt;    * Constructing finitely presented groups with "transcendental" properties (in particular, finitely presented infinite torsion groups).&lt;br/&gt;    * Complexity of residually finite groups.&lt;br/&gt;    * Asymptotic and Burnside properties of group actions of maximal growth&lt;br/&gt;    * Asymptotic cones of finitely presented groups.&lt;br/&gt;    * Asymptotic properties of amenable groups.&lt;br/&gt;These topics are intimately related. For example, Higman embeddings and S-machines are going to be used to construct finitely presented torsion groups and in the study of complexity of the word problem in groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern group theory is a very fast developing area of mathematics that accumulates methods from geometry, combinatorics, logic and computer science. Our proposal describes projects that are require methods and ideas from all these areas. In particular, constructing a finitely presented infinite torsion group (which is one of the outstanding problems in group theory) will require constructing a suitable kind of Turing machine (called S-machines) and adapting methods from geometric group theory to find suitable quotients of groups simulating these machines. Another idea coming from geometry (and due mostly to Gromov) is the idea of an asymptotic cone of a group. We are going to study asymptotic cones to discover algebraic and algorithmic properties of groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Describe the project outcomes or findings that address the intellectual merit and broader of impacts of your work as defined in the NSF merit review criteria.   The project was concerned with problems in group theory, a large and very active area of mathematics with deep applications in many parts of science and technology ranging from physics and chemistry to statistics and cryptology.   Broader impact of he work of the PIs include memberships in editorial boards of several major mathematics jpurnals, publishing a book in Springer monograph series, support of at 4 PhD students and several postdoctoral fellows working under the supervision of the PIs.   Briefly summarize the outcomes of your award (200 &ndash; 800 words) covering the entire life of the award.   The results of the project have been published in the top mathematics journals including Transactions of AMS, Journal of AMS, Duke Mathematics Journal, Advances in Mathematics. The main results include the aspherical version of the Higman embedding theorem, first examples of computationally complex residually finite groups and groups with Tarski numbers 5 and 6, monster-type actions of the free group, first examples of amenable groups with arbitrarily poor Hilbert space compression, a description of Jones' subgroup of the R. Thompson group F, etc.        Last Modified: 06/30/2016       Submitted by: Mark V Sapir]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
