<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;In support of NSF/ENG's Emerging Frontiers in Research Innovation (EFRI) Resilient and Sustainable Infrastructures (RESIN) portfolio of projects, all eight RESIN project teams as well as other invitees from across the nation will convene at Champaign, Illinois on November 17-18, 2011 in order to (i) finalize overarching metrics for sustainability, resilience, and robustness (SRR) of critical infrastructure systems, and (ii) promote implementation of these synthesized metrics in infrastructure system modeling across various application contexts. Another principal objective is to strategize on means to overcome critical conceptual and computational barriers that are common across RESIN projects.  Secondary  objectives are to coordinate RESIN educational and outreach activities, and to discuss future opportunities and a path forward for the RESIN community.  At the workshop, each RESIN team will make presentations summarizing their modeling efforts to date.  New concepts and broader definitions will be provided by invited experts to provide additional breadth and depth to the discussion.  Breakout sessions will be held on specific topics (i.e., metrics, modeling, and engineering implications of SRR, and education, outreach and future research opportunities).  This workshop, via the advancement of new engineering standards and guidelines for achieving  sustainability, resilience and robustness in infrastructure systems, is targeted to have a significant impact on infrastructure system modeling across multiple engineering disciplines.  The workshop materials will be documented (e.g., via videotaping, voice recording) and will be available for downloading permanently at the conference website. The deliverables include (i) a workshop report to NSF including a summary of breakout sessions, (ii) a finalized summary paper of interdisciplinary definitions of SRR, and (iii) a technical report and/or compiled book chapters that summarize the quantitative applications of SRR concepts/definitions in various infrastructure contexts.</AbstractNarration>
