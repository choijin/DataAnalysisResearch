<AbstractNarration>This year's Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern University October 13-15, 2011. This series of annual meetings at Northwestern University has entered its thirty-third year. As in the past, this year's Colloquium consists of two programs. The central theme of the Research Program is probability in analysis and other related fields, whose centerpiece will be two lectures by Russell Lyons of Indiana University. The topic of the Tutorial Program is mass transportation and applications to probability and will be led by Karl-Theodor Sturm of Bonn University. In addition to providing full support for the speakers, the funds from the NSF will be used to cover partial travel and lodging expenses for graduate students, younger researchers, members of unrepresented minority groups, and several senior active participants.</AbstractNarration>

Hsu, Northwestern University  Report Submission Period: 07/01/2011 to 06/30/2012   The sole purpose of this grant in the amount of $22,000 was to support the annual Midwest Probability Colloquium at Northwestern University, now in its 33rd year.  This successful conference series providesWe every  year an opportunity for mathematicians from probability  theory, stochastic analysis, statistics, and other related  fields to come together to reporttheir latest research  achievements and to exchange ideas with  their colleagues from other institutions. Equally importantly,  it provides high advanced graduate students working on their thesis and young researchers just starting their career an  opportunity to discuss their research and and to find new research problems.  The fund received from this grant has been used exclusively to defray the cost of the invited speakers and to give financial support for graduate students and young  researchers to attend the conference. This year's invited speakers were as follows.  Research Program:  Amarjit Buddhiraja (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, one lecture)  Eric Carlen (Rutgers University, one lecture)  Elena Kosygina (Baruch College, one lecture)  Russell Lyons (Indiana University, two lectures)  Tutorial Program (topic: probability theory and mass transportation)  Karl-Theodor Sturm (Bonn University, two lectures)  Alessio Figali (University of Texas, one lecture).  This year's conference was attended by well over 100 people from all over the country.          Last Modified: 12/31/2012       Submitted by: Elton P Hsu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
