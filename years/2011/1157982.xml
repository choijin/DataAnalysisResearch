<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Plants use the sun's energy to convert carbon dioxide gas into the organic materials required for life. Key to this primary productivity is the axial extension of plant stems into the atmosphere where leaves can capture sunlight and exchange gases.  The same axial growth process drives roots into the soil to find water, nutrients and a stable footing for the organism.  This project is focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which seed plants execute this axial growth plan at a cellular level.  Seed plants have taken one of the major polymer systems found in all eukaryotic cells, the microtubules, and repurposed them as patterning agents.  The plant cell creates specific patterns of microtubules just underneath the cell's membrane that act as templates for the construction of the fibrous walls created on the outside of the cell.  It is the cell wall that ultimately gives the plant its structure and rigidity.  The finely detailed nanofabrication of the plant cell wall underlies the ability of all seed plants to extend axially up into the sunlight or down into the soil.  This work employs modern molecular genetic techniques and advanced cell biological methods in the Arabidopsis model system with the aim of discovering what genes are specifically required for organizing the microtubule arrays for axial cell growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;The basic science being performed impacts several areas of practical and commercial interest.  Crop plant plot density is directly dependent upon the axial growth habit (e.g. corn or soybean fields). This work will further elucidate the genes involved in mechanical extension of the hypocotyl during seed germination, a critical period in crop plant development.  This work provides valuable information about plant microtubule dynamics, a common herbicide target, and the patterning of cellulose polymers in the cell wall, the major biofuels feedstock.  This project provides advanced training for a post-doctoral fellow and two (sequential) graduate students.  The training will include exposure to leading-edge imaging technologies and integrated mathematical modeling.  At least 2 undergraduate students will be working on this project as part of their undergraduate honors thesis requirements.  Specialized techniques developed for acquisition and analysis of live-cell image data are being presented as technical reports and in seminars to advance the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major outcome of this study is a complete, quantitative assessment of the microtubule array patterning on the outer face of the axially growing hypocotyl cell.  The microtubule arrays play a dominant role in shaping the plant cell through direction or patterning of the cellulose that is deposited into the cell wall.  How the microtubules form specific patterns, therefore, impacts how the plant forms stems, leaves, roots and all of cells with specialized functions during development.  The fascinating part about these cells is that they have evolved away from using the centrosome to organized their microtubules.  We show clearly and unambiguously that the patterns generated in the plant cell arise from directed processes, not random events.  These cells have transferred much of the microtubule patterning information to the plasma membrane where there are molecular mechanisms, as yet understood, that control the position and direction of microtubule nucleation.  The affect of these contributions is that 10-15 years of work from a broad consortium of laboratories looking for ?self-organization? as a means to explain the patterning in plant cells can now be safely laid to rest.  The focus now turns toward understanding what molecules are critical for locally defining the direction of nucleation, a scenario that is remarkably similar to where things currently stand for non-centrosomal nucleation in animal systems.  The genetic screen performed over the course of 2 years found several important factors for microtubule organization in plant cells and a potentially key factor linking activity to the cell wall.  However, the screen informed us that there are not likely to be singular affecting agents of microtubule dynamics or microtubule/microtubule interactions that specifically alter the patterning as prescribed by the general hypotheses governing self-organization.  Rather, all of our collective evidence points to spatially controlled changes to the frequency and direction of microtubule nucleation.  These finding are a critical step along the path of understanding how the microtubule polymers orchestrate the deposition of cellulose into the plant cell wall, the single largest store of fixed carbon in our biosphere.
