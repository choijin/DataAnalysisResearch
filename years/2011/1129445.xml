<AbstractNarration>The Information Assurance Program (IAP) of the Informatics Research Institute (IRI) at Idaho State is supporting two additional cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students in Information Assurance (IA) and MBA as a part of their existing Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of this program is a mandatory participation in a weekly 20-hour Practicum, generating a variety of student research projects focused on the broad theme of organizational information asset protection. The program is recognized for producing students possessing solid knowledge and abilities to conduct routine IA activities such as certification and accreditation audits. To date, thirty seven students graduated from the program and were employed in cybersecurity positions in the federal government. Another unique feature of the Idaho State University SFS program is a requirement to complete three standard IA certifications: Security+, SSCP and CISSP. An interesting aspect of the program is its integration of MBA business skills with IA knowledge, producing rare and attractive graduates that are in demand by hiring managers of many federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is having an immediate impact on the cybersecurity capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with security skills to federal agencies. Recruitment of underrepresented groups expands upon the normal recruitment of women and minorities at ISU and is resulting in a better diversity in the SFS program than the overall campus percentages. Both PIs have developed a very active partnership with Hampton University, an HBCU, which is creating a strong minority pipeline to the ISU program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at Idaho State University (ISU) emphasizes both hard and soft modalities (skills) to enhance our studentÃ†s viability to be productive in a federal government information assurance/cybersecurity position.  The  NIATEC SFS program at ISU is recognized as a premier educational process in the SFS program.  Through a series of lectures and hands-on activities as well as business administration coursework, our highly motivated students expand their knowledge and abilities.  Our program includes an AACSB accredited MBA as well as rigorous and well-rounded studies in information assurance.  The SFS students complete 24 graduate hours of business curriculum plus, at the minimum, an additional 9 hours of information assurance coursework.  Their cybersecurity knowledge is enhanced by classes in digital forensics, networking, industrial controls systems - SCADA, secure software development, security policy development and compliance, systems security administration and cyber ethics.  We do not concentrate our studentÃ†s efforts in one domain.  We recognize that our students have multiple and varied talents.  We therefore provide them with a strong foundation in principles and allow the student to expand their expertise is specific cybersecurity areas. This is further enhanced with their development of a graduate thesis as a requirement of graduation.   Additionally, they participate in a number of cyber-based activities.  They are active in October Cyber Awareness Month which includes K &ndash; 12 on-site classroom outreach, an information booth at on-campus student traffic areas, creation of public service announcements (PSA) used in national distribution and placing informational posters at multiple sites on the ISU campus.   The ISU SFS students provide all aspects for hosting the NIATEC cyber range competition in Pocatello, Idaho.  November 2015 was our third competition conducted at ISU.  College and high school teams from the intermountain region compete for scholarships at the school of their choice.  Our SFS students implement the network infrastructure for the virtual machines used in the competition, prepare the injects (business scenarios) to test the student cyber knowledge of networks and computing,  create a scoring engine to monitor the availability of the network resources, invite college and high school teams to participate, manage the event from start to completion, arrange for meals and snacks before and during the completion, solicit funding to fund the multiple activities, arrange for a job fair for participants and design the t-shirts for the competitors.  Further, we were a substantial resource to the Pacific Range Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (PR CCDC).   Upon graduation our students are accepting their role in information assurance/cybersecurity positions in the government.  Their retention rate after completing their two years of governmental service is very high.  They are in high demand amongst the federal agencies; most receive very good job offers after their internship.  Several have entered academia after completing their governmental service to teach cybersecurity to others.   Our students are dedicated to improving cybersecurity in the United States and appreciate the opportunity to serve in the federal government.  They continue to participate in outreach to teach others and improve awareness of the needs for strong cybersecurity in the United States.  They are actively working to provide a safer network-centric world as well as protect our personal and national assets from foreign and domestic threats.  Our SFS students view this as more than a job; it is their mission.       Last Modified: 12/17/2015       Submitted by: James C Frost]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
