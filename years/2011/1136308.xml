<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for funding for a daylong education workshop, Vision, Change and the Case Studies Approach, prior to the joint annual meeting of the Animal Behavior Society and the International Ethological Conference (July 25-30, 2011, University of Indiana, Bloomington, Indiana). The workshop has two parts: Part one addresses the general issues of change in science education and how they apply to the teaching of animal behavior.  Jay Labov, Senior Advisor for Education and Communications at the National Academies of Science (NAS), will be the main speaker. His presentation will set up break-out sessions in which participants will deal with specific issues confronting the teaching of biology in general and animal behavior in particular. Part two focuses on one effective approach to improving science education, the case study method. Kipp Herreid, one of the founders of this method and director of the National Center (SUNY-Buffalo), will lead a workshop during which participants will learn the essentials of case study teaching and begin developing their own cases.  The workshop responds to a growing interest in the animal behavior community for dialogue about teaching and learning and a call for recommendations for best practices and a collection of useful teaching materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On July 25, 2011, Drs. Penny L. Bernstein and Cindy Wei hosted a pre-conference education workshop for the Animal Behavior Society (ABS), "Vision, Change, and the Case Study Approach."  Organized by Drs. Bernstein and Wei and funded in part by the National Science Foundation, the workshop provided a venue for the animal behavior education community to discuss important issues and new approaches in science education in general and animal behavior in particular, and to learn more about a specific teaching technique, the Case Study Method. A mix of educators from several countries participated, including graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, faculty, pre-college teachers, and some administrators.  Over 90 participants heard Dr. Jay Labov, Senior Advisor for Education and Communications at the National Academies of Science (NAS) and the National Research Council (NRC), open the event with a presentation about new directions in science education in the U.S., including the Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology initiative.  Recommendations in these reports stress active-learning and involvement of students in real issues, based on data that show increased learning and ability to apply knowledge as a result of these techniques. Using the Vision and Change information as context, participants in break-out sessions and follow-up discussions examined critical issues in animal behavior education and developed specific recommendations for improving the teaching of animal behavior.  The following areas emerged as priorities:  the need for 1) online education resources, including forums for exchange of curriculum materials and teaching modules 2) continuing education-focused workshops at ABS, and 3) a more visible commitment to science education by ABS, including more outreach into the non-academic community.  The second part of the workshop focused on one effective approach to teaching science, the Case Study Method, which stresses critical thinking and real-world situations, issues, and data.  Dr. Kipp Herreid, founder of this method and Director of the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science, walked the participants through a case study in animal behavior, illustrating how it would be done in a class. Participants were very enthusiastic, and evaluations showed that 80% had increased interest in using case studies in their classroom.  Participants were also given tips on writing their own case studies, and several participants noted in their evaluations that they will be working to write new animal behavior- focused case study exercises that could be included in the National Center website collection for general access by all educators.  Overall, evaluations showed that participants found the workshop engaging and useful, and almost all respondents (97%) felt motivated afterward to do something to improve animal behavior education.  Efforts are now underway to develop an online teaching forum for educators at all levels and to plan future workshops as recommended by workshop participants.
