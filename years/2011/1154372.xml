<AbstractNarration>The goal of this S-STEM project by Columbia University Engineering is to prepare a cohort of engineers to meet the current environmental and societal challenges by preparing the students in the areas of water, energy and infrastructure. The project is building on education reform at the undergraduate and doctoral levels and targets reform at the Masters level. By using a research-based Masters degree, scholars will be supported to bridge the period from undergraduate studies into the doctoral program. The program is emphasizing the recruitment of underrepresented populations and will award 10 scholarships every year. The scholarship recipients will also receive a full tuition waiver from Columbia Engineering and a stipend from their faculty research advisor. Support structures for the students include mentoring, cohort building and leadership development. The work is focusing on the recruitment and retention of a diverse group of graduate students and facilitates their integration into research centers to promote connections between students, teaching experiences, leadership and other research-based training.</AbstractNarration>

Mentoring, cohort building and leadership development were all important aspects of the Program, as was an emphasis on increasing the representation of women and scholars of color in U.S. STEM graduate programs.  Outcomes/ Intellectual Merit: Fifty graduate students were supported by the program and, to date forty-eight of these students have received M.S degrees from Columbia Engineering. All of the scholars supported by the Program were instrumental in contributing to, and advancing, knowledge on a range of topics aligned with the theme of Sustainable Engineering including, waste management, infrastructure, energy, and water. Graduates from the S-STEM Program have gone onto secure positions in U.S. based research institutions, industry and PhD programs, adding to the STEM talent pool within the U.S.  Over the course of the program, the S-STEM scholars also successfully mentored five cohorts of High School Students in a three-week summer program on Columbia University?s campus that explored new models for urban sustainability. Each cohort comprised of about 30 High School Students, so in total about 150 High School Students received mentorship from the S-STEM Scholars.  Many of the High School Students themselves were interested in pursuing STEM careers, and the interaction with the scholars was positive in encouraging continued interest.  Products The primary product of the S-STEM is a well-educated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce that can be a significant contributor to maintaining the competitiveness of the U.S. in the global economy. This Program graduated forty-eight M.S students with training in engineering and research that are contributing to the competitiveness of the U.S. All of the scholars supported by this S-STEM program came from groups currently under-represented in U.S. STEM graduate programs.
