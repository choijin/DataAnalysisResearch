<AbstractNarration>The proposed project includes a very large variety of activities designed to recruit and retain women STEM faculty at Oakland University (OU) with a four-pronged approach.  The first prong involves a thorough campus analysis and planning based on the analysis.  The second prong will focus on recruitment and hiring practices at OU with training for all search and department chairs, implicit bias training for Deans, increased transparency of applicant pools, the dissemination of family-friendly information, and the development of a dual career hiring policy.  The third prong of the project involves faculty retention and professional development initiatives including new faculty orientation, a mentoring program, and professional development workshops.  The fourth and final prong of the proposal includes initiatives surrounding dissemination, especially to the region?s 4-year and 2-year institutions.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed initiatives are based on highly successful ADVANCE programs and tailored to the environment at OU.  The first-year information gathering will provide a strong foundation for the activities that will follow.  The scope of the activities is sweeping and the PI team is well qualified and well positioned to carry out the plans.  In addition they have enthusiastic letters of support from stakeholders across the campus including the Provost, Deans, Chairs, potential mentors, advisory board members, and the Union.  The proposal is well written and organized.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sweeping scope of the proposed initiatives suggests a path to institutional transformation at a smaller, highly-motivated, primarily undergraduate institution.  The proposed dissemination to the regional 2 and 4 year institutions is also an innovative way to have broader impacts.  Although not a major focus of the project, the application and tailoring of programming to women of color adds some broader impact.</AbstractNarration>

New Faculty Mentoring and Career Development:  Many STEM faculty indicated the need for mentoring.  WISE@OU found no formal mentoring programs active in any of the STEM departments. Over the past 4 years, we developed a multi-faceted, effective, and sustainable mentoring program for junior STEM faculty.

WISE@OU received enthusiastic, positive feedback from the faculty participants in our programs and successfully created a comfortable cross-disciplinary network in which these critical faculty can thrive.  Were these efforts successful in improving the experience of new STEM faculty at OU?  We surveyed the STEM faculty to assess their satisfaction with the activities of WISE@OU.  Findings are summarized in table below and indicate overall high satisfaction with the program.

Mid-Career Faculty:  In 2014, WISE@OU offered programs for mid-career faculty. We brought in a guest speaker from Michigan State University to speak with Associate Professors. All mid-career faculty on campus were invited to this event, broadening the focus beyond STEM. WISE@OU hosted follow-up workshops on goal setting and best practices for becoming a full professor. WISE@OU also published "Multiple Paths to Full Professor: Challenges to the Academy in the 21st Century" in the Oakland Journal.  This campus-wide mid-career initiative was very well received, filling a critical gap in professional development.  Plans are underway to provide such programming on a regular basis.  Department Chairs:  Over the years of our WISE@OU program, it has become clear to us that the success of a STEM faculty member is tied tightly to having an engaged, supportive department chair.  With the Provost?s Office and CETL, WISE@OU co-hosted the first annual Chairs? Retreat in August 2015. The retreat led to the creation of the Chairs? and Program Directors? Resource Guide, developed by the WISE@OU Program Assistant and published online in 2016. WISE@OU is leading chair workshops on mentoring and anti-bias approaches to recruitment and hiring in this winter. Our efforts have opened discussions about departmental issues and helped provide chairs with useful information to guide their interactions with faculty.   Sustaining WISE@OU:  The full-time staff position associated with the grant has become a permanent administrative/professional position under the auspices of the Office of Research Administration.  Likewise, the grant?s website (www.oakland.edu/advance) will be updated and maintained as a university-wide resource.
