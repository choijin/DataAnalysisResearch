<AbstractNarration>This study examines the distinctive organizational mechanisms intended to control disorder in contemporary urban China. The research focuses on the interplay between the operations of the traditional, grass-roots social control organizations in urban China -- the "neighborhood committees" and neighborhood police stations -- and the newly developed market-based services for public safety and security. The analytic model guiding the research integrates key concepts from the Western literature on neighborhood social control with concepts tailored to the unique Chinese context. The researchers will collect original quantitative and qualitative data for a sample of neighborhoods in Tianjin, a city of more than 12 million people situated about 60 miles southeast of Beijing. A survey based on a sample of 2,500 households distributed across 50 neighborhoods will provide the primary quantitative data. The qualitative data will be gathered through focus groups with members of neighborhood committees and face-to-face interviews with the local police officers assigned to the sampled neighborhoods. With these data, the researchers will address the following overarching questions. To what extent do the traditional grass-roots organizations continue to play a key role in securing order and public safety in a changing China? How has the increased availability of market-based services for public safety and personal security altered the operations of these traditional organizations? In what ways do traditional, grass-roots and market-based mechanisms of neighborhood social control vary along with socio-demographic characteristics of neighborhoods? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the research will shed light on important social developments pertaining to disorder in contemporary urban China and will enhance, more generally, knowledge about how different forms of neighborhood social organization and associated social control processes evolve and are adapted to fundamental changes in the larger social landscape.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The sponsored research entailed the development and implementation of a survey of residents, focus groups with members of neighborhood committees, and face-to-face interviews with local police officers in the city of Tianjin, China. The research questions have been informed by leading theoretical perspectives in Western criminology, in particular the neo-social disorganization theory and related research with accommodations to the Chinese reality.      The survey involved approximately 2,500 respondents who were age 18 and over in 50 neighborhoods in the city. The research team conducted systematic sampling to selected about 53 to 56 households from each of the selected neighborhoods using householdsÃ† addresses.  The team defined a criterion date to select a specific respondent from a selected household with more than one person 18 years old or older. The individual with a birthday closest to the criterion date was chosen to be the respondent. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in the selected households. A total of 2,497 valid questionnaires were obtained with a response rate 99%.  The high response rate is comparable to that of our previous survey on criminal victimization in that city.   Following administration of the survey, the data were cleaned and prepared for statistical analysis, and manuscripts were drafted. The results of the research have been disseminated widely. To date, the co-authors have presented papers at professional conferences in Japan, the United States, and China. Three manuscripts have been prepared for publication in scholarly journals. The major findings are reported in the following section.  As a qualitative component of the project, focus groups were conducted with members of the neighborhood committees in the 50 selected neighborhoods and face-to-face interviews were performed with local police officers in 30 of the selected neighborhoods. Notes and related audiotaped information have been transcribed and a portion of the information from the transcripts was analyzed and used for a presentation at the annual meeting of American Society of Criminology, 2014.         MAJOR FINDINGS  The project aims to analyze different forms of neighborhood social control (i.e., informal control-collective efficacy, semi-public control, public control, and market-based control) and their relationships with different types of neighborhood disorder (i.e., criminal activity, social disorder, physical disorder, and total disorder) in the city of Tianjin. The analyses involve efforts to assess the applicability of Western theories to the Chinese context, supplemented by new variables reflecting the Chinese reality. The results indicate that the variable of collective efficacy as a form of informal control, which has been widely used in Western studies, shows significant effects on different forms of perceived neighborhood disorder when controlling for other forms of neighborhood social control along with several important neighborhood structural variables.  However, its effect on neighborhood criminal activity reaches statistical significance only when assessed with a one-tailed test. This is somewhat curious given that collective efficacy has played such a prominent role in explanations of neighborhood crime in Western studies. In these studies, collective efficacy is commonly significant with more conservative two-tailed tests. The variable of public control as represented by activities of neighborhood police stations exhibits significant effects on all forms of perceived neighborhood disorder. These findings are consistent with the Western literature. Public control as represented by local police activity appears to be an important form of neighborhood social control across different social and cultural settings.  However, the operation, process, and mechanism of public control may differ appreciably in different social and cultural contexts. The variable of market-based control that represents recently emergi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
