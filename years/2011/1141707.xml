<AbstractNarration>This project is to support the travel and accommodation support for 13 Alaska Native participants (two of which are FAI board members) and two facilitators to attend a Think Tank workshop titled "Strengthening the Sustainability of Alaska Native Communities in a Post Oil Economy." This workshop is anticipated as phase one of a larger three phase project, facilitated by the First Alaskans Institute, an Alaska Native serving institution, to bring community members, Alaska Native Scholars, and the scientific community together to strategize on a plan for researching and synthesizing existing data to get a complete picture of the economic and social impacts of declining oil revenues and the changes a post oil economy will have on the Alaska Natives and rural communities. The final phase envisioned but not funded by this proposal request would be the creation of complex economic and social models for the future long-term sustainability of Alaska Native and rural communities in Alaska.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The First Alaskans Institute (FAI) project "Strengthening the Sustainability of Alaska Native Communities in a Post-Oil Economy" funded by the National Science Foundation, remains open and will be completed December 31, 2012.  This is the Think Tank phase (Phase I) of a three phase project aimed at helping Alaskansunderstand the implications of a post-oil economy in the state and its impact on Alaska Native villages and people.  To date, one of two sessions for the think tank has been hosted.  Fourteen emerging and renowned leaders, economists, students, FAI Board of Trustee members and staff participated  An interactive dialogue process was used to engage each participant as a resource to the discussion and a graphic harvester visually captured group sessions to create an immediate map of topics that is being used to formulate the second session and inform the final report.  Dialogue topics included what a post-oil economy in Alaska would and could look like, including the affects, impact, and assessment of declining oil revenue, current community understanding and knowledge building needs, and most importantly, the need for Native community and leadership to be involved now in discussing the larger consequences and opportunities of the sustainability question.   The questions posed and discussed during the first think tank session were:  In a æpost-oil economyÆ, what impacts can we anticipate on Alaska Native communities?   What knowledge do Alaska Natives have to help Alaska prepare for a new phase of its societal development? What information do policy makers need to help prepare Alaska for this new phase? What are the negatives and positives of what may arise for Alaska due to decreased oil production? In moving from this think tank into the next stage of the project, what should we make sure not to forget to address?   The think tank sessions serve as the starting point and provide a foundation to build Phase II of the project,"Strengthening the Sustainability of Alaska Native Communities in a Post-OilEconomy Summit."   When asked about moving to the next phase - the Summit - the sentimentshared was: "We need to harness these emotions to try to create atransformative structure where anything and everything thatÆs valuable is atthe table with Native Leadership involved. Questions raised here need to beasked at the various levels: the local, tribal, regional etc. How are we goingto partner together?"  Upon completion of the 2nd session of the think tank dialogue in Phase I, the full findings and outcomes from both dialogues will be submitted in the final report, along with a plan for phase II, which includes the summit and the economic footprint of the Alaska Native community study.
