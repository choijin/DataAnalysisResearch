<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. This is a proposal to develop open-source software tools for the creation and maintenance of ?internally consistent thermodynamic data/model collections? (ICTD/MCs). ICTD/MCs are intended to support assessment of phase relations in geochemical and petrologic systems and form the basis of several widely used thermodynamic modeling packages including MELTS, THERMO-CALC and Perple_X. The continued improvement of those thermochemical modeling packages depends principally on the ability to update and expand the underlying ICTD/MCs. Presently, that process is time-consuming and requires considerable expertise and technical ability in computer programming and numerical methods. The proposal objectives are (1) to make the process of calibrating these ICTD/MCs less cumbersome, (2) to incorporate, in a more intuitive way, modeling constraints that arise in application of ICTD/MCs to real world problems and to enable imposition of these constraints as inputs for calibration, and (3) to provide tools that will motivate a larger community of researchers to participate in the process of generating ICTD/MCs, thereby improving both quality and applicability, and raising the level of understanding of phase equilibrium modeling amongst geochemists and petrologists. The specific goals of this proposal are to produce open-source, open-platform software tools to (1) calculate and display phase equilibrium relations on pseudosections and on temperature-, pressure-, and thermodynamic state function-composition diagrams, subject to a variety of constraints (e.g., adiabatic, isochoric, isenthalpic) in both open and closed chemical systems, (2) assemble and maintain calibration data, such as that pertaining to experimental phase equilibrium reversal brackets, calorimetric data on thermodynamic properties (e.g., heat content, dynamic heat capacity, heat of solution) and physical property measurements that are applicable to calibration of equations of state or cation-ordering energetics in minerals, and (3) calibrate ICTD/MCs utilizing numerical/statistical methods consistent with linear programming, regression or Bayesian inference and provide tactile user feedback mechanisms that permit forward predictions to be adjusted in a self-consistent manner and thereby function as imposed constraints in the generation of alternate calibrations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. A significant amount of research and instruction in geochemistry and petrology relies upon thermodynamic modeling applications like geothermometry, geobarometry and phase diagram/phase equilibria calculators. These modeling tools are in turn based upon internally consistent thermodynamic data/model collections. Yet, the calibration of these ICTD/MCs remains a daunting exercise undertaken by just a few academic research groups and for-profit corporations, largely because of the intellectual and technical inertia associated with participation in the calibration activity. The result of this situation is that users of thermodynamic modeling tools are disconnected from efforts to expand and improve these tools; most users unfortunately treat these tools as mysterious ?black boxes.? The research proposed here aims to make the process of ICTD/MC calibration more accessible and intuitive, thereby empowering a broader community of users to improve the underlying thermodynamic framework. The proposed software infrastructure will motivate users to focus on the quality of data sources and the realism of predicted results rather than on the mechanics of the process of data bookkeeping, the implementation of calibration numerics, and the analysis of residuals. The proposed research will help users of thermodynamic modeling software better understand how those models are generated, how they can be improved, and what data or model enhancements are required to bring about that improvement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded the development of software that is used to automate the specification and calibration of thermodynamic models of natural substances found in the Earth and related terrestrial planets.  Such models play a vital role in understanding which mineral phases form under particular pressure-temperature conditions, and as such, support predictions of the appearance, abundance and composition of mineral phases (i.e., rock types) in nature.  These models also tell us under what conditions rocks melt to form magmas, and how chemical elements are partitioned between solid, gas and liquid in that melting process.  This information allows us to make quantitative predictions related to chemical differentiation - the process by which chemical diversity is generated within the Earth, ultimately leading to chemically distinct reservoirs, like the oceans, atmospheres and the diverse rock types found at the surface.  Up until this research was undertaken, the process of thermodynamic model generation was an activity only undertaken by researchers with highly specialized knowledge and skills. Importantly, even with this specialized background, the process of model creation was extremely labor intensive.  Consequently, although the resulting models are utilized by an ever broadening group of researchers and students on a daily basis, the construction and updating of these models falls to a small handful of scientists.  Additionally, there existed no mechanism for the ideas and experience of model users to participate in model development.  The research funded by this award aims to democratize and render more accessible the process of the generation of thermodynamic models of Earth materials.   The project generated a prototype modeling development environment called ThermoFit that brings to a central user interface (1) access to underlying data resources required for model calibration, (2) an intuitive mechanism for model specification, (3) a means of calibrating model parameters using modern statistical methods that account for the correlated nature of data calibrants, and (4) an intuitive model visualization framework that casts modeling results in terms of outcomes that are comparable to real world observations. The latter is especially important for assessing model quality and for translating the esoteric aspects of model calibration into results more relevant to the user experience.   One aspect of the model development environment funded by this effort that is unique is the ability to rapidly visualize highly compute intensive results derived from the calibrated models and manipulate those results directly in order to provide additional input to model calibration.  The need for this interaction often occurs in situations where the calibration database for the model is incomplete or contradictory or where the outcome involves constraints for which direct experimentation is not practical.  Novel methods of phase diagram computation involving image processing techniques were developed to facilitate this feature.  The developed modeling prototype was used to successfully calibrate a thermodynamic model for the saturation of mixed water-carbon dioxide bearing fluids in magmas.  This model is currently being applied to the eruptive potential of magma bodies and to assess the transport of carbon by magmas in the Earth.  This grant resulted in the publication of four papers published in peer reviewed scientific journals and seven abstracts presented at international scientific meetings.  In addition, numerous invited lectures on various aspects of grant-related research were given at universities and research institutes in the U.S. and Europe.  The principal deliverables generated by this funding are distributed from the Mac App Store (PhasePlot, MagmaSat, ThermoFit, the latter to be released in early summer 2016) and from the websites at melts.ofm-research.org, ctserver.ofm-research.org, phaseplot.org, and thermodfit.ofm-research....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
