<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to investigate how conceptual misunderstandings of students in different engineering disciplines have common features.  By understanding patterns of misunderstandings, the project will attempt to develop a theory of engineering misconceptions that is trans-disciplinary.  The PIs represent three different universities and multiple engineering disciplines.  The large amount of data collected and archived by this project can serve to provide new insights on misconceptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project, if successful, will be to inform new ways of teaching engineering that better address students' conceptual understanding.  Such knowledge is vital for practicing engineers, lays a foundation for lifelong learning, and provides a necessary framework for developing disciplinary expertise.  Additionally a sound grasp of concepts may be important for developing innovative engineers, able to see deep connections between engineering fields.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary objective of this collaborative multi-institutional project was to understand patterns of misconceptions in multiple engineering disciplines and how similarities across disciplines might help us understand conceptual learning more broadly. This larger understanding of engineering learning can inform instructional changes that transcend engineering disciplines. Misconceptions are student errors in conceptual understanding that can interfere with developing overall correct understandings of engineering concepts.  To accomplish this objective, we had four goals: 1) conduct analysis of student data from interviews about conceptual understanding to determine the structure of knowledge across disciplines, 2) evaluate the applicability and validity of existing conceptual change theories to existing data sets, 3) investigate motivational factors that influence conceptual change, 4) create deliverables that inform both educators and researchers.  To meet these goals we:  established      a substantial and unique database of interview data based on about 295      student interviews, covering three major content areas, developed      and reported on a new analysis method, paired expert-novice analysis      protocol that allows a content expert to work with a non-content expert to      provide better insights to student misconceptions,  conducted      in depth analysis of the interviews to yield critical findings regarding      conceptual knowledge building and motivational factors, developed      a set of proto-theories that focus on different aspects of studentsÆ      difficulties and evaluated      these theories with the goal of developing a synthesis of proto-theories      to create a more holistic explanation of student learning across      disciplines.    Our study yielded important findings with regard to how students engage with conceptual learning and develop conceptual understanding across engineering disciplines:  Engineering      concepts do not exist independently of the learning setting, the social      rules, and studentÆs beliefs about learning and knowledge.  These      concepts have individualized meanings for students that are influenced by      who they are and the context in which they learned the concepts.  Students      primarily reference prior problems or experiences in class rather than      overarching conceptual ideas to navigate interviews with researchers to      investigate student understanding.  Students      struggle to discern what domain they are in when solving problems and      frequently use information that is irrelevant (at least according to      experts) to the problem situation.  Students      prematurely accept answers that do not satisfy all of their own      constraints or with simple appeals to authority. The process seems to      change as students move through undergrad to graduate classes, and as they      move into engineering careers.  Practicing engineersÆ responses to      similar questions are significantly different in this aspect; they were      largely unwilling to discuss answers that they were not able to vet      beforehand.  Students      struggle to make appropriate distinctions between the technical use of      terms and the colloquial use of these same terms. The development of      conceptual knowledge is dependent on the development of useful      distinctions between words that are associated with these concepts (i.e.      stress, if-then) and the different uses of the same word in other      contexts. Students      often inappropriately group dissimilar phenomena, processes or features.      Essentially, students are combining things that need to be defined      separately in order to fully understand the course content. Students      reason using simplified causal relationships. Across our datasets, we      found that students seek to find the causes of phenomena under study, and      seem to prefer simplistic, one-to-one causal relationships.
