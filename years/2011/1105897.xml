<AbstractNarration>Photorespiration can account for yield losses of 25-50% in C3 plants, which include rice, wheat and soybean, three of the top four crops in terms of global grain production.  Photorespiration occurs because oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) compete for the same acceptor molecule in photosynthesis.  The process can be very simply inhibited by increasing the concentration of CO2.  When CO2 is increased artificially  in greenhouses or in open fields, very significant yield increases are obtained.  However, artificially elevating CO2 over millions of acres of fields is not feasible.  Some cyanobacteria solve this problem by confining the fixation of carbon to a structure termed a carboxysome, where localization of specific enzymes cause a concentration of CO2.  Although chloroplasts, which contain the photosynthetic machinery of crops, lack carboxysomes, they evolved from cyanobacteria, which were symbiotically recruited into the ancestors of todays plants and crops.  This research project will provide the foundation for a synthetic biology approach in which carboxysomes will be engineered into the chloroplasts of crop plants to enhance photosynthesis.  Optimization will involve manipulating a model plant that is readily transformable and the development of an in silico model of the system to evaluate the use of different proteins and the minimal system that is needed.   A multidisciplinary approach will be implemented through collaboration of four research groups, each contributing complementary expertise: carboxysome genetics and assembly (Berkeley), chloroplast and nuclear transformation (Cornell), photosynthetic systems modelling (Illinois) and physiological and biochemical characterization of the whole plant (Rothamsted, Cornell and Illinois).   The project will allow postdoctoral and undergraduate trainees to gain experience in an international collaborative project (All). Research resources for comparing plant and bacterial genes will be developed for use in undergraduate education (Berkeley).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Installing a carboxysome, essentially a factory that converts CO2 into sugars, into the chloroplast of crop plants requires a complete understanding of  its architecture and how the different building blocks are assembled.   Through this project, we have gained better understanding of carboxysome assembly, its enzymatic core organization and the interactions between the carboxysome shell and the core proteins.  It is now clear that carboxysome assembly starts from the inside out-- the aggregation of the needed proteins for the conversion of CO2.  These building blocks are held together via protein-protein interactions that we now understand.  . Essential protein domains that are vital for enzymatic core formation  or core-shell interactions--the shell is comparable to external walls of the factory  have been identified; as well as the key component proteins that are required for shell formation.  In the next advance, the knowledge of protein domain interactions in the core allowed us to design a chimeric protein that assembles functional streamlined carboxysomes, to overcome the issue of transfer and regulation of multiple genes that are needed to make the building block proteins.  This will enable installing carboxysomes in organisms that don't naturally contain them.  We also successfully developed a synthetic shell system, containing all of the key component proteins for shell formation, which provides a platform for fundamental studies of shell permeability (how things get in and out of the "factory" is essential for tuning its function in terms of supply and demand).  Furthermore, we demonstrated two different types of interaction between domains of carboxysomal core proteins and the synthetic shells. These observations not only provide strategies for encapsulation into the shell but also provide finer details on the internal organization of the carboxysome. In addition, we did not limit to the study of existing proteins; we resurrected ancient protein sequences through bioinformatics to help us understand how the carboxysome evolved.    Collectively, our findings provide a blueprint for a minimal carboxysome that is suitable for being introduced into plant chloroplasts which was the goal of the project.  More broadly, our findings provide a  strategy to design and build other kinds of cellular factories in cells.   The outcomes from this research have placed us closer to developing new carboxysome-like factories that can help address pressing issues faced by society: Climate change, food security and the need for renewable alternatives to petroleum-based products.
