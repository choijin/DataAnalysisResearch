<AbstractNarration>Characterizing life's astounding diversity is fundamental to creating the stable, predictive classifications applied daily in agriculture, conservation, and medicine. Despite new genomic tools, however, species boundaries remain contentious since both the processes and traits that define species are spatially and temporally dynamic. This project uses multiple evidentiary approaches and novel protocols to test discovery-driven hypotheses of species delimitation in closely related Camassia and Hastingsia (rush lilies). Their morphological complexity, hybrids, and variable populations pose difficult classification challenges, making them ideal exemplars for defining the "best practices" of integrative taxonomy. Analysis of ecological and genetic differences, reproductive barriers, and the response of "generalist pollinators" to floral traits will add further insights into how diversity arises in a family where highly specialized pollination also occurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ecological and cultural value of camas to indigenous peoples enhances the project's broad focus, which engages K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students in investigations encompassing the full scope of systematics. Volunteer partnerships will foster diverse, structured experiences in threatened habitats. Access to internet keys will further improve rare and common plant identification. Finally, ecological niche modeling and records of insect visits and flowering times may facilitate tracking the effects of climate change on plant-pollinator interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The astounding diversity of plants and animals in our world today represent millions of years of evolutionary change in response to local and global environments.  Throughout human history, the biodiversity of our natural world has continued to amaze and benefit our species &ndash; leading to discoveries such as foods like corn and maize, medicines gleaned from plants like the cancer drug Taxol, and pharmaceuticals now produced through genetic engineering in tobacco.  Unfortunately, biodiversity is also dramatically being threatened as global extinction rates rise, human populations expand, and natural habitats are increasingly becoming converted to agricultural and urban areas.  Thus, we have arrived at a critical time where we as humans must quantify and identify the biodiversity around us, before it suffers further loss.   Following the steps of Linnaeus, scientists have historically identified plant and animal species using specific morphological traits, such as shapes, colors, and sizes of objects including flowers, feathers, or even skeletal remains or fossils.  While this has led to a plethora of identified species, there still remain large groups of closely related taxa for which it is difficult to tease apart and identify individual species.  For example, some plants appear to be morphologically distinct but they are still capable of reproducing with one other &ndash; should these be considered separate species or not?  Fortunately, recent technological advancements now offer a potential solution to more accurately identify (or delimit) such challenging groups.  For example, the development of genetic sequencing now allows scientists to compare the underlying genetics of group of organisms that are morphologically similar.  Ecological niche modeling based on environmental traits like precipitation help scientists better understand whether geographically separated groups should be considered different species.    While all these relatively new types of data have been quite informative in our understanding of what constitutes a species, they have typically been used in isolation of one another.  In other words, scientists have yet to develop a comprehensive approach that uses all types of data together.  The main goal of our collaborative proposal was to explore the process of using multiple types of data in an integrative taxonomical approach to define species within a taxonomically challenging group.  We chose to focus on the plant genera Camassia (camas or wild hyacinth) and Hastingsia (rush lilies), which are comprised of 16-18 species and subspecies located across North America (including a few putative new species).  As a collaborative research group, we focused on five different types of data collected from the same populations: (1) Morphological traits, (2) Reproductive compatibility, (3) Phylogenetic relationships, (4) Ecological niche modeling, and (5) Genetic similarity.  The last type of data was added shortly after the project commenced once we successfully developed microsatellite markers for the genera.  While all members of the collaboration participated in data collection together in the field, the first two datasets were spearheaded by PI Kephart (Willamette University), the third dataset was led by Co-PI Archibald (University of Kansas), and the last two datasets were completed by our laboratory at the University of Cincinnati.    Using a variety of approaches, we have been able to show that certain groups of Camassia can be separated into different species on the basis of their morphology and this is largely consistent with their genetic composition and ecological niche requirements.  For example, eastern species of Camassia (C. angusta, C. scilloides, and a putative glade taxon) possess some trait differences in addition to similarities that overlapped.  This was true regardless of whether floral traits, microsatellite markers, or ecological niches were examined.  We also successfully used the microsatellite markers to help identify range expansion of C. howellii from southern Oregon into northern California and to identify Camassia species within the Snake River watershed in Oregon and Idaho. Finally, an unintended consequence of the project was that because we had developed molecular markers within a number of related taxa, we were able to dig deeply into the issue of "missing data" &ndash; genetic loci that amplified in one group of populations while not amplifying in a different group of populations.  In short, we are now developing a method to use these "missing data" as another means of species identification.  The broader impacts of this research have also been instrumental in helping scientists and non-scientists alike. Once complete, we will share our genetic dataset of over 1,500 individual plants from populations across the United States with other researchers on a public platform (such as Dryad).  Co-PI Culley has also worked with pre-K and grades 4-7 girls on age-appropriate lessons involving plant systematics and identification. This research has also resulted in scientific training for a postdoctoral researcher (female), three graduate students (1 female, 1 underrepresented) and 4 undergraduate students (3 female).
