<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award.  It supports research, software development, and education in materials modeling, with an emphasis on the study of energy storage materials.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the goals of this work is to use state-of-the-art first principles simulation methods to study several solid electrolyte materials. While the use of solid electrolytes in commercial applications is currently limited, they will undoubtedly be adopted for some energy storage applications in the near future, due their desirable properties such as stability, durability, and safety advantages.  The simulations in this study will be performed on materials composed of Li-P-O-N, Li-P-S, and their alloys in order to develop a complete picture of what local structures and stoichiometries can optimize ionic conductivity while still maintaining structural and chemical stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second goal of this work is to improve the physical representation of electron interactions within various simulation techniques, which is especially important for materials containing localized orbitals, such as those typically found in cathode materials. This effort will be aimed at developing accurate and efficient implementations of orbital-dependent functional treatments of the exchange-correlation interactions in electronic structure codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training of students for carrying out scientific research in general and for performing computational materials research in particular is an important part of the educational component of this project.  Parts of the project are accessible to graduate as well as undergraduate students at a broad range of levels.  This aspect will help in attracting new students to the field of computational materials science, in particular, minority students from the nearby Winston-Salem State University.  Furthermore, the project is associated with several local and international collaborations that will extend its impact. This includes collaborations with several experimental groups at Wake Forest University and abroad, as well as with several other computational groups to extend simulation capabilities and to facilitate code development and dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award.  It supports research, software development, and education in materials modeling, with an emphasis on the study of energy storage materials.   The development of energy storage technologies is one of the critical elements of a sustainable energy economy.  In particular, advances in battery capacity, safety, and stability are needed to meet the projected energy storage needs.  Basic research on materials which comprise energy storage devices, including a concerted effort in computer modeling, is key to achieving this goal.  One of the goals of this work is to use state-of-the-art parameter-free simulation methods that are based on fundamental quantum mechanical principles to study several solid electrolyte materials.   The simulations in this study will be performed on materials composed of lithium, phosphorous, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur to develop a complete picture of what types of arrangements and compositions can optimize conductivity while still maintaining structural and chemical stability.   The second goal of this work is geared toward software development and computational tool building, via improving the physical representation of electron interactions within various simulation techniques for energy storage materials.  This effort will be aimed at developing accurate and efficient implementations of electron interactions in various electronic structure codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training of students for carrying out scientific research in general and for performing computational materials research in particular is an important part of the educational component of this project.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of stable and efficient batteries for a variety of  applications, ranging from micro devices to electric vehicles to energy  storage from renewable sources, is an important societal need which can  benefit from the results of basic research on materials. Improvements to  current battery technology requires innovations in the cathode  materials, the anode materials, and the electrolyte materials as well as  in the interfaces between the materials and in the integrated battery  itself. Recently, there has been considerable progress in developing  batteries constructed with all solid state components. These have  efficiency and stability advantages over batteries developed with liquid  or gel electrolytes.   This project used a variety of computational techniques to study several solid electrolyte systems and their interfaces with ideal electrodes. Computer simulations of solid electrolyte crystals and their interfaces with electrode materials were  used to identify compositions and structures of ideal stable and meta-stable materials and identify attributes which control their ionic  conductivities.   Some of the specific materials investigated during this project were as follows.  * Colleages in the Chemistry Department of Wake Forest University synthesized a new material $SD$-Li$_2$PO$_2$N based on predictions previously reported by our group.     The new material had a slightly different structure than that of the original prediction, but was closely related. While the material was found to exceptionally stable, its ionic conductivity was found to be smaller than technologically viable electrolytes. * In collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we re-examined the electrolyte Li$_4$P$_2$S$_6$ which has been found  in the preparation of other lithium thiophosphate materials.  With the close collaboration of simulations and experiments, we were able to determine the causes and effects of disorder in the material and to analyze the mechanisms of ionic conductivity. * A method for examining the atomistic properties of ideal interfaces between two solid materials such as an electrolyte and an anode was developed and used to study several systems.   For example pure lithium anodes were found to form  stable interfaces with lithium phosphate electrolytes.   By contrast, lithium anodes were found to decompose lithium thiophosphate electrolytes, likely forming a meta stable buffer layer in the course of the cycling of the battery.  The research team included a direct collaboration of the  principal investigator and several undergraduate and graduate students,  guided by a loose collaboration with several experimental efforts. In  this mentoring environment, undergraduate students received their first  exposure to scientific methods and graduate students received training for  developing basic skills and practices needed for their professional careers as scientists.    In the course of the project 5 graduate students and 5 undergraduate students were involved with the project.          Last Modified: 09/17/2015       Submitted by: N. A. W.
