<AbstractNarration>Age-related cognitive impairments, including Alzheimer's disease, are among the most common diseases in the United States. Prevention through delay is currently considered the best way to tackle Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). Early detection is crucial, as screening individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) may delay its progression and prevent it from developing. This research investigates the role of technologies for senior citizens with potential MCI at-risk factors and for medical practitioners, such as neurologists or neuropsychologists, to make data-driven clinical decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clock Drawing Test, in which the patient is asked to draw a clock showing a certain time, is one of the easiest and most frequently used instruments for dementia screening. Current practice requires medical practitioners to administer and assess each individual paper-and-pencil test. It requires tedious effort and is prone to errors and inconsistent scoring among different clinicians.  To address these difficulties, previous work by this research group has resulted in a computer-based version of the Clock Drawing Test that records a patient's freehand drawing on a tablet computer, then analyzes the drawing for evidence of cognitive imparment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project is extending the computer-based system to acquire additional data associated with the Clock Drawing Test.  This data includes timing of drawing and pausing phases, and pressure applied during drawing.  The data can be used in evaluating drawings under several different scoring critera that can be chosen by the clinician. Through analysis of data and focus group discussions, the clinical utility of the new features are being evaluated with a goal of further improvement.</AbstractNarration>
