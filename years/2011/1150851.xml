<AbstractNarration>Joseph Subotnik of the University of Pennsylvania is supported by an award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop new methods in quantum chemistry specifically to be used for modeling nonadiabatic dynamical processes.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, Professor Subotnik and his research group are pursuing three different goals:&lt;br/&gt; 1. New formulations for diabatic states to minimize inter-state coupling and provide an optimal basis for understanding nonadiabatic transitions;&lt;br/&gt;2. Novel algorithms to compute excited state energies and wave function response properties, specifically using local correlation techniques and other omputationally inexpensive techniques applicable to big systems;&lt;br/&gt; 3. New approaches to produce and analyze derivative couplings between adiabatic and diabatic states, with a heavy focus on their their dynamical properties (including electronic momentum).&lt;br/&gt;All of the techniques above in electronic structure theory are necessary tools for modeling photo-induced nonadiabatic dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have a broad impact in the field of photochemistry and energy science, especially with regards to electron and energy transfer.  Currently, modern research in solar energy focuses on capturing sun light to produce electricity, and we urgently need tools to predict new materials for maximizing the efficiency of solar cells.  This research proposal will provide many of those tools for future applications. Subotnik will also participate in the undergraduate MERCURY conference for computational chemistry, in order to connect with undergraduate researchers and teach them how to develop quantum chemistry packages, so they can also make contributions in this emerging field.</AbstractNarration>

Electronic structure is the area of chemistry which desccribes how electrons swim around nuclei and form the bonds or glue that holds molecules together. For the most part, electronic structure is a stable feature of a given molecule: electrons can form single, double, or triples bonds in most molecules. Interestingly, however, when molecules are subject to visible light, electrons become excited and their electronic structure changes.  Eventually however, after a much longer time, the electrons will again relax and give up their energy to heat (i.e. molecular motion).  Understanding the relaxation of electrons is absolutely criticial for modeling experimentally meaningful systems. For photovoltaics, we require that electrons should stay excited as long as possible, so that we can capture these electrons and effecctively form a battery. For photocatalysis, we also require long lived electrons, so that we can break bonds and form new molecules. Overall, for many processes, we want to use sunlight to produce excited electrons and then use those electrons for some purpose.  Thus, understanding how and why electrons relax is essentially for technological development. As a side note, understanding electronic relaxation is also essential for modeling many experiments in a laboratory where lasers are used as a standard tool to investigate the dynamics of materials and molecules (that can be of interest for a completely orthogonal reason).     With this background in mind, this research program analyized the electronic structure that describes electrons just before and after  the fundamental elaxation occurs. In particular, perhaps the most exciting development of this research proposal was a fundamentally new understanding of the nature of "derviative couplings", which are the mathematical construct that forces electronic relaxation. In particular, we showed how to construct these derivative couplings in a stable fashion, because standard schemes will usually lead to anomalous (and unphysical) behavior.  Several other subprojects were also conducted successfully, including a new interpretation of the dynamics of the Criegee intermediates (which war important in atmospheric chemistry).
