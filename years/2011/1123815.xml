<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports Professor R. A. Flowers from Lehigh University on an "International Collaboration in Chemistry" project. The foreign investigator is Professor A. Gansäuer from Germany, whose contribution to the collaborative project will be supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG). The researchers will develop metal catalysts for the functionalization of aromatic compounds via homolytic substitutions employing carbon centered radicals. The formation of C-C bonds is of fundamental importance and new developments will contribute to the sustainable synthesis of organic compounds, in particular aromatic compounds. The German PI provides expertise in the use of radical catalysis in organic synthesis, the US PI in mechanistic studies of organic reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Flowers and Gansäuer will pursue a detailed understanding of catalytic titanocene based radical reactions to provide efficient and selective approaches for arene functionalization. Arenes are at the center of many chemical commodity products such as styrene. One of the goals of this work is to furnish optically enriched aryl-2-propanols, which form the building blocks for the synthesis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). The international team will include undergraduate and graduate students who will receive multidisciplinary training in techniques not typically covered in standard organic chemistry laboratories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Professor Flowers from Lehigh University completed work on a project entitled: "Catalytic Atom-Economical Aromatic Substitution via Radicals" Funded through the International Collaboration in Chemistry program funded by the NSF.   The work on this project was carried out in collaboration with Professor  Andreas Gansauer at the University of Bonn.  Work in Professor Flowers  group focused on study of the mechanism of Ti(III)-catalyzed arylation   reactions.  A range of kinetic, spectroscopic,  computational, and  synthetic studies were carried out to achieve the major goals of the   project.  Carbon free radical-based conversions are an attractive target for the  development of efficient catalytic processes due to ease of radical generation,  high functional group tolerance and selectivity of bond-forming  reactions.  In spite of these appealing features, the potential of  radicals in catalytic process are highly underutilized.  In this work,  we exploited the innate ability of titanocene-based catalysts to undergo  both oxidative addition and reductive elimination in single electron  steps.  The combination of mechanistic and synthetic studies have  revealed the key steps of Ti(III)-catalyzed reactions and enabled the  development of efficient processes.  The work enabled the development of  catalytic processes using readily available starting materials.  This work may lead to the development of atom-efficient, environmentally  sound processes using earth abundant titanium catalysts.  In addition,  the work demonstrated that catalytic cycles employing free radical  intermediates are feasible.   Results from the project were published in high-profile journals and presented at several National and International conferences.  Results were also disseminated through invited seminars at over 20 Universities.   During the funding period, Professor Flowers hosted two graduate students in his lab from the University of Bonn, and also hosted a scientific visit by Professor Gansauer to provide lectures to his group and department on synthetic aspects of low-valent titanium chemistry.  Graduate and undergraduate students were trained on a wide range of techniques not typically used  in organic labs including stopped-flow rate measurements, ReactIR  kinetics, electrochemistry, and drybox and Schlenk techniques. Knowledge  transfer was promoted by having direct interaction between students at Bonn and Lehigh as  well.  The students involved in this project at Lehigh and Bonn  worked together to formulate, test and further refine hypotheses developed during the project.  Students also presented their work at several National conferences.          Last Modified: 12/08/2015       Submitted by: Robert A Flowers]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
