<AbstractNarration>Laurie Butler of the University of Chicago is supported by an award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program to study the dynamics of radical intermediates relevant to the chemistry of the troposphere. Butler and her research group investigate the branching between product channels of unstable radical intermediates as a function of internal energy under collisionless conditions. Three classes of chemical systems are studied: 1) reactions of chlorine atoms with unsaturated organic compounds, 2) reactions of chlorine atoms with volatile organic compounds and 3) reactions of organic compounds involving NO2.  Experiments employ 1) velocity map imaging with photoionization detection of radical intermediates and products and 2) product velocity and angular distribution measurements in molecular beam scattering apparatuses with either electron bombardment or tunable VUV ionization detection. The experiments are complemented by ab initio electronic structure calculations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivations for the research are threefold: contributing to fundamental understanding of an important class of chemical reactions, providing challenging tests for theoretical calculations, and developing predictive models for atmospheric chemistry.  High school students, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates are actively involved in carrying out this research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Radicals play key roles in atmospheric chemistry. One example is in the chemical reactions by which OH radicals formed photolytically in the daylight hours convert isoprene (a natural unsaturated hydrocarbon) and unburned gasoline (an anthropogenic source of hydrocarbons in our atmosphere) into secondary organic aerosol particles that markedly influence our climate.  But radicals elude direct detection because of their highly reactive, short-lived nature.  This research develops methods to study the decomposition reactions of radical species by generating them photolytically in a high-vacuum apparatus where their reactions can be directly studied.  We developed methodology to test quantum mechanical predictions of the decomposition reactions of important radical intermediates, correctly accounting for the fact that photolysis imparts substantial rotational angular momentum to the radicals under study.      An important benefit of conducting this research at an academic institutiom is the training it provides to young scientists seeking to contribute to science and technology in our country.  The students involved in the research are earning bachelors and Ph.D.'s in chemistry, and go on to work in private companies, national laboratories, and colleges and universities across our country.  Four Ph.D. students earned there degree during this grant period.  One is now a professor at Liberty University, two have taken postdoctoral research positions national laboratories, and the last is working for a consulting company.  They helped educate the brilliant undergraduates at The University of Chicago as they worked toward a Ph.D., learning how to develop their own students' scientific understanding.
