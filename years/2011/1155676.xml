<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to determine whether easily observed physical processes control phytoplankton bloom initiation in the North Atlantic.  The hypothesis is that blooms are triggered by a reduction in mixing in late winter/early spring when heat loss and winds weaken.   For a simple phytoplankton-nutrient system with a wide range of biological parameters, blooms develop in realistic models of convective turbulence in the upper ocean when the surface cooling changes into heating in spring.  This work hypothesizes that the change in turbulence is readily predicted from observable properties and is strong enough to spark a bloom in any biological model that admits them.  Unlike previous explanations which are very sensitive to details of the biological interactions which are both poorly understood and difficult to quantify, this atmospheric forcing hypothesis is testable with remote and in-situ data which can constrain physical parameters much better than biological ones.   This project will extend our existing criterion for bloom initiation to account for wind forcing, evaporation and precipitation.   The range of biological models and parameters for which the criterion works well will be assessed.   The theory will be tested using numerical simulations, new glider data (to be collected), an established UK time-series station, and available satellite data.  The proposed project is a timely, unique and cost-effective opportunity to address one of the longest-running and most intensively studied problems in oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spring bloom, an annual population explosion that dominates the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton abundance in much of the global ocean, exemplifies the interplay between ocean biology and physics.  The continuing lively debate on the processes controlling bloom initiation is driven largely by the paucity of testable hypothesis and suitable in-situ data.  After 60 years of research into this topic by the biological oceanography community, theory and technology has now advanced sufficiently to the point where we can resolve fundamental outstanding questions on the interactions between physical processes and bloom timing.   By coupling modern turbulence and biological models, driving them by observed atmospheric forcings, and comparing results with observations, we will determine the degree to which aspects of the bloom can be predicted simply by knowing the forcing and gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phytoplankton blooms in the North Atlantic are important for driving ocean carbon uptake and supporting ecosystems, including the fisheries of the North Americas and Europe.  Hence this proposal targets topics of relevance for society both in the short term (fisheries) and long term (climate change). The proposal has a strong educational component through the training of a graduate student and a postdoc in interdisciplinary research on topics of growing importance for our understanding of the climate system.  The international collaboration with UK colleagues to collect relevant data is another important aspect.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The OSMOSIS project represents the most detailed observational program ever carried out to examine fluid motions in the ocean surface boundary layer at spatial scales of 1 to 10 kilometer scales for an entire year.  Caltech contributed to the effort to observe a 400 square kilometer region of the ocean using a pair of ocean gliders, autonomous vehicles that serve as platforms to measure density, oxygen, chlorophyll, light penetration and ocean currents.  The field program was a remarkable success, collecting over 4200 individual hydrographic profiles.  The importance of this study is connected to its ability to resolve physical processes that contribute to the variations in the ocean's mixed layer.  The mixed layer is a region of the ocean where turbulence keeps properties, such as temperature and salinity, well mixed in the vertical direction.  However, horizontal gradients in properties may still persist.  Horizontal gradients in buoyancy serve as a reservoir for potential energy and there are a host of different types of instabilities that occur in the mixed layer that act to release this energy.  Our OSMOSIS study was able, for the first time, to document the frequency and seasonal transitions in these different types of instabilities.  Specifically we found that the mixed layer is gravitationally unstable throughout the early fall as cooling acts to erode stratification at the surface.  However, as mixed layers deepen, a diverse number of instabilities become active, in particular symmetric instability, which has implications for the ocean's energy budget and injection of tracers from the ocean surface into the interior.  Our analysis shows that these submesoscale instabilities are active throughout the winter but stop abruptly in spring as the atmosphere transitions to a phase of surface heating and mixed layers shoal rapidly.  This study is particularly important because its suggests the importance of submesoscale processes in open ocean regions.  Most submesoscale work has been focused on western boundary currents, which are pre-conditioned to being favorable to submesoscale processes due to strong front and strong wind forcing from the continents.  Here we show that submesoscale dynamics are likely to be relevant for governing mixed layer depths, even in regions with moderate eddy kinetic energy and weak mean flows.  The ability to not only document seasonal transitions in submesoscale activity, but to also to identify specific instability processes that give rise to these differences will be critical for improving parameterizations of these processes in global climate models.  Specifically, our work has shown that the equivalent surface forcing due to these small-scale motions can greatly exceed typical surface forcing from atmospheric heating/cooling and precipitation/evaporation events, even if intermittently.  This work is also moving forward to better understand the timing of the North Atlantic spring bloom.  The gliders have been able to show that mini-blooms, or localized maxima in surface chlorophyll concentrations occur throughout the winter.  This observation runs counter to predictions that chlorophyll levels should be low throughout the winter, as deep mixed layers cause plankton to spend relatively little time in light-lit levels (the euphotic zone).  We are able to explain this discrepancy by linking the mini-blooms to rapid, restratification of the mixed layer that can trap plankton near the surface, either through surface forcing anomalies or changes in buoyancy distributions associated with submesoscale fluid motions.  This information is critical for improving our understanding of the marine carbon cycle.       Last Modified: 05/31/2015       Submitted by: Andrew F Thompson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
