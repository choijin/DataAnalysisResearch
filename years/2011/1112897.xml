<AbstractNarration>In the modern theory of irregular (ill-posed, unstable) problems, numerous regularized computational methods are known. These methods are being constantly improved and supplemented with new algorithms. Applied inverse problems are the main sources of this development. One of the primary approaches to the construction and investigation of stable methods for solving ill-posed operator equations is iterative regularization. Numerous convergence theorems describe the efficiency of iteratively regularized algorithms for different classes of unstable problems, and give existence results. However it is quite hard to navigate among discrete schemes and the corresponding convergence theorems. Proofs of these theorems are usually based on the contraction mapping principle and are sometimes rather complicated. In this project, PI conducts research on continuous regularization, which is based on the analysis of asymptotic behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems in Banach and Hilbert spaces. When a convergence theorem is proven for a continuous method, one can investigate various discrete schemes generated by this continuous process. Thus, construction of a discrete numerical scheme is split into two parts: development of a continuous process and numerical integration of the corresponding nonlinear operator-differential equation. Consequently, when it comes to a convergence theorem for a discrete scheme, one can differentiate between the sufficient conditions for the convergence of a continuous process, which stem from the nature of the ill-posed problem, and the conditions that originate from a specific method of numerical integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will have a broad impact on a large number of scientific disciplines (biomedical imaging, gravitational sounding, chaos theory, spectroscopy, computerized tomography, and other areas of science and engineering) since the corresponding applied inverse problems can be investigated in the framework of this proposal both, theoretically and numerically. These problems are "ill-posed" in the sense that their solutions are unstable with respect to noise in the observed image data. For this reason, classical methods of computational mathematics cannot be applied. To overcome this instability and to simultaneously incorporate a priori information, one uses special techniques known as regularization methods. PI's research interests lie in the development and analysis of these regularization methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT  The goal of this project was to improve the existing computational algorithms for solving algebraic, differential, integral, and other nonlinear equations. These equations connect the unknown parameters of a model with some given quantities describing the model. The above quantities, which can be either measured or calculated at the preliminary stage, form the so-called input data. As one attempts to reconstruct a cause from its effect, the problem often turns out to be unstable (ill-posed) in a sense that even small noise in the input data may result in the enormous error at a computed solution. This precludes the use of classical methods of computational mathematics in case of such problems since due to severe noise propagation the corresponding iterative methods turn out to be divergent.   To overcome this instability, the techniques known as "regularization" must be incorporated in the numerical process. To that end, one introduces the so-called a priori information into the model in order to sacrifice some accuracy to stability. Since a priori information may not be completely reliable, the penalty term containing this information is scaled by a special (usually small) regularization parameter.  In our research we have conducted theoretical and numerical study of an advanced regularization technique known as continuous regularization. The idea of continuous regularization is as follows.  (1) at first, the model is stabilized by Tikhonov's (variational), Lavrentiev's (shift), local, Bayesian, or other algorithm;  (2) the regularization  is coupled with an appropriate  numerical method for solving nonlinear optimization problems (for example, Gauss-Newton, BFGS, conjugate gradient, etc);  (3) while the regularized numerical method is being executed, the regularization parameter is selected adaptively (continuously) to make sure it is properly balanced with the current value of the approximate solution and with the level of noise in the model.  BROAD IMPACT    The results of this investigation have been disseminated through eight conference talks, nine peer reviewed journal publications (most of them with graduate students), two book chapters, two PhD dissertations, and one MS thesis. Two female PhD students have been supported through this project as full time research assistants. Upon their graduation, they have both found jobs in academia. One MS student has entered PhD program at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, GSU.  Two new applied courses in inverse problems and regularization theory, one dual level and one graduate level, have been proposed based on the results of this project. They will help to advance our PhD program and better prepare students for practically oriented careers in computational sciences.  Theoretical and numerical study conducted under this award has positively influenced the undergraduate research program at GSU Math and Stat Department through active involvement of undergraduate students in the analysis of various unstable models. The best undergraduate project resulted in a journal publication. One undergraduate participant has completed her BS degree and is now a PhD student at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, GSU. Two other undergraduate students are close to graduation (actively applying for PhD programs in computational mathematics).  The project has had a broad impact on a large number of scientific disciplines (irrigation theory, biomedical imaging, inverse scattering, infectious disease modeling, and others), since the corresponding applied nonlinear problems have been successfully investigated in the framework of continuous regularization. Various areas of mathematics, such as scientific computing, mathematical biology, nonlinear optimization, numerical analysis, and other fields have also been advanced.
