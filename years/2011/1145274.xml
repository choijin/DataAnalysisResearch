<AbstractNarration>Although humans have transported thousands of species of plants and animals across the globe, the ability of those species to establish, spread, and cause significant economic and ecological costs in the areas to which they have been introduced varies greatly. Many hypotheses have been proposed to understand why some introduced species harm the ecosystems to which they are introduced while others are apparently innocuous.  Most famously, Darwin hypothesized that introduced species that are less closely related to the native species in a habitat are more likely to cause harm, that is, to become invasive.  This research will focus on three prominent mechanisms that might explain how evolutionary novelty in plants could lead to invasion following introduction: competition, natural enemies, and pollination.  Novelty could allow introduced plants to escape both competition from other plants and attack by predators and pathogens.  However, novelty could deprive introduced plants of pollinators.  Researchers will test the effects of competition, herbivory, and access to pollinators on the performance and predicted population growth of each of 20 introduced plant species that vary in invasiveness and novelty at a field site near Saint Louis, Missouri. Results will help show the costs and benefits of evolutionary novelty in introduced species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing a more thorough understanding of the important environmental problem of invasive species, this study will provide useful information for cost-effective ways to limit the introductions of potentially invasive species and to manage species that have already been introduced. The research will also train graduate and undergraduate students and reach out to the public through an informal science education program with high school interns and through presentations to public audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report     Although humans have transported thousands of species of plants and animals across the globe, the ability of those species to establish, spread and cause significant economic and ecological costs in their non-native range is highly variable.  Many hypotheses have been proposed to understand why some non-native species wreak havoc on the ecosystems to which they are introduced, while others are quite innocuous.  However, evidence for each hypothesis has been mixed.  The results of this research demonstrate that exotic plants that are closely related to native plant species are more strongly benefitted from experiments that remove these competitors, suggesting that novel exotic plant species are successful through reduced competition with neighbors.  However, this relationship is stronger at smaller spatial scales, suggesting that competition is a highly local process.  The effect of competition and herbivory on exotic plant populations interacts strongly with disturbance and exotic plant density.  This finding provides specific applications for management programs aimed at restoring historic disturbance regimes (e.g., prescribed fire).  There was high variation across exotic plant populations in their dependence on animal pollinators for reproductive success, the degree to which they were integrated into plant-pollinator networks and their magnitudes of pollen limitation.  Pollinator-dependent plants that were highly integrated into plant-pollinator networks were less likely to be pollen limited.     This research significantly engaged nine undergraduate students and eight high school interns as well as the more traditional training for graduate students, technicians and postdocs.  Many of these junior scientists worked in the PIs research group for multiple years, obtained a depth of experience into the scientific process and became critical members of the research team.  Many are now continuning on into graduate programs in Ecology and into scientific careers.  The PI gave several week-long courses to high school biology teachers, and several of these teachers have dramatically revised their Ecology module to incorporate the findings of this research, more quantitative examples, and modern scientific debates. The PI and her research group have communicated these findings to local land managers, and have presented these results at conferences that are well-attended by managers in the broader region.
