<AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liason with Industry (GOALI) award supports the study of a new forming process to create a mechanical joint between dissimilar materials.  Friction stir forming will be studied by experimental, modeling, and material analyses.  The intrinsic process forces and temperature will be measured.  The effect of process parameters on the material deformation and joint strength will be experimentally investigated.  A more accurate modeling prediction of thermo-mechanical material behavior will be made.  A complete metallurgical analysis will be conducted to characterize the effect of friction stir forming on the work material grain structure.  This new, efficient process has a relatively small environmental footprint and will be capable of simultaneously heating and forming the work material into a strong dissimilar material joint. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this new joining process will result in a stronger, lighter joint made entirely from the parent material in a variety of dissimilar materials. The process is a quick one-step process without the need for external fasteners, fluids, or any other material.  In traditional joining methods, such as fusion processes, joint strength in dissimilar metal joints is limited.  The major goal of this research is to establish the link among the force/heat input, material structure, material properties, and resulting joint strength.  The nature of work material forming at high temperature will be fully characterized and the proposed work will contribute extensive knowledge about material forming by friction stir processes.  This research will stimulate new avenues and applications for friction stir processes, and make them suitable for a wide range of materials.  General Motors is a partner in the research and will implement the process into the manufacture of their automotive body structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this research, the new Friction Stir Forming process was studied.  The concept of this process, as shown in Figure 1, is to use a rotating tool to create friction on the top sheet and thereby heating the material and simultaneously forming it into a prefabricated hole within the bottom sheet material.  Figure 1 shows the setup at the beginning of the process with the tool rotating and the workpieces in an overlapping position above the backing anvil which contains a cavity for the eventual head of the interlocking joint.  Then, the rotating tool plunges into the top workpiece, which generates frictional heating thereby lowering the yield strength of the work material i.e. aluminum in the current study.  This facilitates extrusion of the aluminum through the prefabricated hole in the steel coupon forming the neck and the head of the mechanically interlocking joint.  The advantage of this process is that it produces a lightweight joint directly from the sheet materials being joined.  This simple process is economical and environmentally friendly and does not require rivets, bolts, fluids, substantial heating energy, or additional mass addition. The friction stir formed joint strength is comparable to the strength of joints made by the cold worked clinch process.  This research supported 3 graduate students through MS degree and 1 PhD student.   The process was developed experimentally at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and General Motors Research &amp; Development, as shown in Figure 2.  Experimentally measured lap-shear peak-load data was the metric applied in a design of experiment methodology in order to investigate the operational parameters.  The significant parameters were shown to be the geometrical characteristics such as coupon thickness, electro-galvanic coating layer, pre-fabricated hole diameter in the steel, design of the formed joint i.e. anvil design, and the positioning of the coupons in relation to other elements of the machine setup.  For example, plunge depth plays a crucial role.  This depth should be as small as possible especially in thinner aluminum sheets.  If the plunge depth is too great, it could compromise the strength of the weld.  Subsequently, another crucially important parameter is aluminum sheet thickness.  The thicker the aluminum sheet is, the stronger the joint.  Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the zinc diffused into the aluminum matrix and a thin layer of intermetallic was formed in the friction stir forming process.  This layer contributed significantly to the strength of the joint (brittle fracture).  Samples with four pins and tapered holes were made with increased extension and toughness in the lap shear joint strength tests.  The pins supported more of the load in the multi-pin samples.     The evolution of the joint formation was mapped through metallurgical analysis as shown in Figure 3.  There seemed to be two layers within the aluminum work material during friction stir forming; the thermally affected zone that was rotating along with the tool, and the heat affected deformation zone that was non-rotational (extruded into the anvil cavity without rotation).  More insight was obtained from friction stir forming material into slot and hole cavity anvil designs.  It was found that most work material was displaced at a radius of 5 mm from the tool axis, and that this material flowed orthogonally to the tool axis.  At either side of this radius, the material flowed apart in different directions depending on the radial position.    Finite element modeling results provided greater in-depth information about the temperature and stress distribution throughout the work materials, as shown in Figure 4.  It was found that it is possible to model the large deformation in friction stir forming with modern finite element tools.
