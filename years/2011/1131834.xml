<AbstractNarration>Measurements of nitrogen and carbon isotopes from deep-sea sediments document dramatic changes between the last ice age and the modern ocean. However, both nitrogen and carbon isotopes are influenced by different physical and biogeochemical processes, which makes their interpretation ambiguous. In this research, a process-based coupled model of climate, ocean circulation and biogeochemistry that includes carbon and nitrogen isotopes will be used in conjunction with sediment data in order to reconstruct glacial nitrogen and carbon cycles. The model will be amended with explicit iron cycling and global databases of nitrogen and carbon isotopes from Last Glacial Maximum and modern ocean sediments will be compiled. This approach allows testing of hypotheses concerning changes in the total ocean nitrogen inventory, polar nutrient consumption due to iron fertilization and their effects on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project continues collaboration between a climate modeler and a paleoceanographer from Oregon State University and international collaboration with a Canadian investigator from McGill University. Funding supports a graduate student, a summer workshop for 30 K-12 teachers from all parts of Oregon and a summer research experience for an undergraduate student at Oregon State University. In addition, the researchers will actively participate in both the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) and in the new Paleo Carbon Modeling Intercomparison Project (PCMIP), efforts that evaluate the skill of climate models under paleoclimate conditions and improve understanding of past climate changes.</AbstractNarration>

The whole ocean inventory of fixed nitrogen, which is determined by a balance of its sources (nitrogen fixattion) and sinks (denitrification), thus is critically important for both the productivity of the oceanÆs food webs as well as for the oceanÆs ability to sequester carbon (biological pump). An increased efficiency of the biological pump has long been suggested as a possible mechanism to reduce carbon dioxide concentrations in the ice age atmosphere by sequestering more carbon in the ocean. Two proposed specific hypotheses to increase the efficiency of the biological pump related to the nitrogen cycle were tested here: (1) increased polar nutrient utilization through iron fertilization (increased dust fluxes), and (2) increases in the whole ocean fixed nitrogen inventory.  This project has improved an existing global Model of Ocean Biogeochemistry and Isotopes (MOBI) by (a) merging carbon (&delta;13C) and nitrogen (&delta;15N) isotope modules and (b) including iron (Fe) cycling. MOBI, which is coupled to a physical circulation / climate model, has been carefully calibrated, extensively tested, and found to be able to reproduce the observed large-scale spatial distribution of these tracers in the modern ocean. The model has then been applied to the Last Glacial Maximum (~20,000 years ago) in order to investigate the oceanÆs circulation and biogeochemical cycling at that time, with a focus on the nitrogen cycle and its impact on ocean carbon storage. To our knowledge these are the first simulations of a global model that includes both &delta;13C and &delta;15N. Comparisons with reconstructions from LGM sediments show that the best fitting models reproduce the main features of the reconstructed changes and thus provided the first quantitative estimates of changes in the oceanÆs nitrogen cycle and biological pump that are simulaneously constrained by both isotopes.  Intellectual Merit  In a manuscript submitted to Paleoceanography we describe idealized LGM simulations with MOBI, in which phytoplankton growth rates were increased incrementaly in order to mimick enhanced iron fertilization. Comparison to sediment data shows that models in moderately increased growth rates can reproduce the main features of both carbon and nitrogen isotope reconstructions best. These models have similar global fluxes (nitrogen fixation and denitrification) and inventories of fixed nitrogen than those of the modern simulations, suggesting that this also applies for the real LGM ocean. This would indicate that the glacial oceanÆs nutrient inventory was not significantly larger and thus would not have contributed to an increased efficiency of the biological pump. On the other hand, these results indicate that increased nutrient utilization through iron fertilization could very well have made the biological pump more efficient.   However, surprisingly the oceanÆs carbon inventory is not increased in these simulations. This indicates that whole ocean changes in alkalinity may be crucial to explain the increase in the LGM oceanÆs carbon inventory. This hypothesis will require testing with an interactive sediment model in the future.  Broader Impacts  The improved model, which is publicly available, will be an important tool for further insights into the glacial ocean as well as to better understand other time periods including transient situations such as the last deglaciation. We have layed the groundwork for new international collaborations and paleoceanographic data syntheses of carbon isotopes and other circulation proxies. Initial databases have been created of both core-top and down core &delta;13C reconstructions based on benthic foraminifera. Climate change workshops for oregonian educators and other activities have contributed to improved public climate literacy.
