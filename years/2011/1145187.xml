<AbstractNarration>Understanding the forces controlling basaltic explosive eruptions is of fundamental importance in order to improve understanding of the range of behaviors of our most frequently active volcanoes and to assess hazards of future explosive events. The summit of Kîlauea is the site of large and growing volcano-tourism (e.g., 5000 visitors/day at the overlook at Jaggar Museum), and there is a public need both for better knowledge of the volcanoes' behavior and improved forecasting of the likely course of future eruptions.  Although not its usual style, explosive eruptions have punctuated Kîlauea's history, with five moderately large events since 1500 CE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study quantifies and models the dominant factors that determine explosive eruptive behavior at Kilauea volcano, through a study of the eruptive products from three plume-forming and fountaining eruptions. The events are episode 1 of the highest historical fountaining eruption at Kîlauea, the 1959 Kîlauea Iki eruption, a much earlier powerful fountaining eruption in 1480 CE and a powerful; plume-forming eruption in 1635 CE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novelty of the approach lies in using new 'rate-meters' to estimate likely durations of magma ascent beneath the volcano to arrive at the influence of this residence time on the ultimate 'fate' of the magma. The investigators will study microtextures (vesicles and microlites), volatiles in melt inclusions, and embayments in eruptive products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to direct support for 3 graduate students and undergraduate students, results will contribute to educational outreach efforts anchored on development of volcanology classes at University of Hawaii, Columbia University and Rice University. The proposal involves exchange of material and ideas between five institutions to the benefit of young researchers, and undergraduate and graduate classes. Our results will be widely disseminated via the Internet using linked web sites hosted by Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and NSF-funded institutions.</AbstractNarration>
