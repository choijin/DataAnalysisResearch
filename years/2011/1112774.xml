<AbstractNarration>The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is a premier forum for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, chips and systems, for technical exchange on current areas of architectural challenge. This proposal aims to support this highly regarded conference by obtaining travel support for students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating in the ISCA conference  June 4-8, 2011 in San Jose, California as part of the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC). &lt;br/&gt;Up to 30 U.S.-based students (averaging $500 each) to be supported by the award. The majority of the awards to be granted to Ph.D. students. Priority will be granted to students who have authored papers accepted for presentation at the conference or its joint workshops, in particular those students without existing travel support.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ISCA 2011 was held June 4-8 in San Jose, California.  It was part of ACM's Federated Computing Research Conference.  ISCA is the premier venue for computer architecture research and this was the 38th edition of the conference.  This was one of the most successful and heavily attended ISCA conferences in recent years.  The conference received 208 submissions, of which 40 were selected.  The conference included plenary talks each day, nearly 20 workshops and tutorials on the first two days, a panel, a reception, and a conference excursion.  All of these events led to extensive interactions among attendees, and was a priceless experience for all students that attended.  The conference had a total of 643 attendees, of which 263 were students.  The associated workshops and tutorials had a total of 430 attendees, of which 201 were students.  The NSF funds were used to fund 59 applicants.  All of these recipients currently attend US universities.  47 of these awardees received $225, and 12 received $350.  The students that received the higher amount were either co-authors on ISCA papers or presenters on workshop papers.  The student travel grants were primarily administered by Aamer Jaleel of Intel.  The recipients included eleven women, two undergraduates, and two junior faculty.       Last Modified: 01/02/2012       Submitted by: Rajeev Balasubramonian]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
