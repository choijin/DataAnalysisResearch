<AbstractNarration>Huge efforts and funds are today deployed, in both academia and industry, with the purpose to develop new tools, techniques, and methods to support the design of innovative and creative interactive digital products and services. However, while a large proportion of these attempts lead to research insights, they are not always successfully transformed into design methods that fit the reality that practitioners experience. This lack of understanding of practice has in many cases led to a substantial lack of trust from practitioners towards the value of research contributions, while at the same time leading to frustrated researchers not understanding the lack of enthusiasm from practitioners when it comes to adapting new design methods emanating from research efforts. The proposed research will develop a solid understanding of this unfortunate situation by carefully investigating existing practice from the perspective of practitioners. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research proposal is made up of five major studies and activities, conducted in parallel over three years. These activities are a combination of analytical studies of design methods and interview studies with practitioners (designers who employ design methods to create products and systems) and researchers (design method developers). The research will lead to insights and principles suitable for practitioners on how to strategize and handle their choice and use of design tools, techniques, and methods, and to insights and principles suitable for organizations for their strategic choices of design methods. Most importantly, the research will lead to educational guidelines suitable for design education on how to professionally think about and handle design methods. With increased knowledge about what constitutes appropriate design methods, these results will increase the probability for more creative and innovative designs of interactive products and systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has been primarily focused on an overlooked aspect in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Interaction Design which has to do with the way interaction design practitioners understand, evaluate, select, and adapt design methods (approaches, techniques, and tools) for their design process needs. Even though design as an approach has achieved a lot of attention lately, we found that little has been done to examine what design methods practitioners actually use, why they use them, and how they think about and understand these methods. We also found that the majority of design methods developed by academics with the purpose to improve practice are not adopted by practitioners. A lot of effort and resources are spent based on the argument that the results will be practically useful while in reality the outcomes are not used or practical.  The main goal of this project was to examine the intentions, goals, principles, strategies and thinking among those who develop new design methods, and among those who use design methods, and among those who teach design methods. For each of these groups we have examined how they understand the professional practice in the field of HCI and interaction/UX design, and what they see as essential qualities of a practical and useful design method, and how methods are used in practice.   Our studies has led to the following outcomes:   - a conceptual framework/typology of design methods;   - a theoretical and practical understanding of how designer-practitioners think about, select, and use design methods;   - a theoretical understanding of how design method developers approach method development;   - insights and principles suitable for designer-practitioners on how to strategize and handle their choice and use of design methods;   - insights and principles suitable for organizations on their strategic choices of design methods; and   - educational guidelines suitable for interaction design (and related areas) on how to professionally think about and handle design methods.   There are several aspects when it comes to the broader impact of our research.
