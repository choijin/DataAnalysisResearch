<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  The goal of this project is to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the Mre11/Rad50 (MR) DNA repair complex, which is involved in the processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within eukaryotes, archaea, and some bacteriophage.  DSBs are among the most deleterious forms of DNA damage and their improper repair may cause gross chromosomal rearrangements, leading to cellular dysfunction or death.  The dual activities of the MR complex (ATP hydrolysis and nuclease) are required for the repair of DSBs that have been chemically modified by toxins or proteins.  This research project will focus on defining, in quantitative terms, the kinetics, thermodynamics, and conformational dynamics of the MR complex.  The objectives of this research project are to:  1) Define the functional role and mechanism of ATP binding and hydrolysis by Rad50; 2) Determine the mechanism behind the metal-dependent change in MR complex nuclease activity and to discover the possible roles of additional proteins in DSB resection; 3) Characterize the conformational changes in Mre11 and determine the role of Mre11 dimerization.  The completion of this project is expected to increase understanding of DSB repair and, more generally, how organisms maintain their genomic integrity through multiple generations.              &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project involves collaborations with both genetic and structural biology laboratories and will therefore expose and educate undergraduate and graduate students to the synergy that results from the combination of biochemical, biophysical, and genetic research.  The project will provide high quality training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  In addition to the multi-year training of students in the PI's home department, the PI participates in the Women in Science and Engineering internship program and will become a mentor for the George Washington Carver internship program.  The goal of these programs are to increase the diversity of talented individuals choosing science as a career.  The PI is also developing a course that places science journalism students in a research laboratory where they will attend group meetings, interview members of the laboratory, and observe daily activities.  The objective is for the journalism students to appreciate the manner and pace at which experimental findings are obtained.  The laboratory members who are being interviewed and observed will also benefit by learning to explain their research to non-experts.  In addition, the PI is developing a course that combines enzyme theory, practical enzyme characterization, and modern data fitting/model discrimination analysis.  Throughout the course the PI will use examples from his own research, and when possible, the students that generated the data under discussion will present the experiments to their peers.  This type of peer-to-peer teaching has been found to be a very effective learning tool for both the peer-teachers and peer-students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit Outcomes: The repair of damaged DNA is a fundamental process that is necessary for survival and evolution in living organisms.  Cellular DNA is constantly bombarded by external and internal DNA damaging agents and the resulting damage must be repaired for proper cellular function.  The most drastic form of DNA damage is an interruption of the DNA backbone referred to as the double-strand break (DSB).  The mistake-free repair of DSBs requires a highly conserved complex made up of Mre11 and Rad50 proteins (the MR complex).  This project has investigated the biochemical mechanism by which the MR complex carries out its crucial functions in DSB repair.   The catalytic mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by Rad50 was determined and several important structural features of the MR complex were identified, including a unique region on Mre11 that auto-regulates its own activity. On the basis of a variety of biochemical and biophysical experiments, we developed a model involving large scale movements of the Rad50 coiled-coil domain that drive both movement of the MR complex along DNA and conformational changes in Mre11 that turn on and off its activity.              Broader Impacts Outcomes:  This project has impacted students at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.  All students received training in a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques and have presented their research at regional and national scientific conferences.  Numerous Iowa State University undergraduate students have performed multi-year research experiences in the PI?s laboratory.  The PI hosted undergraduate student interns from Puerto Rico through the George Washington Carver internship program (GWC), and several small colleges around Iowa through the Women in Science and Engineering internship program.  The PI has hosted high school students from both Ames and Des Moines, Iowa through the Young Engineers and Scientists program, and from Arkansas through the GWC.  In total this project has supported the mentoring and training of four high school and fourteen undergraduate students.  Two graduate students have received their PhD degrees while performing research that has contributed to this project.  The PI developed two new courses as part of this project, one dealing with modern enzyme kinetics and data fitting techniques and another for non-science majors that using fermentation and the production of beer as an entry point to discuss topics such as GMO technology and metabolic engineering.
