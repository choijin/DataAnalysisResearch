<AbstractNarration>The presynaptic terminals of nerve cells are the sites where neurotransmitters (such as glutamate, acetylcholine and dopamine) are released during synaptic transmission.  Synaptic function is critical for all forms of behavior, for normal learning and memory and for motivation and mood. Understanding synaptic function is key to understanding and intervening in numerous disorders including addictive behavior and dementia. Arguably, the presynaptic terminal, with a few dozen different proteins, is the most complex region of nerve cells within what is the most complex organ of the body, the brain. At synapses, neurotransmitter is contained in small sacks or vesicles 30 nanometers (3/100,000 of a millimeter) in diameter. These vesicles are translocated within the terminal by different proteins and docked at release sites, where they can fuse with the membrane, releasing neurotransmitter. The complex, diverse group of proteins, the small size of synaptic terminals and the irregular morphologies of synaptic sites has made the analysis of synaptic terminal function at the molecular level difficult to analyze. Moreover, synaptic vesicles are below the resolution of traditional light or confocal microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past 5 years, there have been dramatic advances in novel strategies for imaging single molecules in living cells at the resolution of single vesicles. The complex geometry of synapses in the brain or even in cell culture is now the limiting factor.  The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for inducing nerve cells in culture to form synaptic terminals onto submicron islands of the membrane protein neuroligin. These neuroligin nanospots will be immobilized on chromium-gold spots generated on glass coverslips using computer chip photolithography technology. Inducing artificial presynaptic release sites on the surface of cover slips will create an optimal situation for imaging the behavior of single photoactivatable molecules in real time, using a technique called PALM. The development of this artificial synapse approach will be done using the highly robust neurons of the marine snail Aplysia, which has been a highly favorable model for analysis of synaptic mechanisms. Once this technique is validated, it will be  tested with mammalian neurons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general NLG nanospot technology that will be developed will promote future interactions between engineers and neuroscientists. Dr. Abrams has a long history of introducing undergraduate students to research, and several will be involved in this project, including a student who is already playing a major role in producing submicron chromium-gold spots at the Maryland NanoCenter.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The synaptic structures that mediate communication between pairs of individual nerve cells (or neurons) are remarkably complex.  The synaptic terminals of presynaptic neurons are specializations where packets of chemical neurotransmitters, contained in synaptic vesicles, are released into extracellular space.  The released neurotransmitter diffuses rapidly across the synaptic cleft to activate receptors in the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron.  Synapses are the major site of modification that occurs during learning and memory formation.  Synapses are also rapidly modulated during shifts in attention.  It is now understood that there are more than a few dozen specific presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins that can be altered to mediate these synaptic modifications.  On the presynaptic side, these proteins participate in various aspects of synaptic vesicle trafficking, including the docking of vesicles at release sites, transmitter release from vesicles as they fuse with the presynaptic membrane, and vesicle recycling after fusion.  To understand the function of proteins that play an important role in regulating vesicle trafficking or modulating vesicle fusion, it is particularly important to characterize precisely their localizations on the nanometer scale.  Synaptic vesicles are only ~30 nanometers in diameter (i.e., 30 millionths of a millimeter), so if the proteins that regulate vesicle function are shifted by as little as 50 nanometers, this would have substantial functional consequences.   To study localization of proteins in cells, researchers typically label the proteins with fluorescent tags.  Traditional fluorescence microscopy is unable to specify the localization of proteins more precisely than a few hundred nanometers, which is too imprecise to address many of the important questions about localization of synaptic proteins.  However, during the past decade, new imaging techniques have been developed that permit imaging with nanoscale resolution &ndash; such as PALM and STORM.  An additional challenge in studying the precise localization of synaptic proteins is that synapses formed between two neurons in culture are only rarely found immediately adjacent to the glass cover slip surface.  Because synaptic morphology is variable and irregular, as presynaptic and postsynaptic elements have complex geometries, it is difficult to interpret small shifts in the locations of presynaptic proteins (for example, it is difficult to infer whether small movements are towards or away from synaptic release sites).   The membrane protein neuroligin functions to induce presynaptic differentiation in neighboring neurons.  As a potential strategy for facilitating the imaging of presynaptic proteins with nanoscale resolution, in this EAGER supported project, we explored inducing presynaptic neurons to form artificial synapses on small islands of neuroligin protein immobilized on glass cover slips.  These islands of the postsynaptic protein neuroligin were supposed to function as phantom postsynaptic neurons, tricking the presynaptic cell into forming normal synaptic release sites.  Because the cover slips are planar, the analysis of the localization of the presynaptic proteins and any changes in their spatial organization would be substantially simpler than with real, three dimensionally complex synapses.    In this exploratory project, we tested three approaches to generating arrays of submicron spots of neuroligin on cover slips:   1.  Electron beam lithography.  Electron beam lithography produced extremely precise patterns of 400 nanometer gold spots to which modified neuroligin protein could be coupled.  However, production of an array of gold spots on a single cover slip required hours.  This was impractical as researchers need a dozen or more cover slips at one time.  2.  Photolithography.  Using high precision glass masks, we could generate one to two dozen cover slips with defined patterns of submicron gold spots in a day. Ho...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
