<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction and background  The use of an Imprecise Probability Model with competing risks data is a natural approach to dealing with masked failure causes. Masking is a general form of missingness that results in some observation having partial--but not complete--information. The very common situation termed "missing data" is a special case of masked data where the masking mechanism results in each observation being either known completely or not known at all. Using an imprecise probability model can be interpreted either in terms of the theory of imprecise probability models directly, or less controversially, in terms of Bayesian sensitivity analysis where the imprecise probability model is viewed as a method of making Bayesian inferences more robust against prior assumptions. Moreover, because the imprecise probability model proposed in this project is constructed from a class of Bayesian models, the method here is an application of the Global approach of Robust Bayesian Analysis. The primary goal of this research was to model the imprecision that arises due to an unknown masking mechanism in particular but imprecision in the distribution of the parameters of interest can be accommodated as well.  Motivation  Missing and incomplete data is a common problem not only for datasets collected for research purposes for statistical methods, but also data collected for other reasons such as public health surveillance or decision support systems. Thus another use of an alternative method of handling missing data may be of interest to other researchers.  Research activities  A model was developed for handling masked competing risks data that does not rely on untestable assumptions on the distribution of the masking probabilities. This model was built by considering the set of all possible values that one can assume about the masking probabilities and deriving conclusions that agree with all of the models within the set. The proposed model has two particularly beneficial features: 1) as in the imprecise Dirichlet model, an invariance property holds that results in an analysis being coherent despite re-categorizations of the failure causes, and 2) when the likelihood function allows a conjugate prior, then analytic results can be derived while maintaining robustness.  A simulation study was performed to determine the frequentist properties of estimates generated by the proposed model. These results were satisfactory and three publicly available published datasets were fit with the proposed model.  An overview of this project and an introduction to Imprecise Probability Models was presented at East China Normal University (ECNU) in July 2011 to the students of my host adviser, Dr. Yincai Tang. In September 2011 at the University of Missouri, web conferencing software was used to give a presentation of the results to my PhD adviser, Dr. Dongchu Sun, and his other students while including the students at ECNU. This work constituted a major component of my dissertation for the statistics PhD program at the University of Missouri, which I completed in May 2012.  Benefits of this research within and outside of statistics  It is believable that the results of the research will be of interest to not only researchers in the Survival and Reliability fields but also to the larger statistical community in terms of the Bayesian sensitivity analysis interpretation. Moreover, other statisticians may be interested in the use of an Imprecise Probability Model, which provides an interesting method of inference and decision making. One can expect that the results of this project can be utilized in the analyses of cause-of-death in human or animal subjects, failures for computer hardware or automobile engines, just to name a few.  The results should be applicable in both the biostatistics and engineering fields for analyzing failure time data especially in the special case of missing data. This projected addressed a fairly general problem which is often handled by making relatively restrictive assumptions. Imprecise Probability Models provide an interesting method to avoid untestable assumptions about the missingness mechanism and they are an interesting alternative to Objective Bayesian methods, but unfortunately are rather under-utilized.
