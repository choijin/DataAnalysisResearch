<AbstractNarration>In the coming decades, ecological communities will experience numerous environmental changes, including shifting climates and invasion by exotic species. Plant and microbial communities may exhibit non-linear responses to these environmental changes as species encounter physiological thresholds that constrain their growth and reproduction. Ultimately, ecosystem responses to environmental change will depend both on short-term shifts in species physiology or growth, and long-term shifts in species composition. This project will help develop the understanding of ecosystem responses to environmental change that will be needed for sustainable long term management of chaparral ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental, observational, and modeling approaches will be used to quantify chaparral ecosystem responses to altered rainfall regimes. Rainout shelters will be used to produce a gradient of rainfall quantity, and initial species composition of the experimental plots will be controlled by removing invasive annual grasses. Short-term physiological measurements will be taken on focal species, which will also be monitored over the course of the experiment to measure growth and survival. To complement these experiments, similar measurements will be taken on dominant plant species along a natural rainfall gradient across Southern California. Results from these experiments and surveys will be used to parameterize a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model to predict how predicted shifts in rainfall regimes will influence plant species composition and, ultimately, influence regional ecosystem processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to undergraduate, graduate, and public education, it will provide data to the broader scientific community, and it will inform land-management agencies. The experiment will provide research opportunities both for undergraduate and graduate students. Further, the research will evaluate how invasion influences ecosystem responses to global change, and whether interannual variation in rainfall may create opportunities for native shrub restoration. Communicating these findings with relevant conservation and land-management organizations will be one of the most important outcomes from this experiment. Finally, the project will make all of the data available and support communication about the ecological impacts of global change through evening lectures in public venues.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Arid and semiarid ecosystems, generally receiving less than 50 cm of rain per year, are widespread across the planet, yet are less frequently studied than other types of ecosystems. These ecosystems are important at a global level because their plants and soil microorganisms experience large variations in climatic conditions, such as rainfall, from year to year. Recent work has shown that arid and semiarid ecosystems are responsible for much of the interannual variation in global carbon (C) cycling, meaning that they are responsible for large shifts in the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) between the atmosphere and land. Drought conditions are expected to become more frequent for the southwestern United States. For example, the drought of 2012-2015 was historically unprecedented, probably exceeding the worst drought in over 10,000 years. Semiarid shrublands of the western US are also experiencing invasion by exotic plant species, such as European annual grasses, which can change the way the ecosystem functions. The main goal of this project was to measure the combined effects of invasive plants and altered rainfall on a shrubland ecosystem in southern California. This project was a collaboration between the Cleland laboratory at UCSD, specializing in plant ecology, and the Lipson laboratory at SDSU, specializing in soil microbiology and biogeochemistry (the cycling of C and nitrogen (N) in the environment). The main activity was a rainfall manipulation experiment, in which rainfall shelters were installed across a landscape containing patches of native shrubs and invasive annual plants. Rainfall was captured and redistributed among the plots to create three levels of rainfall, representing historically normal conditions, moderate drought (66% of normal) and extreme drought (33% of normal). The Cleland lab measured plant growth and litter decomposition (described in a separate report), while the Lipson lab measured changes in soil microbial communities and in the C and N cycles.</p> <p>Effects of rainfall and invasive plants on soil microbes: Soil microbial biomass declined over the course of the drought. However, the experimental rainfall treatment had a relatively small effect, except during the wettest year (2015), in which the high rainfall treatment had more microbial biomass. Microbial biomass was related to soil water content, overall. The rainfall treatment did not alter the species present in the microbial community, but the community varied strongly between years, showing a strong effect of climate. Invasive plants changed the microbial community and the seasonal patterns of microbial biomass, with larger seasonal changes in areas invaded by exotic plant species. Invasive plants also changed the abundance of C cycling genes in the bacterial community, showing that C is processed differently when plants invade.</p> <p>Effects of rainfall and invasive plants on C and N cycling: Soils with exotic plants had higher concentrations of nitrate and ammonium throughout the entire soil profile, especially in the lowest rainfall treatment. This means that reduced plant growth leaves more N in the soil, which can then be transported below the rooting zone and lost from the ecosystem during rainstorms. Dissolved organic C concentrations were higher in areas with native shrubs. Invaded plots released more CO2 from the soil during rainfall events, and these CO2 pulses were larger when soils were initially drier. Soils from invaded areas had less C and N stored in aggregates (clods of soil glued together by organic material), and showed other signs of disturbance and loss of simple C compounds. These results show that invasive plants can alter the ability of soils to store C and N, and can leave them vulnerable to loss during rain events.</p> <p>Overall, these results show that the combination of invasive plants and prolonged drought with intermittent rain storms changes the microbial community and reduces the ability of this ecosystem to store C and N. This study has also produced the most comprehensive description of the soil microbial community form this type of ecosystem (DNA sequences from 69 soil samples, each with hundreds of thousands of sequences). This project trained graduate and undergraduate students, and engaged K-12 students in art-science activities that taught them about plants. This includes an art exhibit with plant roots cast in resin accompanied by paintings, and the construction of a greenhouse for future use at a local middle school.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/08/2017<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Lipson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1153958/1153958_10144398_1496969891238_SMERplots600--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1153958/1153958_10144398_1496969891238_SMERplots600--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rain shelters"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1153958/1153958_10144398_1496969891238_SMERplots600--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rain shelters"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View of two rain shelters at Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve.
