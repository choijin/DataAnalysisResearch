<AbstractNarration>This project provides student travel support for the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)held in Vancouver, Canada on Oct 17-19, 2011. The project allows a selected set of US students interested in network protocols to travel to this conference and benefit from the talks and other events. ICNP is a premier conference in this area and exposure to students of cutting edge research is essential.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was used to support the travel and conference fees of 14 graduate students from U.S. Universities for the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP).  These students presented their research results, participated in conference workshops, and a Ph.D. forum.  The conference took place from October 17-20, 2011 in Vancouver, Canada.  ICNP is the premier conference covering all aspects of network protocols, including design, analysis, specification, verification, implementation, and performance. The conference presents fully refereed research contributions from computer science, mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, and electrical engineering. It is considered a top tier networking conference.  Specific topics of the conference included:  - graph theoretic problems including constrained shortest paths, minimum Steiner Tree, various types of covers (eg, cycle covers) for graphs, maximum flow, from combinato- rial and optimization points of view,  - optimization problems such as job scheduling (for packet scheduling at routers), approximation algorithms,  - clustering algorithms for sensor networks,  - temporal, modal logic for protocol verification,  - design and analysis of cryptographic protocols for security,  - information theory,  - data structure design for data (such as routing table information) access at very high speeds, with dynamic data.  The students were able to gain experience presenting their work, and received feedback from top international researchers and their peers.
