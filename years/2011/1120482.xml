<AbstractNarration>Root traits that influence nutrient foraging in different plants are poorly understood.  In most plants, roots form a symbiotic association with mycorrhizal fungi that may improve the ability of the plant to forage for nutrients.  However, species differ in the extent that mycorrhizae can benefit nutrient uptake, and this is likely related to root morphology, including root diameter and root hair abundance. The PIs hypothesize that tree species with coarse roots with few or short root hairs forage in nutrient-rich patches by relying heavily on mycorrhizal fungi, while tree species with more rapidly growing roots that produce many long root hairs forage for nutrients by proliferating their roots, increasing root hair development and altering the rate of nutrient uptake.  The project will be primarily conducted in a 14-year-old planting of 16 different tree species that vary widely in root morphology, although additional studies will be conducted in natural forest stands and in growth chambers. This study will improve the theoretical basis by which plant roots can be used for calculating the influence of vegetation on elemental cycles, improve predictions of vegetation responses and feedbacks to climate change, and increase the understanding of roots needed for better management of crops and trees for food and fiber.  There will be a strong educational component to this research, including the training of three graduate students, undergraduate training in research and international exchanges of students and scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this research, we show that roots and mycorrhizal fungi are indeed complementary in their foraging for mineral nutrients.  Roots form symbioses with fungi, referred to as mycorrhiza.  In this research, we show that the degree plants depend on the mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient foraging depends on the type of mycorrhizal fungus and the thickness of the root.  There are two types of mycorrhizal fungi common to trees: arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi.  We found among AM trees in temperate and tropical forests, species with thin roots have lower AM colonization but more rapid root proliferation in the fertile patches than the thick-root species.  Thus, among AM trees, thin-root tree species foraged more for nutrients by root proliferation and thick-root species depended more on their mycorrhizal fungi.  We also examined differences in foraging behavior between AM and EM trees.  In EM trees like oaks and pines, plants more readily foraged for nutrients by extending the hyphae of their mycorrhizal fungi, compared to AM trees.  There was also a strong preference for nutrients added as organic matter compared to mineral fertilizer additions.  Collectively, these results clarify how trees with roots of very different morphologies and different mycorrhizas effectively co-exist using different foraging strategies.  There are several broader impacts to this research.  This project helped support five graduate students.  Two have defended their PhD and one their M.S. thesis and all have published their research.  Two additional PhD students should be completing their degrees in the next year.  This project also provided postdoctoral training to Lei Cheng, who is now a Professor at Zhejiang University.  Lastly, nine undergraduate students conducted research in excess of 160 hours on this project.  This work adds to our understanding of plant functional traits, which are being used to refine Earth System Models and can be used to better predict shifts in terrestrial carbon fluxes to climate change.  The root traits identified by this grant (e.g., root diameter and mycorrhizal type) are now being considered as key functional traits to be used in these models.  It also adds to our understanding of the evolutionary biology of plants.  Plants with relatively thick roots are typical of more basal lineages and thin-diameter roots generally have arisen from lineages that are more recent.  This information is also being used to help in the management of fruit crops like apple and grape by providing fundamental information on how the amount of fruit or competition with cover crops can affect root foraging.
