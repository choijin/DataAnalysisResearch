<AbstractNarration>The proposer proposes to develop efficient numerical methods&lt;br/&gt;for several problems in quantum dynamics. Specifically, the following&lt;br/&gt;three topics are selected:  Semiclassical methods for quantumscattering, &lt;br/&gt;surface hopping,  and Bloch-decomposition based computational&lt;br/&gt;methods for quantum dynamics in periodic lattice. These are challenging&lt;br/&gt;computational issues that involve high frequency waves and&lt;br/&gt;quantum-classical coupling. Mathematical and computational&lt;br/&gt;methods can play important roles to enhance our understanding as well&lt;br/&gt;as our ability to simulate these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These problems arise in solid state physics,  semiconductor device&lt;br/&gt;modeling, Bose-Eistein Condensations (BEC),  solar energy, and&lt;br/&gt;functional materials such as graphane, thus the developed computational&lt;br/&gt;methods will have a wide range of applications, some of which of&lt;br/&gt;significant national interests. Some of the research results will&lt;br/&gt;provide excellent additions for future graduate courses in applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and scientific computing, thus will help to&lt;br/&gt;improve the graduate curriculum in applied mathematics in order to&lt;br/&gt;better train future graduate students in modern applied mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Intellectual Merits: Numerical simulations at quantum level is notoriously challenging due to the high dimensionality of the problem and high frequency nature of the wave function.  Semiclassical methods provide a viable tool with the computational cost much less than the quantum simulation but can still describe important quantum phenomena that one desires to capture.  The PI made significant advances in developing several important semiclassical computational methods. Specificially, the PI  developed Gaussian beam methods  for Schrodinger and Wigner equations with discontinuous potentials;  he also developed semiclassical models for systems of Schrodinger  equations, and Schrodinger equations with periodic potentials, to  account for non-adiabatic phenomenon that arises due to band crossing,  an important phenomenon in surface hopping and semiconductor modeling,  and chemical reactions. These new numerical results and  mathematical models allow one to  efficiently compute non-adiabatic  quantum phenomena such as quantum  tunneling, chemical reaction, Berry  connections etc. with the computational cost of  semiclassical mechanics. The PI also extended these robust and efficient  algorithms for high frequency polzrized  waves which are important in  elastic and electromagnetic waves.        Broad impact:  These research results have broad impact in important technology areas such as semiconductor device, graphene, seismology, and quantum chemistry. The PI also trained a number of excellent Ph.D. students who found postdoc or tenure-track positions at prominent academic institutions. such as Stanford, Caltech, UCLA, Texas-Austin, etc.         Last Modified: 09/06/2015       Submitted by: Shi Jin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
