<AbstractNarration>The School of Technology and Design at New York City College of Technology proposes to create a new Center for Performative Design and Engineering Technology that will pioneer performative design education. The project takes as its inspiration the broad focus on laboratory-based learning that brings technological education to a higher level of integration and broader faculty engagement across an entire division. The Center will become the focus of interdisciplinary project-based learning for faculty and students from its nine constituent departments where they will conduct research projects using state-of-the-art technologies in cross-cutting applications that mirror industry practice. The project will produce a laboratory design to support interdisciplinary research by configuring equipment and instrumentation for optimal collaborative use. A faculty team will create a web-based tutorial system for asynchronous learning to accompany interdisciplinary applications of cutting-edge technology. They will also design a new interdisciplinary capstone course and four cross-disciplinary projects for baccalaureate-level students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a model for other institutions with similar programs to emulate.  By bringing project-based interdisciplinary team collaborations to the fore, the project will contribute to an on-going paradigm shift in the way engineering design is taught. The project will also broaden participation since New York City College of Technology serves a high percentage of underrepresented minority students and is one of the nation's top producers of underrepresented minority associate degree graduates in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2012, the School of Technology and Design at CUNY New York City College of Technology received a two-year Transforming Undergraduate Education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (TUES) grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create a new Center for Performative Design and Engineering Technology (CPD). The broad goal of the Center for Performative Design and Engineering Technology was to design and bring to scale integrative curricula and technology applications across the School of Technology and Design by configuring and co-locating state-of-the-art digital fabrication and visualization laboratory equipment and instrumentation in a large interdisciplinary space.  The three overarching activities related to this goal were 1) the creation of the Center for Performative Design and Engineering Technology, 2) development of a Web-based tutorial system and content for the Fabrication | Visualization lab, and 3) creation of curricula and content related to laboratory processes and technology, as well as curricula across multiple departments related to performative design and fabrication.  Performative design integrates computational technological tools into the design process, treating performance as a guiding principle and bringing together multi-disciplinary teams working concurrently from the outset of a project. This approach has become widespread in the building and building technology industries as sustainability has emerged as a socio-economic issue, and high-functioning yet affordable technology has improved simulations of finite element, thermal, solar, and acoustic performance. In addition, development of digital fabrication/manufacturing techniques and new materials that modulate and can be modulated by the environment have changed what can be built, spurring innovation in product design for building.  Deliverables  The grant continued up to May 2015 with a one-year no-cost extension, and succeeded in delivering the major project deliverables, which include:  A set of web-based tutorials for students and faculty to support asynchronous learning using the laboratory tools; A newly developed multidisciplinary capstone course and four cross-disciplinary projects for baccalaureate level students that use the team-based problem-solving processes adopted by industry; and A laboratory design to support interdisciplinary research in undergraduate technological education that configures equipment and instrumentation for optimal collaborative use;    OUTCOMES  The establishment of a large fabrication | visualization | performance testing lab originally envisioned to exist in one contiguous space has not yet occurred due to delays in large construction projects at the college. However, parts of the lab have been set up and the center and college have ensured that most of the pieces are in place for such a lab, including a common management and computational infrastructure and curriculum support tools.  Despite this delay the project has provided the college new opportunities in performative design. Several items of equipment have been put online during the grant period including a series of sensors and data loggers as well as several 3D printers, robotic arms, and a plasma cutter.
