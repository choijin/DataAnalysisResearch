<AbstractNarration>The Internet revolution enabled private users across the world to send and receive messages to one another.  Coupled with cryptographic techniques like public key encryption and digital signatures, this gave rise to the development of the world wide web, e-commerce, and so many other technological changes that we routinely take for granted today.  We are now facing a second revolution in which we are changing not just how we communicate, but how we compute.  More and more we are sending large datasets to untrusted servers, having them perform calculations on our behalf.  From our cell phones and our GPS units, we send compromising information to our service providers in order to outsource the computation that we cannot do on-the-go.  Cryptography has a new role to play in these emerging environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to explore the theoretical underpinnings of the cryptographic challenges that arise in this context.  The proposed directions of research touch on the following questions:&lt;br/&gt;-- How can we safely allow others to perform computation on our encrypted data while maintaining its privacy?&lt;br/&gt;-- How can we verify that outsourced computation was done correctly?&lt;br/&gt;-- What stronger security models are needed in this new, highly interactive environment?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will address the theoretical aspects of these problems, including modeling, protocol design, and negative results.  As part of her investigations, PI will study the powerful cryptographic primitives of fully homomorphic encryption and functional encryption (in particular, the relationship between them and outsourced and verifiable computations), as well as the area of leakage-resilient cryptography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work addressed the cryptographic challenges that arise in the context of computation in untrusted environments, where our information is handled by possibly untrusted others, such as mobile devices, the cloud, etc.  Of specific interest is the challenge of computation over encrypted data, whether verifying correctness of computation, or maintaining privacy of the data even against the party holding the encrypted data.  We also studied stronger security models appropriate in the context of such interactive environments, in particular leakage and tamper resilient cryptography.   Several of our major research outcomes revolved around bringing secure computation towards practice through new models and constructions.  Secure computation is concerned with the question of when can two or more mutually distrustful parties jointly perform a given task on their inputs (e.g., compute joint statistics on their data), guaranteeing that none of them can sabotage the outcome or extract extra information.  As such, secure computation can be viewed as encompassing, in some sense, every other cryptographic task as a special case (e.g., voting protocols, auctions, games, data mining, etc). This has been a powerful and important research area in cryptography since the first breakthrough results in the 1980s, which showed that in principle, anything that can be computed, can be computed securely.  However, these general results typically focus on feasibility within polynomial time, or "proof of concept", rather than practical results.  Indeed, they entail a prohibitive performance overhead, or place unreasonable assumptions about the availability and resources of participating parties.  Our work addressed these challenges for secure computation of general as well as specific computation tasks.     An important problem in this domain is that of practical and private search over encrypted data.  We have developed an efficient, scalable database management system called Blind Seer, that allows a client to query a database while maintaining the privacy of the client's query (not even the server learns information about the query it is answering), and at the same time protecting the server's data (no information about the data is leaked, beyond the matching records to the query). Our system also provides the ability to enforce authorization policies on the system, restricting the client's queries while maintaining the privacy of both query and policy.  Our system supports a rich query set, and provides provable security guarantees.     We have also addressed other aspects of secure computation in modern, untrusted environments, by modeling, constructing, and implementing various protocols.  These include general secure computation in the context of on-line marketplaces, private set intersection protocols, and several approaches to secure computation over the Internet, where parties may be on-line and off-line at various unexpected times, and may execute different tasks at the same time without any central coordination.  Finally, we provided the first protocols for secure two party computation that can run in sublinear time, namely without having to run in time proportional to the entire size of the data that is being computed on.  Thus, these protocols are suited for secure computation over big data, with potential applications in the business, medical, legal, and personal domains.
