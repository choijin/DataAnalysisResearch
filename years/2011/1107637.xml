<AbstractNarration>This award supports an international collaborative research team from the Ohio State University and the Leibniz Institute (IFW) in Dresden, Germany to realize and understand half-metallicity (i.e. 100% spin polarization of conduction electrons) in Heusler compounds and double perovskites. These two families of complex materials contain the vast majority of half-metallic compounds with high Curie temperatures that hold the promise of highly spin polarized transport at room temperature. To advance both our fundamental understanding as well as the technological promise of spin-polarized transport in these two families, this partnership brings together complementary expertise in high-quality epitaxial film deposition of complex materials and spin polarization measurements at the Ohio State University and single-crystal growth of these materials using the state-of-the-art facilities at the Leibniz Institute in Germany. Despite their promise, their chemical complexity and sensitivity to defects and antisite disorder has limited studies of Heusler compounds and double perovskites in prototype and real devices. Progress is also hindered by the fact that many aspects of the fundamental physics are still not well understood. This project has two aims: (1) deposit high quality, half-metallic epitaxial films and magnetic tunnel junctions of Heusler compounds with high Curie temperatures using off-axis ultrahigh vacuum sputtering, coupled with characterization of their structural, chemical, magnetic, electronic, spin polarization, and element-specific magnetic moments; (2) grow single crystals of half-metallic double perovskites. Availability of such crystals will enable investigations of their intrinsic spin polarization and magnetotransport properties. The true promise of these materials can only be assessed by separating intrinsic properties from extrinsic contributions originating from structural and chemical inhomogeneity. The goal of this project is to establish the scientific and technical foundations needed to incorporate half metallic materials in spintronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international collaboration combines the collective and complementary expertise needed to realize the promise of half-metallic ferromagnets for use in spintronics. The availability of highly spin-polarized ferromagnets for room temperature applications will establish a groundwork that has the potential to revolutionize computing. In addition, this effort will strengthen the ties between US and German communities that will enhance the research infrastructure of both partner institutions. Finally, the scientific challenges, as well as the interdisciplinary and international nature of the research program will provide excellent training for the student researchers and junior scientists.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit:  Co-based full Heusler compounds have been extensively studied due to their predicted 100% spin polarization and high Curie temperatures for spintronic applications. Tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) as high as 1995% at low temperatures has been demonstrated in Co2MnSi-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) and room temperature TMR reached 604% in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB MTJs. Majority of the Heusler MTJs were fabricated by on-axis sputter deposition at room temperatures followed by post annealing. The Heusler films made this way showed L21 and B2 order while their crystalline quality were not very high.  Heusler films of high crystalline quality are desired for understanding their intrinsic magnetic and spin transport properties as well as pushing the limit of Heusler MTJs and exploring other applications. Co2FeSi and Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 are among the most studied Heusler compounds due to their high TC and low magnetic damping.  Supported by this WMN award, we achieved epitaxial growth of Co2FeSi and Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 films on lattice-matched MgAl2O4 substrates using our unique off-axis sputtering technique. Our Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 films exhibit crystalline quality comparable to the best epitaxial films of semiconductors as demonstrated by the clear x-ray diffraction Laue oscillations and exceptionally narrow rocking curves.  Magnetic characterizations show a clear magnetocrystalline anisotropy comprising cubic and epitaxy-induced uniaxial terms and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements reveal high L21 order in the Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 films. Magnetotransport measurements show a distinct separation of anisotropic magnetoresistance and ordinary magnetoresistance. These results demonstrate the state-of-the-art crystalline quality and magnetic uniformity of the Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 films.  Oxides containing 5d transition metal ions have generated much excitement over the past few years due to the presence of strong spin orbit coupling (SOC).  Through the support of this grant we have prepared over a dozen unique osmate double perovskite compositions. Some of these compositions have never been prepared, while others had previously been reported but little if anything was known about their properties.  We have been studying their crystal structures, phase transitions, electrical conductivity, and magnetic properties.  The magnetic interactions in A2MOsO6 double perovskites (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni) are highly complex, in particular, the Os&minus;Os, M&minus;M, and Os&minus;M superexchange interactions are of comparable magnitude.  Furthermore, all three types of interactions are sensitive to changes in electron count and bond angle, which makes them tunable through application of either chemical pressure or external pressure. Consequently we are able to tune the magnetism to observe (1) independent antiferromagnetic ordering of the 3d and 5d ions (Sr2CoOsO6), (2) spin glass behavior (SrCaCoOsO6), and (3) ferrimagnetism with Curie temperatures that can exceed room temperature (Ca2FeOsO6).
