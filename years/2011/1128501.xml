<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the properties of electro-mechanical waves that propagate as frequency and voltage disturbances over the electrical grid.  These waves reveal much about the short-term dynamics and stability of the electrical grid and will become increasingly important in the future as time-intermittent renewable generation resources are incorporated into the grid.  The approach is to leverage the new, wide-area, high-resolution phasor measurement unit monitoring and apply methods and approaches from the fields of nonlinear systems, applied mathematics, statistical physics, and signal analysis to study the dynamics of voltage, power flow, and frequency disturbances on large-scale transmission grids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Studying electro-mechanical wave phenomena in large power systems is a promising new approach that draws on numerous disciplines and will rapidly advance the frontiers of the physics-based understanding and data-driven inference of electrical grid states and fast dynamics. This new understanding will enable the design of smart grid controls to prevent economically-costly cascading grid failures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  New time-intermittent renewable resources create a need for effective ways of discovering how an event in one location is manifested in the rest of the grid.  Electro-mechanical waves provide one such relationship and will be key to early detection of problematic grid behavior and design and activation of advanced control systems to restore reliable operation.  Our project will develop a better fundamental understanding of electrical grid behavior, which will ultimately translate into improved operation, better control, and lowered cost.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The introduction of Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) technology allows for monitoring large-scale electrical transmission and generation systems with unprecedented detail, providing high resolution synchronous measurement of voltage phasors, power flows, at frequency at many locations in the grid. Leveraging this new observational capability, we apply methods and approaches from the fields of nonlinear systems, applied mathematics, statistical physics, and signal analysis to study the dynamics of voltage, power flow, and frequency disturbances on large-scale transmission grids.  These disturbances are excitations of electromechanical waves traveling over the grid that are driven by natural events, protective actions (line openings), or other abrupt changes. By studying spectral properties of the spatio-temporal correlations of these excitations, we aim to reconstruct the state (e.g. network topology) and fast dynamics of the grid. We will explore both passive and active techniques based on the unifying concepts of excitation correlations and response functions including: propagation and interaction of long waves and shocks, effects of spatial inhomogeneity (disorder) in the grid, evaluation of dynamical response functions, model reduction techniques, and transient stability phenomena.      Our research activities during the three years of this project included:  development of static (ordinary differential      equation) and dynamic (partial differential equation) continuum models for      propagation of electromechanical wave disturbances, i.e. propagation of      voltage and frequency disturbances; solution of the static continuum model for      distribution circuits including advanced grid control of new smart grid      devices; solution of the dynamic continuum model for      distribution circuits including high levels of induction motor load;   study of the stability of nonlinearly-coupled      generator frequency dynamics on large transmission grids.        Most Important Findings of the Project are:  Our static analysis of advanced controls for      smart grid devices on distribution grids revealed the new controls can      lead to the emergence of new and potentially dangerous equilibria.  Our new model represents an advance over      existing methods because it enables the prediction and characterization of      all such control-driven equilibria. Solution of our continuum dynamical models      reveals that the presence of large levels of induction motor loads in      distribution circuits of sufficient length leads to complex hysteretic      states dangerous to the electrical grid, i.e. fault-induced delayed      voltage recovery (FIDVR) states.       Our analysis shows that there is a continuum of such FIDVR states      and which state is reached depends on the size and duration of the applied      perturbation (i.e. circuit fault).   Our analysis of stability of electromechanical      frequency waves in nonlinearly-coupled generators yielded new and powerful      dynamical stability criteria for generator frequency synchronization in      large-scale transmission grids.  Our      advance was the prediction of stability of the nonlinearly-coupled grid      via analysis of a related linearly-coupled grid. Our analysis of how to reinforce the power system      by means of the FACTS devices have revealed that placement of the      expansive FACTS devices aimed at reliving congestion of lines can be      sparse.  We have also developed set      of heuristics capable to identify optimal placement of correcting FACTS      efficiently. We have developed new approach based on energy      (Lyapunov)  functions to designing      direct method for efficient test of multiple faults in transmission      systems.  Instead of running      computationally expansive dynamic simulations the tests suggests to solve      a set of convex optimization problems giving yes/no answer to the question      if the system stabilizes after the fau...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
