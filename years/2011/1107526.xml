<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Growing public concerns on the health of the aging civil infrastructures prospered structural health monitoring (SHM) using various sensors. Pinnacle technology on the wireless sensors enabled usage of wireless smart sensor network (WSSN) on the SHM and significantly lowered the entire cost of the network. Although researchers proposed methods to establish reliable WSSN, assuring accurate time synchronization of the wireless network and network communication are challenging features for implementing full scale monitoring of the structure. WSSN currently relies on CPU clock time for time synchronization. However, using PC clocks in particular is not reliable enough due to various effects on crystal tolerance such as calibration and/ or temperature effect. The effect results the network time drift of many mille-seconds.
