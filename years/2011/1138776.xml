<AbstractNarration>The 2011 V. M. Goldschmidt Conference in Prague, Czech Republic will provide an excellent opportunity for young geochemists from US institutions to share their research with the scientific community, learn about cutting edge research taking place around the world, and interact with senior scientists specializing in their specific realm of interest. Thematic issues to be addressed at the conference span a broad range of sub-disciplines in low- and high- temperature geochemistry. In addition to oral and poster presentation sessions, students will have an opportunity to participate in field trips as well as short courses. This proposal puts forth a method for fairly selecting and distributing travel support funds to the a diverse and highly qualified group of student applicants, to ensure that 40 or more have an opportunity to benefit from all the resources to be assembled at the conference. In addition to the funding requested from NSF, the Geochemical Society will contribute $10,000, bringing the total number of student opportunities to 50.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International scientific meetings are the primary networking outlet for researchers of all experience levels. For graduate students, these meetings are often the first opportunity to interact with members of the international scientific community. As the premier international geochemical conference, the Goldschmidt Conference plays a critical role in introducing young researchers to the world of geochemistry beyond their home institutions. The lingering effects of such an international learning and networking experience can be life changing for a graduate student struggling to gain a foothold in the scientific community. The proposed student travel support program will enable the best and brightest students from the US and US Territories, students who might otherwise be unable to attend due to financial constraints at their home institutions, to benefit from all the advantages this meeting has to offer at this turning point in their respective careers. Every effort will be made to encourage women, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities to apply for funding, and to ensure, as much as possible, that the full range of demographic diversity sampled by today's geosciences graduate student community is represented among the awardees. Moreover, ncouraging participation by underrepresented groups in international events such as the Goldschmidt Conference may increase the diversity of the core group of senior geoscientists in the years to come.</AbstractNarration>

Since its inception in 1988, the V. M. Goldschmidt Conference has grown in size and prominence to become the most important and largest annual international gathering of geochemists. The Goldschmidt conference is co-sponsored by the Geochemical Society and European Association of Geochemistry and brings together scientists from around the world to share ideas and present cutting edge research. Students attending the conference have the opportunity to learn about this research, and in presenting their own work, can interact closely with and receive important feedback from expert scientists in their respective disciplines. The Goldschmidt travel grant opportunity was advertised via the web, the Geochemical Society Newsletter and Elements magazine. A total of 305 applications were received, of which 78 were eligible for NSF-sponsored travel grant funds. Funds from the Geochemical Society, the Japanese Geochemical Society and the European Association of Geochemistry were used to fund some of the applicants who were ineligible for NSF funds. A panel of nineteen volunteer reviewers, with expertise in both high and low temperature geochemistry was assembled. Each panelist read and reviewed approximately sixty travel grant applications and scored them using a consistent rubric to evaluate the proposed budget, a required letter of recommendation from a faculty mentor, the submitted technical abstract, a short essay to place the work within a larger context and a CV. Each application was reviewed by a team of three reviewers. The forty funded applicants were 50% female and 50% male. Two of the awardees were undergraduate students, five were masters students and the remaining thirty-three were doctoral candidates. Students came from public and private institutions in seventeen states. Each student received $1000 of supplementary travel funding. Although insufficient to cover the full cost of conference attendance (early registration and abstract fees, food/lodging for 5-6 nights and airfare to Prague from the U.S., estimated at $2500-3000 depending on point of origin), the funds did defray a significant portion of attendance costs. Students receiving funds were required to return a survey detailing their experiences at the conference. Students reported that they learned a great deal from the conference, interacted with many peers and professional scientists and were generally inspired to continue their studies and careers in STEM. <br /><br /></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/11/2012<br>      Modified by: Carla&nbsp;Koretsky</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
