<AbstractNarration>Partial differential equations are used in a wide variety of applications as&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models. Their numerical solution is, consequently, of prime&lt;br/&gt;importance for the accurate simulation and optimization of processes in the&lt;br/&gt;sciences, engineering, and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;The last decade saw the emergence of large and successful libraries that&lt;br/&gt;support such applications. While these libraries provide most of what such&lt;br/&gt;codes need for small-scale computations, many realistic applications yield&lt;br/&gt;problems of hundreds of millions or billions of unknowns and require clusters&lt;br/&gt;with thousands of processor cores, but there is currently little generic&lt;br/&gt;support for such problems, limiting access to the many large publicly&lt;br/&gt;supported computing facilities to experts in computational science and&lt;br/&gt;excluding scientists from many fields for whom computational simulation would&lt;br/&gt;be a useful tool.  This project intends to build the software infrastructure that will allow a&lt;br/&gt;wide cross section of scientists to utilize these large resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project intends to support the software infrastructure for the&lt;br/&gt;large-scale solution of partial differential equations on massively parallel&lt;br/&gt;computational resources in a generic way. It will build on two of the most&lt;br/&gt;successful libraries for scientific computing, the finite element library&lt;br/&gt;deal.II, and Trilinos that provides the parallel linear algebra capabilities&lt;br/&gt;for the former. Specifically, we will: (i) Make support for massively parallel&lt;br/&gt;computations ubiquitous in deal.II; (ii) Research and develop seamless support&lt;br/&gt;for problems with billions of unknowns in both libraries and improve the&lt;br/&gt;interaction between the two; (iii) Exploit intra-node parallelism on today's&lt;br/&gt;clusters; (iv) Ensure the applicability of our work on a broad basis by&lt;br/&gt;implementing two real-world applications. &lt;br/&gt;Both deal.II and Trilinos have large, active and diverse developer and user&lt;br/&gt;communities, and this project will actively engage these communities through&lt;br/&gt;user meetings, short courses, regularly taught classes, mailing lists, and&lt;br/&gt;direct contact in focused projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported research and development of new capabilities in two widely used scientific software environments: deal.II and Trilinos.  deal.II uses Trilinos to solve large systems of equation that are generated by deal.II as it provides high-fidelity solutions to partial differential equations on scalable computers.  This project supported efforts to enable solution of linear systems larger than two billion equations.   Specific efforts on this project were exploration of high-performance computing using modern C++ expressions using templates and compile-time polymorphism.  These efforts informed design choices in Trilinos. This project also explored and developed container-based workflows using Docker that led to new scientific workflows and the first containerized versions of Trilinos capabilities.   Another impact of this project was the establishment of a healthy parallel computing capability at the college, which will persist for several years and enable further parallel computing research at the institution.   In addition to the specific scientific objectives, this project funded the research efforts of six undergraduate students, exposing these students for the first time to a scientific research experience.  Five of these students completed honors theses and another is in preparation.  Three students used their research experience to obtain a summer internship at US Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories.  The same three students have gone on to graduate school and another expects to do graduate studies in the coming fall after a summer internship with the DOE.  As undergraduates, these students were not aware of scientific computing research. This project exposed them to a new way of learning and new topics.  The research experience provided by this project has directed these students on a career path that will benefit the scientific community for years to come.
