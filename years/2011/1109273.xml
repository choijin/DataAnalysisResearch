<AbstractNarration>This award will support an observational study of widely separated binary stars consisting of a white dwarf and a cool unevolved (type M) dwarf.  It has been known for decades that M stars show many signs of magnetic activity, such as chromospheric emission lines, and that the activity declines as the stars age.  This study will use the white dwarfs to determine the age of each binary system, and study binaries over a wide age range to explore the age/activity relation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is also expected to address issues of habitability on exoplanets around M dwarfs and to provide new information on the evolution of stellar populations in our Milky Way galaxy.</AbstractNarration>

We found that most red dwarfs with close white dwarf companions that are separated by less than ~50 astronomical units (au; the Earth is 1 au from the Sun) are more likely to be magnetically active, have stronger high-energy emission, and flare more frequently than their single red dwarf counterparts. This trend likely applies to all red dwarfs that have close companions and not simply those in a binary with a white dwarf.  We think that this increase in magnetic activity is due to the companion destroying or disrupting the disk of material that surrounded the red dwarf when it was younger, which many astronomers think is critical to slowing down the rotation of the star. Therefore, the red dwarf in a close binary system does not slow down as quickly as a single star. A quickly rotating star creates a stronger magnetic field and stronger (and longer lasting) magnetic activity.  This result has important consequences for the rotation and magnetic activity evolution of stars and plays a critical role in understanding the habitability and potential for life on planets that orbit close binary systems, which might be affected by large stellar flares and high-energy radiation.  We also constructed a sample of more than 200 binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red dwarf that are separated by more than 100 au.  We used the white dwarfs to determine the ages of the systems (white dwarfs cool in a predictable way) and examine how the magnetic activity of the red dwarf evolves over time.  We found some evidence for a trend showing that red dwarfs have less magnetic activity as they age. Further investigation of this age-activity relation will allow us to assign rough ages to red dwarfs based on their levels of magnetic activity throughout the Galaxy, particularly for older stars that were previously difficult to date.  While working on the scientific goals of the project, we accomplished our broader impact goals by working with the Boston University Upward Bound Math and Science program.  Upward Bound identifies and works with underrepresented high school students and gives them the skills, experience and confidence to be successful in college.  The Upward Bound Math and Science program works specifically with students who are interested in careers in science and technical fields.  For four consecutive summers, our research group worked with Upward Bound students, twice hosting two students in our lab to work on science projects, and twice organizing three full-day lab experiences for a large group of Upward Bound students.
