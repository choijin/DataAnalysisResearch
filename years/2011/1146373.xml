<AbstractNarration>Gene networks are fundamental to animal development, and though the complexity of these networks has been mapped in model organisms, the critical connection between network evolution and organismal diversity remains unclear. This project provides a unique perspective to these complex biological networks by investigating how new fruit fly pigmentation patterns were achieved through the modification of connections between pivotal members of a pigmentation gene network. Using candidate gene and genome-scale approaches it will be determined how a key regulatory protein is connected to and thereby controls the utilization of a battery of target genes necessary to make a pigmentation pattern. Furthermore, by comparing network connections between both related species and populations within a species that exhibit different pigmentation patterns it will be revealed how these connections evolved and the network effects resulting from natural variation in the production of this key regulatory protein.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An enhanced understanding of this model gene network will aid both the evolutionary and developmental biology communities in the construction and testing of hypotheses as to how other gene networks operate and have changed to control diverse traits in diverse lineages. Moreover, these outcomes bear upon the human condition as genetic differences in the DNA sequences connecting regulatory proteins to their target genes is a major yet poorly understood cause of variation between individuals. This project will achieve numerous broader impacts, including: training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, the development of both lab exercises for high school biology curricula and research experiences for high school students, and interactions at University symposia and on visitations to area High Schools with non-scientific students and teachers to communicate the contributions of evolutionary developmental biology to modern scientific thought and the value of scientific research to society.</AbstractNarration>
