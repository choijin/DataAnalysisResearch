<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Intersections of Biology and Mathematical and Physical Sciences. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow at the intersection of biology with mathematics and statistics. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Julie Jedicka is "Prey selection by high order predators: modeling Western Bluebird foraging in patchy environments." The host institution for this research is University of California, Berkeley with sponsoring scientists Drs. Rodrigo Almeida, Perry de Valpine and Wayne Getz. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insectivorous birds are ubiquitous, multi-trophic-level predators, whose ecological function is poorly understood, primarily because their consumption patterns elude researchers due to their high mobility and predation of relatively small organisms. This research develops novel experimental techniques that quantify the prey of a model predator, the Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana). Diet is analyzed through fecal DNA of nestling and adult bluebirds foraging in patchy environments. By pairing these data with arthropod availability in the field and prey consumed, customized mathematical models are being developed drawing from hierarchical statistical models, dynamic state variable models, and a biomass transformation approach to model populations in food webs.  The scientific payoff includes interdisciplinary techniques for quantifying foraging niches not previously attainable and for understanding the ecological consequences of high order predator extinctions or exotic invasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include gaining expertise in mathematical modeling and statistics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this research include outreach to diverse student groups through workshops and existing programs to broaden participation.  Mathematical models and sequence data are being made available on the web and through existing open databases.</AbstractNarration>
