<AbstractNarration>Vision is a critically important medium of communication.  Students are continuously bombarded with images on television, cell phones and during instruction.  Although well-designed images can facilitate learning, poorly designed images can hinder learning. This project tests the hypothesis that appropriately designed visual cues provided on physics problems, can improve students physics problem solving skills.  This project strengthens an existing partnership between a cognitive psychologist mentor and physics education researcher mentee to test the above hypothesis through a sequence of two studies with a total of 150 participants enrolled in introductory algebra-based physics courses. An expert panel of two cognitive psychologists and a physics education researcher serve as the Advisory Board and external evaluators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The studies extend ongoing work over the past two years.  The first study identifies differences in the eye movements of 20 experts and 50 novices enrolled in introductory algebra-based physics while solving physics problems with diagrams.  Each participant solves 20 conceptual problems in introductory physics, each of which includes a diagram whose spatial structure is intimately connected to the problem's solution.  The study will measure the total duration of eye-fixations in the areas of the diagram that are relevant to the solution as well as those that are irrelevant to the solution, but salient for other reasons. This tests the hypothesis that the experts will focus on the relevant areas and the novices will tend to focus on the irrelevant areas of the problem.  The second study tests the hypothesis that appropriate visual cueing to change the eye movements of novices can improve their problem solving performance.  One hundred participants with an appropriate level of physics knowledge are selected from students enrolled in algebra-based physics.  Each participant is shown 10 physics problems on which largest expert novice differences are observed in the first study.  First, each participant solves the problem, and if unable to do so correctly, she is given a practice problem which is similar to the initial problem.  If she solves the practice problem correctly, she is shown a different problem.  One half of the participants receive visual cues overlaid on the practice problem, while the other half do not.  The study compares the problem solving performance of each group to test the hypothesis.  Two graduate students whose dissertation research focuses on visual cueing will work on this project under the guidance of the principal investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is one of the first of its kind to explore and exploit the link between cognition and eye movements in the context of physics problem solving.  Although this project focuses on problem solving in physics, the results of the research have implications for learning in other STEM disciplines where the use of images is important.  Beyond its immediate scope, the project will benefit the field of physics education research by infusing ideas from cognitive psychology regarding visual cueing into physics education research,  It will also potentially change the ways visual media are used in physics and other STEM instruction to more effectively facilitate students' learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vision is a critically important medium of communication.  Students are continuously bombarded with images on television, cell phones and during instruction.  Research has shown that although well-designed images can facilitate learning, poorly designed ones can increase diffculty  Recent research has explored using visual cues -- shapes or lines that are overlaid on a diagram to focus learnersÆ attention on relevant areas of instructional imagery.  Such results suggest that by having learners attend to the correct visual elements in a problem, they begin to think about those elements, leading them to formulate the correct solution to the problem.  In this project we tested the overarching hypothesis: Visual cueing in physics problems with a strong visuospatial component can facilitate correct problem solving.  This project strengthen an existing partnership between a cognitive psychologist mentor (co-P.I. Loschky) and physics education researcher mentee (P.I. Rebello) to test the above hypothesis through a sequence of  studies with participants enrolled in introductory college physics courses.   The studies build on our ongoing work over the past two years.  Study 1 identifies differences in the eye movements of experts and novices while solving physics problems with diagrams.   Study 2 determines whether manipulating novicesÆ eye movements on training problems using visual cueing can facilitate solving transfer problems. Study 3 investigated the effect of providing both visual cues and outcome feedback i.e. telling students whether they are correct or incorrect.   Results of the studies above indicated that:  There is indeed a difference between how experts and novices look at the diagram in a problem. While solving a problem experts tend to focus on the thematically relevant areas of the diagram, while novices focus on the perceptually salient areas, which may lead them to incorrect reasoning and the wrong solution to the problem.  Providing short duration visual cues shows promise in shifting novices' visual attention and thereby improving their problem solving performance.  However, when the participants are not told that the cues might be helpful, they are likely not to benefit from them. Telling participants that the cues are meant to help them solve the problem, and furthermore telling them whether their initial answer and reasoning are correct or incorrect, along with showing them visual cues can greatly improve their problem solving performance, not just on the problems on which the cues are provided, but also on subsequent problems, which are based on the same concept, but have different features, even when no cues are provided.      Intellectual Merit:  (i)     This project was one of the first of its kind to explore and exploit the link between cognition and eye movements in the context of physics problem solving.  (ii)   Further, the project enabled the mentee (Rebello) and his research group to expand their knowledge of the field of cognitive psychology, specifically visual cognition, thus promoting future collaborations between mentor (Loschky) and mentee (Rebello).  Broader Impact:  Beyond its immediate scope, the project will:  (i)     benefit the field of physics education research by infusing ideas from cognitive psychology regarding visual cueing into physics education research,  (ii)   potentially change the ways visual media are used in physics instruction to more effectively facilitate studentsÆ learning, and  (iii) build human capital in the field of physics education research by training faculty and graduate students in the knowledge and skills of cognitive psychology applied to their field.
