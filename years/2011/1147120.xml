<AbstractNarration>This project examines the fundamental dynamics of persistent low-level atmospheric flows which are found along the slopes of mountain ranges and other topographic features.  Important examples include the Great Plains low-level jet, the South American low-level jet on the east side of the Andes, and the low-level jet found along the coast of Chile and Peru.  The central hypothesis of the project is that topographic low-level jets form due to the elevated solar heating that occurs along the topographic features.  More specifically, an inversion technique will be developed to determine the wind and atmospheric mass fields in the vicinity of topography through inversion of the potential vorticity anomalies generated by solar heating.  The technique is developed in isentropic coordinates and accounts for the intersection of the topography and the isentropic surfaces, which bend downward toward the topography due to solar heating.  The method will be used to understand features of the low-level jets including speed and elevation, and to provide a dynamical framework for interpreting the results of complex state-of-the-art numerical simulations.  The analysis will be applied to a number of low-level topographic jets, and to other problems including the onset of the Asian monsoon and its relationship to elevated heating on the Tibetan plateau, the Caribbean low-level jet, and flows near ice sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has societal relevance due to the importance of low-level jets for regional climate.  For example, the Great Plains low-level jet is responsible for a substantial portion of the moisture transport into the eastern half United States which sustains agriculture.  In addition, the project will support and train two graduate students, thereby developing the future scientific workforce in this research area.  Finally, the inversion methods developed in this project will be made available to researchers in atmospheric dynamics through software codes, so that they can be applied to a wide array of scientific problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are many interesting aspects of the atmospheric flow in the  Antarctic region. One is the prevalence of Antarctic katabatic winds, which  are winds that flow down ice-covered slopes cooled by radiative processes,  as shown in the attached figure. These katabatic winds merge with  coastal easterlies, forming a topographically bound low-level jet  surrounding  Antarctica.  We have developed a mathematical theory of low-level  jets that are bound to topographic features such as Antarctica, the Andes,  the Rockies, and the Himalayas.   Our goal has been to develop a unified  view of the role of such low-level jets in the atmospheric general  circulation  and in the climate system. The Antarctic low-level jet is particularly  interesting because the winds are so strong, with the region near  Cape Denison (Adelie Land) experiencing nearly continuous 60-80  mile per hour winds (the windiest place on the surface of the earth).  This research has a broader impact on understanding  the role of low-level Antarctic flow in the annual variation of sea ice  and in the production of dense ocean water just under the sea ice.  It is this dense water that flows downward and outward from Antarctica and becomes the ocean's dense bottom water, a slowly varying part of earth's climate system.
