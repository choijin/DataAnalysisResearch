Yet, between these environments are transition zones such as estuaries, in which complex processes inhibit our understanding of how terrestrial and marine environments communicate.

A small model estuary in New Zealand, the Matapouri Estuary, was selected for its ease of access and in which previous work had been conducted. My MasterÆs work at Rutgers University, U.S.A., utilizes geochemical methods including organic biomarkers and stable carbon isotopes to fingerprint sources of carbon, while Dr. Gillian LewisÆ lab at the University of Auckland uses novel microbiological methods to fingerprint microbial communities. A field sampling strategy was designed to accommodate both methods in parallel and sampling was conducted at high tide and low tide to fully characterize the "phases" of the estuary.  While at the University of Auckland, I learned the methods the Lewis lab uses to characterize microbial communities, which included extracting DNA from each water sample, conducting PCR to isolate and amplify portions of the bacterial genome, and assessing the distribution of DNA fragments, indicative of the bacterial diversity in the sample (using both ARISA and tRFLP methods).
