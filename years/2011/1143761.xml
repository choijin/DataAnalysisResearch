<AbstractNarration>There is growing interest in the use of information and communication technologies for community engagement and for crowd-sourcing solutions to difficult problems through challenges and prizes.  Governmental and nongovernmental organizations are being encouraged to design, deploy, manage and support appropriate online platforms to address both goals and improve economic competitiveness.  These governance challenge platforms can create novel pathways for citizen participation, increase openness of governance activities, and increase both the effectiveness and legitimacy of the governing organization.   Arizona State University is developing a new University-wide challenge platform to enhance community engagement and to solicit ideas from its 50,000-member University community to solve eight broad challenges, but little is known about the design, use and effects of such platforms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will engage the platform design team to incorporate the affordances required to improve the overall user experience and to test applicable theories of team composition, governance structures, legitimacy, and team capacity and commitment.  Once these features have been developed, they will be used in a series of field studies designed to identify theoretical extensions and potential boundary conditions in online community engagement. The studies will initially map community participation, trace how participation spreads through the community, and test the effects of real-time feedback on the community?s participation patterns. The next phase will explore the impact of voting mechanisms on community dynamics, on perceptions of governance accountability, and on more sophisticated forms of community involvement.   Finally, relationships between team formation, structure, diversity and effectiveness will be investigated focusing on the quality of the solutions generated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Summary: This project sought to build upon the growing interest in the use of Internet platforms using challenges and prize to encourage community engagement and use crowdsourcing to generated solutions to difficult governance problems. These "governance challenge platforms" can create generate novel forms of citizen participation, increase the openness of governance, and increase both the effectiveness and legitimacy of the governing organization.  Arizona State University has developed a new University-wide challenge platform to enhance community engagement and to solicit ideas from its 50,000-member University community and the broader public. 10,000 Solutions (http://10000Solutions.org) is a participatory challenge platform designed to solicit solutions in eight challenge categories: education; technology; communities; sustainability; economy; health; human rights; and discovery.

The winner of the $10,000 grand prize, SafeSIPP, developed a technology to address transportation and purification of drinking water in the developing world.

The new many-to-many platform design enables public participation in the virtual and physical world oriented towards creating a community that contributes both to the development and implementation of ideas that improve the social good. While the number of platforms such as 10,000 Solutions has grown in recent years, little is known about the design, use and effects of such platforms.

Finally, relationships between team formation, structure, diversity and effectiveness were investigated focusing on the quality of the solutions generated. Research and Education Activities: Our work has focused on (a) studying the patterns of use and participation on the platform over time, (b) running computer simulations studying network dynamics of groups with different compositions and interests, and (c) preparing for a redesign of the 10,000 Solutions platform that launched in September 2013 and increased functionality and provides a wider array of activities that can occur simultaneously on the platform. 10,000 solutions was also used during the project period as a interactive example and activity for undergraduate and graduate courses in Public Administration.
