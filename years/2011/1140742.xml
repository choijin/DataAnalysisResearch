<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;Exploring Science in the Studio is expanding a pedagogical approach that embeds science into courses in the fine arts, design, architecture, and creative writing.  The project is engaged in developing and disseminating new pedagogical approaches and non-lab based instructional materials to deliver science content to humanities students. The outputs will be specially-designed and produced mobile units for scientific exploration.  These mobile units will provide a replicable and scalable process for bringing science instructional materials directly into classrooms at colleges that do not have stand-alone science departments or facilities. This project has two goals: 1) To enable students in such colleges to understand the transferability of scientific methods of inquiry and knowledge to their practices in art, design, and writing; and 2) To help the humanities faculties in these colleges to integrate science into their teaching on the topic of sustainability.  Sustainability is the science focus because of its substantial breadth, and because problems arising from climate change and the need for increased sustainability in the use of natural resources will be increasingly addressed by teams of individuals who contribute not only scientific knowledge, but creativity and innovation. Artists and designers have important roles to play on such teams.</AbstractNarration>

The system evolved from our identification of several needs for the science materials (storage, access, and display) as well as several dichotomies in the nature of the intended materials: tiny/large, cheap/valuable, fragile/durable, light/heavy, mobile/stationary, field use/classroom use. The units are available to any CCA faculty member or student who attends training workshops on their use. The CCA library provides a permanent storage, display, and work site for the school&rsquo;s science materials, centralizing these resources in a location utilized by students and faculty from all of CCA&rsquo;s 21 undergraduate and 13 graduate majors.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   "Exploring Science in the Studio" examined science education in the context of an art and design college, the California College of the Arts (CCA). The findings of the project are transferable to comparably sized colleges of art and design with a similar range of programs, majors and areas of focus as well as to other interdisciplinary areas of undergraduate science education at colleges and universities in general. The project was successful in establishing vital infrastructure toward achieving two goals:    The project had two goals:   To enable students in such colleges to understand the transferability of scientific methods of inquiry and knowledge to their practices in art, design, and writing; and   To help the studio faculties in these colleges to integrate science into their teaching and to enrich the materials and equipment available to science and other faculty.   "Exploring Science in the Studio" featured three components:   Science in the Studio (SitS) Courses featuring collaborations among art and design studio faculty and scientists   MUSE System (Mobile Units for Scientific Exploration) for use within art and design studios   Symposium to share findings among members of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) and greater university community   1.
