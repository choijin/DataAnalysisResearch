<AbstractNarration>Quantum chemistry can provide highly accurate results for arbitrary  molecular systems, making it a vital component in many different  disciplines such as materials science, biology, physics, chemical  engineering, mechanical engineering, environmental science, geology,  and others.  It is particularly critical in  the rational design of drugs, catalysts, organic  electronics, nanostructured materials, and other designed materials.  Because of their steep computational costs, quantum  chemistry codes must exploit parallel computing and must constantly  adapt to rapidly changing high performance computing technologies.  This creates a significant barrier for the adoption of new technologies into quantum chemistry codes.  Our project involves the development of a parallel, highly reusable library for advanced numerical approximations in quantum chemistry.  This will be the first  unified library of such techniques, designed for high performance and  also reusability by independent research groups.   The PANACHE (PArallel  Numerical Approximations in CHemistry Engine) library will fill this need.   To maximize its impact, PANACHE is being designed to be used by multiple quantum chemistry software packages. PANACHE dramatically speeds up quantum computations, making it much easier to gain insight into a wide array of problems, from studies of reaction mechanisms in catalysis to the design of improved organic photoelectronic devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our highly interdisciplinary project (involving two theoretical chemists and one computational scientist as co-PI?s) provides excellent opportunities for training graduate students and postdocs in the areas of numerical methods, high-performance computing, quantum mechanics, and computational chemistry. Computer code resulting from this project will be released as freely-available open-source software, enabling its use with any other software package.  Workshops on the new software will be held to introduce these new tools to other software developers, and online training material and graduate course material will be developed to improve education in the use of numerical methods in computational science and quantum chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award pertains to the Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) solicitation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computational chemistry is the field that describes molecules using computational models.  It is widely used in chemistry, biology, materials science, chemical physics, drug design, and many other fields.  When using models based on quantum mechanics ("quantum chemistry"), molecules can be modeled rather accurately.  However, the computations can take a very long time to run, and may be impossible for very large molecules. There are various numerical techniques (going by technical names like density-fitting, Cholesky decomposition, and Laplace energy denominators) that have shown great promise at speeding up quantum chemistry methods, but it takes a substantial amount of computer programming effort to take existing codes and adapt them to use these techniques.  Our project addressed this challenge by providng a set of highly optimized, reusable software libraries providing the aforementioned kinds of advanced numerical techniques.  We also developed optimized libraries to compute Coulomb and Exchange matrices, which frequently appear in quantum chemistry models.  With our libraries as building blocks, it becomes much easier for quantum chemsitry programmers to utilize these new techniques.   The new libraries were written in the C++ computer programming language, and made accessible also to the Python programming language.  They were tested and released as open-source software through the Psi4 project (http://www.psicode.org).  They have already been used by our team and otehrs to develop or improve several quantum chemistry methods and computer programs.  In several cases, the methods developed with our tools are the very first publicly available versions of standard methods adapted to use these newer techniques such as density fitting (for example, we published the first density-fitted coupled-cluster gradient codes). Our libraries greatly accelerated the development of these new features, and reduced the lag time between theoretical innovations and usable software products for computational chemistry.  The new modeling tools developed with the help of our software libraries show great promise for providing accurate results with faster computation times.  With the help of our libraries, we developed the fastest available software for a method called symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), which computes the strength of the interaction between two molecules.  We also used our libraries to extend the SAPT method to provide interaction energies between various fragments of molecules.  This, in turn, provides much insight into how drug molecules bind to their protein targets.  Using SAPT software deveveloped with the help of this grant, we were able to unravel a mystery about why certain drugs inhibiting factor Xa (a protein in the drug coagulation cascade) are more effective than others (see Figure).  This work is published in Chemistry: A European Journal, 23, 7887-7890 (2017).       Last Modified: 09/14/2017       Submitted by: Charles D Sherrill]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
