<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposal is to develop mathematical theory of decision making under uncertainty based on multiple models. How the different views should be combined to arrive at decisions rapidly and accurately at any instant is addressed. Past efforts were based on having a sufficiently large number of experts and basing the current decision on the one proven most successful in the short term. In contrast to such approaches, the proposal deals with novel procedures, in which the decisions of all the experts are weighted to choose the action at any instant. The weights, in turn, depend upon the recent short term performance of all the participants. Simulation studies have indicated that the new approach results in significantly faster and more accurate decisions, and that the latter are more robust even under rapidly changing environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology investigated in the proposal will be applicable to a very large class of problems. In particular, the new technique will find application in Cyber-Physical systems in which vast amounts of data are collected by numerous sensors, and networking problems in which distributed decision makers have to make critical choices in real time. The results obtained from the investigations will be widely disseminated by the PI and his co-workers in national and international conference, and in specialized workshops held at Yale. More importantly, undergraduates will be trained by the PI, both during the academic year and during the summers, in the mathematical foundations of the approach as well as in their application to practical problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Accuracy and speed are two attributes that are commonly sought after whether individuals or machines are required to make decisions. In addition, when uncertainties of different kinds are present, it is generally expected that the decisions are not affected significantly, and this is referred to as "robustness" of the decision process.  The research carried out during the past three years was concerned with investigating whether multiple decision makers can make "better" decisions than any single decision maker. Qualitatively, one can raise the question whether consulting many doctors to decide whether or not to have surgery, many stock brokers to buy a stock or not, or many friends to choose a neighborhood to live in are better than consulting merely one doctor, one broker, or one friend in the cases cited. While most people believe that this is indeed true, the research, through theory and simulation studies, demonstrated that this is the case. Perhaps more relevant is the fact that quantitative reasons can be given for the conclusions arrived at.  From a practical standpoint, the results indicate that systems can be made to perform significantly more rapidly and accurately by using multiple models.  The improvement in performance over single models also increases with the complexity of the problem.       Last Modified: 11/18/2014       Submitted by: Kumpati S Narendra]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
