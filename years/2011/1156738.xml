<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at University of Memphis. The REU Program will bring ten students to campus for ten weeks each summer for an intensive research experience. These students will synthesize materials with varied properties and potential applications. Theoretical studies of these materials and their properties will complement experimental studies. Other research examples include the synthesis, characterization, and theoretical investigation of bistable photochromic materials for development as optical switches or optical memory devices, the synthesis and characterization of gold nanoparticles for single-cell biosensor applications, and the development and characterization of water-soluble analogs of G protein-coupled receptors, an important class of membrane proteins. The membrane-protein studies would enable alternative strategies for studying the structure and activation mechanisms of this important class of receptors. Results from these and other proposed projects will be disseminated through publications and presentations. Travel funds for REU participants will allow presentations at national and regional meetings during the year following their research experience. An important addition to the current recruiting plan is an expanded effort to enable the participation of students who are parents in this intensive research experience. Therefore, this REU site will broadly impact training in chemistry, the participation of underrepresented minorities, and student parent participation in chemical research. The REU Site will also promote partnerships between the University of Memphis and regional HBCU institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This REU program provided full-time mentored research experiences to 36 undergraduate chemistry students over a three-year period, a substantial impact on the human capital available in chemistry.  While many of these students are completing their bachelor's degrees, several of those that have completed their undergraduate training have elected to pursue graduate studies and research careers.  A well-education scientific workforce is essential to economic development and public health.  Research performed by the participants in the REU program can be grouped into three major themes, energy and environmental research, materials research, and biochemical research.  Key accomplishments in the energy and environmental research area include preparation and characterization of improved catalysts for solar-driven clean energy production from water, preparation and characterization of proton exchange membranes needed for more commercially viable hydrogen fuel cells, as well as improved guidance for water treatment plants regarding minimization of contamination from water disinfection processes.  Key outcomes from the materials research theme include the progress toward functionalized nanoparticles for use in photodynamic therapy for cancer treatments, and the materials described previously with impact on clean energy production.  Key outcomes from the biochemical research theme include improved understanding of the structure and likely signaling partners of receptor proteins that are implicated in human diseases ranging from AlzheimerÃ†s disease to cancer.  Protein structures are critical guides to the development of clinically useful drugs that may have future impact on human health.
