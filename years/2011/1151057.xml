<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Dongmao Zhang and his group at Mississippi State University (MSU) are exploring and developing an innovative, accurate, ultra-sensitive, and reproducible analytical method for quantification of protein carbonyl, the widely accepted biomarker of protein oxidative damage. Specific objectives of this work are 1) the design and synthesis of a pair of Rhodamine dye derivatives for use as SERS labels of protein carbonyls.  2) the determination of the sensitivity, accuracy, reproducibility, and dynamic range of the SERS based protein carbonyl quantification technique.  3) the experimental and computational investigation of the effect of peptide and protein conjugation on adsorption, aggregation and the SERS activity of the labeling dyes.   In addition, the sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility of the SERS method will be compared with the two most popular bioanalytical methods: mass spectroscopy and fluorescence.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary educational goals of the proposal are: 1) to continue engaging and mentoring undergraduate students in cross-disciplinary research in Dr. Zhang's lab from both Mississippi State University (the PI's home university) and Mississippi University for Women, a nearby non-PhD granting institution and 2) to help attract Mississippi high school students into STEM areas by partnering with a nearby high school that has a high drop-out and low college-attendance rate.  By participating in the proposed research, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will gain valuable experience in the area of nanoparticle interfacial interactions and optical spectroscopy.   In an effort to enhance chemistry education in the partner high school, The PI and his group will assist the partner high school chemistry teacher in setting-up a teaching laboratory, to design and deliver chemistry experiments.  The undergraduate student and high school student researchers in the PI's lab will share their college and research experience with their peers in the partner high school in order to inspire high school students to pursue careers in STEM areas.   The learning from this long-term college/high school partnership will be shared nationwide through national conferences and/or journal publication.  Dr. Zhang hopes to stimulate more creative ideas to promote education in less developed regions.  Progress of the research and educational activities supported by this award will be made public on the PI's research website at http://www.chemistry.msstate.edu/people/faculty/detail.php?faculty=zhang</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has supported three consecutive annual two-week's high school student chemistry summer camps that has benefited a of toal of 30 plus students. The students have exposed to a variety of stimulting chemistry experiments that are related to their life experience.  A total of five graduate students partial supported by this project all have successfully obtained their PhD degrees and employed by FDA, University of Michigan, and others.   The financial support has produced a total of fourty-two peer-reviewed articles in the journals including Nano Letters, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, Analytical Chemistry, and Journal of Physical Chemistry C, and a few other jounrals.     The most signficant innovation enabled by this project is the Polarized resonance synchronous spectroscopic method recently invented by our research group.  This method has for the first time addressed a complex interplay of material photon absorption, scattering, and fluorescence emission that can concurrently occur in many realiest samples.  This technique is capable of providing infomration that is difficult to obtain or totally inaccessible before. This includes material light scattering cross-sections and scattering depolarizations, quantitative decoupling of material light scattering and fluorescence emission that occurs at the same wavelength as the excitation lights.  The published new findings enabled by this novel spectroscopic technique include the strong correlation between molecule and nanoparticle geometry with their light scattering depolarization, and the drastic difference betweeen material light scattering extinction and absorption extinction in their inner filter effect.
