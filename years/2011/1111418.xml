<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry, the Atmospheric Chemistry program of the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) will support the collaborative research program of Prof. Franz Geiger of Northwestern University and Prof. Scot Martin of Harvard University. Professor Geiger, Professor Martin, and their students will combine laboratory and field experiments to test the hypothesis that just like the two hands of one person can use string to produce chiral string figures, the oxidation of chiral biogenic volatile organic compounds can produce chiral organic material in atmospheric particles, with important effects on further chemical reactivity and physical properties. The two research groups will use an environmental chamber to synthesize and analyze chiral secondary organic material from mixes of chiral biogenic volatile organic compounds under well-controlled tropospherically relevant conditions. Climate-related properties of the newly formed secondary organic material will be investigated as a function of the stereoisomeric mix in the gas phase and correlated with the chemical composition and chirality of the organic material using nonlinear optical chemical imaging and nonlinear optical laser spectroscopy. Laboratory model studies will be benchmarked against chemical composition, size distribution, and origin of organic aerosol particles collected in the central Amazon Basin, which features pristine conditions with minimal anthropogenic input. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying chiral aerosol chemistry has the potential to allow for the discovery of fundamentally new aerosol processes, which could help improve the prediction of radiative forcing of the climate system. Chiral atmospheric stereochemistry could also be developed towards a chiral marker to distinguish, for instance, burning fossil fuels from burning forests. This could potentially transform current methods for source apportionment of biogenic vs. anthropogenic emissions, which are commonly based on costly isotope analysis. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to students, including to members of under-represented groups, who wish to pursue a professional scientific career in an area of great societal importance.</AbstractNarration>

The SFG spectra were shown to originate from the particle/air interface, while interfaces internal to the particles, and the particle/substrate interface, contribute minimally. SFG spectra of SOA particles prepared at the HFR, the HEC, and those obtained in Southern Finland in the sub-1-mm (PM1) size range indicate the following: &alpha;-pinene-rich air yields SOA particles that can be described in terms of their surface composition as being similar to the surfaces of &alpha;-pinene-derived model SOA particles in the PM1 size range. Further studies, including some from the Amazon rain forest, revealed an SFG limit of detection of just 20 ng on the collection filter, or 10 pg in the 30 mm laser spot, within 2 minutes. SFG signals from the SOA particles were shown to be sensitive to RH, and particle viscosities were determined for suspended particles for the first time. We also found that the SFG spectra obtained from the surfaces of SOA particles collected in the central region of the Amazon rain forest, where isoprene dominates the chemical composition in air, are dissimilar to those obtained from isoprene-derived SOA particles formed at the HEC. Yet, the SFG responses produced by the field-collected particles are largely size-invariant throughout the climate-relevant fine mode. Related work showed that 10 mM trans-b-IEPOX in 1M (NH4)2SO4 droplets lowers a particle?s critical supersaturation ratio for CCN activity by 8% (one of the largest reductions reported thus far), and that IEPOX isomers account for ~half of the loss of gas phase species during SOA particle growth from isoprene oxidation. SFG spectroscopy and interfacial tension measurements indicate that the tetraols and epoxides surveyed reside in the particle bulk, whereas trans-b-IEPOX resides at the particle surface.  Broader Impacts. Since 2012, we have been making our SOA precursor molecules available to the broader community by announcements at the ACS, AGU, and GRC meetings, and have shared samples with the Goldstein (Berkeley), Nizkorodov (Irvine), McNeill (Columbia), and Bertram (Vancouver) groups.
