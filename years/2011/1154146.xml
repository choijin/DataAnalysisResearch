<AbstractNarration>The Student Integrated Internal Research Experience or SIIRE program at the University of Arkansas is providing financial support for financially needy and talented students studying a variety of engineering disciplines. The program is serving 15 undergraduate and graduate students per year and provides leveraged scholarship support, a cohort of students focused on engineering research initiatives, integrated one-on-one faculty and industry mentoring, industry driven research topics and coursework that will produce graduates with both Bachelor and Master degrees in 5.5 years. The program addresses industrial needs using an innovative company-sponsored work experience that improves the way students and faculty interact with industry and the way industry perceives Engineers with advanced degrees.</AbstractNarration>

The NSF S-STEM program provides student scholarship funds to encourage and enable academically talented but financially needy students to complete STEM degrees and enter the workforce. The SIIRE project addressed NSF?s programmatic goals by providing a guided pathway to a graduate engineering degree for STEM engineering majors. The scholarship funds defrayed student educational costs during their sophomore, junior, and senior years of undergraduate study and during 1.5 years of their graduate studies and reduced one of the key barriers to successfully completing a STEM degree.  SIIRE is based on leading talented students to the realization that graduate education is within their reach. Not only did it mitigate financial barriers to obtaining a graduate degree but also emphasized developing a cohort of students via shared enrichment activities that have been shown to improve retention and graduation rates.  The SIIRE program has been extremely successful. Over 90% of SIIRE participants attributed the program for increasing their awareness of graduate school. 85% attributed SIIRE with increasing their awareness of the importance of completing their engineering degree, and half said it was an important factor in completing their degree.  92% responded that after participating in SIIRE they were more likely to encourage others to attend graduate school.  Of SIIRE B.S. graduates, 45% continued with graduate school compared to our college?s average of 17%.  SIIRE was successful in creating a diverse pool of participants with 49% from minority populations and females making up 42% of the applicants, which is approximately double the rate for each group for our university?s College of Engineering.  Of those SIIRE graduates that continued to graduate school, approximately 29% were minority and 36% were female.  SIIRE had success with students participating in internships (48%) and undergraduate research (74%), and 39% had both internship and research experience.  There were two key findings made for the program.  First, the eleven enrichment and professional development activities were well received by the participants and contributed to their persistence in the program and were reported as a key factor in their liking the program.  Secondly, one particular activity, the GRE preparation workshop had an excellent impact on student awareness and preparation for graduate school within STEM. Overall, participants felt more prepared for the GRE because of the workshops (workshop 1: 78% agree or strongly agree and workshop 2: 80% agree or strongly agree). Participants also indicated that they found the workshop beneficial (workshop 1: 89% agree or strongly agree and workshop 2: 90% agree or strongly).
