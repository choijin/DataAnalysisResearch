<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Small-interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNA) are of great interest to many scientists and engineers because siRNAs are used to temporarily silence or "knockdown" gene expression. Knocking down genes has allowed researchers to determine the functions of genes, identify components of biochemical pathways, differentiate stem cells into terminal lineages, and many other applications. Researchers continue to find new applications for siRNA. Thus, the use and delivery of siRNA has become exceptionally vital to researchers in biological, medical, chemical, pharmaceutical, and bioengineering disciplines.
