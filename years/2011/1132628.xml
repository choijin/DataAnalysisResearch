<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award for a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site Program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) entitled, "RET Site: Inquiry-Based Bioengineering Research and Design Experiences for Middle-School Teachers", under the direction of Dr. Terri A. Camesano.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposed RET site, which builds on an existing RET in Engineering Site program, a total of 30 middle-school science teachers (10 per summer over three years) from Worcester and Framingham Public Schools (WPS and FPS) and neighboring communities will be recruited to participate in a 6-week intensive and authentic summer research experience in bioengineering.  The teachers will work alongside WPI faculty and students on cutting edge research projects in fields such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.  They will gain hands-on exposure to the engineering design process through their own research experience.  In addition, the teachers will use the engineering design process to develop an engineering unit for use in their science/technology classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By engaging 10 middle-school teachers per year, several hundred students per year can be reached on a continuous basis. WPS and FPS middle-school teachers are excellent target groups because both districts have high percentages of students from minority populations, as well as high percentages of at-risk students who are 2nd language learners and students from low-income or high mobility families.</AbstractNarration>

Twenty teachers participated over a three year period. Teachers taught their RET curriculums to over 2,500 middle-school students.

We also increased teachers abilities and confidence to teach engineering, increased their depth and breadth of engineering knowledge, and formed long term partnerships between middle-school teachers in central MA and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.   All of the teachers gained a great deal of experience in inquiry-based learning and the engineering design process. They learned specific skills in a particular area of biomedical engineering, but they also learned how to apply the engineering design process to any of the science topics they are already covering in their classroom activities. Graduate and undergraduate students gained some mentoring experience, as they provided training and instruction to the RET teachers.  Because they were in the same lab area, some RET teachers and BME REU students helped one another with their projects.  We learned that the RET program had a long-term impact on three middle school girls who took part in the curriculum that one of our teachers developed for a middle school after school program.  Two of the girls are now freshman in college majoring in Bioengineering.  The teacher reported that the girls' decisions to choose engineering was, "a direct result of the after school program."  A third student is a freshman at WPI, majoring in Robotics.       Last Modified: 05/30/2016       Submitted by: Terri A Camesano]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
