<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  Protein translation is one of the most fundamental and universally conserved biological processes. As a result, a detailed understanding of the steps involved remains a major research focus in molecular biology and cellular biology. Most knowledge of protein production is limited to results from laboratory experiments. However, if selection on translational errors and efficiency contribute to the evolution of the codons used to create a protein, it follows that genomic data will contain information on the nature and importance of these forces. A major challenge facing the scientific community is how to extract such information in an efficient and biologically meaningful manner. The goal of this research project is to develop statistical techniques that will allow scientists to efficiently extract and interpret this biologically important information from an organism's genome. The major outcomes of this work will include the ability to estimate key biological parameters, such as the direct cost of protein translation, the frequency at which different errors occur, and the average expression level of every gene within a genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will provide direct hands-on research training at the interface of mathematics and biology for students at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels. These students will present their results at local and regional meetings, including an Annual Undergraduate Research Conference hosted by the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS). In addition, the PIs will serve as mentors for undergraduates participating in an ongoing NSF-sponsored Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates and Veterinarians (REU/REV) program sponsored by NIMBioS. This REU/REV program actively promotes the involvement of students from underrepresented groups, including women and minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, by the Evolutionary Processes Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology, and by the Advances in Biological Informatics Cluster in the Division of Biological Infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the main types of information encoded within the DNA genome of each organism is how to assemble specific proteins.  Because the basic code used to assemble proteins is redundant, there are many ways to encode the sequence of a given protein in the DNA of a genome.  Using basic principles from cellular ane evolutionary biology, our work demonstrates how it is possible to 'decode' the patterns of redundancy in order to make inferences about the basic stabilities of different sequences of DNA, the efficiency with which they are utilized and how frequently a protein is made.  How frequently a protien is made is of particular interest to biologists because, roughly speaking, the importance of a protein is proportional to the frequency with which it is made.   Because the underlying principles of the work are very general, the computer programs we have developed can be applied to any microbial organism.  This means that scientists can now gain a quantitative understanding of the biology of any such organism using only its genome.  This is particularly useful to microbiologists studying the vast majority of microbes that cannot be easily cultured in the lab but whose DNA can be extracted from the environment.     Finally, our work illustrates the quantiative interaction between natural selection for efficient translation and how mutation is biased towards particular nucleotides.
