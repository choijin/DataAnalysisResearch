<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the National Science Foundation supports the work of Professor Seth B. Herzon in the area of complex alkaloid total synthesis.  The proposal builds on prior research which provided efficient strategies to synthesize the hasubanan alkaloids, a large family of botanical natural products.  In the proposed work, the application of these strategies toward the synthesis of more complex alkaloid natural products will be pursued.  In parallel, the development of new synthetic methods, inspired by the synthetic studies, will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of efficient methods for the synthesis of hasubanan alkaloids will improve access to molecules with diverse biological effects.  This research will provide training for students in sophisticated organic synthesis preparing them for a career in academia or pharmaceutical industry.  The adaptation of new teaching methods for sophomore organic chemistry and a systematic, research-based approach to undergraduate education is another important component of this project.  The goal is to increase the number of students (including students of underrepresented groups) pursuing chemistry and related fields of study by improving the way undergraduate organic chemistry is taught, and learned.  A University-wide program to provide high school students with hands-on experience in chemistry is also planned.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research program was aimed at the synthesis of hasubanan and acutumine alkaloids - complex nitrogen-containing natural produdcts that are produced by various plant species.  We developed methods to recreate these compounds in the laboratory.  En route to the completion of these compounds, we developed several new synthetic transformations (ways to convert one chemical to another) that are likely to be of broad utiliy.  Ultimately we were able to prepare over a dozen hasubanan and acutumine alkaloids in homogenous form and we are now in position to investigate the medicinal properties of these compounds     In parlall with the work conducted toward these alkaloids, we began to study methods to affect the formal addition of a hydrogen atom to unfunctionalized alkenes.  Alkenes - compounds that contained carbon-carbon double bonds - are inexpensive, abundant, and relatively unreactive, and so they constitute useful starting materials for chemical synthesis.  We developed cobalt based complexes that allow us to efficiently transfer a hydrogen atom to alkenes and then trap the resulting carbon-centered free radical intermediate with other reagents. In this way we can affect the addition of many different H&ndash;X atoms to alkenes including the formal hydropyridylation of alkenes with is a very useful transformation as it allows us to smash together alkenes and pyridine starting materials which are abundant.
