<AbstractNarration>The University of Idaho proposes to engage 90 students in grades 4-6 and six teachers on two neighboring Indian Reservations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning through culturally-based and content rich experiences and activities focusing on the large watershed shared by the tribes. The project will deliver a summer and after-school programs for the Coeur d'Alene Reservation.  Students will create a "virtual watershed", a web-based site comprised of an interactive map, which will provide geospatial locations of social, cultural, and scientific significance. The proposal is centered on two guiding frameworks, Critical Pedagogy of Place and Adventure Learning. These established frameworks provide a sound foundation for program activities and evaluation. Critical Pedagogy of Place is relevant to the Native American Students in the program. Adventure Learning, with an inquiry-based approach, is well-suited to STEM education. The evaluation is both formative and summative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to enhance STEM content understanding, improve attitudes toward STEM careers, and assist in building community partnerships. A design-based approach to STEM instruction using current technology will be used to give students a hands-on culturally based foray into the world of STEM professionals. An Adventure Learning environment will be created allowing students at both tribal locations to share their experiences by uploading data, stories, learning experiences, and thoughts, in real time.</AbstractNarration>

However, there are some key outcomes observed in the summer youth STEM camps. The youth participating in the summer camps gained experience in collaboration around inquiry-based group activities (including use of iterative design process), developed physical skills, and gained an understanding of the intertwined nature of STEM and their culture. Overall they displayed an increased positive attitude towards STEM and tribal values (such as caring for the earth), with an overall positive attitude about study in STEM in the future. Additionally, significant evaluation results (survey-based) included gains in feeling connected to place (places where the camps were held), knowing the history of the place, understanding how to collect water quality information, and being able to make a good model for restoring things in nature.

During this process, some very deep lessons were learned about tribal-university partnerships. At the very beginning of the project, it was significantly important the project research team put effort in to build relationships with tribal members and communities, including learning about the Tribe&rsquo;s history, protocols, values, and other culturally significant issues.
