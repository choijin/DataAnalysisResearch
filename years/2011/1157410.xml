<AbstractNarration>Mangrove forests are extremely valuable marine environments that protect human habitation against waves and currents, are themselves home to many juvenile marine organisms, and are major repositories for carbon. The mangrove coastlines south and north of the Amazon River mouth have had little impact from humans in terms of pollution or clear cutting, but reduction in sediment supply could expose mangrove forests to intense erosion from oceanographic forces. A doubling of eustatic (global) sea-level rise due to climate change could provide substantially more space to trap fluvial sediment discharge, perhaps doubling entrapment and further reducing the sediment supply to the ocean and coastal mangrove environments. To investigate this linkage between sea-level rise and mangrove health, a collaborative research network between US and Brazilian scientists will be established to supply the set of specialized skills necessary for this study. The US group brings expertise in sediment transport processes and the impacts of climate variations on river delta and coastal environments; off-shore research, and land-ocean interactions and global change. The Brazilian collaborators bring expertise in remote sensing, experience with mangrove coastlines, and coastal and estuarine circulation and sedimentological processes in the deltaic regions associated with the Amazon River. &lt;br/&gt;This project will entail a short course/technical workshop at Universidade Federal do Par√° (UFPA); a preliminary field expedition to the Amazon tidal river and mangrove coastlines surrounding the river mouth; and the development of a communication network for sharing of scientific results and discussion. The short course and field expedition will involve a group of  about 6 Brazilian and 6 U.S. students at the graduate and advanced undergraduate levels. The students will be exposed to the scientific underpinnings of fluvial and coastal sedimentation and the relevant environments through field excursions to the Amazon river mouth and coastal mangrove forests. This project and anticipated follow-on activities will lay the groundwork and create the international collaborations necessary to address the question of the linkages between sedimentological and geochemical processes operating on mangrove coastlines and fluvial sediment and carbon exchange to the coastal ocean.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mangrove forests are extremely valuable marine environments that protect human habitation against waves and currents, are themselves home to many juvenile marine organisms, and are major repositories for carbon.  The mangrove coastlines south and north of the Amazon River mouth are among the most verdant on Earth.  The river and the coastlines have had little impact from humans, and represent linked systems that can provide valuable insights to help ameliorate conditions in less fortunate fluvial-mangrove systems around the world.  The long-term objective of this research is to improve our understanding of the coupling between sediment exchange within tropical tidal rivers and sedimentation in linked mangrove forests.  The Amazon tidal river exchanges water and sediment with diverse over-bank environments along its path to the ocean, including floodplain lakes, intertidal backswamps, and vegetated intertidal floodplains. These environments exist along a continuum from strong fluvial influence upstream toward strong oceanic tidal conditions near the river mouth.  Developing an international network of researchers capable of addressing the complex sediment dynamics that govern the exchange and trapping of sediment in these environments is a focus of this project.   In order to accomplish these scientific goals, researchers from the University of Washington and University of North Carolina established a collaborative research network with Brazilian scientists from the Universidade Federal do Par&aacute; in Bel&eacute;m and Bragan&ccedil;a, the Instituto de Pesquisas Cient&iacute;ficas e Tecnol&oacute;gicas do Estado do Amap&aacute; in Macap&aacute;, and the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Niteroi.  In addition to a short course held in Bragan&ccedil;a, Par&aacute;, Brazil, this US-Brazilian team undertook two 10-day research cruises along the Amazon tidal river, and completed a field study in the coastal mangrove forest in Par&aacute; state.  Undergraduate and graduate students from the involved universities obtained both knowledge of the system and preliminary data sets that have been incorporated into a broad range of studies. While data analysis and sample processing is ongoing, preliminary results suggest that the dynamics of sediment exchange vary between each floodplain environment along the Amazon tidal river, so that any effects of natural or anthropogenic perturbation will not be felt uniformly within the system.  Work to characterize the linkage between the Amazon tidal river and coastal mangroves is ongoing, demonstrating the strength of the collaborative research network established during this project.
