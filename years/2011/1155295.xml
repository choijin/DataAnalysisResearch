<AbstractNarration>The mechanisms underlying the glacial-interglacial CO2 variations constitute one of the major unsolved problems in the Earth Sciences. Ice-core measurements have shown that during cold glacial periods, CO2 levels are around 190 p.p.m., but reach 280 p.p.m. during warm interglacials. Though many mechanisms have been hypothesized, it still remains unclear why these large CO2 variations occur, and where the excess CO2 is stored during glacial periods. While it has generally been assumed that the ocean carbonate cycle is (approximately) at steady state, both during glacial and interglacial periods we propose to explore the possibility, and potential impact, of autonomous dynamical behavior of the carbonate cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology hypothesize the existence of a "biogeochemical oscillator" as a contributor to the glacial-interglacial CO2 variations, and in this project they will test that hypothesis.  Their preliminary, highly-idealized model reveals the possibility of an internal oscillation of the ocean carbonate cycle which has several interesting features: (i) it produces oscillations in global ocean alkalinity (and thus atmospheric carbon dioxide) with the characteristic sawtooth shape observed in the ice-core record, (ii) the oscillations are due to ecological interactions between calcifying and noncalcifying primary producers, (iii) the period of the oscillations depends upon the chosen parameters but is in a range consistent with the observed glacial-interglacial variations, and (iv) the model predicts ?spikes? of enhanced calcifier productivity at the glacial-interglacial transitions, consistent with sedimentary records. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, the team will investigate the potential role of these mechanisms, employing a hierarchy of models of vastly different complexities, starting from a set of two ordinary differential equations and working up to a full general circulation model with explicit and detailed biogeochemical components including an explicit ecological model. The advantage of using such a hierarchical approach is that the idealized models can help to gain insight into the mechanisms behind and the robustness of the results from more realistic complex coupled simulations. They will test the model results against ice-core measurements of CO2, observations of glacial-interglacial variations in (carbonate) sediment accumulation, and observations of carbon isotope distributions in the oceans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact :  This work is obviously relevant for understanding historical climatic change, but should also be of significance in considering how the Earth system will respond to anthropogenically emitted CO2. The project is highly multidisciplinary, bringing together expertise in biogeochemical and ocean circulation models with advanced mathematical analysis and data from geological observations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Several decades ago, scientists analyzed air bubbles trapped in Arctic and Antarctic ice showing that atmospheric CO2 varied in sync with glacial-interglacial cycles in temperature and climate with both properties exhibiting a "sawtooth" pattern in time: a steep rise in temperature and CO2 followed by a slow decline over about 100,000 years. Other records show that this sawtooth pattern in climate persisted over the past milliion years or so. Prior to that was a period also characterized by sawtooth variations in climate but of shorter period and smaller amplitude. This change in behavior is called the Mid-Pleistocen Transition (MPT). While variations in the Earth's orbit around the sun are linked to the timescales of these phenomena, a clear explanation for these patterns has yet to be established.</p> <p>In this project, we used mathematical and computer models to examine the hypothesis that a "calcifier-alkalinity" oscillation could have driven the observed variations in atmospheric CO2 and explain the change in behavior at the MPT. Carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean and reacts with seawater. The capacity of the ocean to store CO2 depends on its temperature and the concentration of particular dissolved salts including calcium ions. The latter property is called the alkalinity: high alkalinity equates to a high capacity for the oceans to store carbon dioxide which has the effect of reducing atmospheric CO2. The concentration of calcium ions in the ocean, and thus the alkalinity, reflects a balance between inputs from the weathering of rocks and outputs mediated by the formation of mineral calcium carbonate by marine plankton, some of which sinks and is buried in sediments. If we assume that the input is roughly constant over time, then ocean alkalinity will vary if the fitness and population of calcium carbonate producing organisms changes. &nbsp;The chemistry of seawater is such that it should be more difficult for calcifying (calcium carbonate producing) plankton to grow when the alkalinity is low, which makes the water more acidic. This suggests a feedback mechanism: when alkalinity is high, calcifying organisms are better off and compete with other plankton for resources. As their contribution to the total population increases they consume and bury calcium ions, reducing alkalinity and their own fitness. Over thousands of years, they make their own environment more hostile and are outcompeted for other resources. Eventually their population is small enough that the rate of burial of calcium carbonate is less than the rate of input from weathering of rocks and the ocean concentration of calcium ions and alkalinity gradually increase over many thousands of years. At some point the alkalinity is high enough (and acidity low enough) that the calcifiers become competitive again and "bloom" globally, starting the cycle all over again.&nbsp;</p> <p>Using suite of mathematical and computer models we showed that this hypothesized cycle might provide an explanation for some of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2. The models combine simplified representations of the competition between calcifiers and other plankton as well as pertinent aspects of ocean circulation and marine chemistry. Models of the system showed a sawtooth shaped oscillation in atmospheric CO2 driven by the feedback cycle described above. Rapid increases in atmospheric CO2 are associated with the global "blooms" of calcifiers, punctuated by a long slow decline as weathering replenishes the ocean's calcium ion content. &nbsp;The time interval between high CO2 periods and the size of the peak CO2 concentration are linked and depend upon the specifics of competition between calcifiers and other plankton. Introducing an additional driver into the system, linked to the variations in sunlight cause the oscillation to synchronize with the changes in the orbit. Different timescales in the orbital forcing can be picked out and the system may hop from one dominant frequency to another in an unpredictable way.</p> <p>These models, though highly simplified, are consistent with the observations in several interesting ways: they can reproduce key features of the observed cycles including the timing and magnitude of glacial-interglacial variations (Fig. 1). They predict large "dumps" of calcium carbonate to the sediments during the transitions from glacial to interglacial, consistent with evidence from deep sea sediments.
