<AbstractNarration>We are now in the midst of a technological revolution of massive data generation and processing. Equally massive data storage is required to support this technological boom. New solutions cognizant of operational constraints of storage systems must be invented to curb the skyrocketing cost of data storage. Fundamentally common to all storage technologies are channel coding schemes. Results from coding theory have been used with phenomenal success in storage systems. Practical coding schemes have helped make computer storage ubiquitous. However, currently available coding schemes have hit a performance wall: existing codes are designed for simple channels, and do not match the needs of new storage technologies where the data must be packed as densely as possible on increasingly adverse mediums. Such performance provisioning not only violates fundamental information-theoretic laws but directly increases the cost of a storage system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research fundamentally rethinks channel coding methods with applications to storage systems. This project creates a coding-theoretic foundation that embraces, rather than ignores, adverse physical and operating conditions to increase the capacity of the upcoming storage technologies. Rich combinatorial structure of non-binary channel codes is explored and exploited over four research thrusts: (a) analysis and design of structured non-binary low-density parity-check codes, (b) theory and practice of non-binary non-symmetric error correcting codes, (c) non-binary methodologies for overcoming synchronization errors, and (d) theory-based rapid code prototyping using novel algorithms for fast simulation, FPGA implementation, and publicly available on-line evaluation tool. This research project contributes to the development of a competitive American workforce through active and carefully tailored research engagement of high-school, undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
