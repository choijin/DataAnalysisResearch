<AbstractNarration>Major Research Initiative in Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology:  Production of a Science Plan&lt;br/&gt;Judith Parrish-Jones, University of Idaho&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1157282&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last three decades, scientists who study the Earth?s sedimentary crust and the history of life have conducted innumerable workshops and produced dozens of white papers outlining critical research opportunities in the disciplines. This community may represent the most integrative part of the earth sciences. The community addresses issues of the history of life on Earth and the dynamics of evolution and extinction, the history of climate and climate dynamics, and the history of sedimentation and the dynamics of sedimentary basins. The entire record of climate and life is preserved in sedimentary rocks, and is understood through integrated studies of tectonics, climate, life, and sedimentology. Our sample of modern processes is limited, yet understanding of these processes is important to many societal concerns. Fundamental knowledge about these processes is recorded in the sedimentary record. Without understanding the full range of process behavior we do not truly understand processes such as climate change, extinction, and resource distribution and quality. This workshop will integrate research opportunities identified by the community over the last several years in order to provide a framework for moving forward with major research initiatives.  This workshop will be held in Arlington, Virginia at Marymount College on October 24 and 25th, 2011.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to hold a workshop for sedimentary geologists and paleontologists to produce a science plan for the future of research in sedimentary geology and paleontology.  The science plan was produced and titled "TRANSITIONS:  The Changing Earth-Life System--Critical Information for the Future from the Deep Past."  Deep past is defined as Earth's history before about 2 million years ago.  Major climatic, environmental, and life transitions have occurred during this time that exceed in magnitude and signficance any events during the last 2 million years, yet our understanding of deep-time events remains poor.  Recent work has revealed that the Earth may have experienced radically different states--modes of operation--in the deep past, and understanding these modes is vital for anticipating future changes.  The report outlines 3 critical tools needed for progress--continental scientific drilling, improved geochronological methods, and community databases and sample archives--and three avenues of research most likely to lead to significant discoveries:  deep-time climate, landscapes, and biology and environments.  The science plan recommends the funding of large, interdisciplinary teams working together on critical transitions in Earth history.  As of this writing, the science plan may be accessed through the Society for Sedimentary Geology (SEPM; www.sepm.org) or Paleontological Society (www.paleosoc.org) websites.  Based partly on the science plan, the National Science Foundation established a new funding program, "Earth-Life Transitions" (under the Sedimentary Geology and Paleontology program), which, in 2013, funded several interdisciplinary research teams to tackle important events throughout deep time.  Graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty were critical parts of this effort and have gone on to demonstrate leadership in this science going forward.
