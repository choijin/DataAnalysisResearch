<AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program in the Department of Chemistry at Jackson State University (JSU) will bring 8 students to campus for ten weeks each summer to conduct research in a stimulating and supportive research environment. The summer research project will provide opportunities for JSU-REU participants to excel in research on environmental nanoscience and promote the acquisition of skills necessary for scientific discovery. To understand the applications and implications of nanoscience on the environment, this REU site aims to form an interdisciplinary team of chemists, environmental scientists, nanoscientists, physicists, and biologists within the REU site to focus on research, educational and career development activities related to "Environmental Nanoscience". REU research activity will focus on two main areas: (1) Development and application of nanomaterials in environmental protection and (2) Impact of Engineered Nanomaterials on the Environment. The career and scientific activities will include: a) short courses, b) workshops on graduate school, scientific ethic, and written and oral communication skills, c) seminar series from prominent scientists, d) round table discussions, e) field trips and social events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;African-Americans are underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in the US. Since they represent 98% of the minority population in Mississippi, an REU Site at JSU is an excellent opportunity to address the challenge of the lack of access to successful STEM-research careers for this demographic group. In response to these challenges, the REU site at JSU, one of the 115 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), will provide the research experience to the underrepresented minority, female, and other disadvantaged students for a successful career in science. An anticipated far-reaching and lasting effect of the current REU site program is its impact on training and mentoring African American undergraduate students in the areas of research with graduate education and excellent job prospects as outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
