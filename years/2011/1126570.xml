<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 11-26570&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Kong, Jun&lt;br/&gt;  Cook, John R.; Shi, Jing; Yu, Nan&lt;br/&gt;Institution: North Dakota State University&lt;br/&gt;Title:    MRI/Dev. : A Cross-Platform Infrastructure for Natural Interaction Research&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project from an EPSCoR state, aiming to develop a cross-platform infrastructure that supports natural interaction research by providing automatic modality adaptation, radically alters the paradigm for human/computer interaction (HCI). Distinct from previous approaches, the proposed approach quantifies the usability of each modality and then formalizes the adaptation issue as searching for a set of input/output modalities that produce the highest usability, i.e., an optimization issue. In addition to the interaction context, our approach also considers the effects of computing infrastructures (e.g., system resources and networking) on the modality adaptation. The proposed work establishes the first Natural Interaction Laboratory in North Dakota, enabling the following research projects in Adaptive Natural Interaction:&lt;br/&gt;- Establishing common interaction context across multiple scenarios,&lt;br/&gt;- Device-aware establishment of modality space,&lt;br/&gt;- Device-aware establishment of usability space, and&lt;br/&gt;- Quality of service in the human/computer interaction context.&lt;br/&gt;The work aims to develop a unifying infrastructure for research by providing a common programming interface across multiple devices. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation should provide a unique research facility for faculty and graduate students to conduct research on user interaction-enhancing technology and education. The proposal enhances PhD production in an EPSCoR state, encourages underrepresented students into research via the NATURE (Nurturing American Tribal Undergraduate Research and Educations) and WISMET (Women in Science, Math, Engineering, and Technology) programs, provides research opportunities to undergraduate students, and impacts industry and economic development in North Dakota.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With the fund of this grant, we successfully implemented a cross-platform infrastructure that supported natural user interaction across different devices. This infrastructure provided a novel interaction style that seamlessly integrated a Microsoft PixelSense tabletop and Android devices together. Specifically speaking, an infrared camera, which is embedded on a Microsoft PixelSense tabletop, was used to recognize each user and to track his/her action on the surface of the tabletop. Based on the user's action, a personal mobile interface was generated on a smartphone that belonged to the user. Such a multi-device interaction style supplements a public space (i.e., a tabletop) with a private space (i.e., a mobile device), and facilitates information sharing without compromising privacy. In addition to the interaction between large and small display devices, we also investigated the interaction between a mobile device and a piece of traditional paper, called PhoneLens. A user worked on a large piece of paper by moving his/her smartphone on top of the paper. Then, corresponding digital information is displayed on the smartphone based on the user&rsquo;s movement. This work integrated the benefits of paper and mobile device.

The above researches provided valuable experience in exploring different input/output modalities in a multi-device environment. &nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to traditional input modalities, we consider the EEG device as a special input modality that is especially useful for users with disabilities, and developed two p300 spellers, i.e., the zigzag paradigm and the edges paradigm. Those new paradigms addressed the adjacent problem, the crowding problem, and the fatigue problem. The zigzag paradigm shifted the even rows to the right by d/2 cm where d is the distance between two adjacent characters. The edges paradigm presented a square adjacent to each column/row in the outer boundary of the 6 by 6 matrix. More specifically, a square was displayed in the bottom of an odd column and on the top of an even column, and to the left of an odd row and to the right of an even row. The evaluation revealed that both the zigzag and edges paradigms improved the accuracy over the popular row-column paradigm. We also evaluated the edges paradigm in the mobility condition, which indicated that the edges paradigm is suitable for a mobile speller.</p> <p>With the support of this grant, we were able to stay in touch with the state-of-the-art communicative technologies and investigated how new technologies can be used for promoting usability.
