<AbstractNarration>This project, renewing a previous award, will continue work on the problem of how mass, energy, and elements heavier than helium ("metals") cycle in and out of galaxies over the interval when half the stellar mass now present in galaxies was forming. Under the prior award, the proposing team acquired spectra of several hundred galaxies in the relevant range of redshifts. They will use these data to extend the galaxy mass-metallicity relation to lower stellar masses, and will investigate the effect of shock excitation on metallicity diagnostics using both existing and new integral-field spectroscopic data. New observations will be obtained using new instrumentation becoming available at the Keck Observatory and on the Very Large Telescope, with an emphasis on detailed follow-up spectroscopy. The team will make use of fluorescent line emission to try to resolve discrepant galactic wind velocities obtained from absorption lines partially filled by emission, and will improve their modeling of line profiles, by adapting a theory developed for hot star winds and also by numerical ray tracing through a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation. As a byproduct, the team will improve knowledge of the scaling relations between outflow properties and galaxy properties, and constrain the physical nature of the acceleration mechanism. The project provides support for the third year of a Postdoctoral Scholar appointment for a female scientist and funds the dissertation research of a graduate student; and the Principal Investigator will continue her program of community outreach activities. The team intends to make their line-fitting code and the data from their survey for ultra-faint, emission-line galaxies publically available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project demonstrated the role of galactic winds  over the lifetime of a typical galaxy. Spectroscopic measurements of the Doppler shift of the diffuse gas in  200 galaxies demonstated that gaseous outflows were ubiquitous among star-forming galaxies over most of the period of galaxy assembly. These winds travel fast enough to burst out of galactic disks and affect the properties of the galaxy's environment, the circumgalactic medium, for the next several billion years. By the present era, however, this activity has settled down, and only galaxies that undergo close encounters or direct mergers with other galaxies have high enough rates of star formation activity to drive powerful outflows. We studied nearby examples of galaxies caught in the act of merging and found outflows on both nuclear and global scales.  The biggest surprise, however, was the discovery of "fast outflows" via faint, broad wings on emission-line profiles. This component of the wind appears likely to escape from the galactic gravitational potential and seed the intergalactic medium with heavy elements synthesized by stars.  We developed a physical model that explains the velocity, spatial scale, and luminosity of the fast winds.  Using the data collected for the outflow studies, we also looked for gas flowing into galactic disks.  For many decades now, gas accretion has been seen as critical for explaining the duration of star formation in galaxies and their chemical evolution, but observations provided little direct evidence for inflowing gas. Our outflow survey showed that inflows of cold gas were actually common over the era of disk growth; they were missed previously because the inflow occurs over a small solid angle, which we attribute to the high angular momentum of the accreting gas.
