<AbstractNarration>This Capacity Building proposal for Noyce Scholarships develops strategies for attracting majors in science and mathematics to the teacher licensure programs at Montana State University Billings (MSUB). The goal of this project is to recruit current STEM majors and help them become successful licensed teachers in Montana's high-need school districts, especially those located on or near reservation schools and suffering from high teacher turnover and sub-standard student achievement.  The Capacity Building phase examines the feasibility of redesigning specific courses to make them more appropriate for teaching students in high-needs schools.  The use of blended learning will be analyzed as a delivery strategy, both to facilitate learning by teacher candidates and to model innovative instructional strategies for high-needs districts. Implementation of this proposal lays the groundwork for recruiting STEM teachers to serve in high-needs school districts as indicated by high teacher turnover and sub-standard student achievement. Because retention of teachers in high-needs schools is a continuing problem, this phase also creates a network of mentor teachers to assist Noyce scholars in their induction years as teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Capacity Building proposal is leading to the development of a Phase I proposal to recruit about 15 prospective teacher candidates as Noyce scholars. The projected long-term effect of this proposal is to increase the number of qualified STEM teachers for high-needs school districts in Montana and, through induction support, improve teacher retention rates in these school districts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Capacity Building proposal for Noyce Scholarships at Montana State University Billings (MSUB) explored strategies for attracting majors in science and mathematics to the teacher licensure programs in Montana. The project helped establish the partnerships with tribal colleges, community colleges, and programs to complete these STEM majors and become licensed as STEM teachers in Montana and a design to support them via mentoring during their induction years as teachers. Implementation of this proposal will lay the groundwork for recruiting STEM teachers to serve in high-needs school districts as indicated by high teacher turnover and sub-standard student achievement.  Although degree programs in science and mathematics exist for those candidates seeking teaching licensure, almost no candidates in science do so, while those graduating in mathematics rarely seek positions in high-needs schools. This Capacity Building proposal assessed whether a significant number of STEM graduates might be attracted to seek licensure as STEM teachers.  The MSUB College of Education serves as a conduit for those seeking Montana licensure. The Capacity Building proposal explored the feasibility of re-designing certain courses within the teacher licensure program to make them more appropriate for teaching students in high-needs schools. The proposal also explored the use of blended learning as a delivery strategy, both to facilitate learning by teacher candidates, and to model innovative instructional strategies for high-needs districts.  Retention of teachers in high-needs schools is a continuing problem. This Capacity Building proposal explored the creation of a cadre of mentor teachers to assist Noyce scholars in their induction years as teachers.  This Capacity Building proposal led to the development of a Phase I proposal to recruit 18 prospective teacher candidates as Noyce scholars.  Broader Impact  The projected long-term effect of this proposal was an increase in the supply of STEM teachers for high-needs school districts in Montana and, through induction support, an increase in teacher retention in these school districts.  There was a greater retention of STEM teachers in high-needs schools hopefully leading to higher student achievement in mathematics and science.  Outcomes of this grant were as follows:  Core Planning Group Established    Established role of Core Planning Group Formed candidate criteria and selection Publicity and Recruitment policies established Application Process for Noyce Scholars Contracts designed and evaluated Selection of Noyce Scholars   Curriculum Design for STEM majors    Plans of study in place Course rotation in place new courses for Noyce Scholars developed Delivery strategies in place to meet the needs of candidates   Procedures developed to administer Noyce Scholars    coordination with financial aid and scholarship offices Policy and Procedures for grant oversight and student loan collection system in place to monitor Noyce Scholarships   Project Mentors identified and Equipped to serve as mentors    Mentors identified Mentor training and inservice professional development activities identified to prepare mentors and an induction process identified   Support for mentoring and monitoring progress of scholars established    develop tracking system identify demographic data that needs to be collected on Noyce scholars                Last Modified: 11/03/2014       Submitted by: Kenneth W Miller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
