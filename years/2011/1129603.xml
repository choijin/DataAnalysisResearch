<AbstractNarration>This award will provide three years of continuing support for the U.S. GEOTRACES Project Office at the Lamont-Dougherty earth Observatory of Columbia University. The Office works under the direction of the U.S. GEOTRACES Scientific Steering Committee to support all aspects of the GEOTRACES program, including enabling activities (preparation and distribution of standard reference materials; intercalibration; modelling; data management) and field expeditions (science planning; cruise logistics; synthesis of results). The GEOTRACES program is designed to study the global marine biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and their isotopes (TEIs), employing a multi-tracer approach to characterize the sources, sinks and internal cycling of TEIs while also quantifying the rates of these processes wherever possible. Biogeochemical cycling of TEIs has direct implications for research in such diverse areas as the carbon cycle, climate change, ocean ecosystems, and environmental contamination. GEOTRACES promises clear benefits to each of these areas by significantly advancing knowledge of the marine biogeochemical cycles of TEIs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: GEOTRACES contributes to the training of the next generation of oceanographers by involving a large number of graduate students and post docs. It was evident in JGOFS and other recent programs that participation benefited young people by giving them exposure to peers and to potential future employers. It also informs young people about the procedures for developing new programs and the benefits thereof.  GEOTRACES has also established community building as one of its highest priorities. At the international level, this involves expanding the distribution of technologies for contamination-free sampling at sea, and training investigators to use those new technologies. In the U.S., community building is focused more on sharing the GEOTRACES experience with other sectors of the oceanographic community, freely providing information, assistance and advice to those who wish to follow a path like that of GEOTRACES and organize their own coordinated effort to attack substantial problems in oceanography that are too complex to address by small groups or individual PI projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the US GEOTRACES Project Office, which, in turn, supports the activities of scores of oceanographers in the U.S. who contribute to the international GEOTRACES program.   GEOTRACES is an international research program &lt;http://www.geotraces.org&gt; that investigates the distribution throughout the ocean of many chemical elements that are present at very low concentrations (known as "trace elements").  An anticipated benefit of this research is a more comprehensive knowledge of the sources of trace-element nutrients, such as iron, that are essential for the growth of marine organisms.  GEOTRACES findings will also be used to form more reliable predictions of the transport and fate of contaminants in the ocean.  To date, 14 nations have led research cruises in support of GEOTRACES, and we look forward to growth of the program to include more nations over the next few years.   Trace elements such as iron, zinc and cobalt serve as essential nutrients that influence the fertility of marine ecosystems.  Trace elements such as lead, mercury and copper also occur as contaminants in the ocean due to human activities.  Finally, trace elements, and their isotopes, serve as tracers for processes that we cannot observe directly, such as ocean circulation and the delivery of freshwater to the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge.    The international GEOTRACES program was designed to investigate the marine biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and their isotopes.  In other words, investigators seek to determine the sources of trace elements at ocean boundaries, including the interfaces with the atmosphere, the coast, and the sea bed, as well as to establish the processes that remove trace elements from the ocean, including active biological uptake by organisms and passive sorption to particles that settle from the sea surface into the abyss.   The US GEOTRACES Project Office coordinates logistical support for U. S. scientists in the field of Chemical Oceanography who study the marine biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and their isotopes.  Logistical support includes organizing and coordinating workshops to plan and implement multi-investigator coordinated research on the biogeochemical cycles of trace elements in the ocean.  It also includes support for meetings that allow scientists to inform one another about their findings so that each scientist benefits from new knowledge gained by their colleagues.   Meetings supported by the project office also support intercalibration and data management, two key aspects in the success of any large research program.  Intercalibration involves cross-calibrating results from different labs to ensure internal consistency and, therefore, the highest level of accuracy and precision of the results.  Sound data management ensures that the products of the program are widely and freely available, to the public as well as to other scientists.  Ultimately, data from GEOTRACES programs around the world will be available from the GEOTRACES Data Assembly Centre in the UK &lt; http://www.bodc.ac.uk/geotraces/&gt;.   The US GEOTRACES project office coordinates financial support for travel costs incurred by U.S. investigators who participate either in meetings hosted by the U.S. GEOTRACES program, or by international partners in GEOTRACES.  A complete summary of GEOTRACES meetings can be found on the home page &lt;http://www.geotraces.org&gt;.           Last Modified: 12/28/2016       Submitted by: Robert F Anderson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
