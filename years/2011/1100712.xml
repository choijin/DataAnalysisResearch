<AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project will develop the science of a hybrid machining-based process for producing metal sheet and foil in which cutting and extrusion occur simultaneously in a single stage of deformation. The approach is radically different from the conventional multi-stage rolling processes currently used to produce sheet and foil, in that the deformation can be controlled and confined to a small region, with localized heating from the deformation itself and imposition of large hydrostatic pressures.  The result is a deformation condition that suppresses failure, thereby enabling large shape changes even in alloys of low workability.  Deformation conditions (strain, strain rate and temperature) will be investigated to determine how special stress/temperature states and strain paths can be used to increase deformation efficiency, control microstructure and properties, and eliminate defects.  Experiments and analyses on scaling, energy, tool wear and costs will be conducted in order to characterize process efficiency and for benchmarking against conventional processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will enable metal sheet and foil to be produced directly from ingot in a single stage of deformation, with significant reductions in energy, cost and emissions.  The machining-based deformation approach will also have important advantages for processing alloys of low workability such as titanium and magnesium, providing critical technology for breaking down the cost barriers currently prohibiting these lightweight alloys from large-scale application in commercial transportation systems.  The process imparts advantageous crystallographic textures, while simultaneously controlling grain-size to achieve superior formability and properties.  The research will advance cost analysis of manufacturing processes and provide opportunities for students to interact directly with industry partners and develop entrepreneurial skills. The project is a collaborative study involving Purdue University, M4 Sciences LLC, Ford, and tool manufacturers.</AbstractNarration>
