<AbstractNarration>This Ethics Education in Science and Engineering project, Bridging the Gap Between Engineers and Society: Learning to Listen, will combine research and education to explore the relationships between engineering, science, and society. The project will develop a theoretical framework, a graduate-level engineering ethics course, and four freestanding multimedia modules that draw on empirical social science theory and research methods to bridge the relational gap between engineers and their clients. Goals of engineering ethics education will be promoted by teaching engineers to acknowledge and listen to the voices of the communities they serve. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the following objectives: &lt;br/&gt;Objective 1: Develop a theoretical framework for an expanded pedagogical approach to engineering ethics that grounds ethical dilemmas in the unfolding realities, uncertainties, diverse perspectives, and multiple levels of technical expertise of the publics affected by engineering and science decisions, research, and products. &lt;br/&gt;Objective 2: Build a multidisciplinary, multimedia, empirical engineering ethics graduate course that teaches ethical and scientific inquiry best practices, with explicit consideration of stakeholder needs, values, observations, and knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;Objective 3: Partner with the engineering, science, and public health graduate students who take the course to create four teaching modules: Listening, Responsible Conduct of Research, Responsible Conduct of Practice, and Witnessing Wrongdoing and the Obligation to Prevent Harm. &lt;br/&gt;Objective 4: Assess the effectiveness of the course and modules in helping students understand their role as vital actors in a larger social fabric, and recognize that consideration of the public is an essential resource for their research and a critical component of their practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research and education plan will advance understanding of a highly promising and currently underutilized method of teaching engineering ethics. Faculty at four universities with diverse audiences have committed to teaching the project's principles and materials. As project collaborator, the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors will aid in the development and dissemination of the work products. The project team and participating students include underrepresented groups in engineering and science, in a variety of contributing roles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes of the grant include: 1) development of an innovative new graduate engineering ethics course based on a pedagogical model for socially grounded and engaged engineering ethics, 2) development of a new theoretical framework for empirical engineering ethics education, 3) public presentations and websites, 4) website repository for course approach and teaching materials.  The new course "CEE 5804: Engineering Ethics and the Public," was taught 4 times from 2011-2015 to 70 graduate students.  It was highly rated in student evaluations and interviews and will be taught for the foreseeable future. Three peer-reviewed conference presentations describe the approach, which was awarded with a Virginia Tech X-caliber certificate for innovative teaching and recognized as an "exemplar" in ethics education by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE).  Public presentations of materials based on the course case studies have been popular at other universities, in, engineering, public health, and other non-engineering disciplines.  The principal investigators presented on these case studies more than 20 times, and have made educational products, including a TEDxVT presentation, available online.  A permanent website repository was established, which allows faculty at other universities and the public to easily access the course approach and materials.  The latter include links to public presentations, assignments, and lecture Power Point presentations.   A case study involving service learning was conducted in Flint, MI in 2015. The work, based on a collaboration between graduates of the 5804 class, current members of the course, and public stakeholders received national media attention when it revealed a widespread lead-in-water contamination event.  Ultimately, a public health emergency was declared by local officials.     While evaluation of the impacts of the course are still underway, students involved in these experiences seem to have been profoundly impacted, while their experience of engineering and their moral obligations as future engineers seem to have been dramatically expanded.
