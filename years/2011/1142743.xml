<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a methodology and novel algo-&lt;br/&gt;rithms for Personal Service Robotics. Recognizing that, in unstructured environments, autonomous robotics&lt;br/&gt;alone is not yet reliable enough for performing complete tasks, and complete manual teleoperation is too&lt;br/&gt;labor intensive, this approach combines autonomous operation with human assistance in a Tiered Human-&lt;br/&gt;in-the-Loop framework. At all levels, the autonomy will request help when unexpected or anomalous events&lt;br/&gt;occur. For example, at high levels the user may be asked to identify objects or adjust plans. At the low level&lt;br/&gt;the user may be asked to remote control the robot end-e^ector to unstick a wedged object. Automation&lt;br/&gt;will focus on the most frequent task components, including motion planning, object grasping, and simple&lt;br/&gt;rigid-environment manipulation. The major innovations arise from (a) the design of limit-aware autonomy&lt;br/&gt;in each of these areas, requesting human intervention when needed and (b) multi-tiered human-assisted&lt;br/&gt;fallback options that necessitate greater involvement for severe failures or complex circumstances. Phase I&lt;br/&gt;will demonstrate an operator assisting a robot completing personal service tasks in non-industrial environ-&lt;br/&gt;ments. Phase II will parallelize for an operator supporting multiple robots, with the multiplicative e^ect&lt;br/&gt;demonstrating overall labor savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes accelerating the deployment of robots&lt;br/&gt;in unstructured environments, extending the market for personal robotic services beyond single-purpose&lt;br/&gt;autonomous devices, and increasing access to in-home assistance in daily living for an aging population.&lt;br/&gt;With demographics shifting to an older population, we face a major shortage of manual labor, particularly&lt;br/&gt;for unskilled work. This will impact the o;ce and home environments, and dramatically a^ect the older&lt;br/&gt;population for whom daily tasks become increasingly burdensome, but also for whom appropriate service&lt;br/&gt;workers may not be available. Allowing an operator to assist robots performing personal service tasks can&lt;br/&gt;increase the productivity of such labor and perform greater personal service than traditionally possible.&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, customers are clearly ready to invest into robotic technology. For reference, even today's highly-&lt;br/&gt;limited personal and home robots created a $1.28 Billion global market. A human-in-the-loop personal service&lt;br/&gt;robot will greatly expand that market, as well as create markets for operator services and infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;Delivering personal robotic service will have the immediate bene ts of reduced labor costs and increased&lt;br/&gt;productivity, while also allowing older adults to age in familiar housing and retain greater independence.</AbstractNarration>
