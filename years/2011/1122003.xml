<AbstractNarration>Stomata are tiny pores on the surfaces of plant leaves that allow the exchange of gases between the plant and the atmosphere.   Plants control the apertures of these pores in response to environmental factors so that they can maximize uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (for sugar production in photosynthesis) while minimizing water loss to the atmosphere.  Because the exchange of these gases is critically important to plant productivity and water use in natural and agricultural systems, it is important to understand the processes that control stomatal apertures. This project will explore the mechanisms by which stomata respond to light, carbon dioxide, temperature, and atmospheric humidity.  In particular, the project will test several novel hypotheses that provide simple explanations for a complex suite of responses to these environmental factors that are not well explained by previously proposed mechanisms. In addition, the idea that interactions among individual stomata may function as a type of primitive information processing will be explored.  Much of the work in the proposal is highly interdisciplinary, and students will benefit from the combined expertise of the two Principal Investigators:  a biologist and physicist.  The PIs will also collaborate to teach a new, interdisciplinary, undergraduate  course entitled 'Dynamics, Information, and Multicellularity', which will cover information processing and emergent behavior in artificial and natural systems and the role of information processing in the development of multicellular organisms.  The improved mechanistic understanding of stomatal responses to the environment that will result from this project will aid in producing more water-efficient crops, and in addition, because water loss through stomata is important for global circulation models, it will provide better predictive models for weather and the effects of global climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Stomata are tiny pores in the surfaces of leaves that allow gases, primarily carbon dioxide and water vapor to move between the atmosphere and the internal spaces of the leaf.  These pores vary in width over the timescale of minutes to adjust to local environmental conditions such that carbon dioxide uptake for photosynthesis is maximized while water loss is minimized.  Among the environmental factors to which stomata respond are light, carbon dioxide, humidity, and temperature. Most research on the mechanisms by which these pores respond to environmental factors has assumed that the sensing mechanisms for light and carbon dioxide exist exclusively in the cells that form the pore, termed guard cells.  Mechanisms for sensing humidity have been assumed to be based on water loss rates from the leaf.   And finally, each pair of guard cells has been assumed to act independently of neighboring guard-cell pairs.  The research funded by this award has provided evidence that these assumptions are probably false.  We have demonstrated that guard cell responses to light and carbon dioxide require that the guard cells be in close proximity to the cells inside the leaf that are photosynthesizing.  Furthermore, we have shown that the signal from these cells to the guard cells is probably a gaseous ion.  The identity of this ion remains unknown.  We have also shown that stomatal responses to humidity and temperature are consistent with a single mechanism that assumes that water transfer to and from the guard cells is exclusively through water vapor rather than through liquid water as has previously been assumed.  This mechanism depends partially on water loss rates from the leaf and partially on temperature gradients within the leaf.  Finally, we have demonstrated that guard-cell pairs communicate with their neighbors, either directly through hydraulic pathways in the leaf or indirectly through interactions with photosynthesizing cells in the leaf.  These findings will be of use to those working to improve water-use efficiency in crop plants by altering stomatal movements.  They will also be of use to global climate modelers who need accurate computer models to predict water loss rates from vegetation.
