<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to create better diagnostic testing for drug, food, and environmental allergies.  If successful, it would be transformative in the clinical diagnosis of allergy diseases by enabling rapid evaluation at the doctor?s office in a format that is significantly preferable to skin-prick or challenge testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are the development of next generation diagnostic devices.  These devices will enable the diagnosis of many different conditions and diseases with just a small drop of blood, right in a doctor?s office.  Disease diagnosis from blood often requires that the blood sample, typically one or more test tubes full of blood, be taken from a vein in a patient?s arm and sent to a clinical laboratory.  This is uncomfortable for the patient, requires them to wait days for results, is expensive, and is less safe than the approach being developed by Virogenomics because a large amount of blood that must be transported and handled.  The Virogenomics platform will use just a drop of blood and will provide results while the patient is still in the doctor?s office.  This diagnostic test works similar to the blood-glucose monitors diabetics use to monitor their blood sugar but is much more flexible in regards to the types of tests that can be done. In addition to allergy diagnosis, the proposed diagnostic platform would have application in many other fields that affect our health, such as diagnostics for autoimmune diseases, infectious disease and cancer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to create a point-of-care diagnostic platform.  Initial development efforts were focused on measurement of allergen specific IgE concentrations in human serum for the diagnosis of common allergies from a drop of blood.  Methods and a prototype device were developed, however the prototype was unable to meet the performance requirements needed for a medical diagnostic device and the US patent office rejected our patent application for the surface chemistry methods we developed.  We received supplemental funding under the Technology Enhancement for Commercial Partnerships progam, (TECP) to acquire proof-of-concept data demonstrating that our technology can enable rapid diagnosis of Tritrichomonas foetus infection in cattle.  Trichomonas is a genus of anaerobic single celled flagellated protozoans that are parasites of vertebrates. Tritrichomonas foetus (TF) is a pathogen of the bovine reproductive tract as well as the intestinal tract of cats. In cattle, TF causes temporary or permanent infertility and spontaneous abortions in the first trimester. These are costly to cattleman as they are dependent on cows producing calves annually. In the case of dairy cattle, failure to conceive will lead to losses in milk and calf production with a subsequent loss of income. In 1991, annual beef industry losses were estimated to be $650M.  The presence of two infected bulls in a herd of 500 cows can lead to a 50% reduction in annual calf crop. TF has been recognized as one of the top economic diseases by beef cattle producers in California and the other Western states.
