<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the marine component of the Totten Glacier and Moscow University Ice Shelf, East Antarctica. This system is of critical importance because it drains one-eighth of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and contains a volume equivalent to nearly 7 meters of potential sea level rise, greater than the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This nearly completely unexplored region is the single largest and least understood marine glacial system that is potentially unstable. Despite intense scrutiny of marine based systems in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, little is known about the Totten Glacier system. This study will add substantially to the meager oceanographic and marine geology and geophysics data available in this region, and will significantly advance understanding of this poorly understood glacial system and its potentially sensitive response to environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Independent, space-based platforms indicate accelerating mass loss of the Totten system. Recent aerogeophysical surveys of the Aurora Subglacial Basin, which contains the deepest ice in Antarctica and drains into the Totten system, have provided the subglacial context for measured surface changes and show that the Totten Glacier has been the most significant drainage pathway for at least two previous ice flow regimes. However, the offshore context is far less understood. Limited physical oceanographic data from the nearby shelf/slope break indicate the presence of Modified Circumpolar Deep Water within a thick bottom layer at the mouth of a trough with apparent access to Totten Glacier, suggesting the possibility of sub-glacial bottom inflow of relatively warm water, a process considered to be responsible for West Antarctic Ice Sheet grounding line retreat. This project will conduct a ship-based marine geologic and geophysical survey of the region, combined with a physical oceanographic study, in order to evaluate both the recent and longer-term behavior of the glacial system and its relationship to the adjacent oceanographic system.  This endeavor will complement studies of other Antarctic ice shelves, oceanographic studies near the Antarctic Peninsula, and ongoing development of ice sheet and other ocean models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall objective of this project was to conduct a reconnaissance survey in the region of the Totten Glacier System, including the Moscow University Ice Shelf (Sabrina Coast, East Antarctica) on the Nathaniel B Palmer in early 2014 to accomplish three major goals:  (1) evaluate the recent behavior of the glacial system, based on sea floor morphology, sub-bottom profiling, high&minus;resolution seismic imaging and marine sediment core evaluation. (2) elucidate the longer term role of the Totten Glacier system as it responded to late Quaternary changes in climate and sea level, and (3) assess the present day physical oceanographic and particulate dynamic processes associated with the Totten Glacier tongue and the deep basins that surround it.  This work was complemented with airborne geophysical measurements and a collaborative follow-on cruise on the Aurora Australis to the front of Totten Glacier.  UTIG led the subsurface and bathymetric focus for this multi institution, interdisciplinary project.   Intellectual merit:  We found that the bathymetry in front of Totten Glacier Ice Shelf comprises a thick shallow sill, cut by deep narrow channels.  Deep warm water from the open ocean penetrating these channels can reach the grounding line under the restraining ice shelf, causing enhanced melting and thinning, and allowing acceleration of ice flow in the vast ice sheet inland of the glacier.  This result reenforces the importance of East Antarctica to potential sea level change, both past and future. The marine geophysical data collected in this project discovered a remarkably complete sediment deposit buried beneath the Sabrina Coast continental shelf that holds clues to the evolution of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet within the Aurora subglacial basin (roughly 1/7 of the ice sheet).  We observe infrequent water-rich glaciations crossing the shelf since the late Eocene through the middle Miocene and then a switch to true polar conditions in the late Miocene.  These observations imply a degree of instability or sensitivity of this glacial system which includes the Totten Glacier, known to be rapidly thinning today, to climate changes.  These data as well as data collected in the neighboring Wilkes Land area during the marine geophysical survey on the Nathaniel B Palmer research icebreaker will form the basis of scheduled and proposed International Ocean Discovery Program expeditions to explore Antartica?s climate history.   Broader Impacts:  This work resulted in the training of five graduate students, all of which have continued in academic geosciences, and a postdoctoral fellow who is now a research associate at UTIG.  This work has strengthen ties between US institutions, as well as links between US, Australian and Chilean geoscience communities.
