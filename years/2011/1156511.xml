<AbstractNarration>Corrosion of metals in aqueous environments is an area of great economic, environmental and technological importance. Prevention of corrosion is a key component of sustainability programs, since it helps avoid costly replacements, limits consumption of valuable resources, and controls the spread of environmental contaminants. It is becoming increasingly possible to understand materials corrosion issues at the atomic/molecular level, and to use theoretical approaches in the design of corrosion resistant materials and protection systems. The next few years promise to be particularly scientifically exciting and this meeting is the ideal forum within which to generate and nurture that enthusiasm. This Gordon Research Conference and the preceding Gordon Research Seminar will foster interdisciplinary scientific interactions by convening a group of distinguished researchers and young scientists to discuss a diverse range of materials science and corrosion issues. Oral presentations will cover the range from perennial issues to those that probe the interfaces between corrosion science and related scientific disciplines. Discussion of recent advances covering the atomistic and macroscale levels will be promoted, and a strong emphasis will be placed on the linkages between experimental, computational modeling and theoretical approaches. The GRC-GRS combination provides an essential forum to bring together experts and young scientists in an atmosphere designed to facilitate extensive discussion and the dissemination of new knowledge and understanding. Funding will be used to defray the expenses of invited GRS speakers and to support the attendance of underrepresented minorities and other worthy participants, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, who would otherwise not be able to attend.</AbstractNarration>

The Conference was well-attended with 148 participants (attendees list attached). The attendees represented the spectrum of endeavor in this field coming from academia, industry, and government laboratories, both U.S. and foreign scientists, senior researchers, young investigators, and students. Of the 148 attendees, 45 voluntarily responded to a general inquiry regarding ethnicity which appears on our registration forms. Of the 45 respondents, 33% were Minorities &ndash; 9% Hispanic, 22% Asian and 2% African American. Approximately   24% of the participants at the 2012 meeting were women.             The Gordon Research SEMINAR on CORROSION - AQUEOUS was held at Colby-Sawyer College, Waterville, Maine, July 7 &ndash; 8, 2012. The Conference was well-attended with 59 participants (attendees list attached). The attendees represented the spectrum of endeavor in this field coming from academia, industry, and government laboratories, both U.S. and foreign scientists, senior researchers, young investigators, and students. Of the 59 attendees, 9 voluntarily responded to a general inquiry regarding ethnicity which appears on our registration forms. Of the 9 respondents, 44% were Minorities &ndash; 0% Hispanic, 33% Asian and 11% African American. Approximately   24% of the participants at the 2012 meeting were women.           In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.          Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
