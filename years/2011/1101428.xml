<AbstractNarration>The project addresses several open problems in the theory of partial differential equations. The problems arise primarily in the context of equations used in fluid mechanics (the Navier-Stokes equations and Euler's equations) or in the calculus of variations (regularity of minimizers of multi-dimensional variational integrals for vector-valued functions). For the Navier-Stokes equations the study will include the following areas of emphasis: (1) long-distance behavior of steady-state solutions; (2) regularity for special classes of solutions, such as the axi-symmetric solutions; and (3) regularity of related linear equations with low-regularity coefficients. In the case of Euler's equations, the project will focus on the following topics: (1) existence of periodic and quasi-periodic solutions; (2) the structure of the set of the steady-states of the two-dimensional equations; and (3) the relevance of various steady-states of the two-dimensional equations for two-dimensional statistical theories. The problems in the calculus of variations concern the stability of singularities. Unlike in the scalar case, the minimizers of regular variational functionals for vector-valued functions can have singularities. How stable are these singularities? This question will be addressed. The topic also has connections to nonlinear elasticity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical research in partial differential equations ultimately has a very practical goal, which is the understanding and prediction of behavior of solutions of the equations. For example, fluid flows are usually described by the Navier-Stokes equations. Do the solutions of these equations correctly describe what we see "in practice," and can we use the equations to make precise predictions about the flows? From what we know about these equations, the answers seem to be yes, but the mathematics of the equations is still not very well understood. Indeed, we do not yet have satisfactory mathematical explanations for the behavior of solutions that can be observed either in experiments or in computer simulations. The information we need to obtain from the computations can usually be formulated in simple and concrete terms. For instance, at what speed will an aircraft stall? The question is simple, whereas the behavior of the solutions underlying this question is complicated. Can we somehow manage the complexity by finding the most important mathematical parameters of the flow that are still "controlable"? When we study regularity of solutions, the situation is quite similar: there seems to be a very large spectrum of behaviors that solutions can exhibit. Can we obtain some control of the solutions by focusing on relatively few "right" parameters? What are the right parameters? This research project focuses on questions of this nature. If we can identify some good quantities that govern the behavior of the solutions and that we are able to control, then it becomes much easier to calculate the solutions themselves, since the theoretical information tells us where to focus our computational resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research concerns mathematical aspects of the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations for incompressible fluids (such as water). These equations play a very important role in science and engineering, but our mathematical understanding of them is incomplete. In particular, it is not known if the equations provide a self-consistent description of the fluid motion from the point of view of classical Newtonian mechanics: if a complete description of the the fluid is given at some time (in terms of classical mechanics), do the equation uniquely determine the future states of the fluid (in terms of classical mechanics, assuming the exterior forces are known)? If the answer to this question is negative, then the description of the fluids by the equations cannot be complete.    Important questions tied to the Navier-Stokes (and Euler) equations concern turbulence modelling.  Many flows of great practical interest are turbulent, and their computer simulation presents a tremendous challenge even for the biggest computers. The simulations are based on the Navier-Stokes equations.  Even if the answer to the above question about the complete (Newtonian) description of the fluid by the equations is positive, there is still the big practical problem of actually solving the equations (using computers). Even with the largest computers we have, the problem with turbulent flows is that there the structures arising in the flow have too small scale to be resolved, and one needs to resort to approximations in which we give up on solving the full equations.  The research supported by the award has aimed to address parts of both of these major problems. One major results concerns the so-called scale-invariant solutions, which is a special class of solutions with certain symmetry properties. The PI and one of his graduate students (which was partially supported by the award) solved a long-standing problem of global existence for these scale-invariance solutions, in the case of the large data. Previously the results were known only for small data. Moreover, the solution of the problem also showed a new perspective on the above-mentioned problem of the equations determining the evolution of the fluid completely.

This rules out the possibility of some hidden yet unknown estimates, and shows that certain relatively simple estimates about the solution which were obtained in classical papers of 1930s are in fact optimal (in domains in boundaries).  The research provided an ideal opportunity for training of graduate students, and ideal material for PhD theses.  The results of the research have been reported at national and international conferences and published in top peer reviewed journals.
