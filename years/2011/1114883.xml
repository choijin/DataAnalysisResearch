<AbstractNarration>The project supports a highly visible dissemination outlet for grant holders in the ATE, CCLI, STEP, and TUES programs, and in various EEC programs.  The investigators are organizing poster sessions at the American Society for Engineering Education's (ASEE) Annual Conference for 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. The project invites engineering grant award recipients in these programs to submit an abstract for inclusion in the poster session. Submissions are reviewed for quality and, if accepted, award recipients submit a paper that is published in the meeting proceedings and also present a poster in a special session at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Four poster sessions, each with over 100 participants, were run in June of 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In June of 2016 the poster session transitioned to a new PI who ran that session.  This proposal to the National Science Foundation (NSF) requested support for a highly visible dissemination outlet for grant holders in the Transforming Undergraduate Education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (TUES), the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI, former title now changed to TUES), Advanced Technological Education (ATE), Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion (STEP), and Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) Programs. We proposed to hold a poster session at the American Society for Engineering Education?s (ASEE) Annual Conference in June of each of the next four years (2012-2015). Grant award recipients from engineering in the two years previous to the conference were invited to submit an abstract for inclusion in the poster session. If accepted, they were invited to submit a paper for the proceedings and, again if accepted, present in the poster session. The PI ran events at ASEE?s annual conference since 1986, with NSF sponsorship since 1992. Including the STEP and EEC program grantees (starting in 2011) has increased participation by more than 50 %. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the success of the events was performed.  The Intellectual Merit of the proposal is allowing grantees and potential proposal writers in attendance to exchange ideas.  The Broader Impact on the engineering education community is the by-product of that exchange of ideas, as well as the added dissemination of the proceedings papers, and the resulting future proposals. In addition to the future proposals, an impact will be felt by having others adopt the ideas presented at the poster session and in the papers in their own educational programs.
