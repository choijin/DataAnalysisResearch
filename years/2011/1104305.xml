<AbstractNarration>The goals of the RapidTech National Center are to be a leader in technician education in additive manufacturing by providing professional development to faculty, teachers and incumbent workers; by creating, pilot testing and disseminating project-based modules and career pathways; and by developing successful approaches to obtaining and maintaining equipment for other colleges.  Rapid prototyping is emerging as a core enabling technology to support the design, development, and manufacturing of numerous products. A growing number of industries use rapid prototyping and rapid tooling.  Faculty members from a wide variety of STEM fields recognize this situation and are in need of curriculum materials and professional development that can support the swift introduction of rapid prototyping into their courses and programs.  Rapid prototyping models provide quick feedback for critical decision making that fully engage students and increase their interest and pedagogical focus. The Center is working with regional and local workforce agencies and school districts to interest student in careers in additive manufacturing. Using RapidTech's close relations with industry, a national survey of career opportunities in additive manufacturing is planned.   The Saddleback College Center is located at the University of California at Irvine.  The connection with UC Irvine ensures career pathways for students and provides intellectual underpinnings for the products of the Center.  The evaluation is providing metrics for determining the effectiveness of the Center's activities.</AbstractNarration>
