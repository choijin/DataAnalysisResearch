<AbstractNarration>The South Dakota State University Simulation and Analysis REU program will focus on simulation and analysis techniques in the context of mathematics and statistics, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Participating undergraduate students will gain a broad perspective of the theory and application of simulations, including the generation and validation of realistic physical models, the estimation of model parameters, and the prediction of salient physical phenomena. The student scholars will engage in research in computational fluid dynamics, photovoltaics, statistics, and computational sciences as they learn how mathematical models represent physical phenomena, how simulation methods are selected and implemented, and how simulation results are analyzed, interpreted, and utilized to gain insight into theoretical and applied problems. Research projects will involve 1) simulation tools in the context of engineering design and analysis; 2) state-of-the-art research tools in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, nanoscience, and computation; 3) statistical analysis based on real datasets and simulations; and 4) advanced numerical methods including parallel algorithms. This program will foster critical capabilities in young researchers through its emphasis on interdisciplinary research, publication, and scholarly presentations, as well as the responsible conduct of research. Skilled graduate assistant mentors will assist REU student scholars while advancing their own research agendas. In addition to conducting state-of-the-art research on current concerns, each undergraduate student will participate in a series of four integrated research ethics seminars and have the opportunity to attend at least one conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to construct, simulate, and analyze physical models is a critical aspect of modern scientific research and a skill of significant value in the 21st century workforce. Despite this need, many recent graduates do not possess the skills necessary to create and implement models appropriately. Competencies that students find particularly challenging include the generation and validation of realistic physical models, the estimation of model parameters, and the prediction of salient physical phenomena. This REU program will cultivate such competencies by engaging undergraduate students in hands-on research under the guidance of graduate student mentors and faculty advisors.  The objectives of the program are to enhance undergraduates? abilities to conduct innovative and ethical research and to learn and think independently, thereby improving their preparation for professional careers.  This program will further contribute to workforce development by not only encouraging undergraduate students to pursue graduate degrees in STEM fields, but also by increasing participation from under-represented populations. The program director will recruit a diverse pool of talented undergraduate participants from minority groups, veterans returning from active duty, and students enrolled in smaller regional colleges with limited research opportunities. The training, mentoring, research experience, and professional development provided by this REU program will attract and retain talented students to the STEM fields and will contribute to the development of an internationally competitive science and engineering workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly sponsored by NSF's Division of Mathematical Sciences and Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).</AbstractNarration>
