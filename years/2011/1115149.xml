<AbstractNarration>This project will create InvertNet, an on-line virtual museum comprising &gt;50 million insect and related arthropod specimens housed at 22 Midwestern institutions, focusing on the research theme of effects of land use changes on the biota of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi River drainage basins.  These collections document 160 years of environmental change and are an invaluable and irreplaceable resource but, at present, are largely inaccessible to scientists and the general public.  Most previous efforts to capture and disseminate invertebrate collection data have focused on label data alone.  InvertNet will use advanced digitization and networking technologies to capture and display 2D and 3D images of specimens and labels, and incorporate them into a searchable database. These new techniques should reduce the cost of digitizing insect specimens substantially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By allowing users to find and view detailed images of specimens of particular species and their associated data labels, InvertNet will provide universal access to collections previously restricted to researchers.  It will include links to the popular BugGuide.net insect identification website and to other biodiversity data portals used by researchers, educators, and the general public.  This will facilitate and support many aspects of biological research and education, including species discovery and identification, pest management, ecology and biogeography.  InvertNet will serve as a model, applicable to other kinds of biological collections, for the use of efficient, computer-assisted procedures to increase the speed and accuracy of collection data capture. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The InvertNet Thematic Collection Network aimed to create a virtual museum of invertebrate collections from collaborating institutions throughout the greater Midwestern U.S.  The University of Missouri portion of the project was to digitize the &gt;6 million specimen holdings of the Enns Entomology Museum, which includes small specimens of various taxa on microscope slides, adult Odonata in envelopes, immatures in alcohol vials and jars, and pinned adult insects in drawers.  Imaging of the samples has been completed and most of the 44,116 images have been uploaded to the InvertNet server.  The resulting images allow details of individual specimens to be examined online and reveal much of the data on labels.  Of particular interest among our holdings are over 4 million specimens of aquatic insects from throughout Missouri that were donated by the Missouri Department of Conservation and accessioned via a 1996 grant from NSF.      Broader Impacts  The broader impacts of the project are represented by contributions to scientific training and infrastructure.  More specifically, the project provided training opportunities for 18 undergraduate students in entomology and other biological science fields, most of whom were from traditionally underrepresented groups.  Many of these students continued on for graduate education following their experience with this project.  Contributions to scientific infrastructure are represented in the online presence of more than 3 million specimens from our collection in the InvertNet virtual museum.
