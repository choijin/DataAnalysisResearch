<AbstractNarration>It is increasingly recognized that at the molecular level nonlinear networks of heterogeneous molecules control many plant processes, so that systems biology provides a valuable approach in this field, building on the integration of experimental biology with mathematical modeling. One of the biggest challenges to making this integration a reality is that most plant biologists do not possess the mathematical background needed to build and manipulate mathematical models well enough to use them as tools for hypothesis generation. The goal of the project is to develop a network modeling tool, PlantSimLab, that enables plant biologists to build, validate, and use intuitive computer models, with a user interface that does not require mathematical or modeling expertise. No such tool is currently available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PlantSimLab is intended to play the role of a virtual laboratory, in which plant biologists can interrogate a computational model in ways similar to how it is done in the laboratory. The software will be developed in close collaboration with the plant biology community, through use cases that drive software capabilities and interface features. Finally, an extensive dissemination effort will be made to introduce the tool to plant biologists. The project will also leverage an ongoing outreach project that engages 9-12 year-old children across Virginia. The program, Kids' Tech University (KTU), brings 450 children to the Virginia Tech campus 4 times each year, where they interact with scientists, participate in hands-on laboratories, and, between campus events, explore a virtual space related to topics discussed on campus. The project will result in hands-on as well as virtual activities related to plant biology in general and the focus of the proposed project in particular.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was part of a collaboration among four instutitions. It aimed to produce a computational tool useful for creating models of signaling networks in plants. Our team would use the tool to create a model of the plant immunity signaling network. We had previously obtained a data set of the expression levels of essentially every plant gene over a seven point time course after immune response activation in a set of sixteen combinatorial plant immune signaling mutants. Through analysis of this very large data set, we found that simple mathematical models were inadequate to describe the network behavior. More complex models could not be derived because the number of time points was insufficient. Thus, the first outcome of the project was the understanding that the behavior of the plant immune signaling is extremely complex, so mathematical models cannot be derived without much more extensive data sets. In light of this, we analysed the data set differently. We applied a network reconstitution analysis to the expression pattern of each immune-responsive gene in the plant. This analysis showed that most genes are controlled by a combination of signaling sectors acting individually and interacting with each other. For most genes, the signaling interactions had larger effects than the effects of the sectors acting individually.
