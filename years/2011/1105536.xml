<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1105536&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Guofang  Wei &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal studies the geometry and topology of smooth metric&lt;br/&gt;measure spaces with Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature bounded from&lt;br/&gt;below and quasi-Einstein metrics.  The Bakry-Emery Ricci&lt;br/&gt;curvature is an important generalization of Ricci curvature for&lt;br/&gt;smooth metric measure space, which occurs naturally as the&lt;br/&gt;collapsed measured Gromov-Haudorff limit. Furthermore, the&lt;br/&gt;Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature plays important roles in a variety of&lt;br/&gt;topics such as the study of Ricci soliton, warped Einstein&lt;br/&gt;metric, diffusion process, logrithmic Sobolev inequality, as well&lt;br/&gt;as in the extension of Ricci curvature lower bound for metric&lt;br/&gt;measure space. The principal investigator will study the geometry&lt;br/&gt;of Ricci solitons; relation between comparison geometry and Ricci&lt;br/&gt;flow and obtaining a combined estimate for the first eigenvalue&lt;br/&gt;for Ricci positive and nonnegative lower bound.  The PI will also&lt;br/&gt;study the structures of the fundamental groups for manifolds with&lt;br/&gt;lower integral Ricci curvature bound as well as minimal volume of&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic orbifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature and Ricci soliton play a very&lt;br/&gt;important role in Ricci flow, which led to the solution of&lt;br/&gt;Poincare conjecture.  Quasi-Einstein metrics is are important&lt;br/&gt;both in mathematics and physics.  Smooth metric measure space is&lt;br/&gt;also related to optimal transport, information geometry, discrete&lt;br/&gt;geometry. The proposed activities would have impact on all these&lt;br/&gt;directions.  The fundamental group is the most fundamental (as&lt;br/&gt;the name implies) topological information. Its understanding will&lt;br/&gt;greatly advance the study of the effect of curvature bounds on&lt;br/&gt;the global topology of Riemannian manifolds, therefore will be&lt;br/&gt;helpful in answering questions about the shape of the universe.</AbstractNarration>
