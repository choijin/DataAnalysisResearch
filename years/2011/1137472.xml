<AbstractNarration>The University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) HBCU-UP project is designed to increase retention and persistence in STEM and strengthen student preparation for graduate school and the workforce. The project intends to build a strong foundation for incoming UVI STEM students through activities to increase pass rate in developmental courses and to increase student preparedness for Calculus by a Math Behind the Science Summer Bridge Program including course-taking in computer programming and mentoring and training of students to understand the expectations for success in STEM education and careers. Strategies selected to achieve these objectives resulted from a thorough literature review of evidenced-based practices and tailored for the specific context of the institution. Peer Led Team Learning (PLTL) will be employed as a strategy to increase pass rate in developmental courses. The project has specific targets for STEM retention and graduation rate increases. A comprehensive set of strategies to achieve the retention and graduation rate goals include creation and/or delivery of 1. A special STEM freshman development course, 2. Summer Sophomore Research Institute (SSRI), 3. Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE), 4. Academic year HBCU-UP Research Scholar (AHRS), 5. Faculty professional development in STEM student advising and mentoring, and 6. A STEM Resource Center.</AbstractNarration>

The following programs make up the UVI-CARP program.  Math Behind the Science Summer Bridge; STEM freshman development courses; Peer Led Team Learning (PLTL); Summer Sophomore Research Institutes (SSRI); Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE)     INTELLECTUAL MERIT MATH BEHIND THE SCIENCE  The Math Behind the Science (MBS) summer bridge program was a residential 6-week course designed to enhance the mathematics preparedness and mathematics competencies of college-bound students who were interested in pursuing careers in STEM. Specifically, the program prepared high school graduates to enter introductory college level calculus courses and provided a foundation for success in other STEM courses. PEER LED TEAM LEARNING     Peer-led Team Learning (PLTL) is a model for undergraduate instruction that introduces a peer-led workshop as an integral part of a course (Gosser Jr. &amp; Roth, 1998; Gosser Jr. D. R., Kampmeier, Strozak, Varma-Nelson, Radel, &amp; Weiner, 1996; Gosser Jr., Cracolice, Kampmeier, Roth, &amp; Varma-Nelson, 2001).  Research shows that peer-led team learning improves students? performance in science and mathematics courses (Parkinson, 2009; Subramanian, Cates, and Gutarts, 2009).     At the beginning of the UVI CARP program, in 2012, pass rates were compared for those courses that included a PLTL component and those that did not.  The pass rates for PLTL supported courses were higher than non-PLTL courses. The pass rate for PLTL courses was significantly higher than for non-PLTL courses.  Because of the demonstrated benefits, PLTL sessions were incorporated into every section of all developmental mathematics courses.     SUMMER UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH     Working with a faculty mentor, students participated in appropriate summer research projects: Summer Sophomore Research Institute for rising sophomores and juniors, and Summer Undergraduate Research Experience for advanced rising juniors and rising seniors.  The STEM confidence and self-efficacy was administered to a subset of students who participated in the SURE and SSRI program.  There was a statistically significant difference between the pre- and post survey responses to two questions on the survey. An analysis of these results shows that because of the SURE program students? confidence to understand STEM topics and to explain science information learned to another person increased.    FACULTY MENTORING  Empirical data show that faculty mentors perceive that they support students and encourage them. The support and encouragement foster a ?special relationship? between faculty and students. For instance, one faculty mentor commented, "I yell eureka in the lab" referring to her excitement when students master a specific laboratory skill. Another faculty mentor stated, "I get excited and offer encouragement" and another commented, "They learn that you don?t go away" and "They feel that faculty are there for them." Other indicators of the special relationship include faculty mentors talking to students, spending time with them, engaging students as colleagues, and recommending that students seek peer support. BROADER IMPACTS:  An analysis of quantitative and qualitative data collected from show that the UVI CARP program accomplished the goals and objectives set forth.
