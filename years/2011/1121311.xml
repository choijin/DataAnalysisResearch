<AbstractNarration>Scientific merit.  Filamentous fungi are the primary degraders of plant cell wall material in the environment. Some species are associated with the roots of plant species in a symbiotic relationship that allows plants to gain micronutrients from soil. Other fungal species are disease-causing agents in plants or animal/humans. Filamentous fungi, both beneficial and pathogenic species, grow by tip extension, branching and hyphal fusion to form an interconnected hyphal network. This hyphal network is believed to be essential for transfer of nutrients throughout ecosystems by root associated and saprophytic fungi and for colony establishment and exploitation of resources in pathogenic fungi. Studies on the filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, have revealed a complex and carefully regulated biological process of germling/hyphal fusion. During chemotropic interactions prior to cell fusion, published studies have shown that the alternating oscillation of signaling proteins from the tip of one fusion cell to its partner provides a compelling model for signaling between genetically identical cells.  Physiological differences occur over a short time period and are associated with signal transduction feedback mechanisms.  From these studies, it is evident that N. crassa uses a secreted chemical language to coordinate chemotropic interactions and cell fusion. The first objective of this project is to elucidate the signaling mechanisms and the language that filamentous fungi use to coordinate development of their hyphal network.  Cell fusion is an important developmental process during mating and during tissue formation (i.e. the formation of multinucleate muscle cells and osteoclasts), although the mechanisms associated with cell-cell fusion are not well characterized.  A second objective of this work is to identify additional components necessary for cell wall disassembly/membrane merger (fusogens). The ultimate goal of this work is to understand how the formation of the hyphal network allows a fungal individual to perform the physiological and developmental processes required to compete in nature and to complete its life cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact.  Hyphal fusion in filamentous fungi is comparable to cell fusion events between genetically identical cells resulting in syncytia, such as myoblast fusion during muscle differentiation, trophoblast fusion during placental development and between osteoclasts during bone formation. Thus, studying cell-cell fusion in N. crassa provides a useful model for understanding molecular mechanisms of cell fusion events in more complex eukaryotic species. This project is an excellent training project as it incorporates live cell imaging techniques and microscopy, as well as genetics, biochemistry, genomics and molecular biology.  It is expected that undergraduate researchers will be co-authors on research papers, as for previous NSF awards. The cell biological work on germling/hyphal fusion will continue collaborations with a mathematician interested in fluid dynamics, a bio-nanotechnologist, and amateur mycologists. A French television documentary that focuses on the analysis and function of a filamentous fungal hyphal network is currently being developed in collaboration with French documentarians.</AbstractNarration>

And third, an exploration into fungal communication via identification and characterization of the ligand/receptor associated with chemotropic interactions and cell fusion.              Research articles funded by this award are noted below.  Specific Objectives.  A. Dissecting the oscillation of signaling components during cell fusion. The goal of this objective was to determine the mechanism and requirements for oscillation of proteins required for chemotropic interactions during cell fusion. To facilitate this goal, we used a discovery-based approach to identify phosphorylation targets of a kinase (MAK-2), as well as a targeted approach to determine which components of the MAK-2 kinase pathway oscillate during chemotropic interactions. A phosphoproteomics study in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory was conducted and direct phosphorylation targets of MAK-2 that were essential for cell fusion were identified, including a highly conserved scaffold protein (HAM-5), which assembles signal transduction components (Leeder et al., Genetics 2013; Jonkers et al., PLoS Genet 2014). Germinated asexual spores undergo cooperative behavior (Richards et al., Biol Letts 2012) and an inability to undergo cell fusion is detrimental for the ability of a fungal colony to share resources (Simonin et al., Eukaryot Cell 2012). Hyphal network formation is required for maintaining genetic diversity by mixing flows of nuclei. Mathematical modeling and cell biological and genetic experiments revealed the exquisite hydraulic engineering necessary to create the mixing flows (Roper et al., PNAS 2013). Finally, by assessing genome wide natural variation in wild populations, new components of the cell fusion pathway were identified (Palma-Guerrero PLoS Genet 2013).    B. Identification of targets of PP-1, a transcription factor required for germling/hyphal fusion, and a predicted target of the MAK-2 kinase signal transduction pathway. Signal transduction through the MAK-2 pathway is required for the initiation of germling fusion, resulting in the activation of a transcription factor (PP-1). PP-1 was shown to be directly required for the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in chemotropism and cell wall disassembly/membrane merger (Leeder et al., Genetics 2013).          C. Characterization of components required for cell wall disassembly/membrane merger. Mechanisms of plasma membrane merger in eukaryotic cells, for example during muscle development and fertilization, remains obscure, with few true "fusogens" identified. To identify potential candidates for cell wall disassembly/membrane merger in N. crassa, we performed targeted analysis of genes p...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
