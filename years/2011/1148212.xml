<AbstractNarration>Over the last 25 years cosmic ray produced (cosmogenic) radionuclide techniques for earth sciences have revolutionized the understanding of processes at the Earth's surface.  Most of these investigations utilize in-situ produced cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al in quartz, due in part to the ubiquity of this mineral, and in part because of the availability of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) sample preparation protocols that are accessible to the earth science community.  Since the development of the method, measurements of 10Be and 26Al in quartz have been used to provide empirical constraints and answer fundamental outstanding questions throughout the fields of geomorphology, climatology, archaeology, ecology, seismology, and geophysics.  This investigation will develop a routine, robust standardized approach for measuring multiple cosmogenic nuclides in the iron oxide, magnetite, providing a powerful new tool for earth scientists working across many disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

Since the development of the method, measurements of 10Be and 26Al in quartz have been used to provide empirical constraints and answer fundamental outstanding questions throughout the fields of geomorphology, climatology, and geophysics.  This proposed investigation develops standardize approach for measuring multiple cosmogenic nuclides in a single iron oxide sample (magnetite), providing a powerful new tool for earth science community.  We demonstrate clean mineral separation/purification and chemical separation of cosmogenic nuclides from magnetite. We achieved a silicate contamination level of ~0.05 %.  This is much better than a contamination level of ~ a few % achieved in previous studies, but still higher than the optimal level of 0.01 %.  High-energy neutron cross-section measurements are extremely important for understanding the fundamental process and rates of the production of cosmogenic nuclides in terrestrial and extraterrestrial materials.  We use a unique neutron experimental hall where high-energy neutrons (up to 400 MeV) are produced from a Ring-cyclotron at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics in Osaka University, Japan.  Measurements of short and long half-lived radionuclides are continuously processed in high purity targets from 80 MeV to 400 MeV neutron irradiations.  However, the final results of cross section measurements will take several more years to finish.           We continue to encounter difficulties in finding a qualified candidate who possesses the required analytical wet chemistry skills needed to perform this project.
