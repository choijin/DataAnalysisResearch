<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division supports Professor Jeffrey Rack at Ohio University for studies into  the development of photochromic ruthenium sulfoxide complexes. Photochromism in these compounds arises from conversion between isomers in which the sulfoxide is bonded to the ruthenium through sulfur and ones in which the sulfoxide is attached to the ruthenium through oxygen.  New examples of these compounds will be synthesized to test the role of sterically-hindered ligands on the excited state rate constant for the isomerization. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy will be employed to determine the rate constants along with their wavelength, solvent and temperature dependence. Identification of intermediates on the femtosecond and picosecond timescale is an important goal. Complexes that feature two-color reversible photochromism will be incorporated into polymers that will feature photomechanical effects. Such effects are exceptionally rare and a new procedure for measuring strain in polymers featuring photomechanical effects will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students associated with this project will be trained in the areas of inorganic, physical, analytical and organic chemistry. The multi-disciplinary nature of the project will demand that the student be aware of literature contributions in disparate research areas. Involvement of underrepresented groups is also a genuine goal of this project. Ohio University is located in Athens, OH a rural, chronically economically depressed area in Appalachia. Ohio University is deeply committed to the education and training of a student population with a significantly higher than national prevalence of low-income, first generation college students. Indeed, of those undergraduate students performing research in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, 40% are from one of the 29 counties in Appalachia. The students associated with this project will be involved in a number of divisional, departmental, College, University and Community outreach and interactive programs.</AbstractNarration>
