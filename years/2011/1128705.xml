<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop signal processing system design solutions to enable high-performance and low-cost hybrid solid-state/magnetic hard disk drives with beyond 1 Tbit per square inch areal density. The proposed research aims to cohesively develop powerful signal processing algorithms and low-cost VLSI architecture solutions that can simultaneously address the low signal-to-media-noise ratio and high system fault tolerance implementation cost faced by the emerging hybrid shingled written recording systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the theme of developing unified signal processing system design solutions from both theory and practical implementation perspectives. New non-controllable trellis-based finite-state detectors and their efficient VLSI architectures will be developed to address the loss of signal-to-media-noise ratio caused by shingled writing. A unified read channel design approach and a data-management-aware signal processing strategy will be further developed to reduce the overall system signal processing implementation cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed research is that it will enable the development of low-cost ultra-high capacity mass data storage drives to accommodate the exploding global data volume. It also contributes greatly to sustaining the historical magnetic recording areal density growth rate, providing a direct benefit to this strategically important high technology sector critical to the economic health of the nation. Extra effort will be made to recruit women and other under-represented groups as research assistants in this project, involve representatives of the Pacific Islander minority as undergraduate researchers, and reach out to high school students as part of outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The data storage industry is in a paradigm-shift period. The disk drives (which used to be the main means of storing data) are slowly, but surely, being replaced by solid state drives whose storage mechanisms are not magnetic, but rather electronic, most commonly in the form of NAND flash memories. Disk drives will not be entirely replaced though. It is very likely that disk drives will continue to exist mostly as cloud storage devices.

In this environment, it is paramount to develop a good understanding of channel models both for shingled magnetic recording and flash memories, as well as develop signal processing and coding methods to cope with the demands of the novel channels, which is what this project accomplished.       A) Shingled magnetic recording is a promising option to sustain the historical areal density growth of hard disk drives while retaining conventional heads and media. Nevertheless, highly scaled shingled magnetic recording is subject to severe intertrack interference (ITI), fewer grains per channel bit and therefore lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This naturally demands two-dimensional (2-D) read channel signal processing, which has an inherently large spectrum of detection performance versus computational complexity tradeoff. By concurrently detecting multitrack readback signals from a read head array, joint 2-D signal detection can fully utilize the 2-D interference to maximize the detection performance at the penalty of the highest computational complexity. In the past, multitrack joint 2-D detection has not been thoroughly studied from either the detection performance or silicon implementation perspective because of the justifiable concern on its practical feasibility. To fill this missing link, we conducted a comprehensive study of multitrack joint 2-D signal detection performance and silicon implementation cost.

By carrying out comprehensive simulations and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design, we showed that multitrack joint 2-D signal detection is a practically attractive option with superior detection performance and affordable silicon cost, especially when considering projected CMOS technology scaling toward 16 nm and below.      B) We derived the optimal detector for multilevel cell (MLC) flash memory channels with intercell interference (ICI). We started with a simple MLC channel model and just slightly altered the model to guarantee mathematical tractability of the optimal detectors (maximum likelihood and maximum a-posteriori sequence and symbol detectors). The optimal detector is obtained by computing branch metrics using Fourier transforms of analytically computable characteristic functions (corresponding to likelihood functions).

A patent application was filed, and is presently in the review process.      C)  In the write process of multilevel per cell (MLC) flash memories, an iterative approach is used to mitigate the monotonicity problem. The monotonicity in programming is considered to be the major restriction in MLC flash. To solve this issue, an iterative approach called "incremental step pulse programming (ISPP)" is used to concurrently program lots of cells in small steps.
