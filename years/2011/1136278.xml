<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative award to advance mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) science by developing and operating advanced upper atmospheric lidar instruments.  The Consortium of Resonance and Rayleigh Lidars (CRRL) includes six universities:  the University of Colorado (CU) hosts the CRRL director and the unique CRRL Technology Center (CTC); the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in collaboration with Embry-Riddle University operates the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) in Cerro Pach√≥n, Chile; Northwest Research Associates/CoRA Division contributes to the operation of the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR) in Norway; and Utah State University (USU) in collaboration with Colorado State University (CSU) operates a sodium lidar in Utah.  The increasing number of middle and upper atmosphere observing stations around the globe, and the recent increase in data assimilation schemes for numerical models, indicates the growing movement in the community to address the middle and upper atmosphere as a global system requiring studies spanning a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  The Na resonance wind and temperature (Na W/T) lidar technique, central to CRRL, provides fundamental measurements of the MLT region at temporal and spatial resolutions that are difficult to achieve by other means.  As a result, Na W/T lidars have yielded fundamental advances in our understanding of MLT dynamics, thermal structure, chemistry, and microphysics that were previously impossible.  They are, therefore, key instruments for achieving the community goals of whole atmosphere modeling and system science studies.  The effort will consolidate and advance middle and upper atmosphere lidar systems leading to 1) improved coordination, performance, and scientific productivity of the three Na lidars currently at low, middle, and high latitudes, 2) more rapid and more efficient advances in lidar technology developments, implementations, and transfers, 3) active education and training, guest investigator, and outreach programs to educate future researchers and broaden the lidar user base in the upper atmosphere community, and 4) a coordinated vision and plan for the upper atmosphere lidar community.  The expanded measurement capabilities and community involvement anticipated within RRL, especially the ability of the Na lidars to measure both temperature and winds day and night, and the ability of the lidars to support and enhance correlative instrumentation at key sites, will ensure the maximum scientific benefit and the broadest possible applications of these systems.  Finally, CTC technology developments will strive to ensure the most efficient and comprehensive utilization of advancing technologies to the benefit of lidar research within and outside of CRRL.  The CRRL activities will have a broad impact 1) by enhancing the infrastructure for middle and upper atmosphere research and 2) by defining a new means of educating, managing and coordinating correlative research activities.  The greatest research benefits will occur through comprehensive and coordinated studies that merge multiple data sets and diverse scientific interests which will enable the greatest scientific return on the research investment.  CTC technology developments will also benefit from, and be of benefit to, technology developments currently outside the Aeronomy community.  The anticipated CRRL education, training, and guest investigator programs will ensure a group of talented and enthusiastic users to pursue lidar developments and applications in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) is an upper atmosphere observatory established in 2009 in northern Chile in the Andes mountains.  It?s goal is to make long-term measurements of the upper atmosphere in the 80-110 km altitude range using ground-based remote sensing instruments.  This region is at the top of the mesosphere and the bottom of the thermosphere, often considered as the boundary between the atmosphere and space.. It is where many complex physics and chemistry processes occur, and is often referred to as the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT).  Because of the huge density difference between the lower atmosphere and the MLT (5-6 orders of magnitude), small perturbations in the lower atmosphere can have very large impact on MLT.  Measurements of atmospheric perturbations in this region are therefore critically important to understand their influence to the space environment.   Unlike most space based measurements, ground-based instruments stay at one location so they can measure MLT at very high temporal resolutions and cover long periods of time.  This is very important for detecting fast changing perturbations on the time scales of a few minutes to a few hours.  The ALO location is ideal for both optical observation and science.  The dry climate means year-around clear skies, allowing long time observations.  The high Andes mountains are a major source of atmospheric perturbations because the disruption of wind near the surface generates so-called mountain waves that propagate up and strongly influence the MLT.  The central instrument at ALO is a sodium lidar, which can measure vertical profiles of sodium density, atmospheric wind and temperature at very high resolutions (500 meters in vertical, 1 minute in time).  There are only a handful of such lidars around the world, and the ALO sodium lidar is the only one in South America.  It makes measurements by pointing a yellow laser beam into the sky, and using telescopes and sensitive electronics to collect the very weak light scattered back by a layer of sodium in the 80-110 km region created by meteoric ablation.  In addition, ALO also has several CCD cameras used to detect faint light emissions naturally occuring in the MLT.   These instruments are operated only during the nights and when the moon light is low.   They work together to provide comprehensive measurements of the atmosphere variations.   Figure 1 is a picture of the ALO site when the sodium lidar was in operation.  The laser was pointed to three directions in order to measure the wind speeds in different directions.    The major tasks in this project are to operate the sodium lidar, manage the ALO facility to support other instrument operations, and conduct scientific research using the data collected.  Unlike those CCD cameras, the sodium lidar requires an onsite operator.  The ALO team operated the lidar in 2-4 campaigns per year with two weeks in each campaign.  A total of about 1400 hours data have been collected in 17 campaigns and cover all 12 calendar months.   The data quality was significantly improved since May 2014 after an aging laser was replaced with an advanced solid state laser.   Figure 2 is an example of the lidar data collected in one night in April 2015,  It shows fine vertical structures and rapid changes of all quantities. These data are being used by both the ALO team and the broader science community to investigate the MLT processes.    The research activities focus on the effect of small scales perturbations (called gravity waves) on the MLT.  How these waves propagate through MLT, how they break and influence the background atmosphere, and how they interact with the many chemical processes were investigated.  A total of 9 peer-reviewed journal papers have been published on these results.  One special finding is the frequent occurrence of small amount of sodium above the normal 80-105 km region, as shown in the left in Figure 3.  This finding is both scientifically interesting and beneficial for lidar observation.  It enables extension of the measurement up to 140 km, as shown in the right in Figure 3.  This more than doubles the vertical extent of wind measurement that no other instrument could make.   Three PhD students at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University were trained and graduated through participating research in this project.  The data collected have also be made available to the science community for broader research interests.  With the proven operation record and science productivity, the ALO facility is shown to be an important asset for the research in the MLT.
