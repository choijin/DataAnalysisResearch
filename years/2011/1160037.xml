<AbstractNarration>The Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports this Workshop that will be led by Professor Sarah Larsen of the University of Iowa. This proposal requests funding for a Chemistry REU PI Workshop in the Summer of 2012, which is three years after a successful 2009 Workshop. In addition, the event will coincide with the 25th anniversary of the NSF REU Program. The objective of the 2012 PI Workshop is to bring together the Chemistry REU PI community to facilitate interaction and exchange of ideas in formal and informal settings. This gathering will also inform and engage Chemistry REU PIs about critical issues, such as broadening participation, methods for program evaluation, and research ethics. Sharing effective REU practices will be highlighted and, through breakout sessions, an action plan for issues the Leadership Group (LG) needs to address in the coming years will be developed. The timeliness of this Workshop will also allow the celebration of 25 years of successful REU programs at NSF. The Workshop will be evaluated using a post-workshop evaluation form and a final Workshop Report will be prepared and disseminated to the NSF and to the Chemistry REU community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of REU programs involve broadening participation by students in groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science and especially in chemistry. The PI workshop will provide PIs with examples of effective strategies for recruitment of underrepresented students to their programs. Establishing a sustainable mechanism to connect students from the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation in STEM (LSAMP) with REU programs is another expected outcome of the Workshop. Challenges and strategies associated with recruiting other nontraditional student groups such as students with disabilities and community college students will also be addressed at the Workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The main activity of this project was the Chemistry Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Principle Investigator (PI) meeting that was held July 11-13, 2012 at the Drury Plaza Hotel in San Antonio, Texas. The meeting was organized by the Chemistry REU Leadership Group (LG).  The meeting was attended by a total of 52 participants including REU Principal Investigators or site directors, invited speakers, and National Science Foundation (NSF) personnel. The workshop was divided into three main sessions focused on Strategies for Broadening Participation, Evaluation and Assessment and Current REU Topics.  Each of the main sessions included two or more oral presentations, followed by focused breakout sessions and concluded with reports from the breakout sessions.     The following activities directly resulted from action items proposed during the Chemistry REU PI meeting:  A) January 8, 2013: Follow-up REU LG Meeting to discuss action items from the PI meeting. The Chemistry REU LG met in Arlington, VA on January 8, 2013.  Art Hicks from the LSAMP met with the LG to discuss ways to increase interaction between Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program and Chemistry REU programs.  A meeting of selected LSAMP directors is planned for the national ACS meeting in April 2013.      B) April, 2013: National American Chemical Society (ACS) meeting in New Orleans, LA. Two events were held at the National ACS meeting in New Orleans in April, 2013.  A symposium was held on how to run a Chemistry REU program for current and prospective PIÃ†s and a meeting were held between Chemistry REU LG group  representatives and LSAMP representatives to discuss ways to increase interactions in the future.     Broader Impacts:  The focus of the proposed workshop was on Chemistry REU programs and how research opportunities are effectively provided to undergraduates through these programs. An important goal of REU programs is to broaden participation by students in groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science; and the PI workshop provided PIs with examples of effective strategies for recruitment of underrepresented students to their programs.  Working toward establishing a sustainable mechanism to connect students from LSAMP with REU programs was another outcome of the workshop.  Challenges and strategies associated with recruiting other nontraditional student groups such as students with disabilities and community college students were also addressed at the workshop.
