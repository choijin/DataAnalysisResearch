<AbstractNarration>This project has two strands: algebraic versus geometric invariants of groups, and exploring non-positively curved groups. Both fall within the orbit of Gromov's study of infinite discrete groups through large-scale geometry, heavily driven by parallels with Riemannian geometry.  The first focuses on filling invariants, which concern the geometric features of discs spanning loops ("soap film geometry") in spaces associated with groups. The second concerns how notions of non-positive curvature in group theory interrelate and the wildness present in non?positively curved groups, particularly in their conjugacy problems and subgroups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work falls within the subject of Geometric Group Theory, which concerns infinite groups and the spaces on which they act. Its roots lie in the early 20th century, particularly in low-dimensional and algebraic topology. It has taken off since the late 1980s when it became clear that geometric features of the spaces involved have profound repercussions for the algebraic structure of the groups. Rich interactions have ensued with, for example, Riemannian geometry, probability, Lie groups, dynamical systems, ergodic theory, combinatorics, computer science and logic.  In addition to the research work, a course in Geometry and Topology will be deigned for undergraduates whose studies who are not primarily concentrated in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This project was on a topics in Geometric Group Theory, which concerns infinite groups and the spaces on which they act. Its roots lie in the early 20th century, particularly in low-dimensional and algebraic topology.

This project had two outstanding outcomes.  The first was the production (with O. Baker) of an example of a "hyperbolic group" and subgroup for which there is no "Cannon&ndash;Thurston map".  A  group is hyperbolic when it displays exclusively negative curvature.  Hyperbolic groups (and spaces) have  been studied fruitfully via their "boundaries" - that is, by studying the routes off to infinity.  When one hyperbolic space sits inside another, one can examine how the boundary of the first sits inside that of each other.  This has proved productive and influential in the study of 3-manifolds.  However what we show that this breaks down in the greater generality of groups.    Baker and the PI also investigated the relationship between Cannon&ndash;Thurston maps and subgroup distortion. We proved that Cannon&ndash;Thurston maps are well-defined (that is, subgroup inclusion induces a map of the boundaries) for heavily distorted free subgroups inside the family of hyperbolic groups known as hyperbolic hydra.
