<AbstractNarration>Concerns about changes in the world's environment have led scientists from many different nations to collaborate on a broad range of research and training activities.  The International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP)is overseen by the International Council of Science (ICSU) with cooperation from the International Social Science Council (ISSC).  IHDP seeks to provide international leadership in framing, developing, and integrating social science research on global environmental change and to promote the application of the key findings of this research.  IHDP's activities focus on development of themes for focused research and long-term collaborative efforts.  IHDP has developed an international research programme that enhances the involvement of the social sciences in global change issues and contributes to a heightened awareness of the human dimensions of global change.  The IHDP Strategic Plan 2007-2015 details the main objectives of the Programme, which is currently in the middle of Phase II of its operations. Further, the Secretariat continues to strengthen IHDP's three core pillars of work by facilitating cutting-edge research, developing global scientific capacity, and supporting interaction between science and policy.  IHDP aims to enhance basic understand about the factors influencing as well as the impacts and potential responses of global environmental change (1) by mobilizing, catalyzing and integrating social science research into the largely natural sciences-dominated environmental change debate; (2) by strengthening the capacities of research and policy communities; and (3) by facilitating and strengthening dialogue between science and policy.  This award will help provide support for the IHDP Secretariat, which coordinates IHDP at the United National University in Bonn, Germany. The IHDP Secretariat facilitates IHDP's Programme and implements the strategic priorities.  Its core functions encompass coordination of research activities, capacity building, organization of major events and policy dialogues, and dissemination of outcomes and results of IHDP activities. Core support for the IHDP and its Secretariat is provided by NSF on behalf of agencies participating in the multi-agency U.S. Climate Change Research Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through support of the IHDP, a solid investment is made in the infrastructure that fosters broader and deeper international, interdisciplinary collaborative networks.  This further strengthens scientific inquiry across a range of topics and projects, thereby helping to enhance fundamental knowledge about very important topics and issues.  Through its capacity-building activities, especially support for activities that education and involve more scientists from developing nations, the IHDP also facilitates a strengthening and diversification of the international scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
