<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS 11-39364&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Nelson, Tracy W.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Brigham Young University&lt;br/&gt;Title:  RAPID/IUCRC: An International University Collaborative Research Program between NSF/IUCRC CFSP Center and Tohoku University  &lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID project, enabling graduate students from the Kokawa Laboratory from Tohoku University in Japan to go to Brigham Young University (BYU) to use the facilities and equipment available within the CFSP (Center for Friction Stir Processing, an NSF ENG I/UCRC) to continue performing essential research for short periods of time (2-6 weeks), responds to the disaster in the labs caused by the March 11 earthquake  in Japan. Sensitive Optical and electron microscopy equipment were rendered unusable and are currently not on the priority list for immediate repair. Thus, the project aims to satisfy the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;- Enable students to continue their research;&lt;br/&gt;- Engage graduate, undergraduate, and underrepresented students and faculty from five different countries in an international collaborative effort; &lt;br/&gt;- Expose students to a wider breadth of research and development in FSW&amp;P;&lt;br/&gt;-        Expand international networking opportunities; and&lt;br/&gt;-        Enlarge the international database of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) processes and practices.&lt;br/&gt;The research work at both universities has a long history of producing outstanding intellectual results, as evidenced by more than 60 publications in Tohoku and more than 30 at BYU in this area in recent years. While at BYU, the students will be performing joint research in:&lt;br/&gt;- FSW of steels, stainless steels, and titanium alloys,&lt;br/&gt;- Tooling for FRW&amp;P, and&lt;br/&gt;- Grain boundary engineering.&lt;br/&gt;The USA researchers collaborate with the Japanese investigators from Tohuku University, Dr. Hiroyuki Kokawa and Dr. Yutaka Sato. The former has co-authored a relevant book in the area, while the latter has spent a sabbatical year at BYU. Thus, a useful collaboration already exists. A letter of support and biographical sketch of the Japanese collaborator is included in the supplementary document.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Students representing five different countries, along with faculty from Japan and USA will be engaged in this international collaborative research effort. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be invited to present their work to more than 20 industrial sponsors from around the world during annual and semi-annual CFSP meetings. The research will be broadly disseminated in the technical community in the form of journal papers and technical presentations.&lt;br/&gt;Obviously, contributing equipment to help in the completion of on-going research should enhance the USA students while enabling the exchange of ideas. In general, the project also contributes to train graduate and undergraduate students exposing them to high-impact application areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objectives of the program are to: 1) enable students at Tohoku University the ability to continue their research, 2) engage graduate, undergraduate and underrepresented students and faculty from five different countries in an international collaborative research effort, and 3) expose students to a wider breadth of research and development in FSW&amp;P.  Seven students from the Kokawa Laboratory at Tohoku University were able to come to BYU during the past 24 months.  Students from both BYU and the Kokawa Laboratory had the opportunity interact on various FSW&amp;P programs at BYU.  BYU is the Lead site for the Center for Friction Stir Processing (CFSP): a National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Program.  BYU and Kokawa Laboratory students engaged and participated on various on-going programs here at BYU.  The incremental funding provided by NSF to support the international exchange were invaluable.  All the objectives of this program were met or exceeded.  International cooperation was enhanced, and support provided to students and faculty in an area distressed by natural disaster was greatly appreciated.  Although the scientific outcomes may not be as evident at this time, the effect this program had on the lives of students and faculty at Tohoku University is clearly evident.
