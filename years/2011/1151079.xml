<AbstractNarration>In this CAREER project, supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Poul Petersen of Cornell University will examine the ultrafast dynamics of interfacial water with new advanced nonlinear optical spectroscopic methods. A wealth of phenomena encompassing reactions in the atmosphere, biological processes, and proton transfer in fuel cells take place on/at wet hydrated surfaces. While it is increasingly recognized that water is not a passive solvent but plays an integral role in such processes, we do not have a good understanding of either the structure or the dynamics of interfacial water and how these are influenced by the chemical nature of the surface. This research program aims to attain such an understanding by directly measuring the ultrafast dynamics of interfacial water. This goal will be reached by developing coherent surface-specific two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. This technique is able to directly measure the couplings and dynamics of the OH stretching vibration of interfacial water molecules, which are a sensitive measure of the hydrogen-bonding dynamics. Using a scaffold of self-assembled monolayers, the chemical nature of the interface will be tuned to obtain the structure-function relationship between the surface properties and the interfacial water dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result of this research program will impact a diverse set of areas involving chemical processes at wet surfaces. The graduate and undergraduate students involved in the research will be trained in both highly technical optical instrumentation and chemical functionalization of surfaces. Given the majority of female students in the research group, this research program will, in addition, contribute to train and retain female scientists. The hands-on outreach component of this program will target middle and high school students and teachers. Drawing on the optical expertise of the PI, a microscopy/optics module will be developed to engage and excite students and teachers about using light to examine the world around us.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under the National Science Foundation CAREER grant CHE-1151079, the Petersen Group at Cornell University has studied the structure and very fast dynamics of water at surfaces and in biological settings.  Water exhibit a series of unusual properties, including a density maximum at 4oC, causing ice to float rather than sink. The unusual properties are due to the structure and rapid fluctuations of the hydrogen-bonded network within water, which connect the water molecules together.  In biological and technological systems, water is in contact with a variety of different surfaces. These surfaces perturb the hydrogen-bonded network causing water at surfaces and in biological settings to exhibit different properties than in the bulk. Since hydration is critical to the structure and function of such systems, we need to understand how water behaves at surfaces. However, few experimental methods can single out molecular layers of water molecules at surface and characterize the structure and dynamics of the hydrogen-bonded network.  The CAREER grant resulted in the development of a series of advanced laser experiments involving multiple laser pulses to characterize the structure and dynamics of water at interfaces and in biological systems. These methods are focused on characterizing the vibrations of the OH bonds in water that inform about the hydrogen-bonded network. These experiments allow for singling out water at surfaces and in biological systems and characterize the structure and dynamics of the hydrogen-bonded network, thus providing the foundation for understanding the properties of water in such systems.  Using these advanced spectroscopic methods, a chiral water spiral wrapped around DNA was discovered and characterized. This means that the iconic helical structure of DNA is templated onto the surrounding water structure to create a water helix. In addition to showing that chiral (helical) structures can be transferred from biomolecules to water, this provides a new method for directly characterizing water in contact with biomolecules.  The new spectroscopic method provides the means for systematically studying how water behaves at interfaces and in biological settings, which will have a large impact in the fundamental understanding of a wide range of biological and technological systems such a fuel cell membranes.  The new methods can be applied to study the dynamics of molecules at a wide range of applications.
