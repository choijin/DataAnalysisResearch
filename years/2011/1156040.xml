<AbstractNarration>2012 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Bioanalytical Sensors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant application seeks partial support for the GRC on Bioanalytical Sensors, to be held at Salve Regina University, 17 - 22 June 2012, and its associated Gordon Research Seminar, which will be held at the same location on 16 - 17 June. The objective of this conference is to serve as a conduit for stimulating, but collegial discussions of unpublished data in the areas of biochemistry, biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, and physics as they apply to the development and applications of bioanalytical sensors. This will be achieved through active participation of attendees in two poster sessions, informal discussions, and 9 oral sessions with 31 speakers and 9 discussion leaders. The data discussed will encompass diverse fields and will address the following themes: 1) molecular recognition using alternatives to standard antibodies, 2) recent advances in optical, electrochemical, and mechanical detection, 3) real-world applications and in vivo sensing, 4) use of nanotechnology to advance understanding of molecular interactions, (5) biocompatible engineered surfaces, and 6) supporting/enabling technologies. Specific topics will include (but are not limited to) single molecule-based sensing, intracellular sensing, biomaterials with enhanced optical or electronic properties, nanoparticles and nanostructures, biocompatibility and the biological/non-biological interface, miniaturization and automation, and multiplexed detection in complex matrices.  In addition, the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will convene immediately preceding the GRC. Organized and conducted by graduate students and postdocs, the GRS will provide an opportunity for junior scientists to present their own work in an oral format in front of their peers. Participation in this more intimate program (limited to ~35 participants) will enhance the scientific training of these junior investigators and provide to them contacts and potential collaborators. A large proportion of the total proposed budget will go to support GRC and GRS conference fees for graduate and postdoctoral participants as well as emerging researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT. Because the field of Bioanalytical Sensors is by its very nature highly interdisciplinary, it is important to provide scientists with information on the latest research in diverse areas directly related to and ancillary to biosensing. The conference program designed for the 2012 GRC addresses many diverse topical areas associated with bioanalytical sensing with presentations by both up-and-coming researchers as well as world renowned scientists with established track records of successful innovation and multidisciplinary endeavors. The discussion leaders - a hallmark of GRCs - are recognized experts in their fields and will be responsible for initiating and maintaining a vigorous, all-inclusive discussion for each talk. It is anticipated that new ideas will be generated, leading to improved instrumentation and materials for future bioanalytical sensor platforms as well as fostering new collaborations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT. The broad, long-term objective of the 2012 GRC on Bioanalytical Sensors is to increase the knowledge base by informing participants of the latest research in sensor systems and materials development, systems integration and automation, and other relevant basic and supporting technologies. This meeting will bring together a diverse group of participants with the expectation of forming cross-disciplinary collaborations. These interactions will be critical to bridge the gap between the biological and physical aspects of existing and future bioanalytical sensors. Additionally, the 2012 GRC and its associated GRS represents a significant opportunity to promote diversity in the field of bioanalytical sensing. The invited participants include young scientists and members of groups underrepresented in the fields of chemistry/biology/engineering. The GRS in particular is an exciting opportunity to involve graduate and postdoctoral trainees more fully in the "GRC experience", with formal oral presentations selected by a panel composed of the GRS chairs and vice chairs. Other GRS participants will present posters at both the GRS and GRC. The organizers will seek participation by trainees who are members of underrepresented groups, including women, African-Americans, and Hispanics by soliciting potential attendees from relevant organizations.</AbstractNarration>
