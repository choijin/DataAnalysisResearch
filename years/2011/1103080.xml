<AbstractNarration>The Math and Science Partnership (MSP) project Promoting Excellence in Arizona Middle School Mathematics: Increasing Student Achievement through Systemic Instructional Change involves 10 Core Partners: Scottsdale Community College (as the lead), Chandler-Gilbert Community College and Glendale Community College, and the Deer Valley, Scottsdale, Fountain Hills, Chandler, Florence, J.O. Combs school districts, as well as Salt River Pima-Maricopa Community Schools. Supporting partners are: Arizona State University, Maricopa County Community College District, and the Glendale, Mesa, and Peoria school districts. This MSP Targeted project supports teachers in advancing their knowledge about the teaching and learning of middle school mathematics, as well as developmental mathematics in community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Promoting Excellence in Arizona Middle School Mathematics (PEAMSM) project provides a systemic model of sustainable professional development in partner schools and colleges to achieve the goal of increasing student achievement in middle school mathematics courses, thus enabling these students to make a successful transition to more challenging courses and curricula in high school. Project activities are in four areas: Teacher Knowledge Development; School-Based Collaborations; Capacity-Building; and Research. The project also produces research about the characteristics and mechanisms of a sustainable professional development program, as well as contributes to the body of knowledge for understanding teachers' and students' mathematical thinking and beliefs. PEAMSM targets 300 in-service middle school mathematics teachers, 32 middle school mathematics teacher-leaders, 40 middle school administrators and 140 pre-service middle school teachers in the Phoenix, AZ metropolitan area and impacts a total of 24,000 students in grades 5-8. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PEAMSM possesses a substantial research portfolio. The primary research question is "In what ways does the teacher professional development experience promote sense-making, computational fluency, problem solving and conceptual understanding of mathematical ideas among middle school mathematics teachers?" There are several other research questions that involve investigating different aspects of the professional development and its effects on teachers and the students they teach. Project findings will be prepared for publication in peer-reviewed journals of mathematics education and for presentation at state and national conferences. The project provides a national model for professional development and teacher education conducted by community college faculty trained in mathematics education research.</AbstractNarration>

Participating teachers and administrators were actively engaged in (a)&nbsp;summer institutes and workshops that emphasized the development of conceptual understanding, computational fluency, and problem?solving skills among the participants and their students, (b)&nbsp;collaborative communities of learners (CCOLs) that helped teachers connect what they learn in the institutes and workshops with their classroom practices, (c)&nbsp;instructional rounds that engaged administrators with the CCOLs, and (d)&nbsp;targeted development of teacher leaders to sustain the CCOLs beyond the AMP project&rsquo;s life.

Findings from this project have been presented at over 12 conferences and published in proceedings. Several research instruments were designed and implemented to study teachers&rsquo; beliefs about mathematics and the teaching of mathematics: AMP Teacher Survey, AMP Teacher Interview Protocol, AMP CC Faculty Interview Protocol, and the AMP Sustainability Toolkit. In addition, two dissertation studies are currently underway to investigate teachers&rsquo; understanding about division of rational numbers and teachers&rsquo; understanding of measures of center. AMP served as a successful model for implementing and researching PD with middle school teachers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The AMP team, in collaboration with RMC Research as the external evaluator, developed and implemented the AMP Sustainability Toolkit to assess the &ldquo;residue&rdquo; remaining in our AMP schools after teachers completed the two-year professional development program. Through 1-2 day site visits, which included classroom observations, teacher interviews, principal interviews, and student focus groups, the site visit team collected and analyzed data to determine the degree of AMP saturation within the teaching and learning of mathematics within specific schools.

AMP established 5 long?term goals:  Increase student achievement in middle school mathematics and developmental mathematics at the community colleges. Enhance the quality, quantity, and diversity of the middle school mathematics teacher workforce in the partner districts by working with both in?service and pre?service teachers. Promote positive attitudes and beliefs toward mathematics among students, teachers, administrators, and partner school board members. Increase the capacity of the partnership to sustain the project?s work beyond the 5?year grant. Produce research?based knowledge.   Over 300 in?service middle school mathematics teachers, school and district administrators, and pre?service teachers in the Phoenix metropolitan area participated in AMP. Participating teachers and administrators were actively engaged in (a) summer institutes and workshops that emphasized the development of conceptual understanding, computational fluency, and problem?solving skills among the participants and their students, (b) collaborative communities of learners (CCOLs) that helped teachers connect what they learn in the institutes and workshops with their classroom practices, (c) instructional rounds that engaged administrators with the CCOLs, and (d) targeted development of teacher leaders to sustain the CCOLs beyond the AMP project?s life.
