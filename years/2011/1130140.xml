<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to improve automated in situ monitoring of the marine microbial community. Microbes account for most of the primary productivity and biomass in the ocean, and the structure of the microbial community determines in large part that of higher trophic levels. A fundamental understanding of the factors that regulate community structure requires detailed and sustained observations of the plankton, which motivated the PIs to develop in situ flow cytometric and imaging-in-flow techniques that measure individual-cell light scattering and fluorescence properties, and utilize automated image analysis to determine taxonomic affiliation of the larger cells. While the instrument designs have proven and effective, two enhancements will enable new research applications. The first challenge to be addressed is that large cells are often under-sampled by current instruments. Acoustic focusing will increase sampling rate by &gt; 10-fold and thus provide a far better look at these cells, facilitating studies of in situ growth rates of different phytoplankton species, and potentially making possible species-level studies of microbial predator activity. The second challenge to be addressed is the need for physical capture of cells for in depth analysis. Emulsion microfluidics techniques will facilitate image-based cell sorting of field samples by allowing the required image analyses to be carried out in a delayed laboratory procedure. After returning the stored cells to the laboratory, analysis of the image corresponding to each stored cell will be carried out, and the stored cells sorted as desired by a novel microfluidic device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This instrument if successful will be capable of statistically quantitative sampling of pico, nano and microplankton with underwater deployment times as long as half a year. The samples archived in the instrument will permit unprecedented insights into the dynamics of the planktonic ecosystem. If made available commercially (which is in the works) instruments of this type could be key elements for biological sampling on moored ocean observing systems. The proposal has a significant training aspect with the inclusion of two graduate students as well as the collaboration with the Zephyr foundation on the development of a phytoplankton 'unit' in their educational program aimed to high school students. The signs of global change are clear, but the ramifications of these changes are not well constrained because of our limited knowledge of ecosystem responses. The proposed improvements to the IFCB will provide a means to directly observe responses of the primary producers in the natural environment as conditions change. There is no doubt that this knowledge will improve our modeling capability and provide guidance for societies actions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The oceans contain an amount of life roughly equivalent to that on land, mostly microscopic plankton. Phytoplankton, single-celled plants containing chlorophyll that enables them to use energy from sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide, are the base of the marine food chain. Their community composition and abundance determines that of the community that grazes on them, and ultimately the kinds and quantities of fish consumed by humans. Plankton communities are hard to sample because the cells can reproduce and be eaten on short time scales (days), and their distribution depends on water currents as well as environmental variables.</p> <p>The PIs developed two submersible automated flow cytometers which use lasers to measure photosynthetic pigments in individual plankton cells: FlowCytobot (FCB), which measures light scattering and light absorption properties of the smallest phytoplankters, and Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) which also captures photographic images of larger cells (Fig. 1). Automated classification of these images can provide abundance estimates for a number of cell types.&nbsp; Both instruments are deployed at the Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard Coastal Observatory (MVCO) to conduct a high-resolution, long-term plankton monitoring program, sampling every 20 min for most of the past few years, providing a new way to look at plankton dynamics. FCB&rsquo;s measurements have provided daily estimates in situ growth rates of <em>Synechococcus </em>(independent of grazing or other cell losses) from the daily changes in cell sizes, and have revealed changes in the timing of the spring bloom that are linked to climate change.&nbsp; IFCB at MVCO has revealed a variety of patterns in diatom species occurrence, with some groups appearing only at particular times of year and others persisting for long periods.&nbsp; Occasionally the images even reveal grazers preying upon diatoms (Fig. 2). Another IFCB has provided early warnings of toxic dinoflagellate blooms on the Texas Gulf Coast.&nbsp;</p> <p>IFCB observations have also reinforced the fact that the plankton remains a paradox; we still cannot predict many of the patterns we observe.&nbsp; Are differences in &ldquo;seed&rdquo; populations from year to year responsible for an unusual bloom or for a year without an appearance by particular species?&nbsp; This is a problem that requires better sampling to solve.&nbsp; Another area that suffers from sampling difficulties is the species-level effects of grazers on phytoplankton; an increased sampling rate could elevate IFCB&rsquo;s direct observations of predation from thought-provoking to quantitative.</p> <p>The most straightforward goal of the project was to increase IFCB&rsquo;s sampling rate, which is limited because the depth of focus of the imaging lens is only a few micrometers: the stream of sample water has to be very thin. Previous workers showed that particles can be forced to the center of a flowing stream by applying high-frequency vibrations to the stream housing, allowing a much larger volume of sample to be analyzed (Fig. 3).&nbsp; In fact, this approach has been used in clinical flow cytometry, so our challenge was to adapt the technique for in situ environmental flow cytometry (i.e., low power consumption, stable automated operation). We found that acoustic focusing increased sample throughput by a factor of three for most cell types, and by much more for some important cell types (e.g., red-tide dinoflagellates).</p> <p>A second goal was an IFCB that could physically capture imaged cells, so that specific cell types could be studied in greater depth (e.g., genetic analyses). The sorting mechanism was taken from a commercially-available cell sorter: a tube which darts out into the sample stream when signaled by a cell passing through a laser beam upstream. Our idea was to store the captured cells in a coil of thin tubing, with cells separated by bubbles of oil, in a known order (so that they could be retrieved and matched with their images). However, we found that though this approach was reasonable when tested with plastic beads, real phytoplankton cells presented problems: long cells (especially chains of diatoms) are incompatible with flow through channels narrow enough to accomplish sorting with acceptably low volumes of water accompanying each cell. A single blockage essentially ruins the channel, and since an important purpose of our project was to sort from natural populations, we abandoned this approach (whose objective was to allow for storing sorting cells during eventual in situ deployment), to concentrate on optimizing and testing the benchtop image-based sorter itself. We sorted a variety of ciliates, flagellates, and other plankton from Woods Hole Harbor, to explore the range of utility of the approach (Fig. 4).&nbsp;</p> <p>A third goal for enhancing IFCB was the automated application of live-cell stain to allow detection of non-chlorophyll-containing cells. This approach allows automated imaging of the whole microbial community, not just the phytoplankton. We modified an IFCB to accomplish this, and have shown that for some groups staining indeed increases observed cell abundances.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Heidi&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sosik</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1130140/1130140_10138476_1512134906252_Outcomes_figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1130140/1130140_10138476_1512134906252_Outcomes_figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1130140/1130140_10138476_1512134906252_Outcomes_figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Example plankton images automated collected in situ by IFCB at the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory.
