<AbstractNarration>The investigator is conducting a 4-year study of student decision making to enter STEM professions by conducting a follow-up survey of a national sample of 30-year-olds.  The investigator had previously conducted a national survey of public school students in the 7th and 10th grades, which collected student performance in mathematics and science, courses taken in high school and college, personal attitudes toward science, and career plans.  The investigator now is following up these same students as they have aged and are beginning careers at approximately age 30 to ask them in what field they are currently working and what career decisions were made that affected their involvement with mathematics and science.  This longitudinal study of student performance is providing new information about student decisions during their decision-making about careers in science and engineering and particularly about their experiences in undergraduate school.  The background information contains information on the student early educational and occupational expectations, their parental background, their self-perception, and their activities while in high school and college.  The collection of career activities as an adult permits the analysis of the influence of beliefs and plans made during secondary school and college on adult choices.  The survey will provide national estimates of the statistical parameters of probabilities of selection and performance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new data set has a large potential for informing other researchers about the status of student decision-making in science and engineering professions.  The project addresses questions of career choice that are central to the STEM program and is likely to be useful for informing the NSF community about the strength of factors that are associated with choosing science careers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this national study are likely to be of wide interest to professional researchers and policy makers in science and engineering.  The study provides a broad based analysis of choices faced by students facing career choices.  The investigators are seeking opportunities to provide results more directly to students and administrators in undergraduate institutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Eight of the 10 articles in this special issue are based solely on LSAY data and the findings will provide important policy guidance in this field.
