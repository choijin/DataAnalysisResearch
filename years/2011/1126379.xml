<AbstractNarration>The main purpose of this project is to facilitate acquisition and use of a state-of-the-art flow cytometer with imaging and fluorescence triggering capabilities, which will be located at the University of Mississippi (UM), Department of Biology. The Flow Cytometer and Microscope, or FlowCAM, utilizes a high resolution CCD camera, multiple objectives, and image analysis software to allow enumeration, measurement, and image capture of individual suspended organic and inorganic particles ranging from 0.002 to 2 millimeters in size. This instrument was designed for plankton assessment, but it can be used for any fluid-suspended particle in this size range. Therefore, in addition to studies in plankton ecology, planned uses of the instrument include research in symbiosis, mycology, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and wildlife biology. The key features of the FlowCAM are an unprecedented speed of sample processing (up to 10,000 particles per minute) and production of a digital reference image for each particle. The processing speed improves statistical robustness of community data, and the automation leads to a significant reduction in human bias in plankton identification and enumeration. As microscope-based community analysis is often the limiting factor in plankton research, this instrument will allow the investigators to address ecologically relevant questions at a spatial and temporal scale not before possible, including real-time monitoring of plankton dynamics such as aquatic pollution events and harmful algal blooms. A web-based data access portal will enable remote users to quickly receive data from samples sent to UM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many scientific questions in biology could be more rapidly and efficiently answered if scientists could easily identify, count, and document microscopic objects such as unicellular algae, fungal spores, and protozoan parasites; the FlowCAM will do just that.  The multi-disciplinary nature of this instrument will encourage use by a diverse group of scientists, greatly expand UM existing research and training capabilities, and encourage collaborations among researchers across the region. Projects supported by the instrument will include assessing algal roles in ecosystem services such as nutrient retention in agriculturally influenced streams; measuring the impact of the invasive, planktivorous Asian carp on the food resources of native fish species in the Mississippi River Basin; relating parasite load to mate choice in wild turkeys; understanding symbiotic relationships and co-evolution in mycorrhizal and coral-algal symbioses; and understanding survival and distribution patterns of native and invasive mussel larvae. Image databases will be made accessible for public use through Morphbank, an open web database of biological images, and detailed community databases shared through the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity. The PIs will provide educational demonstrations and research opportunities for a high school-to-college summer bridge program designed to attract minority students to the fields of math, science, and engineering. At the university level, the instrument will be integrated into several laboratory-based courses (Aquatic Biology, Principles of Microbiology, Limnological Methods) and will be used in faculty-supervised independent research projects (e.g., Directed Study in Biological Sciences, summer REU programs). Research data will be disseminated in the primary scientific literature.</AbstractNarration>
