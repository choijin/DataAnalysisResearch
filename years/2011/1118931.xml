<AbstractNarration>Research in continental rift systems commonly assumes that lithospheric deformation has a similar scale to and is spatially coincident with the surface expression of rifting. However, ongoing continental extension between Nubia and Somalia appears localized to a narrow rift zone (the Main Ethiopian Rift) only in the thin elastic uppermost crustal lid. At greater depths in both the lower crust and mantle lithosphere, very weak materials appear to accommodate extension by viscous stretching over long length scales at lower strain rates, resulting in highly depth-dependent stretching. This possibility is important because it challenges existing understanding of continental rifting and provides an opportunity to investigate the implications of heterogeneous rheology for continental mechanics. Although the Main Ethiopian Rift has been studied with many, none of the previous efforts have extended far beyond the rift zone to provide a synoptic view of the region. Therefore, no existing data suffice to test for distributed deformation in the Ethiopian Highlands or the Somali Platform. This project combines a large-aperture GPS network and a large-aperture broadband seismometer array with numerical modeling to characterize the lateral and vertical deformation patterns within the lithosphere surrounding the Main Ethiopian Rift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of plate tectonics includes continental breakup as one of its fundamental principles. In the past, continental masses have both coalesced and fractured but it is unclear how continental breakup progresses over space and time, aside from general inferences that this breakup must be very variable in heterogeneous continental materials. The East African region is the best ongoing example of a fracturing continent, but it has mostly been studied in the great rift valleys, omitting any important processes extending beyond the rift. This experiment takes a broader view of continental breakup, studying not only surface rifting, but also deformation far beyond the rift. The results have potential scientific implications for the general understanding of plate tectonics processes and of the fundamental properties of the continents. The results will also help map new geothermal energy resources, earthquake and volcano hazards, and the rise and fall of high mountains and plateaus in Africa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research on the dynamics and kinematics of continental rifting has focused narrowly on active rift zones, especially the East African Rift System (EARS). This assumes a narrow zone of extension assumes that strain within continental lithosphere where two continental tectonic plates are being pushed apart very much like oceanic divergent boundaries.  However, GPS data show that in the Ethiopia rift extension occurs over a wider region than to the south in the EARS.  Through observationally based geodynamic simulations we investigated the factors that lead to diffuse rifting specifically those within the Ethiopian Rift.  This collaborative project integrated geophysical data obtained in this project (GPS observations and seismic tomography data) to fully understand the forces generating the diffuse rifting pattern here.  The first major outcome from the modeling component of this project was the determination of the continuous kinematic strain rate and velocity field inferred from interpolation of GPS data acquired in this project with both earthquake focal mechanisms and fault slip observations. We found that rifting within the Ethiopian Plateau is broader than the Main East African Rift to the south, however it is asymmetric with the diffuse extension occurring along the western side of the rift while the eastern side appears to have extension relatively focused at the rift. This feature is evident in both the strain rate and velocity fields. The second major outcome was the determination of the asymmetry of the deviatoric stress distribution associated with gravitational potential energy variations . Deviatroic stresses associated with density difference inferred from seismic produce an asymmetry that correlate with the asymmetry observed from the GPS observations implying that the diffuse deformation along the western side of the ridge is being drive by the gradients in gravitational potential energy.  This asymmetry is also noticed in the crustal thickness contrasts determined from the seismic component of this grant.  Because the crustal thickness of the western side of the rift is overall uniform and correlates with previous locations of flood basalts, gravitational potential energy is uniform across the western side. For geodynamic simulations that imposed a weak crust in regions in areas that low seismic velocities were observed, predicted surface velocities that correlated with the diffuse and asymmetric patterns observed in the GPS data.
