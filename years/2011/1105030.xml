<AbstractNarration>This award supports an experimental research program to test Newton's inverse-square law of gravitation to better than one part in 100 at a 100-micrometer range and to search for hypothetical extra space dimensions down to 10 micrometers.  The source mass for the gravitational force measurement is designed to generate no Newtonian signal.  To reduce thermal noise that could mask a signal, the experiment is cooled to liquid helium temperatures.  Any inverse-square law violation signal is detected by a highly sensitive superconducting differential accelerometer formed by two superconducting test masses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will explore the very nature of spacetime and test the foundations of General Relativity and theories beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.  The confirmed observation of a deviation from Newton's law at short distance would revolutionize our understanding of gravity and could lead to a unification of all fundamental forces.  The cryogenic technique that this laboratory has developed for measuring extremely weak forces is of potential value in a variety of other fields which require measurement of minute forces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the proposed research is to test NewtonÃ†s inverse-square law to better than one part in 100 at a 100-micrometer range and search for extra space dimensions down to 30 micrometers.  This research will explore the very nature of spacetime and test foundations of General Relativity and theories beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.  The experiment is cooled to 4.2 K.  To minimize Newtonian errors, this experiment employs a near-null source, a circular disk of large diameter-to-thickness ratio.  Two test masses, also disk-shaped, are positioned on the two sides of the source mass at a nominal distance of 280 micrometers.  The signal is detected by a superconducting differential accelerometer, which is a highly sensitive gravity sensor.  A photograph of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. In order to reach the intrinsic sensitivity of the superconducting accelerometer, the seismic noise of the laboratory must be rejected to one part in 10,000.  To be able to reject the vibration to this level, we have added additional superconducting linear and angular accelerometers to measure and compensate the platform vibrations.  In addition, parasitic forces due to residual gas, trapped magnetic flux, and electrostatic patch field interfere with the non-Newtonian signal we are looking for.  We have found a way to null these parasitic forces by applying an additional electrostatic force.  The apparatus has been modified accordingly and is undergoing tests.  We expect to obtain scientific data in the next few months.  The project has trained one graduate and two undergraduate students to become capable experimental physicists.  Further refinement of the cryogenic techniques that this laboratory has developed for measuring extremely weak forces is of potential value in a variety of other fields.           Figure 1.  Apparatus   for  the inverse-square law test mounted   on the cryostat insert.            Last Modified: 02/27/2015       Submitted by: Ho Jung Paik]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
