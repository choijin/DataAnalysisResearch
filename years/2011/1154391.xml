<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by recruiting, mentoring, and supporting academically talented, but financially needy, students through degree completion and partnering with employers to facilitate placement. Project objectives are to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Improve educational opportunities for eligible students pursuing degrees in biological, physical, mathematical, and information sciences or engineering or technology.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Increase retention of students to degree achievement by creating supportive environments through changes in organizational culture and practices.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Improve student support programs by providing mentoring, tutoring, counseling, internships, and placement.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Increase the STEM workforce by implementing the project with industry partners to help meet national needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The project is providing students with skills that improve academic competitiveness, encouraging them to pursue STEM careers, increasing faculty involvement in mentoring students, nurturing permanent changes in organizational culture and practices, and increasing the economic diversity of the STEM workforce.  Project partners include Danfoss Turbocor Compressions, General Dynamics, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. The college is providing release time  for faculty to mentor students and STEM tutors for scholars.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The project goes beyond increasing the quantity of students in STEM disciplines by advancing knowledge of effective practices that prepare students to pursue STEM careers from community colleges, the fastest growing educational level in the nation, by innovatively integrating student support and placement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To measure the effectiveness of the S- STEM Star Program at the Tallahassee Community College, an analysis of program participants and non-S-STEM TCC students (FTIC) was completed for the 2012 &ndash; 2017 academic years.  S-STEM students performed better than their non-program participant counterparts on three key performance indicators including Fall to Fall Retention, 2-Year Graduation and Course Success.  On Average, S- STEM students had a 33% greater Fall to Fall retention, 61% greater 2-Year Graduation and 14% greater Course Success rate.  Within the STEM program S- STEM students had an average 92% Fall to Fall retention, 77% 2-Year Graduation and 84% Course Success rate.  In addition, S-STEM had an average 4-year Institution Transfer Rate of 63%.  Most students transferred to Florida State University (54%), Florida A&amp;M University (17%) and University of Florida (12%).  Over the course of the granting period nearly 100 students were  awarded S-STEM scholarships that assisted with the furthering of their  academic pusuits in STEM disciplines.   Students who were awarded these  funds, were responsible for attending workshops, tutoring sessions,  outreach activities, and other benficial progaming provided through the  TCC STEM Center.   Students were also assigned mentors who they  worked with on a monthly basis, that involved meeting to get help with  advising issues, academic problems, specific projects that they were  assigned as STEM Center participants, and a variety of other interests.   The purpose of the mentoring was to provide students with a faculty  member who also was a STEM major and allow for a personal relationship  to be developed that could support the student in an extra curricular  fashion.  More than 20 STEM faculty participated as mentors for these  STEM students over the course of the grant period.  The advancement of the student's interest in their respective STEM disciplines was strengthened through the participation of summer internships.  Many of these internships were conducted at univerisities both local to the college as well as through out the state.  There were even some students who were selected to intern at National Laboratories, such as Brook Haven National Lab in Cold Harbor Srings.
