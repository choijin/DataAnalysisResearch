<AbstractNarration>This project is focusing on retaining students who express an interest in STEM and attracting students already on campus with a demonstrated proficiency in STEM-related fields. Notre Dame's top-ranked business school attracts many undergraduates who have the aptitude to succeed in STEM majors. This project is engaging their interest in engineering and science while ensuring they have the mathematics background to be successful in STEM. The Colleges of Business, Science and Engineering are creating new business minors for STEM students, to provide them with the business background that they desire. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project is developing a STEM Learning Community Network on campus by implementing the following programs and activities:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) introducing Electronic Portfolios (ePortfolios) as a tool for student planning, reflection, and advising;&lt;br/&gt;(2) eliminating curricular roadblocks in the introductory mathematics courses by developing new Bridging Mathematics Course Modules;&lt;br/&gt;(3) establishing academic year and summer Academic Success Programs that enhance study skills;&lt;br/&gt;(4) expanding opportunities for Authentic Professional Experience and Engaged Scholarship for first-year students through undergraduate research and community-based programs; and&lt;br/&gt;(5) promoting a STEM-supportive campus culture through a STEM Student Ambassador Program in the residence halls and other student-led initiatives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities are increasing the number of STEM graduates and improving STEM education at Notre Dame. STEM Student Ambassadors are improving the awareness and appreciation of STEM among all students on campus, while ePortfolios and the Academic Success Programs are enhancing student engagement and proficiency for all majors. Community-based engaged scholarship programs are building partnerships with area K-12 schools, further promoting STEM learning in the region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to improve the attraction and retention of undergraduate STEM majors in the College of Engineering and the College of Science at the University of Notre Dame.  Over the period of the project, degrees granted by these two colleges increased by 34%.  The intellectual merit of the work was to take a campus-wide approach, addressing multiple dimensions of the student experience.  Specifically, the project focused upon 5 main areas of activity:  (1) introducing electronic portfolios as a tool for student planning, reflection, and advising; (2) eliminating curricular roadblocks in the introductory mathematics courses by developing new bridging math programs; (3) establishing academic year and summer academic success programs that enhance study skills; (4) expanding opportunities for authentic professional experience and engaged scholarship through undergraduate research and community-based programs; (5) promoting a STEM-supportive campus culture through student-led initiatives.  The broader impact of the project has been significant change not only within the two STEM colleges at Notre Dame, but across the university and in the local community as well.  For example, research under this grant on the use of electronic portfolios and their impact on retention led to the university-wide adoption of them as part of a new program for all first-year students.  A peer-led team learning initiative first piloted under this grant for the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry was further adopted by the Department of Mathematics.  The community-engaged internship program initiated under this grant ultimately led to the creation of a new Center for Civic Innovation that supports projects from across the university in partnership with local government, industry, and nonprofits.  A K-12 outreach program developed under the grant that combines STEM and music education has reached hundreds of students in local schools, and with support from a follow-on NSF iCorps grant, is in the process of commercializing the effort through a small business.
