<AbstractNarration>PI:  Stephen Parker&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1139737&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  National Academy of Sciences&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Core Support of the Water Science and Technology Board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Water Science and Technology Board is the focal point for studies related to water resources and hydrologic sciences accomplished under the aegis of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering.  The Board's objective is to improve the scientific and technological basis for resolving important national questions and issues associated with the efficient management and use of ground and surface water resources.  &lt;br/&gt;In carrying out its responsibilities and in serving the national interest, the Board responds to requests for evaluations and advice through its ad hoc studies concerning specific and generic issues in water resources, influences action by initiating studies of issues that merit consideration by public agencies and others, identifies issues and topics of research related to water resources, and cooperates with other units of the National Research Council (NRC) and groups with mutual interests outside of the NRC. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the Board is important in advancing knowledge and understanding covering the traditional scientific and engineering aspects of water resources and the economic, institutional, legal, educational, and social aspects, as well.  The Board consists of members from all of the disciplines involved in water resources activities and responds to specific requests from government, state and local agencies, and others.  The Board projects future needs for and capabilities of multi-disciplinary water-related research and education in the sciences, engineering, and technology.  These projects are separately funded and carried out by ad hoc committees under the Board?s oversight.  At meetings of the Board, liaison representatives provide comments and suggestions to aid the board in developing its program and reports on its activities. &lt;br/&gt;The Board promotes broader impacts for its activities by advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning in projecting future needs for and capabilities of multi-disciplinary water-related research and education in the sciences, engineering, and technology.  Board members and staff participate in conferences, workshops, and other activities to disseminate the scientific and technological understanding of its reports.  The Board?s findings benefit society by assuring that the activities in water resources receive attention appropriate to the role water plays in furthering national interest.</AbstractNarration>
