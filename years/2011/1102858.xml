<AbstractNarration>In her thesis, the PI pioneered the study of the dynamics of rational maps having a nontrivial automorphism, that is maps for which conjugating by some nontrivial linear fractional transformation preserves not just the dynamics of the map but the map itself (its coefficients when written as a rational function, say). Since most rational maps have no automorphisms, this might be considered a dynamical version of complex multiplication. The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in the PI's plan to create a theory of dynamical complex multiplication, with the goal of developing enough machinery that a proof of a Conjecture of Morton and Silverman for this family of maps is within reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Broader impacts of the work emerge from education and outreach activities, with a focus on gender equity issues and supporting women in research mathematics. Proposed activities include:&lt;br/&gt;(1) mentoring women in mathematics at the University of Hawaii and thus broadening participation of underrepresented groups;&lt;br/&gt;(2) establishing the Math Teachers' Circle of Hawaii; and &lt;br/&gt;(3) continuing the University of Hawaii Mathematics Department's Distinguished Lecture Series.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI proposed to investigate a proposed analogy between the fields of arithmetic geometry (the study of integer and rational points on geometric objects) and arithmetic dynamics (the study of the number theoretic properties of iterated functions).    Researchers in arithmetic dynamics have developed a kind of dictionary, allowing us to form dynamical analogs of theorems and conjectures from the geometric world:  Rational points on varieties correspond to rational points in orbits.  Torsion points on abelian varieties correspond to preperiodic points.  Finitely generated groups correspond to orbits of wandering points.     Intellectual Merit  The over-arching goal of the project was to extend this dictionary, to find an appropriate dynamical analog of varieties with complex multiplicaiton (CM).   One way to think about complex multiplication is that a geometric object has extra symmetries, more than one expects from a generic object of that type.  One hypothesis, then, is that the correct analog would be "functions that have extra symmetries."  The PI pioneered the arithmetic study of such functions in her thesis, and she has continued to work on it supported by this grant.  A major result in this direction is joint with postdoc Alon Levy and graduate student Bianca Thompson: For families of twists of functions with extra symmetries, there is a uniform bound (depending only on the original function defining the family of twists) on the number of K-rational preperiodic points for any number field K.  In fact, this result holds in arbitrary dimension as well.  Together with Rafe Jones, the PI also tackled the question of Galois representations attached to these functions, proving special cases of an analog of a classic theorem of Serre's for elliptic curves with CM.  Despite this promising line of work, functions with nontrivial automorphisms provide an unsatisfying analogy to CM varieties. There are two technical but important properties enjoyed by CM varieties, neither of which holds in the dynamical setting:  They have potential good reduction, and they are naturally partitioned into a countable union of finite sets in the moduli space.  Recently, researchers  including the PI began proposing a new analogy to CM varieties: post-critically finite (PCF) functions, functions for which the entire forward orbit of all critical points is finite.  A deep result of Benedetto, Ingram, Jones, and Levy paved the way for another major outcome of this project, one which had been explicitly described in the proposal. Together with graduate students David Lukas and Diane Yap, the PI found an exhastive list of quadratic PCF functions with rational coefficients.  This result was a computational tour de force, and the paper was accepted to the competitive Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium conference.  This result provides two examples of PCF functions that do not have potential good reduction, showing that these functions also fail to be completely analogous to CM varieties.  This outcome surprised many researchers who had hoped and believed otherwise.  In a recently-submitted paper, the author along with several collaborators uses these PCF functions to create examples of interesting number theoretic phenomena, specifically infinite field extensions that are ramified at only finitely many primes.  In addition to this main thread of work, the PI has published several other papers in various areas of number theory, including at least one with direct applications to cryptography.     Broader Impacts  The PI originally proposed three broader impacts to her work:  (1) Mentoring women in mathematics at the University of Hawaii and thus broadening participation of underrepresented groups.  During the life of the grant, she advised two female graduate students, one of them Latina.  Both of these students received travel and research support from the grant, and both have completed their PhDs.  A third female student at UH was supported in conferen...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
