<AbstractNarration>We are requesting funding to support US participants, particularly graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and recent Ph.D.s, to attend the international workshop Recent&lt;br/&gt;Developments in Model Theory that will be held June 5-11 in Oleron France.&lt;br/&gt;One of the objective of this workshop will be to bring researchers in&lt;br/&gt;Model Theory and some other areas together to present and discuss problems&lt;br/&gt;as well as some recent advances in these areas and thereby facilitate&lt;br/&gt;further interactions. Another goal of the workshop is to provide an informal&lt;br/&gt;setting where graduate students and younger researchers from US can learn&lt;br/&gt;about new trends and interact with one another as well as with prominent&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provided support for US national and US-based researchers to participate in the meeting ``Recent Developments in Model Theory held in Oleron, France June 5-11, 2011.  The meeting was one of the largest gatherings in model theory ever with over 140 participants from all over the world. Speakers included most of the leading figures in modern model theory as well as key researchers from other areas of mathematics where model theory has had significant applications.  The talks covered a wide range of current research in pure and applied model theory and closely related areas.  Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students had the opportunity to present their work in shorter lectures and poster sessions.  The award provided  partial or full support for 26 US national and US-based researchers including 8 graduate students, and 10 postdoctoral researchers.  5 of the supported participants were invited speakers.  9 of the supported participants were women and 2 were underrepresented minorities.  We are currently preparing a proceedings of the conference which will include 15-20 papers and will appear in one or two volumes of the Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic.  The volume will reflect the wide range of the conference including papers in stability theory, o-minimality, applications of model theory to tropical geometry, and papers in number theory and group theory related to model theory.
