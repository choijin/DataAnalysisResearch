<AbstractNarration>The University of Georgia, lead institution for the Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Peach State LSAMP) will continue successful practices in recruitment and retention to increase the representation of historically underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and technology (STEM) fields.  The 2011-2016 program will consist of a partnership with the following institutions:  Fort Valley State University, Savannah State University, Southern&lt;br/&gt;Polytechnic State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Perimeter College and Kennesaw State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through close coordination with state-funded and other externally funded programs, such as the University System of Georgia STEM Initiative and NSF's Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergradute Program, the alliance contributed to significant achievements in broadening underrepresented minority STEM participation, providing targeted support to 1,135 PSLSAMP students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program provides a stronger focus on key recruitment and retention strategies and a strengthened evaluation process, as well as a broadened research collaboration network. The substantially broadened state-wide presence along with stronger and more rigorous focus constitutes a program that will provide committed institutional support; strong administrative and faculty support; and targeted academic enrichment, proactive mentoring, and meaningful research opportunities for students. Building on the foundation developed in the last five years, the intended goals for the project are as follows:  &lt;br/&gt;1. Significantly increase minority STEM enrollment and baccalaureate degree completion; &lt;br/&gt;2. Increase the percentage of LSAMP students who participate in STEM research or an external&lt;br/&gt;internship as an undergraduate student;&lt;br/&gt;3. Increase the percentage of LSAMP scholars who transfer to a 4-year institution after completing&lt;br/&gt;partner two-year program;&lt;br/&gt;4. Increase the number of students who pursue STEM graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best practices implemented in this project will have transferable values for STEM&lt;br/&gt;activities in other institutions in the nation. It will also create an environment in which the outcomes&lt;br/&gt;achieved will be sustainable after the project comes to an end. This project will not only contribute to&lt;br/&gt;increasing the number of URM students in STEM disciplines but also to increase the awareness for and to&lt;br/&gt;foster the development of state-wide measures for accelerating diversity in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

The Peach State Alliance is a strong collaboration of six public higher education institutions in the state of Georgia that provide a diverse mix of academic strenghts and capabilities.</p> <p>The participatin institutions are the University of Georgia (UGA - lead institution), Fort Valley State University (FVSU), Georgia State University Perimeter College (GSU-PC - two-year partner, previously Georgia Perimeter College before merging with Georgia State University in July 2016), Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), Kennesaw State University-Kennesaw&nbsp;Campus (KSU-K), Kennesaw State University-Marietta Campus (KSU-M - previously Southern Polytechnic State University prior to its merger with KSU-K in July 2015, and Savannah State University (SSU). Peach State LSAMP leveraged the resources, partnerships, and commitments of each member institution to provide academic social, and financial support for URM students pursuing STEM fields of study. Through their collaborative Peach State LSAMP efforts, they have significantly advanced their academic objectives and collectively achieved greater outcomes than would have been achieved through their individual efforts.</p> <p>In order to fulfill the goals of the grant, the Peach State LSAMP offered the following activities and programs:</p> <ul> <li>Incoming freshman and transfer student summer bridge programs</li> <li>Peer mentoring and study groups</li> <li>Tutoring and academic support</li> <li>Career and academic professional development workshops</li> <li>Student Stipends and Research financial awards</li> <li>Faculty-mentored undergraduate research</li> <li>Summer internships and research opportunities</li> <li>Travel awards for local and national STEM conferences</li> <li>Graduate school preparation</li> </ul> <p>From 2011 - 2016,&nbsp;Peach State LSAMP program has funded 1413 students as general or research scholars. The Alliance has had 500 scholars to graduate, and 111 graduates to enroll in graduate or professional school. Other outcomes include 816 funded research opportunities (on-site, off-site, and internationa), 566 LSAMP workshops, 650 scholars presented at conferences, and 16 students were contributing authors for research publications during this grant funding. See attached figure summarizing this information.</p> <p>The Peach State LSAMP program has yielded amazing outcomes exceeding both institutional enrollment and degree completion for URM students in STEM majors. Enrollment for URM students in STEM majors has increased 60% from the baseline (2010) to 2016.
