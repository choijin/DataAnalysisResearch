<AbstractNarration>The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), in collaboration with New York University's Institute for Education and Social Policy, is developing an innovative model of science teacher preparation. The project leverages the scientific and educational resources of a world class informal education institution, AMNH, with best practices from Urban Teacher Residency programs. The primary project goal is to create an alternative pathway for teacher candidates to earn a Board of Regents-awarded Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree with a specialization in Earth Science teaching for grades 7-12. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed 15-month, 36-credit academic program will initially serve 50 prospective Earth Science teachers. Teacher candidates will participate in rigorous coursework in science content and pedagogy, summer teaching and science practicum residencies at AMNH, and mentored school-based residencies in high-need schools in the New York City region. Following graduation, teachers will maintain their ties with AMNH and commit to a minimum of four years of teaching in high-need, low-performing New York City schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong educational research and evaluation components will help to determine the impact of this new teacher preparation model on student achievement in New York City schools.  More specifically, this project will answer the question "How do students taught by first year AMNH MAT Earth Science teachers perform academically in comparison with students taught by first year Earth Science teachers not prepared in the AMNH program?", with the hypothesis that teachers trained through the AMNH program will produce higher achieving students as measured by their scores on New York State (NYS) science assessments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In light of the NYS requirement that the pilot program be implemented in high-need, low-performing schools, this project has the potential to engage, motivate and improve the Earth Science achievement and interest in STEM careers of thousands of students from traditionally  underrepresented populations including English language learners, special education students, and racial minority groups. In addition, this project will gather meaningful data on the role informal science education organizations can play in preparing well-qualified Earth Science teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An Innovative Approach to Earth Science Teacher Preparation: Uniting Science, informal science education, and schools to raise student achievement   The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) has completed the sixth year (2011-2017) of the NSF-funded project to examine and document the development, implementation, and outcomes of the first museum-based Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) Earth science program.  Initiated in 2011, this NSF award leveraged the work in evaluation, research, that was begun under the award to AMNH by the New York State (NYS) Race to the Top competition. The following conditions were required for designs submitted to the NYS competition: (1) increase the number of science teachers in areas of need; (2) increase the number of students taking the Science Regent exams; and (3) create reciprocal agreements with high-needs schools that want certified science teachers, teach over 70% Title 1 students, and have had persistently low achievement and graduation records.

Through a variety of funding streams, the program is working with its current teacher candidates and has graduated and employed 78 alumni of the program.  This work?s intellectual merit is constituted by the contributions made by a museum-based design for science teacher preparation, to the formal teacher preparation system, to informal science education research, and to the field of evaluation and research. Additionally, the project?s broader impact on students, educators, partners, scientists, postdocs, school principals, and mentors is evident, as all previously mentioned stakeholders come together to address the needs of urban high-needs schools and their students. The impact of this design is documented in final reports and publication.  Outcomes  1) The Museum has developed a fully institutionalized program that awards a Master of Arts in Teaching degree. The institutionalization operates on multiple levels: it awards degrees, maintains strong partnerships with schools, is a member of the network of Independent Colleges and Universities in NYS, and participates in policy discussions related to teaching assessments and science education in NYS.   2) The program?s teacher preparation profile and evaluation record have deepened the Museum?s partnerships with other local teacher education programs. These programs have been contracting with AMNH for museum-designed and -taught elective courses. When the Museum was authorized, all five partners changed the status of "elective" to "required" courses in their science teacher preparation programs.  3) The evaluation evidence clearly indicates that the program has been successful in preparing first-year teachers to teach in high-needs urban schools in New York State. The AMNH MAT faculty and staff were very effective in preparing cohorts of first-year teachers to teach in high-needs urban schools. Graduates felt that they were well-prepared.  4) Additional measures also confirm this evidence, such as MAT graduates? performance on certification examinations and the responses from principals who hired the graduates.  5) The quantitative study conducted by NYU IESP focused on student performance on the New York State Earth Science Regents Examination, a standardized test. The evidence indicated that students of the MAT graduates are doing as well as students taught by other Earth science teachers with similar years of experience in New York City.  6) Demographically, the MAT graduates teach a higher percentage of students who qualify for free and reduced-price lunch and are lower performing in science, relative to students taught by other Earth science teachers with similar years of experience in New York City. Therefore, MAT graduates have been able to bring their students to the same level of performance as students who have reached higher levels of achievement.   7) The collaborative case study focused on the teaching practices of a sample of graduates from the first three cohorts and their connections to what they had learned in the program.
