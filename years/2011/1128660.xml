<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to design and fabricate a silicon nanochannel system with embedded nanoelectrodes for DNA sequencing. The sequencing principle is based on detecting the electron tunneling property of individual nucleotides of a single-stranded DNA as it translocates through a nanochannel. The nanochannel will be fabricated based on MEMS microfabrication and AFM nanolithography. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the program is the integration of the latest DNA sensing principle with advanced AFM techniques in realizing a label-free sequencing device that can provide fast and specific detection. The development of this rapid DNA sequencing technique is transformative. The proposed project will explore several novel areas such as AFM machining of nanofluidic channels, optimization of DNA electron tunneling sensitivity, and specificity of functionalized nanoelectrodes towards DNA bases. Results of the proposed project are expected to impact future designs of nanofluidic based nanomedicine systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the program are the advancement of the knowledge of bionanotechnology and the development of an important tool for both biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Additionally, the proposed research will also generate diversified learning experience for students involved in the project, who will have a rare opportunity to be cross-trained in nanofabrication and DNA processing. The fabrication techniques and recipes developed by the project are expected to greatly enhance the core capability of the multi-user cleanroom facility at the University of Arkansas in areas such as MEMS, BioMEMS, and NEMS.</AbstractNarration>
