<AbstractNarration>PI: Carol Lushbough (University of South Dakota)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborators: Stephen Goff (University of Arizona), Daniel Stanzione (University of Texas - Austin), Volker Brendel (Iowa State University) and Molly Nepokroeff (University of South Dakota)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BioExtract Server is an open, Web-based system designed to aid researchers in the analysis of genomic data by providing a platform to facilitate the creation of bioinformatic workflows. Scientific workflows are created within the system by recording tasks performed by the user. These tasks may include querying multiple, distributed data sources, saving query results as searchable data extracts, and executing local and Web-accessible analytic tools. The series of recorded tasks can then be saved as a reproducible, sharable workflow available for subsequent execution with the original or modified inputs and parameter settings. The iPlant Collaborative (www.iplantcollaborative.org) is a project sponsored by the National Science Foundation to build a computer infrastructure for research in the plant sciences. By sponsoring distributed informatics projects, iPlant extends high level computation to researchers through access to data, analytic tools, and workflows. One of the primary goals of the iPlant Collaborative is the reuse and integration of relevant technology that exists in the science community and to collaborate with other researchers when building new infrastructure. The overall goal of this project is to make data, analytic tools, and workflows accessible, interoperable, easy to use, and applicable to research and education.  In collaboration with the iPlant Collaborative, this project will enable researchers to execute iPlant analytic tools within the BioExtract Server, create iPlant workflows through the BioExtract Server, and manage analysis and provenance data across both platforms.  Examples of such management include executing BioExtract Server tools and workflows and creating data extracts with input drawn from iPlant, storing BioExtract Sever tool results at iPlant, and annotating iPlant data through the BioExtract Server. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary, overall objective of this project is to make data, analytic tools, and workflows accessible, interoperable, easy to use, and applicable to research and education. As the project's functionality becomes available through the BioExtract Server (bioextract.org) / iPlant (www.iplantcollaborative.org) platforms, it will be introduced to the research and educational communities through workshops, presentations, publications, and education. BioExtract Server integrated functionality will be added to the content of iPlant's free, 2-day "iPlant Genomic Education Workshops"  which instruct researchers and faculty in the use of iPlant resources. The iPlant Collaborative holds more than 10 on-campus training sessions per year, in addition to workshops at a number of major conferences (including the ASPB Annual Meeting and the Plant &amp; Animal Genome Meeting for the plant community, and the SC conference series for the computing community). Through these workshops, project personnel will demonstrate how the integrated iPlant/BioExtract Server functionality can be applied to general research questions. Personnel will work with individual researchers to help identify ways in which the integrated functionality could be leveraged to perform specific analysis. In addition to creating and delivering workshop content, the project will create videos demonstrating the iPlant/BioExtract Server functionality. These videos will be made available through the iPlant website as well as the BioExtract Server site. Finally, project functionality will be incorporated into yearly BioExtract Server workshops for the Undergraduate Research Fellows from the partner institutions of South Dakota NIH NCRR's IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) for which the PI serves as the Bioinformatics Core Director.  Finally, the BioExtract Server will be an independent system available through an open source license that can be installed on individual servers.  Individual installations will be configurable and allow for the inclusion of resources that best fit individual project needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Integrating the BioExtract Server with the iPlant Collaborative  Project outcomes report Carol Lushbough University of South Dakota clushbou@usd.edu, (605) 677-6138     The BioExtract Server is a Web-based, workflow-enabling system that offers researchers a flexible environment for analyzing data (http://bioextract.org) [1]. The primary objective of the BioExtract Server is to bring an easy-to-use, accessible, robust, cloud computing bioinformatics workflow system to researchers, faculty and students that may not have "in house" high performance computing resources. It provides researchers with the ability to save a series of BioExtract Server tasks (e.g., query a data source, save a data extract, and execute an analytic tool) as a workflow and the opportunity for researchers to share their data extracts, analytic tools and workflows with collaborators. The BioExtract Server leverages the iPlant Collaborative [2] Agave API (Application Programming Interface) to enable researchers to use data from the iPlant Data Store and execute programs via the High Performance Compute (HPC) resources at Texas Advanced Computing Center and San Diego Supercomputing Center (see Figure 1). These HPC resources are provided by iPlant through an allocation by the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) [3].  The BioExtract Server development team integrated the iPlant Agave API to provide access to its Data Store, Atmosphere cloud, and XSEDE supercomputing resources in a consistent way that allows users to scale their science without thinking about how to scale their infrastructure. The system has been implemented as a distributed, multi-tiered application using the Java Enterprise Edition (EE) platform. Java EE is the industry-standard platform for building enterprise-class applications supporting the scalability, accessibility, security, integrity, and other requirements of enterprise-class applications.  It is designed to reduce the complexity of enterprise system development by providing a development model, API, and runtime environment. The BioExtract Server system takes advantage of the Java EE capabilities and offers a robust workflow engine that exploits parallelism to solve large compute problems.   The BioExtract Server workflow system provides users with the ability to save a series of BioExtract Server tasks (e.g. querying a data source, saving a data extract and executing analytic tools) as a workflow (see Figure 2). Any series of tasks performed on data is a possible candidate for workflow automation. The BioExtract Server provides the ability to record tasks as they are performed and then turn those tasks into a workflow. As tasks are performed BioExtract Server records them, and they are saved in the "background". Once the entire set of tasks has been executed, researchers may save it as a workflow simply by providing a name and description. If one of the tasks executed by a researcher is the execution of an iPlant analytic tool, that task is incorporated into the workflow in the same manner as other tasks.  Through this project, functionality has been added to the BioExtract Server that offers researchers easy, integrated access to iPlant DE resources. The net result of the integration of the iPlant Agave API with the BioExtract Server is a gateway that provides significantly more capacity and capability than before and enables researchers, faculty, and students to perform data intensives analysis.   Importantly, this project has brought easily accessible high performance computing resources to institutions that may not have the in-house resources.  The BioExtract Server has been adopted by the South Dakota NIH NIGMS IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) program. This network is comprised of six South Dakota Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and two tribal colleges. This adoption allows us to bring easily accessible HPC resources to individual researchers across the state. Analytic...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
