<AbstractNarration>Studies throughout the globe indicate that the seaward transport of groundwater to the coast may play a significant role in the contribution of nutrient, micronutrient (e.g. Fe), carbon and other geochemical budgets of nearshore waters. The corresponding situation in Antarctica is likely to be similar, but is largely unstudied. The objective of this project is to quantify the rate of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and its associated fluxes of nutrients and iron to coastal Antarctic waters. The size of this discharge of the flux of re-circulated seawater and the subsurface glacial freshwater flow component, compared with the collocated surface inputs of freshwater sources, including melting glacial and sea-ice will be determined using a suit of chemical, isotopic and radiochemical tracers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current scenarios of the primary production of the waters offshore of Palmer Station and down-current of the Western Antarctic Peninsula suggest that limiting amounts of micronutrient iron, and other nutrients, are augmented by several continentally derived sources. The contribution of SGD dissolved Fe in this region is to date unknown, yet may be a significant component of the geochemical budgets of these productive coastal waters. Cross shelf mixing rates of Fe and nutrients will be estimated to better constrain the importance of SGD.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project investigated the input of glacier meltwater into the coastal ocean along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) in order to quantify the flux of biologically important elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon and iron from this source. Glacier melt is thought to be an important source of nutrients and micronutrients, such as iron, to the Southern Ocean that can lead to enhanced plant primary production, which in turn, can be a major "sink" of atmospheric CO2.              Our primary contribution to this collaborative project was to use the stable isotopes of water, &delta;18O and &delta;2H to quantify the amount of glacier melt that has entered the ocean. This is doable because glacier ice, and hence glacier melt, has much greater amounts of the lighter isotopes, 16O and 1H than seawater does, and therefore the amount of melt can be determined via mass balance calculations. These data, when combined with the radium isotopic data generated by our East Carolina University colleagues, can be utilized to provide highly quantitative estimates of freshwater and mixing rates of water into the ocean. This information then can be used to calculate the nutrient and iron concentration inputs. The horizontal mixing rates of water along the WAP ranged from 110-3600 m2sec-1, which are within the range calculated by other methods, and suggest rapid input and transport of glacier melt. Therefore our work indicates the importance of glacier melt as a source of these biologically important elements into the ocean. This is particularly relevant given that climate modeling predicts continued enhanced warming, and hence increased glacier meltwater input into the WAP in the future.
