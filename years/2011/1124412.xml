<AbstractNarration>False memories occur when people remember events in a way that diverges from the way the events actually happened. Both children and adults can be subject to false memories, but adults develop a number of strategies to limit these errors. One strategy involves making use of expectations about how vivid and distinctive particular sorts of memories should be (i.e., distinctiveness strategy). Another strategy involves making use of knowledge that memory of one event sometimes implies that another event did not happen (i.e., logical inconsistency strategy). Although these memory editing strategies are well developed in adults, they are less developed in children. The purpose of the planned research is to understand how children develop these skills.  In the first two experiments, children and adults will study lists made up of both pictures and words.  Because pictures tend to produce more vivid memories than words, a participant using the expected distinctiveness strategy should have fewer false memories for pictures. To measure the use of the logical inconsistency strategy, some participants will study lists where each item is presented as either a picture or a word, but never in both formats. This will allow them to use the logical inconsistency strategy (e.g., "I know it was not a picture because it was a word").  Other participants will study lists that include some items that are presented as pictures, some items that are presented as words, and some items that are presented as both pictures and words ? making the logical inconsistency strategy invalid. To see if strategy use is related to frontal lobe development, participants will complete a standard neurological test battery that measures frontal lobe function (Experiment 1-3). To see if strategy use is learned through experience, some participants engage in multiple study test trials to see if this experience increases strategy use (Experiment 2). The final year of the project will examine if these strategies are used by children in situations that mimic the challenges faced by actual child witnesses (Experiment 3).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of high profile cases in the 1980s and 1990s raised public concern about whether children sometimes falsely remember events, especially after suggestive questioning. In these and other contexts, the accuracy of children's memory can be of vital importance. Part of the puzzle involves understanding why children are less able to avoid false memories than adults. A science based understanding of strategy development in children could produce an immediate impact in these and other cases. The research we plan on conducting may improve methods for interviewing children and may help us understand the situations where children are most likely to fall prey to false memories. The research will also help determine if there are individual differences between children which may make some children more prone to memory errors than others. Finally, the research may have important educational implications.  If the strategies being investigated are learned through experience, the planned research may result in educational approaches that help children to learn these strategies more efficiently. In fact, as part of the investigators' plan to share the results of this research, they intend to hold annual "learning about learning" workshops with local school districts. These workshops will allow the investigators to share with educators the results of the research and will also allow the researchers to gain insights from the first hand experiences educators have helping children to learn.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ False memories occur for both children and adults.  When false memories involve recalling a memory originating from one source (e.g., a picture) when it really originated from a different source (e.g., a word) they are called source memory errors.  One strategy adults use to avoid these errors is called diagnostic monitoring. Diagnostic monitoring involves comparing the details a memory with the details one would expect the memory to have if it had derived from a particular source.  Another strategy is called disqualifying monitoring. This involves searching memory for details that are inconsistent with the event in question.  The purpose of the present project was to understand how these memory strategies develop in childhood.    We conducted four experiments.  In the first experiment, children and adults watched a videotape of a woman saying words.  After each word, a man either repeated the word or showed a picture. Some lists were mutually exclusive.  On these lists, it was never the case that an item was presented twice.  Consequently, it was never the case that the man both said the word and presented the corresponding picture.  Other lists were non-exclusive. On these lists, some items were repeated, so it was possible that the man both said the word and showed the corresponding picture.  Participants then completed a word test and a picture test.  On the word test, participants were only supposed to accept items if the man said the word.  On the picture test, participants were only supposed to accept items if the man had shown the picture.  Lower source memory errors (e.g., thinking an item had been presented as a picture when it had been presented as a word) occurred in the exclusive condition than the non-exclusive condition, indicating that disqualifying monitoring was occurring.  Fewer source errors occurred on the picture test than on the word test, indicating that diagnostic monitoring was occurring.  Children as young as 5 years old used both strategies.  Measures of intelligence, executive function, and recollection were related to the use of these strategies.  In the second experiment, we were interested in whether these strategies could be learned.  Participants (1st graders, 3rd graders and adults) studied lists as in Experiment 1. Participants then took three tests, with each test probing different words and pictures. On the first and third tests, no feedback was given, whereas on the second test, some subjects received item-level feedback throughout the test. Source errors declined across successive tests for all ages. However, explicit feedback did not reduce source errors in any age group. Additionally, all age groups could use picture recollections in a disqualifying monitoring strategy. That practice improves memory performance, even without feedback, has important educational implications. It suggests that testing effects found in educational psychology may transfer across tasks and may not even require explicit instruction in meta-cognitive strategies to be effective.  In a third experiment, we followed up on the effects of feedback and training on source memory errors but again found that children used disqualifying monitoring even without explicit training or feedback.  In our fourth experiment, we applied these ideas to children?s eyewitness testimony. Children watched a video about Samantha Stone. Samantha was described as clumsy and always causing accidents.   The video showed Samantha interacting with children and their teacher. During the video, several accidents happened.  Some of the accidents were caused by Samantha, some were caused by the teacher, and for some accidents it was not shown who caused it.  Additionally, some accidents were bizarre (e.g., comb falling in a toilet) and some were not (e.g., crayons spilling on table).  In a later interview, children were more likely to believe that Samantha caused the accidents when the person who caused the accident was not shown than when the teacher caused the accident. This demonstrates that children could use disqualifying monitoring.  They were also more likely to think that Samantha caused the bizarre accidents, perhaps because the nature of these events was consistent with the stereotype they had of Samantha being accident prone.  These experiments show that children?s use of strategies to avoid false memories may have been underestimated by past research.  When the memory load was low, children seemed adept at using disqualifying and diagnostic monitoring. Most research has found children have some ability to use these strategies when explicitly instructed to do so, but our research shows that even children can do so without specific instruction. Importantly, we also found that use of these accuracy preserving strategies can be increased with simple practice, even without providing children with explicit feedback.  The results have important legal implications, showing that children may be able to edit their memories for inaccuracies under some circumstances.  The results also have important educational implications, in that they show that practice with situations that require disqualifying and diagnostic monitoring may increase memory accuracy.
