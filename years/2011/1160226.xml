<AbstractNarration>This is a program to observe x-rays and gamma-rays emitted by thunderstorms.  Two known phenomena will be observed: the incredibly bright, fast terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) and ?glows? of gamma-rays emanating from the tops of active thunderstorm cells.  The Airborne Detector for Energetic Lightning Emissions (ADELE) is a set of gamma-ray detectors and supporting electronics.  In previous flights, it was found that the first TGF seen from an aircraft, set strong upper limits showing that TGFs are associated with &lt; 1% of lightning flashes, and established that glows are quite common and extend to energies &gt;5 MeV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADELE will be adapted to fly on a Global Hawk drone at 18 km as part of NASA?s Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) mission, which will provide 300 hours of flight time over tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic.  The activities to be performed include adapting the instrument for the new aircraft, integrating it onboard, participating in the campaigns by monitoring our instrument in real time from NASA?s Dryden flight facility, analyzing the data, and publishing and disseminating the results.  Scientists from Duke University will provide simultaneous broad-band radio-frequency data to interpret the behavior of lightning corresponding to TGFs and the periods in which glows are observed.  Scientists from Florida Tech will provide meteorological support and interpretation and will model the high-energy processes associated with TGFs and glows.  NASA Collaborator Richard Blakeslee and colleagues will provide detailed storm electrical measurements, including lightning, electric fields, air conductivity, and storm currents, from the Lightning Instrument Package which will be simultaneously flown on the Global Hawk during HS3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT &lt;br/&gt;The scientific goals embrace understanding the physical mechanism behind TGFs and glows and searching for high-energy emission associated with two other phenomena: gigantic jets and elves. The measurements of the intensity and spectrum of glows and the comparison of the gamma-ray data with lightning data from the same storm and in-situ electric field and conductivity data (provided by other instruments on HS3) will determine whether the glows represent a significant current caused by relativistic breakdown with feedback.  A new tool for estimating the magnitude and extent of the electric field in the upper layers of storms via the spectrum, intensity, and shape of the gamma-ray emission will be developed.  The ADELE flights will give dramatically improved views of recently-discovered phenomena that may play a role in thundercloud discharging and the physics of lightning initiation.  The discovery of high-energy radiation from gigantic jets and elves, both of which should involve high electric fields, is a possibility, since this would represent the first time a sensitive high-energy detector was taken into the vicinity of these phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS &lt;br/&gt;The program will train several graduate and undergraduate students, some already involved with ADELE and some new, in the skills of instrument development, programming, field work, data analysis, and publication. The TGF measurements (both detections and non-detections) will also help us address the public health question of how often (if ever) aircraft passengers are exposed to the radiation dose of a TGF. Directly within the region where TGFs are formed (probably less than a square kilometer), the dose could be up to 100 times the annual limit for non-radiation-workers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project was an attempt to measure and understand the several ways in which thunderstorms produce gamma radiation.    One of these ways is called a "terrestrial gamma-ray flash" or TGF.  A TGF is an enormously bright burst of radiation associated with lightning -- but only with a small fraction of lightning flashes, for reasons we don't understand. Thousands of upward TGFs have been observed beaming their gammas into space, seen by satellites in orbit.  But only a very few downward events have ever been seen from the ground.  We pursued TGFs with our custom-made gamma-ray detectors as guests on two aircraft -- the Global Hawk, an unmanned NASA plane, and the Hurricane Hunter's Orion aircraft.  We also built a second detector array that was deployed at two sites on the ground: on the Western coast of Japan, where winter thunderstorms hug the ground so closely that we get a good look at what's going on inside; and on a mountaintop site in Mexico.  With the Hurricane Hunters, we discovered a TGF happening in the eyewall of Hurricane Patricia in 2015, at a moment when that hurricane was the most intense one ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.  Not only was this the first time a TGF had ever been seen in the very unusual and very violent eyewall environment, there was something else unique about the observation: this was an upward TGF viewed from below.  As had been predicted by theorists but never observed before, the upward TGF -- produced by electrons accelerated upward by the thunderstorm's electric field -- has a backwards "tail" produced by positrons (the electron's antimatter counterpart) accelerating downwards.  This discovery opens up the new possibility of detecting upward TGFs regularly from the ground, since the Orion aircraft was only at 2.5km altitude, a height accessible from mountaintops.   Our calculations show that even lower altitudes, such as the 1.6km altitude of the city of Denver, should still allow these observations to be made.  Another observational first, confirming theoretical predictions, came from our campaign for winter thunderstorms in Japan.  We measured a TGF so extraordinarily bright that it completely paralyzed our instrumentation while the gamma-rays were present; but in the aftermath, we saw a signal in our detectors that could only be produced by a flood of neutrons coming out of the sky in the milliseconds afterwards.  These neutrons are knocked out of atomic nuclei in the air by the gammas themselves, and later absorbed by other atoms, resulting in radioactive nuclei on both ends of the process.  The study of this secondary radiation is an important part of determining the yet-unanswered question of whether there are rare circumstances in which TGF radiation is a hazard to humans.  Finally, as part of this project, we reanalyzed some data from an earlier flight of one of our instruments that took place in 2009.  In this case we were studying a different kind of thunderstorm gamma-ray event, which we call a "gamma-ray glow".  Unlike TGFs, which last for a millisecond or less, glows can last for as long as the electrical charges of a thundercloud are maintained.  The level of radiation in a glow is negligible compared to a TGF, but they may have a different kind of significance: the high-energy electrons that collide with nuclei in air to make the glow gamma-rays also produce a lot of ionization in the air, ripping other electrons from their parent atoms.  This produces electrical currents that start to cancel out the thundercloud's electric charges.  Of course the most dramatic way that thunderstorm charges get canceled out is by lightning; but by calculating the electrical currents associated with our glow observation, we were able to show that it is at least possible that glows may compete with lightning as the dominant way that some thunderclouds lose their charge.
