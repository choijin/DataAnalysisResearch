<AbstractNarration>Natural landscapes are often highly variable such that a species is likely to experience different selective pressures across its range. Such divergent selection can drive the adaptive differentiation of populations, maintain genetic variation, and promote speciation. Adaptation of populations to their local habitat has frequently been demonstrated, but is not well characterized at the genetic level. This study will look at adaptation to serpentine soils in Mimulus guttatus (common monkeyflower) to address the genetic basis of adaptive divergence. Serpentine soils represent a particularly harsh habitat that most plant species cannot survive in; however, M. guttatus is able to grow both on and off of these soils. This project will use high-throughput DNA sequencing technology to identify regions of the genome that contribute to differences in tolerance to soil conditions, test the adaptive significance of these genomic regions in the field, and identify traits that enable survival on serpentine soils. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characterizing the genetic basis of adaptation to heterogeneous environments could provide important insights for predicting how populations may respond to changing environments. Furthermore, by identifying genomic regions involved in plant growth on metal enriched, nutrient poor soils this project could have implications for phytoremediation of sites affected by mining or other activities resulting in toxic soils as well as crop breeding to improve tolerance to poor or stressful soils. This project will include mentorship of high school and undergraduate students and the engagement of the general public.</AbstractNarration>
