<AbstractNarration>This research advances a model of trust to delineate contextual and psychological factors that foster sustained satisfaction across the transition to parenthood. In relationships, trust functions to signal the safety of approach. Impulsive trust corresponds to automatic evaluative associations to the partner. Reflective trust corresponds to considered beliefs about the partner's motivation to be responsive. The proposed model predicts that being impulsively trusting can inoculate against concerns about the partner's responsiveness in ways that sustain satisfaction. This project involves a longitudinal, multimethod study of the transition to parenthood. The work to be conducted within the scope of the project is promising on several fronts. First, it advances a dual-process model to predict relationship satisfaction over a major life transition.  No previous research has examined the singular or joint effects of impulsive or reflective trust on satisfaction over the transition to parenthood. Second, research and theory in the close relationships area has only begun to explore dual-process models. This project is the first to investigate the automatic and controlled processes involved in responding constructively vs. destructively to conflicts-of-interest (in the lab and daily life). Third, people's limited ability to accurately introspect on their experience can impede scientific understanding of the factors that promote relationship satisfaction and stability. Importantly, this work can reveal ways to circumvent such limitations through its focus on reactions that do not require conscious insight into behavior (i.e., challenge/threat cardiovascular responses, if-then contingencies). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to its scientific merit, the research to be carried out promises societal benefits as well. This research could potentially identify tractable points of intervention for strengthening relationships over the transition to parenthood. It could also reveal how strengthening impulsive trust might help vulnerable people (e.g., low in self-esteem) thrive in relationships. Given the centrality of relationships for life happiness, the results of this research should generate broad interest in the field of psychology and the general public. In addition, the project involves the training of graduate and undergraduate students who are underrepresented in advanced data analytic techniques and psychophysiology. The university is part of an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse community, which will be reflected in the participants and graduate and undergraduate members of the research team.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Even though the birth of a first baby is a source of great joy and excitement, many couples experience significant declines in marital well-being as they adjust to their lives as new parents.  The current longitudinal study sought to identify psychological processes that make couples more or less vulnerable to such declines in satisfaction over time.  This project specifically focused on how people's automatic attitudes toward their partner affect adjustment.  Automatic attitudes refer to people's immediate, non-thinking evaluative reaction to their partner.  They capture people's most basic categorization of their partner as someone who is desirable to approach or best to avoid.  Couples first came to the laboratory about 6 weeks before their baby was born to complete various measures tapping their perceptions of themselves, their partner, and their relationship.  Then they returned home to do a 2 week daily diary assessment. Couples then returned to the laboratory 4-5 months after their baby was born.  They completed the same set of measures they did initially and they also negotiated a conflict while their cardiovascular responses were recorded.  Although analyses are still ongoing, the data have revealed new information about how couples adjust to the transition to parenthood.    First, as any new parent knows, couple interactions can change markedly from before to after a baby is born.  These changes can be captured through people's automatic attitudes toward their partner.  This project revealed that pre- and post-birth automatic partner attitudes exist simultaneously in memory and jointly affect how couples respond to one another as they confront difficult issues in their relationship.  Specifically, people who possess evaluatively inconsistent attitudes (i.e., positive pre-birth and negative post-birth, or negative pre-birth and positive post-birth) experience a state of behavioral confusion or angst because their attitudes motivate them to want to both approach and avoid their partner.  Consequently, couples with evaluatively inconsistent automatic partner attitudes behave more destructively when their partner disappoints them as a parent and they experience steeper declines in relationship well-being over time.    Second, as any new parent knows, taking care of a newborn can also violate expectations about how the world works, or is supposed to work. Prior research has suggested that people need to find some way to restore a sense of meaning in the world when their experiences confound their expectations (e.g., seeing that hard work does not pay off).  This project revealed that vulnerable couples will strengthen their commitment to one another when parenting challenges their expectations about how the world works.  Specifically, less satisfied new parents became more committed to their relationship when their experiences as parents violated gendered expectations about what new moms and dads should do.  Less satisfied new fathers strengthened their commitment when they ended up doing more domestic tasks than they expected (a violation of the cultural norm that men do less than women).  Similarly, less satisfied new mothers strengthened their commitment when they ended up doing fewer domestic tasks than they expected (a violation of the cultural norm that women do more than men).  These findings thus suggest that even vulnerable people can use their relationships to find a sense of meaning and purpose in the world when their expectations for how the world should work are violated.
