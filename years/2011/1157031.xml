<AbstractNarration>This award will support an REU program focus on The Science of Global Change and Sustainability hosted by the Environmental Science Institute?s at the University of Texas - Austin. The goals of the program are to provide REU students with an engaging research experience, the excitement of scientific inquiry, professional development opportunities, and an expanded perspective regarding graduate school and a science career. Additionally, student researchers will be engaged in approaches to campus sustainability as a local way to address issues of global change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real advancements in global change science require a non-traditional, interdisciplinary approach that integrate basic sciences such as geology, hydrology, and ecology, with applied and social sciences such as urban ecology, engineering, and policy. This REU program will provide both the specific disciplinary training and collaborative experiences necessary to develop and inspire future integrative scientists. REU students will follow a program that allows them to conduct field research, analyze samples on state-of-the-art instrumentation, interact with graduate students and faculty in multiple departments to interpret the results, present the results at a campus-wide poster session and then at a national professional meeting, and participate in seminars on research ethics, global change science topics, and the science-policy interface.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The goal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in "The Science of Global Change and Sustainability" at The University of Texas at Austin is to provide undergraduate students with an engaging and challenging research experience in a university research laboratory or field research setting, the excitement of scientific inquiry, professional development, and an expanded perspective regarding graduate school and careers in science. Our aim is to recruit primarily from schools unable to supply high-level research experiences and to recruit students from groups underrepresented in the sciences and engineering.  In summer 2014 we brought ten undergraduates to UT-Austin for 10 weeks to conduct research projects in the research groups of faculty working on topics in global change and sustainability. Student activities included a major research project for each participant under the mentorship of a faculty researcher bolstered by six other types of activities over the course of the summer. There are six connecting field experiences; four seminars, including ethics and sustainability; practical applications and career development; social activities; a final university-wide poster presentation; and a reflection portfolio synthesizing all the elements of their experience.  Two of the 2014 students and one additional 2013 student authored 3 abstracts that were delivered as presentations or posters at national meetings of the Geological Society of America or the American Geophysical Union.  We were particularly successful in attracting a geographically and ethnically diverse cohort of REU fellows for summer 2014.   Real advancements in global change science require a non-traditional, interdisciplinary approach that integrate basic sciences such as geology, hydrology, and ecology, with applied and social sciences such as urban ecology, engineering, and policy. The REU program provides both the specific disciplinary training and collaborative experiences necessary to develop and inspire future integrative scientists.
