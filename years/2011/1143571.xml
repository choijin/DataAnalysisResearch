<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Carl J. Wendt and an international team of colleagues will conduct two field seasons of archaeological research on the Mexican Gulf Coast at the medium-sized Olmec (1200-500 B.C.) site of Los Soldados.  The team will collect household-level data from the Middle Formative period (1000-400 BC) site of that is situated 11 km southwest of the La Venta capital.  The resulting data will be used to (1) develop a ceramic typology and ceramic stratigraphic sequence for the La Venta region, (2) elucidate domestic organization, domestic ritual, and subsistence adaptations, and (3) make inferences on regional resource control and political economy. Not only will household archaeology increase our understanding of Olmec community structure and domestic organization, Middle Formative domestic activities are a key to understanding larger questions of household socioeconomics and or cultural complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archaeologists believe that the Olmec were the first "complex" society in Middle America and that the roots of later civilizations such as the Maya can be traced back to this base. Thus the research is highly significant in a New World context. The work will also shed light on the processes which led to the emergence of complex societies and thus has relevance within a broader context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is significant and unique in Olmec studies in that it takes a "bottom-up" approach to the study of the Middle Formative Olmec by collecting household-level data from a range of domestic contexts across a secondary center to address questions and test hypotheses on Olmec domestic organization, subsistence patterning, and regional resource control.  The research will build on the body of household archaeology theory and method to generate a much clearer picture of Middle Formative Olmec daily life, exchange networks and procurement systems, the organization domestic craft production, and how people adapted to and modified their tropical lowland environment.  The "bottom-up"/household approach contrasts with most other studies of Olmec society and polity that draw inferences from the more grandiose aspects of the society such as stone monument carving and transport.  By measuring differences in household assemblages, Wendt and his team will be able to determine what the Olmec elite actually controlled, and investigate the scale of the control, rather than drawing inferences indirectly from measures of monument transport or artistic skill, which often result in erroneous impressions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the research is that it will contribute to undergraduate and graduate student learning, help build and strengthen international partnerships (US and Mexico), and employ household archaeology to study ancient daily life in Mesoamerica as well as the nature of economic and political control in an early Mesoamerican society.  More broadly, this research will help elucidate the processes and factors involved in the rise and organization of complex societies in Mesoamerica in particular, and the New World in general. Results also will be used to contribute to and build on theory on power strategies used by elite in early complex societies by providing data on one specific instance of what resources and commodities La Venta elite actually controlled.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Carl J. Wendt and an international team of colleagues conducted archaeological excavations on the Mexican Gulf Coast at the medium-sized Olmec (1200-500 BC) site of Los Soldados.  The team collected household-level data from the Middle to Late Formative period (1000 BC &ndash; AD 300) site of that is situated 11 km southwest of the La Venta capital.  The resulting data was used to (1) develop a ceramic typology and ceramic stratigraphic sequence for the La Venta region, (2) elucidate domestic organization, domestic ritual, and subsistence adaptations, and (3) make inferences on regional resource control and political economy. Not only does household archaeology increase our understanding of Olmec community structure and domestic organization, Middle and Late Formative domestic activities are a key to understanding larger questions of household socioeconomics and or cultural complexity.  Excavations uncovered a range of features and artifact concentrations.  Features included numerous pit features containing abundant ceramic and other materials.  Materials recovered include ceramic sherds, partial and complete vessels, thousands of chipped and ground stone artifacts, clay figurines, greenstone axes and beads, burnt clay, bitumen, pigment, bone, and hundreds of other objects.  We also uncovered various prepared surfaces, some of which appear to have been house floors.  Results of the radiocarbon analysis show that Los Soldados was occupied spanning the Middle to Late Formative periods (ca. 800 to 100 BC).  Within this range, we were able to identify three distinct phases:  800-400 BC, 400-200 BC, and 350-100 BC.  In addition, there is a possible Early Formative component (1350-1100 BC).  Paleobotanical analysis shows that the residents of Los Soldados were using/consuming a range of wild and cultivated foods including maize, beans, palm fruits, avocados, strawberries, elderberries, mamey sapote, purslane, violet, and verbena.  Interestingly, Mexican prickly poppy was also present in some samples, and its presence suggests medicinal/ritual use.  The wide range of plants in the samples leads us to suggest that the diet at Los Soldados was quite diverse.   Analysis of chipped stone artifacts reveals an expedient stone tool industry.  Surprisingly, and quite unusual was the large amount of chert in comparison to obsidian in the assemblage.  Over 60% of the chipped stone is chert, which differs remarkably from other sites in the region where assemblages are dominated by obsidian, which usually consists of upwards of 90% in Olmec assemblages.  This suggests that cutting activities conducted at Los Soldados required more durable yet less sharp cutting material.      As part of this project, Wendt has trained 10 anthropology students in field research.  Seven of these students are from the US, and four of them are currently enrolled in PhD programs.  Two of the three Mexican archaeology students completed their licenciatura theses using data generated from this project.  As part of this project three graduate and nearly twenty undergraduate CSUF students have received training in data entry (and management) and digitizing in ArcGIS.   Overall, this project is significant and unique in Olmec studies in that it takes a "bottom-up" approach to the study of the Middle Formative Olmec by collecting household-level data from a range of domestic contexts across a secondary center.  The research builds on the body of household archaeology theory and method to generate a much clearer picture of Middle Formative Olmec daily life, exchange networks and procurement systems, the organization domestic craft production, and how people adapted to and modified their tropical lowland environment.
