<AbstractNarration>This work will develop a computational framework to advance the understanding of epigenetic gene regulation. One of the most important tasks in modern molecular biology is to understand the role of epigenome in gene regulation and in phenotype development. With the current unprecedented availability of genome-scale epigenetic modification data, this project will develop computational algorithms and tools to model histone modification and discover patterns that are of interest to gene regulation. The discovered histone modification patterns will provide us deep insights into multiple epigenetic modification interaction and genome-epigenome interaction. The probabilistic model of gene expression regulation constructed from large-scale genomics and epigenomic data integration will greatly advance understanding of gene regulation at different levels. The objectives of this research are to: (1) create novel algorithms to model epigenetic modifications from high-throughput sequencing data; (2) create computational and statistical algorithms to mine epigenetic modification patterns; and (3) model gene regulation through genomic and epigenomic data integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence. This work will develop tools for modeling epigenetic changes. All of the proposed research will be converted into software tools that will be released as open-source and freely available software tools to the scientific community. All the associated source code will be freely available to the public through the project website. The proposed research will have great impact on education at all levels. The research will be incorporated into the graduate, undergraduate and K12 education, and will be disseminated to the research community, informal science education, and the public to enhance scientific understanding. The education and outreach component also includes developing outreach activities for women and girls in interdisciplinary science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual merit:</p> <p>This project aims to advance our understanding of epigenetic gene regulation through NGS epigenomic data integration. We have been working on the nucleosome sequencing and ChIP-Seq data for method development and data interpretation. We have developed novel approaches such as ChIPModule and SIOMICS to systematically discover TFs and their cofactors from ChIP-Seq data. We have also applied our methods to 349 human DNase I hypersensitive site datasets and discovered significant regulatory mechanisms. In order to understand the epigenetic aspect of gene regulation, we have performed a study on H3K4me2 enriched genomic regions. This study involved 149 TF ChIP-Seq datasets and 33 HM ChIP-Seq datasets in three cell lines. We found H3K4me2 can reliably define TF binding regions. In order to understand the underlying mechanism for nucleosome formation, we have developed a pattern discovery and scoring method called FFN. FFN can identify combinatorial feature patterns that are differentially enriched in nucleosome-forming and nucleosome depletion sequences. In addition, we developed a probabilistic graphical model to discover latent epigenetic modification modules (EMMs) from 56 reference epigenomes. The resulted EMMs show their condition-relevance to the corresponding reference epigenomes. Moreover, our novel computational method called EPIP has shown to reliably predict enhancer-promoter interactions especially cell-specific ones. EPIP can incrementally improve its performance with new training data without the need to re-train with the old training data. It is capable of predicting interactions in cell types with limited genomic data. &nbsp;We further studied interacting enhancer-promoter pairs determined in four previous studies using computational algorithms. Finally, To understand why ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) are coordinately regulated, we integrated the chromatin interaction data in seven cell lines and seventeen primary cell types to study the distal regulatory regions of human RPGs. we identified thousands of putative distal regulatory regions that directly or indirectly interact with RPG promoters. We made significant discoveries that will have a high impact on enhancer promoter interaction pair predictions. With enhancer promoter interaction pair predicted in nine cell lines and nine primary cell types, we observed that two enhancers are likely to regulate either the same genes or completely different genes. This observation implies that enhancers form clusters, in which each cluster of enhancers synchronously interact with almost every member of a set and only this set of genes. We perceive that an enhancer can be up to two mega base pairs away from other enhancers in the same cluster. We also notice that although a fraction of these clusters of enhancers does overlap with super enhancers, the majority of the enhancer clusters are different from known super enhancers.
