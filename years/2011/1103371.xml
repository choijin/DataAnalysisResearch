<AbstractNarration>The researchers will use the geochemical signature of shells from the European Limpet, Patella vulgata, collected from archaeological sites along the Scottish coast, to reconstruct surface seawater temperature (SST) seasonality during the mid-to-late Holocene.  The specific goal of the project is to test hypotheses related to shifts in winter/summer seasonality during the Sub-boreal to Sub-Atlantic transition and the Medieval-Climate Anomaly to Little-Ice-Age transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include support of graduate students and strong international collaboration.  Furthermore, research methods and results will be broadly disseminated through exhibits and lectures at the North Carolina Museum of Natural History, and the Orkney and Mull Museums in Scotland. Finally, software developed through the project will be made freely available to the international scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit    Subboreal-Subatlantic Transition. The coldest winter months recorded in Neoglacial (3300-2500 BP; Bronze Age) shells averaged 6.6&plusmn;0.3&ordm;C, and the warmest summer months averaged 14.7&plusmn;0.4&ordm;C.

MCA-LIA Transition. MCA shells recorded warmer summers and colder winters by ~2&ordm; C relative to the late 20th century.

Without the benefit of seasonal resolution, sea surface temperature averaged from shell time series would be weighted toward the fast-growing summer season, resulting in the conclusion that the early MCA was warmer than the late 20th century by ~1&deg;C. This conclusion is broadly true for the summer season, but not true for the winter season. Higher seasonality and cooler winters during early medieval times may result from a weakened NAO index. In contrast, the LIA shells have a more a variable inter-annual pattern. Some years record cooler summers and winters relative to the MCA shells and late 20th century, whereas other years record warmer summers and cooler winters similar to the MCA shells. Our findings provide a new test for the accuracy of seasonal amplitudes resulting from paleoclimate model experiments.     Sclerochronology of Modern P. vulgata from Warm- and Cold-Temperate Zones along the Eastern North Atlantic. Isotope sclerochronology (the study of isotopic variation along shell growth patterns) identified differences in seasons of fast vs. slow shell growth from P. vulgata inhabiting warm- and cold-temperate biogeographic provinces. Individuals from the cold-temperate zone produce annual growth lines in winter, representing slowed growth, whereas specimens from the warm-temperate zone form annual growth lines in summer. Shells from the boundary between these two biogeographic provinces form annual growth lines in winter or summer. Our results are similar to Mercenaria shells from the western North Atlantic Thermal tolerance is the mostly likely mechanism for the observed changes in the timing of annual growth line formation with latitude.
