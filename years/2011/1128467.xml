<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research is conducted on the design of output feedback control of nonlinear systems using high-gain observers. The research will tackle two challenging problems. First it will address the stabilization and regulation of non-minimum phase nonlinear systems using high-gain observers. Non-minimum phase systems pose a challenge in the design of feedback control, even for linear systems. The research will build on recent results by the principal investigator on designing regulators using conditional servocompensators and the use of extended high-gain observers as virtual sensors. There are challenging technical problems that need to be solved to make these designs feasible.  Second, the research will tackle the challenging problem of using high-gain observers in a noisy environment. New designs that use nonlinear gains to change the effective gain of the observer during transient and steady-state operation will be developed and tested experimentally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One outcome of the project will be a research monograph on high-gain observers in nonlinear feedback control. The proposed activity will broaden participation of underrepresented groups. The ECE Department at Michigan State University has an active program to recruit women and minority Ph.D. students.</AbstractNarration>
