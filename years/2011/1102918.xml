<AbstractNarration>This research supports the examination of the coupling and synchronization of polar climate oscillations.  The researcher postulates that each polar region behaves as a self-sustained relaxation oscillator with its own natural frequency and nonlinear feedbacks influencing each other through dissipative coupling proportional to the temperature and heat storage gradients between North and South Atlantic Ocean and atmosphere.  The researcher will examine polar synchronization and the possible connection to Heinrich events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research include the support of a doctoral student and the participation of undergraduate students in the research project</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Synchronization is a widespread phenomenon in nonlinear, physical, chemical and biological systems. It describes the phenomena whereby two or more weakly interacting, nonlinear oscillators adjust their natural frequencies until they lock in phase and frequency. This behavior has been observed in biological, chemical and electronic systems, including neurons, fireflies, and computers, but has not been widely studied in climate. This NSF-funded project involves the study of several cases of synchronized climatic systems in different time scales. A first important finding reveals the global climate&rsquo;s gradual synchronization to the Earth&rsquo;s 413kyr orbital eccentricity band, which we show starts at the Mid-Pleistocene transition (~1Ma) with the phase lock between the solar forcing and the climate response (Rial et al. 2013). A second major example of stable synchronization in the climate system is the continuous, 90 degree phase lock of the polar climate signals for the available methane-matched record (~90ky) (Rial 2012; Oh et al. 2014). These results resolve the controversy on the phase difference between the polar climates, and therefore what the hemispheric seesaw is. A third important product of our research group has been the retrieval, by a careful application of spectral deconvolution, of the transfer function that connects the two Polar Regions and that is likely responsible for keeping them synchronized (Reischmann et al. 2016a). This transfer function is nearly monochromatic, and suggests that the signal is predominately communicated north to south with a period of 1.6kyrs.
