<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is the theoretical study of certain devices that have been proposed as possible building blocks for photonic quantum computers; that is, quantum computers where the information is carried by single photons.  The devices considered involve a single atom or quantum dot in an optical microcavity.  Their design is a substantial improvement over previous designs because of their very low power requirements and potentially very low failure rate.  Several different configurations will be studied as regards experimental feasibility and potential for best performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many groups around the world are working on photonic quantum computers, and this research will have a direct impact on such work.  Moreover, even if an all-optical quantum computer eventually turned out not to be the best choice, photons will almost certainly still be used for communication between the nodes of quantum networks in the future (as they are now in commercially available quantum cryptography systems), and the devices to be studied here would be very useful in such networks, to provide memory storage and allow for error correction operations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to explore ways to achieve quantum computation using single photons.  A single photon is the minimum amount of energy that can be stored in an electromagnetic field at a given frequency, so the goal was in part to ascertain how much energy is necessary to carry out an elementary operation in a quantum computer, given some constraints such as how fast one wants the operation to be, or the maximum acceptable error rate.  To this end several theoretical schemes were studied in which two individual photons would interact through an auxiliary system (typically a sort of interferometer known as an "optical cavity"), with the requirement that this auxiliary system should be "passive," that is, it would not require to be driven by an external source of energy (such as an external, "classical" electromagnetic field--a laser, for instance).  Our study showed that there is essentially only one system that satisfies the above requirements and can achieve, in principle, a very high fidelity (a figure of merit that is equivalent to a very small error probability).  This scheme involves a single three-level atom inside an optical cavity and needs to be operated in what is known as the "adiabatic regime," which is to say, relatively slowly (long photon pulses).  We were able to show that under some circumstances the requirement of adiabaticity can be relaxed somewhat, allowing for slightly faster operation.  We also showed that there may be some flexibility in the atomic level structure as well, although making use of that flexibility (essentially, the possibility that the photons may not have the same frequency) introduces complications elsewhere.  By contrast, we found that in other passive systems we studied (optomechanical cavities, and nonlinear optical media) there was typically a tradeoff between the strength of the interaction and the achievable fidelity, which made all these schemes essentially unusable.  We believe, however, that there remains a hidden "energy cost" associated with the first, and most favorable, scheme (three-level atom inside optical cavity), and that is the need for some switching mechanism that can route the individual photons into or out of appropriate storage loops where they need to be kept in between their repeated interactions with the cavity.  Hence a part of our work was devoted to try to find the minimum energy required to switch, or deflect, a photon, from some path to an orthogonal one.  We were not able to get very conclusive results on this problem, which seems to be somewhat circular: in principle, if one had a scheme to generate a "maximal" effective photon-photon interaction, one could use that to make a switch that is activated by a single photon; however, in order to have such a working interaction, it seems one needs first to have a working switch!  We have not been able to find a way out of this difficulty, nor (alternatively) to prove that it is indeed insurmountable, so we intend to continue to explore this question in the future.
