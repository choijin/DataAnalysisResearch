<AbstractNarration>The TigersTeach Noyce Initiative is a partnership involving Clemson's Eugene T. Moore School of Education, College of Engineering and Science, and College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences in collaboration with partner school districts in Anderson, Oconee, Pickens and Greenville Counties, SC.  The project is providing scholarships for 30 undergraduates or post-baccalaureate students to become mathematics and science teachers.  Teacher candidates participate in early field experiences guided by Master Teachers.  The project provides multiple entry points for students from first-year engineering and science majors through post-baccalaureate students. Students either enter a dual degree program completing a degree in a STEM major plus a STEM education degree or enter a graduate level MAT program in secondary science or mathematics after completing a STEM undergraduate degree. The project uses a servant-leader model focusing on a commitment of service to high-needs communities and providing substantive immersive experiences in school and community agencies.  Using Clemson University's innovative Call Me Mister program as a model, the project is creating a comprehensive set of activities to develop a program with service and leadership as intended outcomes, both on campus and in partner schools. These program activities educate students about the teaching profession by involving them in seminars with veteran scientists and teachers, by encouraging participation in professional conferences, and by working in local schools and agencies. Students learn about and contribute back to the community and profession by being engaged in a continuous series of mentoring, tutoring, and teaching events throughout the program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of the Clemson TigersTeach Noyce program was to prepare students, with a background in STEM areas, as secondary science and mathematics teachers to teach in high-needs districts. Over the life of the grant, in conjunction with our district partners, we prepared 48 scholars through our secondary science or mathematics education degrees.  Of those graduates from our programs from 2012 to 2017, 39 are still serving in the field as science and mathematics teachers.   Through the grant, we provided our scholars with a supportive learning community through a series of co-curricular immersion activities, including discussion panels, teacher panels, professional development workshops, and field trips.  Our scholars also had opportunities to work with underrepresented minorities, in grades 9-12, on campus for summer programs and support to attend and present at state, regional, and national conferences.  After graduation, our alumni received mentoring during their induction years through school-based and faculty mentors.  Using the results of program evaluations, we made continuous improvements to both our undergraduate and graduate degree programs in secondary science and mathematics education.  We maintained flexible degree options for our students (BS majors, BA dual majors, and MAT), created new courses for students to better prepare them in content and pedagogy, and created materials and strategies to recruit for our programs that will persist after the grant period ends.  In addition to offering scholarships to students with STEM backgrounds interested in teacher preparation programs, we offered Clemson students in STEM majors the opportunity to participate in a semester-long internship experience in a high school setting.  Over the life of the grant, we placed over 100 STEM undergraduate students with mentor teachers in high school settings, provided orientations for both our students and mentor teachers, held several call-back meetings each semester, and engaged the interns in reflections about their experiences to answer the question, "Do I want to teach?"  At least seven of the students changed into one of our teacher preparation programs as a result of this internship, with several more pursing their options at other universities.
