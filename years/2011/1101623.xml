<AbstractNarration>The 15th International Conference on Random Structures &amp; Algorithms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 15th International Conference on Random Structures &amp; Algorithms  &lt;br/&gt;will take place at Emory University in Atlanta, May 24 - 28, 2011.   &lt;br/&gt;This is a biennial meeting, initiated in 1983 by the Faculty of Mathematics, Adam Mickiewicz University, in  Poznan, Poland.  The aims of these conferences are to present recent research results and to identify and explore directions for further research in random discrete structures, randomized algorithms and broad areas of applications of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics, computer science, and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is established as a key locus for the exposition of trends and breakthroughs in the development of probabilistic methods and their application in discrete mathematics and CS theory.&lt;br/&gt;The choice of the plenary speakers highlights important themes ranging from classical topics such as Ramsey theory, phase transitions in random graphs,  and the regularity lemma, which have seen recent exciting progress, to modern ones including  message passing algorithms, unique games related hardness of approximation for optimization problems,  internet related mechanism design, auctions, and computational game theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main feature of the conferences is the mix of researchers from discrete mathematics, theoretical CS and optimization, attracted by a common interest in probabilistic tools and their application.  Holding the meeting in Atlanta is intended to attract more involvement from the CS theory community, which is arguably best-developed in this country.  Conference activities will be widely disseminated by the conference proceedings in Random Structures &amp; Algorithms, a leading research journal, on the conference website, and through archived and/or streaming video of selected lectures.  We hope to attract, and support, a large number of students and postdoctoral researchers, and participants from groups under-represented in the community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Intellectual Merit:   The main themes of the conference revolve around the use of probabilistic methods in the study of discrete structures and algorithms.  The scientific and organizing committees have long experience in holding such meetings, this being the 15th in a biennial series usually hosted in Poznan, Poland.  We were able to attract many of the leading math and CS researchers who study random structures and algorithms, as well as large numbers of young scientists.  The main themes are well depicted by the titles of the 10 invited lectures:  1. Asymptotics of random structures was represented by the invited talks of Bela Bollobas (The distribution of the number of vertices in the giant component), Jeff Kahn (Upper tails for cliques) and Nick Wormald (Cops and robber on random graphs).  2. Extremal and probabilistic combinatorics was  represented by the invited talks of Jacob Fox (Graph regularity and removal lemmas) and Joel Spencer (Two Needles from Exponential Haystacks).  3. Statistical physics was  represented by the invited talks of David Gamarnik (Statistical physics of random structures and algorithms) and Eric Vigoda (Improved bound on the phase transition for independent sets in the square lattice).  4. Theoretical Computer Science was represented by the invited talks of Subhash Khot (On the unique games conjecture), Jennifer Chayes (Strategic network models: from building to bargaining), and Fan Chung (The combinatorics of PageRank).  Taken as a whole, these presentations highlight many of the most exciting themes in this interdisciplinary area spanning mathematics, computing and optimization, unified by the common use of probabilistic methods to study structures and develop algorithms.  Broader Impacts:  Techniques from probability theory have become indispensable in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, both in the development of mathematical and computational theory and methods, and in the creation of efficient algorithms.  By bringing together probabilists, discrete mathematicians and computer scientists, the RSA 2011 Conference provided a unique opportunity to exchange methods and ideas arising in these distinct communities.  It was particularly beneficial for the young researchers -- graduate students and postdoctoral fellows -- who came to the meeting in large numbers.  Of 74 contributed presentations, more than 30 were given by graduate students and post docs.  The conference series, beginning in 1983, has stressed the importance of melding probability, optimization, discrete math and CS theory.   Significant aspects of the work presented are concerned with "real-world" applications, as indicated by the talks motivated by PageRank and problems in statistical physics.  The interdisciplinary nature of the meeting was underscored this time by the overlapping 2-day Eight Workshop on Algorithms and Models of the Web Graph (WAW 2011).   This workshop focuses on probabilistic graph models that are motivated by huge networks such as the WWW and nicely complement the "traditional" Erdos-Renyi models that underscore much of the work in random graphs.  Another significant impact of the meeting is the cooperation it fostered among Emory University, Georgia Tech and Adam Mickiewicz University.  Each has strong programs in discrete mathematics and CS theory which are made more robust by the interaction of their faculty and students.   The proceedings of the conference will eventually be disseminated in special issues of the leading journal Random Structures &amp; Algorithms [published by Wiley].  We expect publication during 2012.  Videos of each of the 10 invited 1-hour talks are posted on the Emory University iTunes site and accessible without charge to the public.
