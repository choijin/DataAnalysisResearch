<AbstractNarration>Under the aegis of the AGS-PRF (post-doctoral research fellowship) solicitation, the researcher aims to produce multiple, quantitative paleo-precipitation reconstructions, spanning the last 1,500 years, across an east-west transect of lakes in western North America.  Specifically, the researcher will use hydrologic and isotope mass balance models to quantitatively interpret existing (Washington and British Columbia) and new (Montana) lake sediment isotope records to develop regional precipitation reconstructions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These reconstructions will be used to investigate hypotheses regarding contrasting aridity patterns and to assist in ongoing experiments using perturbed physics ensemble runs of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that govern potential changes in El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and their associated impacts on extra-tropical precipitation and drought patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve supporting an early career scientist and helping reduce the uncertainty in probabilistic future projections of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) phenomenon and helping to constrain predictions of future hydroclimatic conditions in the arid regions of western North America.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The broadly defined goals of this project are to characterize hydroclimate variability in the Pacific Northwest (Figure 1) of North America over the past two millennia using analyses of lake sediment oxygen isotope data and model simulations, and to provide insight into ocean-atmosphere and external forcing controls on climate in this drought stressed region through comparison/synthesis of paleoproxy data.  In the past two years we conducted two field seasons in which we collected 4 new sediment cores from lakes in Montana and southern British Columbia (see Figure 1) as well as bathymetric data, water samples for isotope and ion chemistry, and water column limnolgical profiles.  The lakes have characteristics (e.g., volume, catchment size, hydrologic setting) similar to those of lakes we have studied in the past, and a hydrologic and isotope mass balance model has been produced as part of this research for application to these sites.  This model will be used to quantitatively interpret the sediment isotope data once it becomes available.  Processing of the lake cores for oxygen isotope analysis is currently underway at the University of Pittsburgh, and will be completed over the next several months. Isotope analysis will be conducted at the Large Lakes Observatory, University of Minnesota Duluth using the isotope lab IRMS.  We are highly confident that we will produce at least three 2000 year oxygen isotope records from the Pacific Northwest.  Once these records are produced, we will include them in ongoing analyses of existing records from the western American cordillera.  In the past two years, we have published 4 manuscripts that are directly relevant to this project: two in  which we established the modeling and sediment core processing framework for producing the quantitative paleoprecipitation datasets, and two in which we interpret the paleodata in the context of other, regional records of drought.  The most recent of these papers (Steinman et al. 2014, Geophysical Research Letters 41) synthesizes all available lake sediment oxygen isotope data from the Pacific Northwest (and presents two newly developed records) and draws conclusions regarding ocean-atmosphere forcing of hydroclimate in western North America over the past 2000 years.  The lake sediment oxygen isotope data synthesized as part of this research (Figure 2) indicate that past precipitation amounts in the Pacific Northwest during them Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (~900-1300 AD) were greater than during the Little Ice Age (LIA)(~1450-1850 AD).  This finding implies that hydroclimate variations on centennial timescales in response to synoptic climate variability (e.g., the El Nino Southern Oscillation) mediated by external (e.g., solar and volcanic) forcing may be greater than previously thought.  This pattern is consistent with observed associations between the El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Northern Annular Mode and drought (shown in Figure 1) as well as with proxy-based reconstructions of Pacific ocean-atmosphere variations over the past 1000 years (Figure 3), and with climate model simulations of precipitation anomalies in western North America during the LIA and MCA (see Figure 4) (Steinman et al. 2014 Geophysical Research Letters 41).  The large amplitude of centennial variability indicated by the lake data suggests that regional hydroclimate is characterized by longer-term shifts in ENSO-like dynamics, and that an improved understanding of the centennial timescale relationship between external forcing and drought conditions is necessary for projecting future hydroclimatic conditions in western North America.
