<AbstractNarration>The Network Science project is a three year ITEST strategies project designed to engage 120 disadvantaged high school students (grades 10-11) and up to 30 high school STEM teachers from Boston and New York urban schools in a network science research based program, using cutting edge computer modeling research technology. Working with graduate student mentors, Network Science students and teachers will: (a) learn about the emerging discipline of network science, (b) construct and analyze science networks using computations and data visualizations, (c) use networks to solve problems across STEM domains (e.g., energy, communications, and diseases) through collaborative research projects and integrated technology, and (d) present their research at an annual Network Science research conference. Three cohorts of students and teachers will participate in a two week residential summer camp at Boston University, an intensive summer research experience (4 weeks), an academic yearlong program (continued research, industry lab tours, workshops, virtual visits), and an annual Network Science Research conference. Student participants will also receive internship opportunities by industry partners after the culminating conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boston University and the New York Hall of Science will work collaboratively to implement all phases of the project. Advisors from ten partner research laboratories will play an integral role in the development and implementation of the program. In addition, formative and summative evaluations will be conducted using a mixed method approach by an experienced external evaluator. The ultimate goal of the project is to attract disadvantaged youth to careers in IT and STEM through positive IT research experiences, internships and mentoring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     In Network Science for the Next Generation (NetSci High) Boston University and the New York Hall of Science facilitated a training program and series of year-long research projects for teams of high school students and teachers from high needs schools. The research teams were mentored by scientists and graduate students from research labs in Boston and New York. Participating institutions included Harvard Medical School, Boston University, Columbia University, Stevens Institutue of Technology, U.S. Military Academy at West Point and Binghamton University. Graduate students and/or scientist mentors participated with project teams in 2-week summer training program at Boston University in computational and analytical methods in complex networks. At the end of the year of research, teams presented their work at professional science conferences.   This project led to deep involvement of both project personnel and high school students in international organizations, conferences and workshops; and brought about a significant increase in the interest and initiatives in education in network science at all levels as well as in data science and computer science.  Intellectual Merit   NetSci High provided strong evidence that heterogeneous cohorts of high school students have the intellectual capacity to understand and use computational and analytical approaches to study data-intensive complex networks and draw conclusions from those results. NetSci High also provided evidence that performing meaningful research in a team setting with ongoing mentorship motivates students to realize the value of computational tools and persist in STEM as they advance to tertiary education. Further, the program provided evidence that high school teachers are capable of participating in research teams, but require additional scaffolding of skills and meaningful connections to their discipline in order to succeed.   Broader Impacts   While NetSci High was conducted with over 100 students, teachers and graduate students; beyond the project itself there is significant residual impact on both communities of scientific practice and secondary learning settings. High school students and teachers continue their relationships with researchers and have found alternative ways to support training and research projects modeled after NetSci High. They have also found ways to support student-teacher teams in participating in professional conferences and events. NetSci High has also resulted in a growing network science community of practice interested in education and project personnel and participating institutions now host annual symposia on network science and education and developed a set of "Network Literacy: Essential Concepts and Core Ideas," which explicates what the network science community of practice believes are what everyone should know about networks by the time they graduate from high school. This has been distributed in electronic and print form worldwide, promoted at internattional workshops and conferences and has been translated into 19 languages. More information about these ongoing efforts can be found at the websites: http://www.bu.edu/networks and https://sites.google.com/a/binghamton.edu/netscied/.      One of the participating teachers has gotten a credit bearing network science high school course added to the curriculum offerings for their home high school and NetSci High participating institutions are developing teacher training programs and curriculum and standards alignment with NGSS, as these new standards roll out in New York and Massachusetts.   At Boston University, the experience of NetSci High has been a stepping stone towards a collective impact approach to broader impacts, whereby successful programs such as NetSci High can sustain, evolve and scale.  A lasting outcome is a university-wide effort and other collaborative initiatives that align K-12 STEM outreach with undergraduate and graduate education, STEM research, industry partnerships and city and state partnerships.
