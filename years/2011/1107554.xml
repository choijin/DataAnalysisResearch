<AbstractNarration>Hopa Mountain, a Bozeman, MT based nonprofit organization, in collaboration with the Blackfeet Native Science Field Center at Blackfeet Community College, is scaling up their Track 2 Native Science Fellows program to engage up to 20 Native American college students annually in community-based geosciences field experiences and careers.  Working together, these organizations provide role models and work experience for Native American tribal college and university students interested in the geosciences; develop an annual Fellows gathering with peer networks of Native college students that are interested in pursuing geosciences careers; and strengthen the network of colleges, organizations and science professionals who are committed to the success of Native students, providing students with on-going support for personal, academic and professional success.  Additionally, the Blackfeet Native Science Field Center is organizing a week-long Native Science Summer Institute for 25 secondary students.  These career-ladder fellowship programs are designed to expand the number of Native American students in the Northern Rockies that are pursuing geosciences degrees and careers.</AbstractNarration>
