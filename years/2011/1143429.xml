<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a cloud-based communication tool for managing handshakes between information workers.  Handshakes are goal-oriented interactions that occur frequently in the course of collaborative information work, such as questions, requests, or notifications requiring acknowledgement.  Using email, workers must track, organize and manage handshakes manually.  For workers who handle hundreds of messages per day, these routine tasks consume large amounts of time and contribute to information overload.  This project will test the feasibility of using a cloud-based communication tool to automate the tracking, organization and management of handshakes.  By modeling the structure of worker interactions as they unfold, the technology can determine how and by whom work is being performed, guide worker attention to where it is needed, and reduce information overload.  Handshakes can be reused, further improving productivity.  The research will include development and pilot testing of a prototype system.  During the pilot test, data will be collected to measure the usability of the technology, as well as the effects of the technology on worker communication patterns and productivity.  The results will establish the feasibility and effectiveness of a handshake-based approach to structuring information worker communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to advance the state of scientific and technical knowledge about computer-assisted information work, thereby increasing information worker productivity and economic growth.  The technology area, tools for facilitating collective intelligence, currently comprises three paradigms: messaging, business process management, and project management.  These paradigms model information work using messages, processes, and tasks, respectively.  The proposed innovation introduces a new paradigm that models information work using structured handshakes.  This paradigm defines a new unit of analysis for scientific study of information work and enables the automation of routine handshake management tasks.  The target market sector for the technology is high-end information workers such as corporate lawyers, management consultants, and financial advisors.  Based on the revenue generated by leading information worker communication tools in this technology area, the commercial potential of the technology exceeds one billion dollars per year.  Many high-end information workers have more business opportunities than they have time to pursue, so increasing information worker productivity will lead directly to improved business performance and faster economic growth.  Increasing the marginal product of high-end information workers will also lead to higher demand for such workers, and thereby to creation of high-value jobs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This SBIR Phase I project established the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a cloud-based social media platform for initiating and managing interactions between workers.  The research was performed by a team of three full-time software engineers, including the PI, during the period from January 1, 2012 through June 30, 2012.  With respect to technical feasibility, the Principal Investigator and his team developed and deployed a functioning proof-of-concept system with communication and search capabilities, demonstrated integration with major email platforms, configured the system for on-premises deployment on a corporate intranet and refined the user interface to improve usability.  With respect to commercial viability, the PI and his team segmented the target market and developed a commercialization strategy, acquired a prominent lead customer in target market segment, identified target customer requirements and incorporated these requirements into the company's development road map, and worked jointly with lead customer personnel to plan deployment and pilot testing of the proof-of-concept system.     Feedback from prospective lead customers who have evaluated the software indicated that the innovation may substantially improve the tracking, triage and transparency of interaction worker communication relative to existing technologies.  By increasing interaction worker productivity, the reasearch may contribute to the growth and competitiveness of the US economy and create high-value jobs.  Also, by creating a framework for instrumenting interaction work, the research will facilitate collection of detailed data that may contribute to advances in the fields of organization theory, organizational behavior, and operations research.
