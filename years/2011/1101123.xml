<AbstractNarration>The area of computability has blossomed in recent years.  Some of the most interesting problems call for combining computability with sophisticated algebra, model theory, descriptive set theory, and/or probability.  There is a large group in Novosibirsk working on these problems.  There are smaller groups doing related work elsewhere in Russia, in Kazakhstan, and at several universities in the U.S.  The grant will be used to help build and maintain working relationships among these researchers.  The first goal is to to solve problems.  The grant will help us to produce better results, to work more quickly, and to be aware of more important connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two earlier NSF grants have, for the past ten years, served to facilitate joint work by researchers from the U.S., Russia, and Kazakhstan.  At the time the first proposal was submitted, collaboration among researchers in logic in the U.S. and the former Soviet Union was just beginning, with occasional visits by senior researchers.  The first grant had an enormous impact and greatly magnified the ties among researchers in the three countries.  The  second grant led to much greater involvement of young researchers.   &lt;br/&gt;The current grant will be used to continue building a network of collaborators who are committed to sharing ideas and working together on fundamental problems.  We will continue the emphasis on involving young researchers.  We want our graduate students and postdocs to see themselves as part of an international research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was the third in a series of grants intended to facilitate collaboration among researchers in computability from the U.S., Russia, and Kazakhstan.  A supplement to the grant added Bulgaria to the list.  As before, funds from the grant were used to support research visits.  The NSF money was stretched by the addition of funds from other sources---a Packard Grant, a grant from the Kazakh government, money from the Federal University of Kazan and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, etc.As planned, a number of researchers traveled from East to West or from West to East with support from the grant.  The visits provided a chance to exchange information, to compare different approaches to problems, and to begin joint research.  Participants, working together, solved a large number of problems on a variety of topics in computability---effective algebra, definability in the enumeration degrees, internal complexity of computable structures, complexity of isomorphisms, etc.  Some papers on the joint work have already been published.  Other papers are still in progress.  A significant number of young people, graduate students and postdocs, participated in the activities supported by the grant.  The PI is convinced, from observing her own students, that the experience of collaborating with researchers from half-way around the world gives young people greater confidence in their own abilities and increases the likelihood that they will stay active in research.  Among the faculty participants, some are based at major research centers (UW Madison, UC Berkeley, CUNY, Novosibirsk, Kazan).  Others are based at smaller, primarily undergraduate institutions (University of Portland, Western Illinois, Wellesley College).  The named participants all benefitted from the discussions of problems that took place when the proposal was being prepared.  During the period of the grant, a significant number of participants had some travel support.  Others served as hosts, and worked with those who traveled.  Still others were later drawn into projects that began during someone's visit.  Thus, the grant had a positive effect on the research of a sizable group.
