<AbstractNarration>Cummings proposes a program of research in combinatorial set theory.&lt;br/&gt;Infinite graphs, trees and orderings are the main objects of research in this program. The proposed research uses a wide range of techniques including forcing, PCF theory and inner model theory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The immediate goal of Cummings' research program is to get a better understanding of certain  infinite mathematical structures. Problems about these structures arise in many areas of mathematics including algebra, analysis, topology and (perhaps surprisingly)  the study of finite structures.   The long term goal is to forge new tools for the construction and analysis  of infinite structures, which should  then  find broader application.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       The focus of this project was the study of infinite sets and structures,     using tools from a number of mathematical areas including:   Mathematical logic (an area where mathematical reasoning is formalised and analysed).   The theory of games, particularly games of infinite length. Optimisation (the study of techniques for maximising some quantity subject to constraints).      Among the structures of interest were graphs, trees, colourings and      groups (sets of symmetries).  Facts about infinite structures can be used   to learn more about finite structures, notably by constructing infinite   "limit structures" from sequences of finite structures: this was also a theme  of the project.        The project produced new results on a number of topics including  Very large infinite sets ("large cardinals").  Such sets play a crucial role in the modern study of infinite structures. Infinite graphs, particularly "universal graphs" (graphs which contain copies of all other graphs of the same size). Colourings of the edges of a finite graph.   Large structures which are very different from all their smaller substructures ("incompact structures")      The project involved wide international collaboration with researchers     from countries including the UK, Israel, Austria, Germany and Iran.     The project afforded training opportunities for junior researchers, in     particular the PI advised three graduate students and mentored a     postdoctoral associate working in the general area of the project.  The PI    also gave two series of expository talks at international workshops, both    aimed at junior researchers.
