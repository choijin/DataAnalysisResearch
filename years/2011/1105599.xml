<AbstractNarration>The proposed research concerns the development of harmonic map theory in the setting when the domain and/or the target spaces are singular spaces.  The motivation of such an extension of harmonic maps is for their application in superrigidity, geometric group theory, minimal surface theory and character varieties.  The PI proposes to explore the interplay between analysis and group theory via harmonic maps.  From the analysis point of view, it is a central problem to determine under what conditions harmonic maps are regular and, if not, to determine the structure of the singular sets.  From a group theory point of view, harmonic map theory is an important tool in studying rigidity questions.  Among the specific problem that will be investigated using harmonic maps are: rigidity properties of NPC (non-positively curved) spaces, quadratic differentials and Teichmuller theory of complexes and the theory of singular minimal surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notion of energy has its origins in the mathematical description of the physical world.  Roughly speaking, the energy of a map between two spaces measures the total stretch of the map, and harmonic maps are the critical points of the energy functional.  Thus, the understanding of harmonic maps is of great interest to both mathematicians and physicists.  Harmonic maps are important because they are analytical objects that can be used to represent geometric, topological and algebraic objects associated to a space.   They have numerous actual and potential applications in many fields of mathematics or well as in other sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, the PI studied geometric spaces that have  singularities.  Most of the existing literature in geometry deal with  non-singular, thus smooth, geometric objects such as a plane, a sphere, a  saddle surface and their generalizations.   On the other hand, most  objects in nature are non-smooth with singularities of varying degrees  of complexity.  In this project, the PI studied certain singular geometric spaces by analyzing maps into and between them that are optimal in the  sense that they minimize energy.   A natural notion of energy for a map between geometric spaces is defined  by measuring the total stretch of the map at each point of the domain  and then integrating. Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy  functional. They can be seen as both a generalization of harmonic  functions in complex analysis and a higher dimensional analogue of  parameterized geodesics in Riemannian geometry.  Next to totally geodesic  maps, harmonic maps are perhaps the most natural way to map a given  geometric space into another. The PI extends harmonic map theory for singular geometry and applies it to  solve problems in other fields.   Intellectual Merit:  The results of this project are of interest in mathematics and physics and will lead to a greater understanding of the natural world.  By developing a theory of harmonic maps in the singular context, the PI and her collaborators developed tools to solve problems that arise in a broad range of fields of mathematics such as rigidity problems in geometric group theory and understanding of the degeneration of hyperbolic structures. The PI has published her results in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated information through giving talks at seminars and conferences both nationally and internationally.   Broader Impact:  Through the involvement in this project, the PI encourages the development of the next generation of STEM professionals.  She teaches undergraduate and graduate courses related to the project.  She advises graduate students and supervises their research work.  She mentors postdoctoral students and collaborates on research projects.          Last Modified: 09/28/2015       Submitted by: Chikako Mese]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
