<AbstractNarration>IIP 1161022 &lt;br/&gt;University of Florida &lt;br/&gt;George &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP - 1161014 &lt;br/&gt;The George Washington University &lt;br/&gt;El-Ghazawi &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests a five year renewal (phase II) of NSF funding for the University of Florida (UF) and the University of George Washington (GWU) sites for the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHREC is currently comprised of the University of Florida (UF) as the lead institution, the George Washington University, Brigham Young University (BYU), and Virginia Tech as research partners. These institutions were brought together to establish the CHREC I/UCRC to investigate, develop, and evaluate new concepts, methods, infrastructure, and tools in reconfigurable high-performance computing (HPC) and high-performance embedded computing (HPEC), from building-block devices to hardware and software infrastructure to applications and tools, and advance these technologies through research and education for the benefit of Center members, students, and the discipline at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHREC is ideally situated to explore key research challenges of specific interest and paramount importance to its membership. The proposed university sites possess the expertise, experience, base of high-quality students, cutting-edge facilities, and administrative commitment to support this endeavor, as well as a strong record of success. Areas of research thrust for the next phase of CHREC include: design automation and programming methods; algorithms and applications; device and core building blocks; and systems and services. CHREC will continue and expand its role as the first university/industry research center in this fast-growing and increasingly important field of computer engineering. Research results will lead to new concepts, technologies, insights, and tools in reconfigurable computing for HPC and HPEC, experience rapid technology transfer via the I/UCRC structure, and thereby enrich and expand the nation's lead in these vital industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHREC will continue to have a direct impact upon the success of this field as a whole by helping support a national R&amp;D plan and serving as a catalyst that brings leading organizations together to define common goals, methods, and standards. The PIs will continue to integrate the research results into the university educational process with expanded programs at multiple levels in engineering, and state-of-the-art facilities will be leveraged. Activities will be structured to attract a diverse set of students and faculty, including underrepresented students via several minority recruitment programs. Broad dissemination of results will occur through scholarly journal and conference publications, the center web site, and press releases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  CHREC began operations in January 2007,  and since then, has established itself as among the fastest growing and  most successful Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers  (I/UCRCs) sponsored by the NSF.    Intellectual Merit: A range  of problems aimed at improving the productivity of High-Performance  Heterogeneous Computers, with emphasis on Reconfigurable Computing, has  been investigated.  Heterogeneous and reconfigurable computing were  demonstrated to provide orders of magnitude in speed as compared with  conventional computers, in many critical applications.  Examples are  security/cryptography, remote sensing, and bioinformatics.   Heterogeneous and reconfigurable high-performance computers are,  however, difficult to use.  This is why our work under the CHREC center  has focused on productivity, where we have emphasized performance, power  and programmability at the same time.    Some of this work includes  virtualization of FPGA and GPU systems published in ACM Transactions on  Reconfigurable Tech. &amp; Systems, (El-Araby et al., Jan 2009) and  presented in the International Conference on Parallel Processing (Li et  al., ICPP 2011); Efficient scheduling of tasks with multiple  architectural variants, published in IEEE Transactions on Computers  (Huang et al., Sept 2012) and ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable  Technology and Systems (Huang et al., Nov 2010); Efficient scheduling of  tasks for GPU accelerated systems (Li et al., Computer, Nov 2013);  Evaluating high-level design methodologies for high-performance  reconfigurable systems (El-Araby et al., IEEE Trans.
