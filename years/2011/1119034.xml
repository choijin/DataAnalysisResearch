<AbstractNarration>Developers and researchers at Ohio State University and KCP Technologies are creating, testing, refining, and studying a computer-based, individualized, interactive learning system for intermediate/middle school students that can be used by them independently (online or offline) or by teachers in classrooms. This learning system is called Individualized Dynamic Geometry Instruction (iDGi) and will contain four instructional modules in geometry and measurement that reflect the recommendations of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  iDGi courseware fully integrates research-based Learning Progressions (LPs) for guiding students' reasoning; formative-assessment linked to LPs; instructional sequencing that interactively adapts to students' locations in LPs; built-in student monitoring, feedback, and guidance; and research-based principles of educational media into the modules.  The software platform for iDGi development is an extended version of the dynamic geometry computer environment, The Geometer's Sketchpad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development process follows recommendations in Douglas Clements' Curriculum Research Framework and includes sequences of development, trials with students, data collection, and revision.  The research and evaluation are based on random assignment of approximately 350 students to treatment and control groups.  Achievement data are collected using developer-constructed instruments with items that reflect the mathematics topics in the CCSS.  Researchers explore the variability at the student, teacher, and school levels using the appropriate level of hierarchical linear models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial publishers have expressed strong interest in publishing online and offline computer versions of iDGi, an iPad version of iDGi, an online management system for iDGi, and support materials for users and teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What Did the Project Do?  This Research and Development Project created, tested, refined, and studied an online, individualized, interactive Dynamic Geometry (DG) computerized learning system that can be used by students independently or by teachers in classrooms. The Individualized Dynamic Geometry Instruction (iDGi) learning system fully integrates the use of the powerful DG instructional environment, formative-assessment, and research-based Learning Progressions (LPs). The software platform for iDGi development consists of three parts: (1) The Geometer?s Sketchpad (GSP) which is used to create DG lessons; (2) a GSP extension, WebSketchpad, developed by KCP Technologies/McGraw Hill in a subcontract, enabling conversion of GSP lessons to web applications; and (3) an online iDGi html data generation, gathering, inspection, and management system created by the iDGi project.  iDGi focuses on 2D geometry and measurement for grades 3-8 as described in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and the NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics.  Although iDGi can be used by students independently, teachers can use the Teacher Menu to inspect up-to-the-minute progress of their students' movement through iDGi lessons, and they can inspect particular students' progress through lesson pages.  These tools enable teachers to monitor and guide student work in way that connects it to students' positions in learning progressions, which can help teachers design classroom discussions that help students consolidate and deepen their individual iDGi work.  What Is Dynamic Geometry?  Example 1.  To investigate and learn the properties of parallelograms, students use the iDGi Parallelogram Maker which makes any parallelogram that fits on the computer screen, no matter its shape, size, or orientation. Dragging the Parallelogram Maker's vertices changes its angles and side lengths&mdash;and thus its visual appearance&mdash;but the transformed shape is always a parallelogram.  To help students conduct precise analyses of shape properties, the iDGi Parallelogram Maker can also display angle measures and side lengths that are instantaneously updated as it is manipulated, along with parallelism and symmetry tests.  Example 2.  To help students learn the properties of rotations, iDGi lessons have students predict the image of a rotation, given its turn center and amount of rotation, then check their predictions by clicking a button that shows the rotation's dynamic motion.  Intellectual Merit  The iDGi project has several unique features.  It integrates principles from mathematics education, cognitive science, and instructional media to produce an inquiry- and problem-based curriculum recommended in mathematics education with the careful student guidance preferred in cognitive and instructional science. It uses research-based learning progressions for formative assessment, student feedback, lesson-to-lesson instructional sequencing, and within-lesson instructional branching. It integrates reasoning-detecting, within-lesson LP-based assessments with computer-based adaptive instruction.  The iDGi project has generated a great deal of research that helps the field of mathematics education better understand the relationship between mathematical and spatial reasoning, a critical factor for all of STEM education.  The project investigated this relationship in the contexts of reasoning about (a) angle-, length-, and area-measurement; (b) geometric transformations; and (c) formal property-based reasoning about geometric shapes.    Broader Impacts  Even though there is a substantial amount of research indicating that students? mathematics learning is improved when teachers understand and use in their teaching research-based learning progressions, there are substantial, long-standing, and perhaps insurmountable, impediments to having a majority of teachers implement these practices.  One impediment is the need for extensive teacher training.  Another impediment is an education institutional structure that demands that students be taught mathematics specified for their grade level, NOT what they can actually make sense of as specified in research-based learning progressions.  To overcome these impediments, the iDGi project has produced an online individualized learning environment in which students access geometric concepts and reasoning according to their positions in research-based learning progressions. In essence, iDGi gives students access to the high quality master teaching that results from learning-progression- and formative-assessment- guided instruction. Making this type of high quality instruction available to ALL students, no matter who their teacher is or where they are located, improves the instruction available to all students and makes mathematics instruction more equitable.  Findings   The project's large-scale field tests indicate that iDGi can be extremely effective in promoting and supporting the development of students' geometric reasoning and conceptualization.  But to reveal portions of this student development, students' reasoning had to be examined much more carefully than is usual in educational measurement.  Assessment must examine not just if students learn predetermined subject matter, it must also detect and examine what students learn.  The iDGi project also found additional evidence indicating how difficult it is for students at all grade levels (including high school) to truly and deeply make sense of formal properties of geometric shapes, especially in the intermediate grades.  Finally, the project found that use of iDGi can be effective even if only minimal amounts of inservice are provided to teachers.
