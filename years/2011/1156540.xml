<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at Indiana University.   The site will support ten participants for ten weeks to carry out experimental and theoretical research projects in a broad range of areas in the IU Physics Department and the IU Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter (CEEM). Research topics in a wide range of projects will be available, including experimental and theoretical research in accelerator physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, elementary particle physics, materials physics, medical physics, and nuclear physics.  Special programs for the students include orientation sessions, weekly seminars on current research in physics, discussions on professional development and scientific ethics, and progress presentations. At the conclusion of the program, the students will present their results in talks at a closing symposium and develop a way to share their results to a technical audience. They will also be encouraged and supported to present their work at professional meetings in the following academic year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal goal of the IU Physics Summer REU program is to provide the students with meaningful, challenging, and exciting experiences in the research-intensive environments of the Indiana University Bloomington Department of Physics and Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter. We strive to match each student with the type of research (theory/experiment/computational) and choice of subfield that they have expressed interest in pursuing.     During the summers of 2012-2014 the program supported a total of 32 students for ten weeks each, including 14 female participants; two are members of other groups underrepresented in physics.  Thirty of the students attend or attended another institution, and overall a majority of supported participants were from colleges or smaller universities that lack the depth of research opportunities and facilities at IU.  Eight other local students and one visiting student, each with other support, also participated fully in our activities, including one female and two members of other underrepresented groups.  Participants worked on individual research projects under the supervision of faculty members and postdoctoral researchers.  A total of 20 faculty members and 5 postdoctoral researchers served as mentors for the participants.   In addition, the students attended a seminar/discussion series, which presented overviews of a number of physics research areas and initiated discussions on topics such as career paths in physics, preparing for graduate school, issues of integrity in scientific research, and scientific communication. Each summer, participants had the option of visiting research facilties at Fermilab and were given scientist-led tours of a number of experimental sites.   By the end of the program, students prepared a tangible method to share their work in an appropriate form (research paper, research poster, conference presentation, technical report). During the final week of the program each student also presented a talk on their work at a local symposium.   Students were encouraged and supported to attend national and regional research conferences where they could present their work to a wider audience.
