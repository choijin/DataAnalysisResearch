<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to better understand how magma is produced inside the Earth beneath the volcanoes in the Cascade mountains of Washington, Oregon, and northern California.  Volcanism in this region is caused by the process of subduction, in which oceanic crust offshore of the Pacific northwest sinks back into the Earth?s mantle along the continental margin.  Subduction is also responsible for the very large earthquakes that can occur in this region.  As the sinking plate heats up, it releases H2O and other ?volatile? elements (Cl, S, F, C), which in turn cause the overlying mantle rocks to melt, producing magma that feeds the Cascade volcanoes.  While the process of subduction occurs in many regions around the world (e.g., the Andes), a distinctive feature of the Cascades system is that the subducted oceanic crust is geologically young when it starts to subduct.  This causes the crust to be hotter and should result in release of H2O and other volatiles when the subducted crust is still quite shallow, before it lies beneath the volcanoes.  The main challenge, then, is to understand what role H2O and other volatiles play in creating magma beneath the Cascade volcanoes, and if volatiles are important, how they move from the subducted oceanic crust back into the mantle to produce magma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test some fundamental ideas about volatile recycling and magma generation in ?warm-slab? subduction zones such as the Cascades arc. The project will involve new measurements of H2O, other volatiles, fluid mobile elements, and stable and radiogenic isotope tracers in primitive Cascade magmas. Many of the measurements will be done on melt inclusions, which are small blobs of silicate melt trapped inside of growing phenocrysts at depth.  Such inclusions are not affected by low pressure degassing as magma moves towards the Earth?s surface, and thus provide a record of the pre-eruptive dissolved volatile contents in magma.  The data obtained in this project will provide new information on mantle and slab temperatures, magma production processes, and the sources of volatiles beneath the Cascades arc. This project involves collaborations with other scientists in the U.S., Canada, and Japan for some of the specialized chemical analyses that will be done.  Another collaborative effort will involve geodynamic modeling of mantle wedge flow patterns beneath the Cascades so the new geochemical data can be integrated with geophysical results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Subduction zones are places where oceanic crust gets recycled back into the deep parts of the Earth.  They are typically associated with a deep sea trench and a chain of volcanoes that lie on a separate tectonic plate that is positioned above the sinking oceanic plate.  The Cascade volcanic chain in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States is an example of a subduction zone.  The goal of this project was to better understand how magma is produced above the sinking plate, after which the magma rises to feed volcanoes at the EarthÆs surface.  To accomplish this, we used samples of volcanic material erupted from small volcanoes in different parts of the Cascade chain in northern California and southern Washington.   A key focus of our study was to investigate the role of water in causing rocks deep inside the earth to melt. We used geochemical analysis of volcanic material to determine how much dissolved water was present in the magmas that erupted from Cascade volcanoes.  Although our study focused on how magma forms inside the Earth, the results also help us understand why magmas in subduction zone volcanoes are water rich, which has the effect of making these volcanoes erupt explosively, creating a hazard to human communities.  There were several interrelated projects that were supported by this grant.  The work on the projects was done by three graduate students at the University of Oregon. The primary project was focused in the Cascades of northern California, in the region around Lassen volcano.  We combined geochemical data with computer models to show that the subducted oceanic plate melts beneath the volcanic chain.  Those water-rich melts then rise into the overlying mantle, where they react with the mantle rock to produce more melt of basaltic composition.  Our results also show that the amount of water recycled from the subducted plate varies such that the volcanoes that are closer to the subducted plate receive a higher flux than those farther away from the plate.  A second project was focused in the southern Washington Cascades near Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams.  The goal of this project was to determine if different regions of the Cascade volcanic chain receive different fluxes of water from the subducted oceanic crust, and how any differences might affect magma formation processes. We found that the magmas in the southern Washington region contain lower water concentrations than those farther south in northern California.  From our results, we can infer that a different melting process is required to make magma beneath the southern Washington region. This melting process likely involves upwelling (vertical rise) of solid mantle rock that lies beneath the continental crust, but above the subducting oceanic plate.  The goal of the third project was to develop a method for using geochemical analysis of volcanic material to determine how much carbon dioxide is dissolved in basaltic magmas when they form in the mantle beneath the Cascade volcanoes.  Carbon dioxide is recycled from the subducted plate along with water and other chemical elements, so these measurements help us to better understand how carbon dioxide is stored in the deep Earth and how it is released to the atmosphere by volcanic activity.  Our data show that carbon dioxide concentrations dissolved in the basaltic magmas are much lower than the concentration of water, and our results give us a much improved basis for estimating the amount of carbon dioxide that is released from subduction zone volcanism.
