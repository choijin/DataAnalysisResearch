<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: For many large DNA viruses, the production of new viruses requires use of a protein molecular motor, powered by chemical energy from ATP, to force the replicated viral DNA into the preformed empty viral shell, which is also made of protein. The viral DNA is replicated as a continuous long chain that must be cut into complete, unit-length pieces to provide each new viral particle with a complete DNA genome. The protein motor that packages the DNA also cuts the DNA chain to the correct length.  For the herpes viruses and many bacterial viruses, the DNA is cut at specific sites to generate viral DNA having correct ends.  Packaging begins with a precise initial cut, which generates the DNA end that is threaded into the shell by the motor.  Once a complete viral DNA has been packaged, the motor nuclease again precisely cuts the DNA to terminate the DNA packaging cycle.  This project aims to determine the mechanism by which the terminal DNA cut is precisely made. The model virus to be used in these studies is called "lambda," and it infects the bacterium E. coli. It was chosen because it is one of the most favorable systems for investigating this mechanism.  Lambda has a special recognition site, adjacent to the proper cut site, to stop the packaging motor, so that the terminating cut is precisely made.  The efficiency of termination increases with the length of the packaged DNA.  As the shell fills, the resistance to packaging more DNA increases, the velocity of packaging slows, and more energy is required for the motor to continue packaging.  Models to explain how termination efficiency is controlled by the extent of packaging emphasize (1) the extent of shell filling, (2) the packaging energy required, or (3) that packaging velocity regulates termination. In this project, each of these factors will be studied to determine which controls the termination process.  These studies will be facilitated by the use of "optical tweezers," a powerful, biophysical technique in which single DNA molecules and individual virus shells are attached to plastic microspheres and manipulated with focused laser beams.  Packaging of a single DNA molecule can be measured by detecting the movement of the microspheres and the forces acting on them. The rate of DNA movement, the energy required for packaging, and the extent of packaging will be manipulated through genetic, biochemical, and biophysical perturbations.  The roles of a putative shell-stabilizing protein and of various regions of the motor proteins will also be explored using genetic and biochemical methods. The project will increase understanding of how viruses move, cut and package DNA.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Viral DNA packaging motors not only play an important role in the assembly of many viruses, but very likely also share structural features and mechanisms with many other cellular, DNA-processing enzymes, including helicases, bacterial chromosome segregation motors, and endonucleases. A strong interdisciplinary educational environment, integrating concepts and methods from the biological and physical sciences, will be ensured for participating graduate and undergraduate students. The project is led by two experienced researchers with complementary research backgrounds in biophysics and molecular biology, and strong records of research mentoring of undergraduates and students from diverse backgrounds. New undergraduate biophysics course materials will also be developed in the course of the project. Educational materials for K-12 science education will be developed in collaboration with the R.H. Fleet Science Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Genetic Mechanisms cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During assembly, many viruses utilize a protein complex called "terminase" that pulls DNA through a nano-channel into the viral shell. This "molecular motor" translocates the DNA until a sufficient length corresponding to the virus? genome length has been packaged and then stops translocating and cuts the DNA to release a filled virus particle. The mechanism by which terminases sense that a sufficient amount of DNA has been packaged to trigger termination was unknown and constitutes a fundamental question in biology/biophysics.  By studying how bacterial DNA viruses such as lambda, the E.coli virus, recognize and process their DNA during assembly of the virus particles, we gained basic information about virus recognition. By comparing several related viruses, we also learned about the basis for specificity, i.e., how viruses avoid packaging non-self DNAs.  Information about recognition enabled construction of a "full-length" viral DNA molecule in which the sites where initiation or termination could possibly occur could be controlled, enabling experiments to investigate the mechanism of termination.     It had proposed that termination could be triggered either by a "velocity monitor" which senses the slowing of the motor as the virus fills, or an "energy monitor" which senses the amount of force resisting packaging, or a "packaging density monitor" which directly senses the amount or "pressure" of the packaged DNA. Our research developed new methods to study this process, at the single-molecule level. Though experiments in which the motor velocity is slowed or loaded by applied force, provided evidence against the "velocity" and "energy" models, thus supporting "packaging density" models. In addition, our research uncovered new information about the mechanism by which the velocity of the viral DNA packaging motor is regulated and the role of DNA sequences in directing the initiation and termination of the process.     More broadly, our findings expand our knowledge of fundamental principles in biophysics/biochemistry concerning mechanisms of regulation of enzyme and motor protein activities. Our finding that density of the packaged DNA affects both velocity of the packaging motor and triggering of the termination/DNA cleavage activity constitutes demonstration of a novel type of protein mediated regulation. Analogous effects may occur in other motor/enzyme complexes involved in processing and packaging DNA and other biopolymers in other contexts, such as in the nuclei and cytoplasm of cells. During the course of this work we also developed improved methods with broader applications in biology/biophysics for measuring viral DNA packaging, for accurately measuring ultra-small displacements and forces with optical tweezers, and for manipulating single DNA molecules and virus particles.                 Finally, this project had significant educational value for the many students who participated, including graduate, undergraduate, and high school students having a broad range of backgrounds, including members of underrepresented groups.  The training these students received in molecular genetics, molecular biology/biochemistry, and biophysics is relevant to future employment in fundamental science research and/or applied research in biotechnology and biomedical fields.
