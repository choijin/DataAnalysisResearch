<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on three main objectives: (1) to recruit high school students to pursue one of the following S-STEM fields at University of Texas Pan American - a B.S. in Chemistry, a B.S. in Physics, or a B.S. in Physical Science; (2) to promote STEM careers among high school students; and (3) to provide quality training, development, education, and student support services to S-STEM scholars to enable them to persist in their STEM field and finish their degree in a timely manner. Particularly noteworthy is that the project will provide an S-STEM Mentor Training Program that will be aligned with the mentor certification program of the College Reading and Learning Association. This program takes place in South Texas which has a high underrepresented Hispanic population.</AbstractNarration>
