<AbstractNarration>This project is expanding an existing partnership between Baton Rouge Community College Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Division (BRCC-STEM) and Louisiana State University College of Engineering (LSU-CoE) to increase STEM students' completion of two year Associates of Science (AS) and Applied Science (AAS) Degrees at BRCC and four year Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees at LSU (emphasizing Engineering/Construction Management - E/CM). One project outcome is to increase the number of BRCC AS/AAS E/CM graduates to 25 annually who have strong academic foundations for further E/CM study at LSU.  For LSU, the goal is to improve the overall 2nd-3rd year retention and ultimately the cumulative 6th year graduation rate in engineering by 2-3% annually to the current university average for all entering freshmen (59%). Grounded in the "sense of community" lessons learned from an earlier STEP project, the results of small group discussions with BRCC students and research-based educational practices, these goals are being met through the following actions:  1) designing and implementing a pre-engineering learning community at BRCC; 2) integrating supplemental instruction/academic support such as Peer Lead Team Learning (PLTL) in core STEM/Engineering courses at both institutions; 3) expanding faculty development opportunities and supporting faculty-student interaction/collaboration across institutions that improves student learning; 4) providing the environment and training necessary to develop mentoring relationships among students (particularly transfer students), faculty and practicing professional/industry partners; and 5) implementing  mechanisms for effective monitoring and continuous improvement. This project is serving as a model for STEM Student Success.</AbstractNarration>
