<AbstractNarration>This study focuses on how the water chemistry of tropical streams is influenced by surface and groundwater inputs and how these inputs are, in turn, affected by climatic variations such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation.  This is a continuation of a long-term study that has compiled the only continuous long-term (&gt;20 yrs) record of stream chemistry in Central America. Following long dry periods associated with El Nino events, poorly-buffered lowland streams exhibit 100-fold increases in acidity for up to eight months. These prolonged acidification events appear to be an amplification of normal seasonal (i.e. dry season/wet season) trends.  This project investigates the mechanisms causing these events and how this acidification affects the ecology of the streams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lowland streams in Central America support diverse aquatic communities and transport large amounts of carbon from highly productive terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere and ocean. The climate in Central America is predicted to have decreased dry-season rainfall.  This climatic shift will likely have major deleterious effects on the chemistry of neo-tropical streams.  To better understand these research findings in a more global context, the long-term data set from this project in Central America is being linked to other data sets throughout the tropics (e.g., Amazon, Congo, Mekong and Ganges Rivers). In addition, the results of this project will be disseminated in the Water for Life/Agua para la Vida program, which includes outreach activities in local communities and an internationally accessible web page equipped with teaching tools on river conservation and water quality/quantity issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Findings from this LTREB Project are an important contribution to our understanding of how climate change affects Neotropical ecosystems. The project has resulted in the only long-term (1988-present) data set that we are aware of on stream solute chemistry and related ecosystem processes for lowland primary rainforests in the mainland Neotropics.  Emergent patterns in our long-term data have proven critical to understanding how tropical streams  ecosystems respond to hydroclimatic variability.   Our study site is La Selva Biological Station, located in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. The majority of streams draining the 1600 ha protected area are solute-poor and vulnerable to natural seasonal declines in stream pH following the dry season. This episodic acidification is exacerbated (pH as low as 4 for months) by extreme dry periods such as large El Ni&ntilde;o events.  However, some streams draining La Selva receive solute-rich (e.g., HCO3, Si, P) inputs of regional ground-water of geothermal origin and they are consequently relatively well-buffered against pH declines. By combining long-term weekly measurements and wavelet analysis of high frequency data (every 15 min), we have found that precipitation drives pH declines at time scales ranging from days to weeks, to months and seasons.  Our long term data from Costa Rican rainforest streams, combined with long-term data from other terrestrial studies, indicates that decreased precipitation during the dry season can decrease C-sequestration and increase stream acidity.   While there has been recent interest in geothermal ecosystems as sentinel systems for climate change and potential biotic refugia in arctic ecosystems, our study is the only one to our knowledge that is using geothermal systems to study the impacts of changing climate on tropical streams. Analyses of our long-term data indicate that geothermal groundwater inputs into streams stabilize export of biologically important solutes (e.g., P) across years with differing precipitation. We also found that sediments play an important role in determining the timing and quantity of P-export from streams. After termination of an eight year phosphorus addition to a headwater stream, we found that ~25% of the added P was still present in the sediments, and it took four years for that P to be released.  Several lines of evidence indicate that CO2 from soil respiration is responsible for stream acidification but that acidity from iron oxidation can also become an important driver of pH following dry conditions.  Stream and groundwater pCO2 and pH co-vary in time, with high pCO2 during the wet season.  Estimates of whole-stream metabolism suggest that most of the pCO2 in the stream comes from soil respiration (rather than in-stream C-processing), accounting for the majority of stream acidity. We also determined that iron oxidation in dry soils is capable of driving pH declines of soil leachate, suggesting that iron oxidation at the landscape scale could contribute to decreasing stream pH via shallow groundwater.  Analyses of long term data indicate that hydrological variables (discharge, days since last storm) were major factors structuring macroinvertebrate assemblages over a 15 year period.  However, a study during the last mega El Ni&ntilde;o event showed that macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass declined during seasonal pH drops and increased macroinvertebrate drift was observed in response to experimental acidification of a solute-poor stream.  Our LTREB Project shows tight coupling of rainfall, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems. Hydrologic connectivity plays an important role in determining the consequences of the interplay between climate, surface- and ground-water on stream food webs. We found that the presence of solute-rich geothermal groundwater positively influences shrimp abundance by enhancing food quality and by buffering against pH declines.  Stream biota might be resistant to some degree of episodic acidification, as both diatom and macro-invertebrate assemblages are composed of acid-tolerant taxa.  However, several climate models predict decreases in dry season rainfall for the Neotropics which may lead to an increased magnitude of seasonal acidification. Thus, an important question arising from our work is: How long will benthic communities be able to withstand changes in hydrologic regimes, warmer temperatures, and possibly more frequent ENSO (either El Ni&ntilde;o or La Ni&ntilde;a) events which are predicted by recent climate models.
