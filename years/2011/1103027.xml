<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate in detail the relationship between the chemistry, solid-state microstructure, and macroscopic charge transport properties of solution-processable conjugated polymers.  Aligned assemblies of conjugated nanofibers will be created and their performance measured both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the molecular backbone.  The microstructure will be examined in using optical and electron microscopy, with a particular focus on defect structures observed by low dose electron diffraction and high resolution electron microscopy.  Electrical properties will be measured over a range of frequencies using impedance spectroscopy.  The primary materials of interest will be functionalized poly(propylene dioxythiophenes) (Poly(ProDOT+)) using monomers designed and synthesized in the PI's laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will provide fundamental information about the structure and properties of conjugated polymers; plastics that can conduct electricity.  These materials are of interest for a variety of devices including biomedical electrodes, chemical sensors, transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaics.  These devices are providing improvements in health care, national security, and reducing our energy requirements.  The project will provide direct support for graduate students in science and engineering, and will make it possible to continue current outreach activities with undergraduate students.  The PI's research group will also continue established interactions with industrial and international collaborators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the fundamental structure and properties of oriented conjugated polymers using high resolution microscopy and diffraction techniques.  The materials of interest to us are electrically conducting organic materials that are being used in a variety of devices including bionic interfaces, organic electronics, and photovoltaics (solar cells).  The specific polymers we have focused attention on are called poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(3,4-propylene dioxythiophene) (PProDOT).  Our project examined the orientation and properties of these long macromolecules when processed into extremely tiny filaments (nanofibers).  We designed and investigated the properties of several existing materials, and also investigated some entirely new materials created using novel synthetic chemistries.    One example of a new polymer that was developed in this project is the doubly-substituted ProDOT-diene derivative shown in the Scheme 1.  The polymer is formed by electrochemical oxidation of the monomer.  The two double bonds in the middle of the molecule have make it possible for us to dramatically change the physical properties of the resulting PProDOT polymers using thiol-ene "click" chemistry.  Our results were published in several peer-reviewed manuscripts and presentations at scientific meetings of the Materials Research Society, American Chemical Society, and American Physical Society.  The research provided the primary financial support for two Ph.D. graduate students in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Delaware.  Several undergraduate students also assisted in the project.         Last Modified: 07/13/2015       Submitted by: David C Martin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
