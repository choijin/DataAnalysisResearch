<AbstractNarration>This project is a three-day public summit on fostering partnerships and linkages between disciplines, sectors, agencies and nations in sustainability science and innovation. The summit will feature invited presentations and discussions to showcase U.S. federal investments and institutional structures regarding sustainability, identify opportunities to help promote practices that would lead communities toward sustainability, and address communication issues needed to recognize science and innovation as central to the understanding and adoption of sustainable practices. An ad hoc organizing committee will develop the agenda, and select and invite speakers and discussants. Nominees to the organizing committee as well as the ~200 conference participants will include those with expertise in sustainability from a variety of perspectives, including federal, state and local government, the private sector, academia, nongovernmental organizations, and international bodies. The format will include multi-partner panels, plenary and breakout sessions addressing a variety of sustainability concepts, including, but not limited to, examples of successful partnerships, communication and outreach of sustainability science, sustainability metrics, infrastructure and data needs, and international sustainability efforts. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The summit will be held in spring 2012 and a brief summary of the event will be issued. This summary will be developed in accordance with institutional guidelines and will be subject to appropriate review procedures prior to release. The summary will be disseminated widely to interested audiences within local, state and federal governments, industry, universities and nongovernmental organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Achieving the goal of sustainability, meeting human needs while conserving ecosystems, their components, and functions, requires a continuous process of scientific innovation, new integrative knowledge, and collaborative approaches to implementing technologies and policies.  It is imperative that the science community collectively assess the state of sustainability, prioritize research needs, understand the needs of decision-makers and users of the science, and build partnerships in an effort to effectively meet current and future sustainability challenges.  To date, there has been no commonly accepted operational framework for how to move forward in addressing sustainability challenges.  May 2012 Symposium  To address this need, an expert committee under the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and MedicineÆs Science and Technology for Sustainability Program organized a three-day public symposium on May 16-18, 2012 at the request of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to better define the issues and forge new collaborations.  The symposium, titled Partnerships, Science, and Innovation for Sustainability Solutions, featured invited presentations and discussions to showcase federal investments and institutional structures regarding sustainability; identify opportunities to help promote practices that would lead communities toward sustainability; and better communicate the central role of science and innovation in understanding and adopting sustainable practices.  The symposium included panels, plenary and breakout sessions addressing a variety of sustainability concepts and discussing examples of successful partnerships, communication and outreach efforts, sustainability metrics, infrastructure and data needs, and international sustainability initiatives.  Participants included representatives from federal, state, and local governments, the private sector, academia, nongovernmental organizations, and international bodies involved in sustainability issues.  Videos and PowerPoint presentations from the symposium are available at: http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/sustainability/SustainabilitySymposium/PGA_069360.  A brief, individually-authored symposium summary, Partnerships, Science, and Innovation for Sustainability Solution, was released in November 2012 and available at: http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/sustainability/SustainabilitySymposium.  Dissemination Activities  The summary of the May 2012 symposium has been widely disseminated to interested audiences within local, state and federal governments, industry, universities and nongovernmental organizations. As a follow up to the symposium, the STS program organized two workshop events focused on issues related to sustainable agriculture and urban sustainability.  April 2013 Event  During the May 2012 symposium, several speakers commented that the agency should consider funding agriculture as an important component of its science portfolio. Ensuring sustainable agricultural growth will be critical to addressing the global challenge of food security. As a follow up to the May 2012 symposium, the STS program convened a small selected group of experts in the agricultural filed to hold focused discussions on how the NSF, in particular, its Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) Program, can develop an agricultural research portfolio. The one day event was held on April 29, 2013 in Washington, DC. Specific topics included identifying:  The most critical scientific priorities in the area of agricultural research for the SEES portfolio; How key actors in federal agencies, academia, and private sector can develop effective partnerships to support sustainable and resilient food systems research; and How public and private sector funds can be leveraged to further the field of agricultural systems research to address key challenges for sustainable and resilient food systems.
