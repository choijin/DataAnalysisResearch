<AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Interdisciplinary Research-Based Education", at the University of Delaware, under the direction of Dr. Erik T. Thostenson, will encompass 1) curriculum development, 2) undergraduate research and 3) involvement in extra-curricular programs. In all of these areas there will be an emphasis on the need for interdisciplinary collaboration for the development of nanoscale materials and their devices. Research experiences for undergraduates in the laboratory are invaluable at teaching future engineers the manufacturing approaches for developing functional nanostructures as well as giving students hands-on experience in new characterization and modeling techniques required for nanoscale engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the program include enhancing the infrastructure for research and education through the collaboration of diverse research groups and co-advisement of students, and shared facilities and instrumentation. A particular effort will be aimed at recruiting exceptionally talented students from under-represented groups through the College of Engineering's Resources to Insure Successful Engineers (RISE) and Women in Engineering (WIE) programs. The involvement of engineering student groups advised by the PIs in project-based activities will emphasize working in interdisciplinary teams and building scientific leadership skills. Research results will be disseminated broadly to the physics, materials science, and mechanical engineering research communities because of the interdisciplinary nature of the projects. The project team will incorporate the results of this NUE in their ongoing outreach programs as well as the College of Engineering Outreach programs. Finally, a focal point for active exchange and interaction is the Center for Composite Materials (CCM). Numerous research activities at CCM involve the development of nanostructured materials and devices. There is participation of faculty and students from nine academic departments throughout the university as well as almost 70 companies in the Center's Industry Consortium Program. This close university/industry interaction facilitates rapid technology transfer between basic science and technological applications.</AbstractNarration>
