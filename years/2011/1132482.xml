<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year continuing award for a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site Program at Polytechnic University of New York, entitled, RET Site: Science and Mechatronics Aided Research for Teachers with an Entrepreneurship expeRience (SMARTER) Program, under the direction of Dr. Vikram Kapila. This is a renewal of a successful 3 year RET Site program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SMARTER program will provide a professional development opportunity to a total of 36 middle and high school in-service teachers (12 per year for three years) in the areas of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and entrepreneurship from the New York City Public Schools.  During each year of the project, under the guidance of Dr. Kapila and six senior personnel, 12 teachers will receive mentoring and conduct inquiry-based, hands-on, engineering research in the exciting field of mechatronics through six-week long summer workshops.  Collaborative activities involving Technology Management faculty and the Centers for Entrepreneurship and Technology will enable teachers to learn about entrepreneurship, conduct innovation case-studies, and shadow entrepreneurs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will benefit the teachers by reinforcing their science and math skills; enriching their STEM experience through exposure to real-world engineering research; developing and honing their research skills; cultivating and sustaining creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship traits; and providing opportunities to network with tech-entrepreneurs.  Moreover, the teachers' schools will benefit since the participants will be able to provide their students with a solid foundation for college-level study in STEM; integrate hands-on activities with content and performance standards in curriculum; and mentor students to participate in an Inno/Vention student idea competition.  A business-philanthropy partnership will allow teachers' students to gain real-world entrepreneurial experience through summer internships at start-up technology businesses.  The project will serve as a catalyst to induce a cultural change that will transform students from being mere consumers of technology to becoming creators of novel technological products.</AbstractNarration>

Each year, 6-week summer workshops were conducted in a collaborative environment consisting of 14 graduate researchers and 6 faculty. The project introduced teachers to sensors, microcontrollers, mechatronics, and robotics through training, mentoring, and engineering research. Teachers acquired experiences, skills, and resources in hands-on, engineering research and entrepreneurship, including prototype product development. Each year, following the summer workshop experiences, teachers utilized their new learning and skills to integrate real-world, authentic technologies in their school activities. They mentored students to participate in a mechatronics/robotics-based student idea competition at NYU. Finally, project personnel integrated their research, teaching, curriculum and lab development, and outreach activities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On a 35-item survey assessing teachers&rsquo; familiarity with mechatronics, their self-perception average improved from 1.6/4 (pre) to 2.69/4 (post). On a 7-item survey assessing teachers&rsquo; familiarity with entrepreneurship, their self-perception average improved from 1.75/4 (pre) to 2.93/4 (post). On pre/post-project technical quizzes, teachers&rsquo; average was: 51.3% (pre) and 62.2% (post); yielding 21.3% improvement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The teachers made significant contributions to research on mobile apps for robotics, electric motor energy consumption measurement, environmental monitoring, fish locomotion, etc. The teachers designed mechatronics-enabled laboratory experiments, e.g., Arduino-based conductivity probe, modeling homeostasis using a microcontroller, exploring equivalent fractions using a robotic clock, etc. Project&rsquo;s sustained impact is evidenced through the efforts of Midwood HS teachers who collaborated with us to create a pre-engineering mechatronics curriculum, which has been certified by the NY State Education Department. In 2016, the PI was recognized for these collaborations by the award of a <strong>Certificate of Excellence</strong> by the NYC Career and Technical Education Programs and Schools.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>Broader Impact:</em></strong> A significant proportion of project teachers are from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines (among 36 teachers were 11 underrepresented minorities and 15 women). Each year (2014&mdash;2016) in May, students of project teachers from prior summer competed in NYU&rsquo;s Inno/Vention contest. Each year, the contest attracted over 50 attendees, who presented 10 to 12 innovations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project teachers have conducted field trips for their students to NYU labs, raised funds to integrate mechatronics activities in labs and science clubs, disseminated their experience, developed new curriculum, etc. Several illustrative examples follow. (1) Ms.<strong> Chu</strong> led 18 middle school girls in a Girls Who Code Club and Parallax Inc. donated to her school two robot kits and a kit of sensors. (2) Ms. <strong>Fittipaldi</strong> worked with her senior math class of 27 female students on robotics and introducing them the field of engineering. She received a grant from the Young Women&rsquo;s Leadership Network to purchase nine robotics kits using which she engaged her students in building their own robots while learning engineering and design concepts. (3) Mr. <strong>Frank</strong> started the first IS 93 computer coding club, which uses sites such as code.org and codeacademy.org. He worked on an entrepreneurship program where students learned and practiced a 9-minute pitch using &ldquo;How to Create an Elevator&rdquo; pitch by Michael Hyatt and Shark tank. (4) Mr. <strong>Irimina</strong> created and led a one-day workshop for over two dozen teachers of The New York Performance Standards Consortium Schools on &ldquo;How to engage and attract more students to STEM fields.&rdquo; (5) Mr. <strong>Jadav</strong> received a grant through which he introduced the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms to his computer science class in which students undertook open-ended DIY projects. (6) In summer 2014, Mr. <strong>Walcott</strong>&rsquo;s mentees presented three papers at the International Fuel Cell Conference in Boston, MA. (7) Mr. <strong>Zitolo</strong> created an eight-week curriculum, offered to 30 seniors (11 females, 19 males), on physical computing. As a Master Teacher Fellow, he led 8 workshops to introduce 40 NYC teachers to Arduinos.

For example, in partnership with the NYC Department of Education, the PI, his colleagues, and engineering students conducted 2015 and 2016 Summer STEM Education Partnership project. Over five dozen engineering students learned, modified, and refined lessons for middle and high school teachers and students in robotics and smart cities tracks. The engineering students conducted a three-day workshop for 45 teachers and paired with teachers to provide hands-on learning to over 600 students through five-week long summer programs. The PI and his colleagues developed and launched a &ldquo;M.S. in Mechatronics and Robotics&rdquo; program to modernize curricula, make it relevant to students&rsquo; interests, and address workforce demands for engineers having practical experience. Under an NSF supplement award, the PI hosted a workshop titled &ldquo;Mechatronics Education Innovation,&rdquo; attended by over 60 participants from 22 US states, Canada, UK, and Denmark.
