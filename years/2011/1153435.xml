<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to improve physical understanding of microstructure on the overall macroscopic behavior of heterogeneous layers by computational analysis using the multiscale cohesive model. The multiscale cohesive model proposed in this work is capable of coupling physical processes at the micro-scale to the macroscopic response in order to derive a homogenized cohesive law with a point-wise attached heterogeneous micro-continuum. The model can account in a natural way for coupling of normal and shear effects. The gradients pertinent close to the crack tip will be resolved by a second order/nonlocal scheme. The thermodynamically consistent reduced order model that retains essential information, while remaining computationally attractive, will have a high practical value. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project will yield an integrated scientific tool for analysis of heterogeneous layers, such as multi-functional adhesives, dental adhesives, bone adhesives, geological interfaces, subjected to complex loading conditions by integrating multiscale techniques with computational materials science. On the educational side this project will provide a unique setting for multidisciplinary education of one graduate student as it involves computational solid mechanics, computational science and multiscale modeling. The PI will participate in engineering education partnership between the University of Notre Dame and the Riley High School, South Bend, IN. Broadly, the goals of this partnership are: i) to enhance core skills in modeling and data analysis; ii) to introduce students to leading edge research ideas by demonstrating its relevance to both their academic courses and everyday lives; and iii) to mentor inner-city students for college preparation.</AbstractNarration>
