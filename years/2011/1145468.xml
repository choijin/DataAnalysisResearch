<AbstractNarration>Project description: Positive assortative mating occurs when individuals select mates who are more similar to themselves than expected by chance. A recent analysis of more than 1,000 case studies found that positive assortative mating is the rule rather than the exception within human and non-human animals. Positive assortative mating maintains genetic variation in populations, biases genetic mapping studies (e.g., to find disease-causing genes), and may drive the origin of new species. In light of the important genetic effects of assortative mating, it is surprising that little is known about its behavioral and evolutionary causes. The investigator will conduct experiments to test competing hypotheses as to why positive mating evolves. Specifically this study will (1) evaluate the frequency and strength of assortative mating within 20 populations of an important model organism (the threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus), (2) identify the mate-choice behaviors that generate assortment, and (3) test whether assortment is favored by direct versus indirect selection, and/or disfavored by costs or barriers to signal transmission. Notably, this work provides the first field-based empirical test of the long-standing theory that disruptive natural selection favors positive assortative mating. This hypothesis, if true, would change our view about how new species arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance: The project will improve our understanding of the causes and incidence of assortative mating. By focusing attention on this form of non-random mating, the work will increase awareness of the high frequency of assortment and therefore the need to account for non-random mating in genetic and association mapping studies in both evolutionary biology and medicine. In addition, the project will pair scientists with high-school biology teachers and pre-service teachers-in-training. This will give K-12 science teachers practical experience in biological research, and foster communication between scientists and current and future teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The age-old phrase 'opposites attract' is rather misleading when it comes to mate choice. In animals, including people, individuals tend to choose mates who are more like themselves. Humans for instance tend to pair up with mates more like themselves in height, education, income, religion, and ethnicity. Animals may provide a window into this phenomenon of 'assortative mating'. Why would this non-random mating evolve? How does the ecological context facilitate or inhibit such choosiness? What are the genetic consequences of assortative mating? Our research has established that assortative mating is common in animal population sin nature. One might say that 'similars attract'. However, biologists still know little about the environmental conditions that facilitate this assortative mating. We surveyed numerous populations of stickleback to measure non-random mate choice in nature, and found a weak trend towards positive assortative mating (pairing with similar mates), but ultimately observed no strong environmental predictor of this variation, lending no support to existing mathematical theories to explain the evolution of assortment. Studying assortative mating is complicated, unfortunately, by the simultaneous effect of multiple other forms of sexual selection. Males tend to aggressively compete with similarly-colored rivals, for instance, while at the same time trying to adjust their color to match their local light environment. Meanwhile, femalesprefer males in certain microhabitats (shallow water) over others (deeper water). Thus, mate choice is the outcome of multifarious simultaneous forces in natural populations, a fact which is often overlooked in studies of mate choice behavior that often focus on single variables at a time. This matters, however, because the assortative mating that we record has substantial effects on population genomic structure within populations, that can confound genetic mapping and genetic association studies. In human medical genetics, for instance, the tendency to mate with like individuals inflates the chance of spurious statistical correlations between disease states and genetic markers. Therefore, understanding the evolutionary origins and genetic consequences of assortative mating may be essential to recognizing subtle genetic structure within our own species, and its implications for medical genetics.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/19/2016<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;I&nbsp;Bolnick</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1145468/1145468_10197877_1476907997837_IMG_4405--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1145468/1145468_10197877_1476907997837_IMG_4405--rgov-800width.jpg" title="A nesting male stickleback"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1145468/1145468_10197877_1476907997837_IMG_4405--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A nesting male stickleback"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A nesting male stickleback changes his colors to contrast against the local light environment, but this makes him more vulnerable to attacks from rivals.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Thor Veen</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;I&nbsp;Bolnick</div> <div class="imageTitle">A nesting male stickleback</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1145468/1145468_10197877_1476907624180_20140701GoslingChad--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1145468/1145468_10197877_1476907624180_20140701GoslingChad--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field work in British Columbia"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1145468/1145468_10197877_1476907624180_20140701GoslingChad--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Field work in British Columbia"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An aerial view of cages in Gosling Lake, BC, with different-colored light filters.
