<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project builds from previous research on how computer-aided feedback to students improves how the students learn drawing-related concepts in engineering statics.  By researching how to integrate rapid feedback between instructor and student, this project will enable computer-assisted drawing tools to be utilized in introductory engineering statics courses to improve student learning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to overcome barriers for integrating effective software tools into critical, large enrollment engineering courses early in the curriculum.  The collaborative project engages two universities with different educational missions to ensure that the results are widely applicable.  The needs of students typically under-represented in engineering are addressed in the proposed research project.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by enhancing research infrastructure and data access to broaden research capabilities.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Sketch Recognition Lab at Texas A&amp;M University, College Station is developing online software to increase the quality and speed of learning engineering. LeTourneau University in Longview, Texas tested this software in engineering classrooms over a four-year period. LeTourneau University faculty provide guidance to the development team by evaluated the softwareÃ†s effectiveness at enhancing the quality and speed of student learning.     This new online software "Mechanix" (http://sketchmechanix.com) enhances engineering learning by providing intelligent and immediate feedback on a special type of diagram sketched by engineers and students. These diagrams are known as a truss free-body-diagram. Despite the importance of such hand-sketched diagrams for engineering learning and practice, large class sizes common in engineering education today often prevent careful human feedback on such diagrams.     The engineering students testing the online homework system experienced state-of-the-art sketch recognition algorithms, and were fully informed of the research plan and purpose. Students critically evaluated this new educational software tool in comparison with traditional methods. Therefore a secondary impact of this study was exposing students to the innovation and excitement possible in the profession of engineering teaching, potentially inspiring some to pursue the field themselves.     If properly expanded, the Mechanix online engineering learning software has the potential to make wide-sweeping impacts on certain courses in virtually all engineering degrees. The need for fast and accurate feedback on hand-sketched free-body-diagrams is a severe and prevalent issue in engineering education.  The software currently handles closed trusses, and this progress is vital to future expansion into other types of free-body-diagrams.     LeTourneau researchers, in collaboration with Texas A&amp;M and Georgia Tech, published this study at the June 2015 American Society for Engineering Education national conference.
