<AbstractNarration>Visual search skills for hazard perception are critical in many domains. They are used by pilots to maintain situation awareness, by doctors reviewing screen images to diagnose health disorders, and by security screeners inspecting for hazardous materials. They are also critical to a novice driver's ability to detect roadway hazards. For novice drivers, poor visual search skills can increase the risk for traffic fatalities, which are the leading cause of death for teenagers nationwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtual reality can be used to provide visual search training during driver education. However, the success of these training programs depends on the validity of eye-scanning patterns in the virtual environment and on the simulation parameters employed to elicit those patterns.  The overall objective of the research is to assess the validity of search patterns in the virtual world as they apply to the physical realm, and then to identify which simulation parameters are critical for successful simulator-based hazard perception training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The project will integrate theory and data to advance our knowledge of which parameters of virtual reality-based hazard perception training promote the greatest transfer of training to real world driving.  Specifically, the project will (a) examine the relationship between visual search in driving simulators vs. that in the real world, using specially equipped vehicles; (b) test which aspects of the driving simulator lead to the best training and transfer of learning; and (c) examine how age and experience influence hazard perception skills.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The findings from the project will advance scientific understanding of how virtual reality training simulations can be used to improve driver education, thereby leading to better drivers and fewer traffic accidents.  The results will also be applicable to other areas in which virtual reality training can be valuable, such as medical diagnosis and security screening. In addition, the project will enable a number of disadvantaged students to take part in engineering and technology research and includes a high school outreach component to engage students in research at an early age.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Teen drivers are the most vulnerable group of drivers and traffic accidents are the leading cause of teen deaths.   In this research we explored the difference between teens and adults in a number of potentially hazardous situations to determine if a year of driving experience suffices, or if more time is needed.  For this we compared novice teens, those with one year of driving experience, and adults.  To take the step towards developing specific hazard exposure simulator based training for teens, it is necessary to know whether eye glance and vehicle behavior between simulator and reality is identical and what simulator characteristics are important to facilitate such a match between virtual and actual reality.  To address these questions, the same participants drove in an instrumented vehicle and in a moving base driving simulator in four geo-specifically matched potential hazard scenarios.  The key findings from this project were:  (1.) Novice teens show impoverished hazard mitigation mental models as evidenced by their eye glance and vehicle control behavior, and (2.) Teens with one additional year of driving experience are already beginning to gravitate towards the developed mental models evident in adults.  If this process can be accelerated through carefully tailored driving simulator training programs, then many young lives will be saved.  These findings were most reliable in the driving simulator.  The recommendation for simulator parameters is therefore: i.) use a wide field of view especially when intersections are part of the study (if intersections are part of the study, then a motion base is also a must to prevent excessive percentages of simulator sickness), ii.) use a high resolution and also highly detailed textures so as to better match the saliency of the real world, and iii.) contrast (at least in the range we used) has little effect but care needs to be taken not to lower it too much, as elderly drivers with degraded contrast sensitivity will perceive the world as if it has a lower resolution.   The current study has the potential to greatly improve the safety of our teenagers by applying the insights, techniques, and tools developed in this project to develop teen driver training techniques that accelerate the process of developing effective hazard perception skills in traffic, thereby removing one of the leading causes of death in teens.
