<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Marya Lieberman from University of Notre Dame and colleagues Paul Bohn, Patricia Maurice, Peter Burns and Franklin Tao will acquire an X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS). The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) semiconductor and polymer surface chemistry of "smart" materials, (b) studies of self-assembled monolayers, biomolecule/surface adhesion, (c) DNA damage and repair, (d) catalyst design and characterization as well as libraries of materials, (e) reaction mechanisms of catalysts, (f) surface chemistry of actinide minerals, and (g) soil and mineral surface chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-ray photoelectron spectrometers are used for chemical analysis. The XPS technique quantitatively measures elemental composition, empirical formula, chemical state and electronic state of the elements in a given material. A sample is irradiated with a beam of monochromatic X-rays and the kinetic energies of the resulting photoelectrons are measured and related to specific elements. XPS often plays a crucial role in defining the system under study. The technique requires the use of ultra high vacuum conditions. The work to be carried out by these investigators represents a wide array of systems requiring surface characterization. The instrumentation will be used in research activities and also for research training and education of a large number of students from diverse backgrounds and will serve for outreach activities to neighboring institutions such as Saint Mary's College, Indiana University South Bend and Indiana University Northwest.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ MRI: Acquisition of an X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS)  Project Outcomes Report, award ID 1126374  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, or XPS, is a method for analyzing the elemental composition of the few atoms at the surface of a material.  Those surface atoms are responsible for how the material interacts with the outside environment--they govern the reactivity of catalysts, the adsorption of small molecules and proteins to surfaces, the performance of electrodes in sensors or batteries, and the passivation or degradation of minerals.  The University of Notre Dame used funding from the National Science Foundation to purchase an imaging XPS system to replace a 29 year old x-ray spectrometer.   The new instrument is an imaging XPS, which means that it can "see" changes in atomic composition on parts of a surface that are just 10 microns apart; the old instrument could only report average surface composition.  We also have a custom-built chamber where researchers can activate catalysts at high pressure and temperature, and then move them into the vacuum environment of the XPS measuring chamber to characterize the surface composition.  This lets us study catalysts in their actual active states, rather than in states that have been passivated by reactions with oxygen in the air.  Notre Dame is one of the few XPS facilities in the country that allow analysis of radioactive materials.  We developed protocols for preparing samples and testing them to be sure the radioactive materials were firmly attached to the sample holder, and then checking the instrument to ensure that no contaminants would cause problems for other users or repair personnel.  This unique capacity  allows Notre Dame researchers to see which types of radioactive minerals are most stable under different environmental conditions, which helps us understand how to more safely store radioactive wastes and how radioactive contamination spreads in the environment.   Our new instrument is much easier to maintain and repair;  we have had over 1550 hours of operation with less than 75 hours down for repairs.  The instrument is so easy to use that we now offer summer workshops for faculty from local 4-year colleges where they learn to operate the XPS, and we train undergraduates to operate the XPS for undergraduate research projects.
