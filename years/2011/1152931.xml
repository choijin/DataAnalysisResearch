<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Christy Haynes of the University of Minnesota. Prof. Haynes and her students will study the interaction of beneficial bacteria with engineered nanoparticles and assess the role that simulated natural water has on nanoparticle characteristics and bacterial impact. Initial efforts will focus on characterizing nanoparticle behavior in simulated natural water by studying nanoparticle dispersity and stability in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) while also working to understand transformations the NOM experiences after nanoparticle introduction. Furthering mechanistic understanding of bacteria-nanoparticle interactions, the next stage of the study will address how nanoparticle presence influences S. oneidensis function, namely biofilm formation and flavin secretion. These functions have numerous constructive impacts on the ecosystem, and disruption by nanoparticles would be significant. The study addresses the critical gap in ecological toxicity knowledge surrounding the interaction of commonly used engineered nanoparticles and the beneficial bacteria, S. oneidensis. The nanoparticles chosen for investigation, TiO2 and Ag, are likely candidates for unintentional release into the aquatic ecosystem because of their common use in consumer products. Within the food web, the interaction of engineered nanoparticles with beneficial bacteria is important based on the constructive function of bacteria itself as well as their interaction with other organisms. It is critical, therefore, to consider how ecologically important organisms are impacted by these nanomaterials. S. oneidensis is an ideal model beneficial bacteria because they are widely distributed, geographically and throughout the aquatic ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a part of the project, Prof. Haynes and her students will develop a high school laboratory activity titled, "Nanoparticle Toxicity in Brine Shrimp" where students will get a hands-on experience examining the effects of noble metal nanoparticles on an aquatic invertebrate. They will learn concepts from chemistry, microbiology, and statistics, while exploring this cutting edge topic. The research project will provide excellent educational opportunities for students, including some from underrepresented groups, desiring to work at the forefront of environmental science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Evaluating Beneficial Bacteria Function Following Engineered Nanoparticle Exposure  CHE-1152931  Haynes, Christy L.     There are two major focus areas within this project outcomes report &ndash; the first focused on engineered titania (TiO2) nanoparticles and the second focused on engineered silver (Ag) nanoparticles. In both cases, the work focuses on nanoparticle transformation and impacts on beneficial bacteria.  1. Impact of TiO2 Nanoparticles on Shewanella oneidensis  As TiO2 nanoparticles have been extensively used in various applications, including anti-microbial materials and UV-protection agents in cosmetics, the unintentional release of TiO2 nanoparticles into environment and its impact on the ecological system needs to be assessed. This study investigated the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on an ecologically beneficial bacterium, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. As TiO2 nanoparticles are known photocatalysts, the effect of synergistic UVA illumination was also explored. We monitored the growth profile, intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, riboflavin secretion, and gene expression level change of S. oneidensis MR-1 with TiO2 nanoparticle and/or UVA illumination (Scheme 1). We found that TiO2 nanoparticles caused a small inhibition of bacterial growth only at a high dosage, and UVA illumination did not have an additive effect on the inhibition (Figure 1). Reactive oxygen species level in cells and riboflavin secretion were not affected upon TiO2 nanoparticles exposure. Gene expression study was applied to further probe the effect of TiO2 nanoparticle exposure and UVA illumination on cellular functions. The gene expression results showed minimal change in gene expression levels upon UVA illumination and no change upon TiO2 nanoparticle exposure (Figure 2), correlating with cell growth and cell function assessments.

These measurements demonstrate a comprehensive scheme combining various analytical tools to enable a mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle-cell interactions and to evaluate the potential adverse effects of nanoparticles beyond viability/growth considerations.  2. Transformation of Ag Nanoparticles in the Natural Organic Matter and their Synergistic Impact on Shewanella oneidensis  This research studied the behavior of silver nanoparticles in simulated natural aquatic environments by characterizing their interaction with humic and fulvic acids (also referred to as natural organic matter, NOM). We found that the colloidal stability of silver nanoparticles in high ionic strength solutions increased following nanoparticle exposure to NOM (see Figure 3); this result suggests that NOM may, in some cases, enhance silver nanoparticle transport in aquatic environments by reducing homoaggregation rates. We also saw that the toxicity of silver nanoparticles to a population of bacterial cells was closely related to the extent of nanoparticle dissolution (i.e., release of ionic silver); we monitored the latter in real-time using silver ion-selective electrodes, allowing us to characterize the dissolution kinetics with higher time-resolution than is possible using ICP-OES or ICP-MS, the standard techniques for this measurement (see Figures 4a, b). Silver nanoparticle toxicity decreased following exposure to NOM rich in sulfur and nitrogen (Figure 4c). Nanoparticle exposure to NOM poorer in sulfur and nitrogen had limited impact on dissolution and toxicity, despite the observation that colloidal stability was significantly increased. These results suggest that exposure to NOM cannot be assumed to mitigate the toxicity of silver nanoparticles in natural aquatic environments, and that the extent of NOM interaction with silver nanoparticles will depend strongly on the concentration of sites with hi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
