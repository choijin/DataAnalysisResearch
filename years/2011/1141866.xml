<AbstractNarration>Conway/1141866&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to conduct a suite of experiments to study spatial and temporal variations of basal conditions beneath Beardmore Glacier, an East Antarctic outlet glacier that discharges into the Ross Sea Embayment.  The intellectual merit of the project is that it should help verify whether or not global warming will play a much larger role in the future mass balance of ice sheets than previously considered.  Recent observations of rapid changes in discharge of fast-flowing outlet glaciers and ice streams suggest that dynamical responses to warming could affect that ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Assessment of possible consequences of these responses is hampered by the lack of information about the basal boundary conditions. The leading hypothesis is that variations in basal conditions exert strong control on the discharge of outlet glaciers.  Airborne and surface-based radar measurements of Beardmore Glacier will be made to map the ice thickness and geometry of the sub-glacial trough and active and passive seismic experiments, together with ground-based radar and GPS measurements will be made to map spatial and temporal variations of conditions at the ice-bed interface. The observational data will be used to constrain dynamic models of glacier flow. The models will be used to address the primary controls on the dynamics of Antarctic outlet glaciers, the conditions at the bed, their spatial and temporal variation, and how such variability might affect the sliding and flow of these glaciers. The work will also explore whether or not these outlet glaciers could draw down the interior of East Antarctica, and if so, how fast. The study will take three years including two field seasons to complete and results from the work will be disseminated through public and professional meetings and journal publications. All data and metadata will be made available through the NSIDC web portal. The broader impacts of the work are that it will help elucidate the fundamental physics of outlet glacier dynamics which is needed to improve predictions of the response of ice sheets to changing environmental conditions. The project will also provide support for early career investigators and will provide training and support for one graduate and two undergraduate students. All collaborators are currently involved in scientific outreach and graduate student education and they are committed to fostering diversity.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our overarching goal is to assess the potential contribution of East Antarctica to sea-level rise. &nbsp;Large inland basins beneath the East Antarctica Ice Sheet that are below sea level are connected to outlet glaciers (<strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) that have potential to drain inland ice when the ice shelves surrounding Antarctica disintegrate. This is important because the Antarctic ice sheet has potential to contribute tens of meters of sea-level rise. This would have major societal impacts, especially since much smaller changes in sea level are already impacting low-lying areas in Florida, Southeast Asia, and islands in the tropical Pacific.</p> <p>In this project, the primary focus was Beardmore Glacier, one of ten large outlet glaciers that drain East Antarctic ice through the Transantarctic Mountains into the southern Ross Sea Embayment (<strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>). Today the glacier drains a catchment of ~90,000 km<sup>2</sup>. At the grounding line (the location where inland ice that is grounded on bedrock starts to float), it is 25km wide, mean surface velocities are 360 m/year, and the modern flux of ice is 7 Gt/year. Glacial geologic data from Mt Kyffin (<em><strong>Figure 2</strong></em>) indicate that ice in the vicinity of the modern grounding line 17,000 years ago during the last ice age was ~950 m thicker than present.</p> <p>To achieve the primary goal of the project our field team of five people spent two field seasons (austral summers of 2012-13 and 2013-14) on Beardmore Glacier conducting airborne and ground-based radar surveys, GPS and passive seismic surveys, and active seismic experiments (<strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>).</p> <p>Airborne and ground-based radar measurements across and along Beardmore Glacier show (i) bed elevation at the grounding line is about 1100m below present-day sea level, (ii) bed elevation 70km up glacier from the grounding line (near Cloudmaker) is more than 2200m below sea level, (iii) bed elevation in the upper reaches of the glacier (~230km up from the grounding line) rises above sea level (<em><strong>Figure 4</strong></em>). Furthermore, our new bed topography differs significantly from the earlier Antarctic Bedmap2 compilation, which iss data limited (<strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>). Importantly, the inland sloping bed raises the possibility that the lower 70km of the glacier is susceptible to runaway collapse either if the glacier at the grounding line thins slightly, and/or if buttressing of the lower glacier was removed through disintegration of the Ross Ice Shelf. However, the high bed threshold (above sea level) in the upper reaches of the glacier limits the amount of East Antarctic ice that can be drawn down through this outlet.</p> <p>Our ground-based radar profiles across the Beardmore grounding zone reveal a melt-water channel incised into the bottom of the floating ice shelf. The channel originates from beneath the glacier above the grounding line and enlarges rapidly downstream, likely because of convection-driven melting as the fresh melt-water entrains relatively warm ocean water as it rises along the bottom of the ice shelf. Beneath the glacier, the channel is 200m wide and incised 60m into the base of the glacier; 8.2km down-glacier from the grounding line, the melt-water channel is 750m wide and incised 260m into the bottom of the shelf (<strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong>). Our direct evidence for the existence of liquid water beneath Beardmore glacier is surprising; it implies a relatively high geothermal flux (~75 mW/m<sup>2</sup>), and it enables basal sliding, fast flow and rapid evacuation of inland ice.</p> <p>Seismic emissions in the grounding zone are high, with up to 40 events/hour recorded using a network of passive seismometers. Our GPS and seismic data show tidal modulation of both flow speed and seismicity; seismic events are split evenly between falling and rising tide. Beamforming analyses reveal that most events originate from distinct two locations. Events at both locations occur during falling tides, but most of the rising-tide events occur at one location. The timing and location of events is likely a result of changes in strain rates as ice flows across the grounding line around Mt. Hope with extensional flow on the outside and compressional flow on the inside. Seismic events that occur on falling tides arise from both the increase in horizontal velocity along the ice shelf and also vertical stretching as ice shelf elevation decreases. Flow speeds indicate similar horizontal velocity increases in a specific region of the glacier during rising tide. Our results show how coupled geodetic and seismic observations in grounding zones provide important insight into mechanical interactions and processes when outlet glaciers discharge into ice shelves.</p> <p>The project provided research experience, training and support for four graduate students from the University of Washington and one from Central Washington University.
