<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop the next generation of atom chips for producing and manipulating ultracold atomic gases (temperatures &lt; 1 ÂµK).  While atom chips developed in Phase I provided only magnetic control, these new hybrid atom chips will be able to manipulate ultracold matter both magnetically and optically.  These chips will be incorporated into atom-chip vacuum cells, allowing optical techniques to be implemented in compact ultracold matter products.  In Phase I, we developed silicon/glass wafers for both creating ultrahigh vacuum electrical feedthroughs with near perfect yield as well as in-trap imaging of ultracold matter.  In Phase II, we will further develop this technology by incorporating miniature on-chip optical elements as a vehicle for bringing optical potentials (e.g. produced by laser beams) into the vacuum system.  Our research plan includes redesigning existing chip layouts to accommodate small-sized optics that will be anodically bonded to silicon regions of the chip.  To further enhance functionality, we will pursue both anti-reflection coating of atom chips and redesigns of the connectorization scheme used to bring electrical currents to the chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to greatly expand the number and variety of experimental techniques that can be implemented with atom-chip vacuum cells.  Of key interest here are optical techniques, such as optical lattices, used to trap and coherently control quantum mechanical systems (e.g. Bose-Einstein condensates).  An important application of ultracold lattice-trapped atoms is interferometry, which can be used to realize gyroscopes, accelerometers, and gravimeters that are expected to be orders of magnitude more sensitive than current state-of-the-art technologies.  Such devices are crucial for navigational positioning systems and satellite communications, and therefore are of great interest to both commercial and defense-oriented markets.  Optical trapping is also vital for the next generation of neutral atomic clocks, whose accuracy is now exceeding a phenomenal 1 part in 10^17 (i.e. a loss of 1 second every 3 billion years).  Optically trapped atoms are also ideal for implementing quantum information algorithms, and therefore have many applications in the emerging fields of quantum computation and information processing.  For basic science, optical lattices have been used for precision measurements of fundamental constants, some of the most stringent tests of the Standard Model of Physics, and groundbreaking studies of many-body physics.</AbstractNarration>

Under this Phase II SBIR program ColdQuanta has developed hybrid optical/magnetic atom chips for implementing additional optical techniques to manipulate and control ultracold matter. Specifically, we focused our efforts on expanding our atom chip technologies to include integrated on-chip optics as a vehicle for introducing optical potentials into the vacuum system.  In Phase IIB of the program we extended the work under Phase II to develop integrated optical coupling to the chip assembly.  We have developed and iterated through several atom chip designs that incorporate on-chip optical elements to produce optical lattice potentials.

The included figure shows a hybrid atom chip assembly, which we view as the most significant outcome of this work.  Through this program we have refined many of our existing processes and established several new competences.  We have stabilized our atom chip fabrication process; and have established on-chip optic fabrication, alignment and bonding requirements and processes.  We have developed processes for and have demonstrated on-chip optical coatings.   We have produced integrated ultra-high vacuum systems with hybrid atom chip assemblies, and we have used those systems to demonstrate performance of the chip systems with samples of ultracold atoms.  Additionally, under this program we have worked to develop supporting infrastructure for standard and hybrid atom chip assemblies, including ultra-low noise atom chip current sources, chip connectors, and integrated out-of-vacuum optics packages.  ColdQuanta has already received multiple product orders and has won several development contracts that include this technology.  Since the start of this SBIR program ColdQuanta has substantially increased its sales &amp; marketing activities, exhibiting at multiple conferences, domestic and international; sends quarterly newsletters to a growing mailing list of potential customers; and has established international exposure through distributors in China, UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Singapore.
