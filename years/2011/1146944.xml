<AbstractNarration>During development and regeneration of the nervous system, neurons send out processes guided by the neuronal growth cone, a highly motile sensing structure and an excellent model system to study the dynamic interactions between cell surface, signaling, and cytoskeletal proteins such as actin. Although significant progress has been made in identifying the molecules involved in directional growth cone migration, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Particularly, the relationship between mechanical and biochemical signaling in neuronal growth and guidance remains a mystery. To fill this knowledge gap, this project will investigate how Src tyrosine kinase, a key signaling enzyme, regulates actin organization and dynamics as well as adhesion-mediated growth and force production of live neurons. Specifically, this project will determine which aspects of actin dynamics are regulated by Src as well as the relationship between force production and Src signaling in adhesion-mediated growth. To reach this goal, quantitative fluorescent imaging of cytoskeletal dynamics and Src activation will be combined with biophysical approaches involving micropipettes and the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will significantly improve the understanding of how cells integrate sensing, signaling, and cytoskeletal dynamics during directional migration. The project involves training of High School, undergraduate, and graduate students in cutting-edge live cell imaging and biophysical techniques. The results will not only be disseminated to the scientific community, but also to the broad public through a web site called "CELLebration" displaying movies, images, and educational material about cell motility, through presentations at local schools, and public outreach events at Purdue University (Spring Fest and NanoDays). In summary, through high-quality digital imaging presentations, this work will increase the public awareness for the need for quantitative microscopy and biophysical approaches to solve key cell biological problems.</AbstractNarration>

These processes are guided by a highly motile structure named the neuronal growth cone. Over the last three decades, significant progress has been made in identifying specific guidance, receptor as well as signaling molecules involved in axonal growth and guidance; however, much less is known about how these molecules biochemically and biophysically affect the cytoskeleton.

When placed in cell culture, these neurons develop the largest growth cones in nature, which serve as an excellent model system for quantitative analysis of the dynamics and mechanics of the cytoskeleton. We have used a variety of imaging modalities in our project, including high-resolution fluorescent and differential interference contrast time-lapse imaging, super-resolution microscopy, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Through molecular manipulations of isolated neurons, we found that Src tyrosine kinase, a key signaling enzyme in many biological processes, controls the organization and dynamics of both actin-based structures in the growth cone, filopodia and lamellipodia. Filopodia are finger-like actin bundles that act as sensors for guidance cues to direct growth cone movement. Lamellipodia are the veil-like actin networks between filopodia, which connect to the central domain of the growth cone and the axon. Our studies revealed that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin regulates the formation, stability, and lengthening of filopodia, as well as actin branch formation and protrusion of lamellipodia. The second goal of our project was to investigate the forces produced during growth cone advance, and how they are related to signaling. We found that neuronal growth cones can produce nanonewton level traction forces over the range of two orders of magnitude. We also found a positive feedback-loop between Src activity and traction force production. Lastly, we discovered that the level of substrate deformation better correlates with growth cone advance than the level of traction force.
