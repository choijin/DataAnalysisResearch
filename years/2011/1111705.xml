<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Instrument Development for Biological Research Program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure, Prof. Jonathan Sweedler and his group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are developing a suite of measurement approaches to characterize d-amino acids within individual cells and other small-volume domains within the nervous systems of multiple animals.  Using capillary electrophoresis for separation and fluorescence and mass spectrometry for detection, along with several unique high-throughput cell sampling devices, information on the presence of d-proline, d-glutamate and d-alanine is being determined. In addition to development of new enzymatic imaging approaches and single cell characterization measurements, application to several carefully selected animal models will provide information relevant to the function of the d-amino acids throughout Metazoan life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project not only promises to train students to be analytical chemists/measurement scientists, it also provides them with significant education and research experience in the biological sciences. Undergraduate and graduate students with diverse backgrounds, including many women scientists, will be actively involved and mentored in these interdisciplinary efforts. The broad-based dissemination of the research through publications, conferences, outreach, and training that includes undergraduates and graduates from multiple disciplines assures that this research advances our country's needs in science education and research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding how the brain functions, processes information, and controls behavior is a longstanding unanswered but important research challenge. Perhaps surprisingly, in the postgenomic era, one expects the suite of chemical players in a brain region to be known and their functions uncovered. However, many cell-to-cell signaling molecules remain poorly characterized, and for those that are known, their localization and dynamics are oftentimes unknown. The ability to characterize and understand how the brain functions requires new and innovative measurement approaches to sample and characterize the chemistry occurring within the cells in well-defined neuronal networks. Even after decades of research, many neurotransmitters and neuromodulators remain undiscovered.   One of the more overlooked categories of cell-cell signaling molecules in the brain are the d-amino acids (DAAs) and d-amino acid containing peptides. One reason these are not well known is because they are not easy to characterize. Several measurement approaches were developed during this project, based on single cell chiral measurements as well as single cell metabolomics and peptidomics, to study what may be the most overlooked category of cell-to-cell signaling molecules, the DAAs. Until our work, a lack of appropriate analytical technologies hindered investigations into the role of chirality in intercellular signaling, and in particular, the presence and function of the DAAs, including d-aspartate (d-Asp), d-alanine (d-Ala), d-serine (d-Ser) and d-glutamate (d-Glu). By coupling capillary scale separations with fluorescence and mass spectrometry, we created methods that provide information on d-Ser, d-Asp, d-Glu and d-Ala, as well as classical transmitters, in samples as small as individual neurons. Direct, single cell mass spectrometry results complement this information, confirming the previously suggested co-localization of neuropeptides, hormones and DAAs.   Using these new approaches, we verified the presence of d-amino acids in several primitive animals; for example, a research project performed in collaboration with Leonid Moroz and co-workers from the University of Florida revealed that our model Ctenophore, Pleurobrachia bachei (the Pacific sea gooseberry), does not have the expected enzymes required for the metabolism of the catechols and indoles involved in intercellular signaling. Interestingly, we did confirm that they synthesize DAAs.   As another important finding, we confirmed the hypothesis that d-Asp acts as a classical transmitter in the nervous system of the common neuroscience model, Aplysia californica. The outcome of our research has been a suite of tools for characterizing DAAs, and for placing the enigmatic DAAs into a functional cell-to-cell signaling context. For more information on the hunt for d-amino acids in Aplysia, see the NSF Science Nation video, released in April 2016, https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/science_nation/sluggishthoughts.jsp.   Lastly, we studied DAAs in rodents, where we observed DAA accumulation in secretory vesicles and chemical and physiological release from cells. Because our tools measure DAAs, they have allowed us an extraordinary glimpse into a new class of cell-cell signaling molecules that are well conserved across the animal kingdom    In terms of broader impacts, these new technologies have been widely disseminated via research publications and published protocols, and as part of a variety of scientific training efforts. While our first non-research goal involved training graduate students at UIUC, we also trained collaborators and visiting scholars to use our technologies.
