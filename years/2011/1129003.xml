<AbstractNarration>1129003&lt;br/&gt;Selker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative grant between Oregon State University (PI: Selker) and the University of Nevada Reno (PI: Tyler; EAR-1128999), supports a three year continuation and enhancement of national multi-user facility support for the Center for Transformative Environmental Monitoring Programs (CTEMPs).  CTEMPs was established in 2009 with initial support through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; EAR-0943682).  CTEMPs offers community support for planning, training, equipment lease and field implementation using distributed fiber optic methods including Raman backscatter Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) to allow for unprecedented observation of the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature for environmental applications including but not limited to, snow, groundwater and watershed hydrology, aquatic and terrestrial ecology, karst geology, soil science (including permafrost studies),  atmospheric boundary layer turbulence and glaciology.  Data collected using the CTEMPs DTS systems will be integrated into the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System (HIS) and CTEMPs will become a Hydrologic Measurement Facility (HMF) Node of CUAHSI.  CTEMPs plans training workshops and field deployment for up to 26 research projects a year with this support.  CTEMPs currently maintains five DTS system, one of which is high resolution, and 27 km of fiber optic cable.  High resolution DTS systems allow for near continuous (0.25 m) and precise (+/- 0.3 deg C) observations of river bottom, lake, or estuary bottom, snow pack, soil horizon or atmospheric temperatures over distances as great at 8 km at high temporal frequency (1 Hz).  Temperature precision of +/ 0.01 deg C can be achieved when observation are sampled hourly.  When placed in a stream or river, fiber optic DTS allows for observation of the location, temperature, and flux of each groundwater inflow, calculation of an exact heat budget to determine hyporheic exchange, and observation of micro-thermal habitats critical to successful larval fish recruitment.  DTS systems were originally developed for applications in the oil industry and for fire detection in high rise buildings.  Support for CTEMPs will make this developing technology available to broader scientific community for marginal instrument lease costs and applications for instrument use will be prioritized by an advisory committee with external representation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We can now measure the temperature each hand-width along a fiber optic cable to 0.01 degrees C over distances exceeding 10 miles in length &ndash; literally 10Ã†s of thousands of measurements in a single moment.  This has allowed us to observe earth processes with discovery of the melt rate of AntarcticÃ†s Ross Ice Sheet, the evaporation rate of the Dead Sea, the bleaching of coral in the South China Sea, and the patterns of wind over the Colorado prairies.  This is made possible by the NSF funding a facility that geoscientists can call on to teach them what the technology can do for them, help them design the instruments needed, install the cables, and even help them interpret the data.  In 2011-2015, CTEMPs supported over 70 distributed temperature sensing projects from spanning Antarctica, China, France, the Dead Sea, The South China Sea, and many states.   The major goals of this project are to develop environmental monitoring tools to the research community. CTEMPs focuses its instrumentation development in fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) for applications in earth sciences. CTEMPs second major goal is disseminate this instrumentation to the research community, with a primary focus on earth and environmental sciences.  CTEMPs serves as a community user facility, with instrumentation and support services available to federally supported researchers as well as state, local and limited private industry.  CTEMPs third major goal is to provide education and training in environmental monitoring, primarily focused on fiber optic sensing and, beginning last year, in remote sensing via UAS.  CTEMPs is jointly operated by the University of Nevada, Reno and Oregon State University (OSU), and has an East-Coast service office at Smith College in Massachusetts.  Training is a critical part of bringing this technology to the scientific opportunities.  From 2011-2015, CTEMPs hosted five two-day DTS workshop training over a 100 students and professionals on the use of distributed temperature sensing immediately before the Fall AGU meeting in Stanford CA. Additionally, DTS workshops were presented in Beijing China (2012, 2 day); Luxembourg in (2013, 3 days), John Day, Oregon (2014, 5 day); Corsica, France (2015, 3-day) and Helsinki, Finland (2015, 4-day) (workshops presented outside the USA had no expense to CTEMPs).  56 CTEMPs-supported peer-reviewed publications were recorded in this reporting period . Many of these publications resulted directly from CTEMPs instrumentation used by researchers in their fields.  In the remaining publications, CTEMPs provided technical support, advice and consultation to the design of field experiments or the analysis of data.  Research areas focused primarily on hydrology and ecology, with several manuscripts supporting cryosciences and oceanography. Of particular note in 2015 was CTEMPs first publication in the AAAS Science Advances on data developed by CTEMPs instrumentation and analysis in support of the WISSARD subglacial lake drilling program.  The development of heated fiber applications for DTS is a focal point of the OSU research team.  OSU published two articles with applications for heated fiber optic cables: the measurement of soil moisture (Sayde et al, 2014) and high resolution wind speed measurements (Sayde et al, 2015; Figure 3). The development of this method was one scientific goal of this reporting period.  During these 3 years CTEMPs has been developing numerous international collaborations. One very successful collaboration is between OSU, the University of Rennes 1 (France) and the University of East Anglia (UK). The 2 week field experiment during summer of 2013 where the characterization of groundwater flow in boreholes using the fiber optic technology was the main focus resulted in three peer reviewed publications: Read et al, 2013 (figure 1), Read et al. 2014 and Read et al. 2015.
