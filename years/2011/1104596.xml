<AbstractNarration>This research will address fundamental issues concerning quantum dynamics in the presence of disorder, and topics related to critical phenomena in statistical mechanics. One of the outstanding challenges is to develop mathematical tools for the analysis of the extended states and conduction in the presence of disorder. Of particular interest is the possibility of the localization - delocalization transition in systems of interacting particles. The work will build on the progress which was recently made by the PI which showed that in certain situations extended states emerge through tunneling facilitated by resonances between well separated localization centers. In the area of Statistical Mechanics, research will be resumed into critical phenomena, in particular at critical dimensions. The goal is to resolve some unsettled questions, in particular in relation to the phi(4d) field theory. The well known non-perturbative results on this topic did not yet address conclusively the critical dimension d = 4. Research will also be directed at clarifying the possible existence of a novel type of transition, at which the nature of the coupling of the local order parameter to the quenched disorder in d = 2 dimensional systems may change as the disorder strength is varied. The PI's past work on this subject included proof, jointly with J. Wehr, of the rounding effect of the disorder, and the recent extension of this to quantum systems, done jointly with R. Greenberg and J. L. Lebowitz. The envisioned research is expected to combine the perspectives of Probability (fluctuation analysis and large deviation theory) and Analysis (Hp function spaces and operator theory) for results which are of interest for Physics. As was demonstrated in the past, the challenge of shedding light on issues of physics enriches also fields of mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant includes funds for a graduate student and a postdoc, and for the continuation of fruitful collaborations. These are highly valuable both for the proposed research and for the training component of the work. The PI's past work has contributed to the professional development of a number of men and women who are now active researchers in related fields, and this project will continue to serve that role as well. The research results will be presented through publications, lectures and workshops. The PI has assisted in the organization of meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research Goals   The project focused on Mathematical studies of phenomena with manifest significance for Condensed Matter Physics, and of mathematically interesting and challenging structure.  In particular, the goal was shedding light on the following interrelated topics:  a) disorder effects on quantum spectra and dynamics  b) critical phenomena in three and four dimensions   c) disorder effects on phase diagrams in low dimensional systems (questions related to the Imry-Ma phenomenon).  In terms of the mathematics involved, the work employed and developed methods of Functional Analysis and Probability Theory.   Major Outcomes     1) Resonant Delocalization:  A breakthrough result was the finding and rigorous proof that under certain conditions,  the dynamics of quantum systems with disorder exhibit energy regimes (phases) in which extended states are formed due to resonating local quasi-modes (Joint work with Simone Warzel, of TU-Munich).   This results presents one of the very few mechanisms which have been identified as effective for the formation of bands of continuous spectrum in situations where the Bloch-Floquet mechanism, which forms the basis of condensed matter theory, is rendered inapplicable by the quenched disorder.  (Further manifestations of this mechanism were derived in work joined also by post-doctoral associate Mira Shamis).   An intriguing observation is that the extended eigenstates (vibration modes) which result by this mechanism may be "nonergodic", deviating from a heuristic version of the equidistribution principle.  If this holds also for many particle dynamics -- which is a topic of current research, including by this PI -- that may bear significant implications of the conductive properties over (what has been termed by others) a `bad metallicÆ phase.     2 )  Lorentzian characteristics of quantum noise  The spectral properties of random operators and the associated resolvent functions are of interest from both the perspective of the general theory of ``quantum chaos'', and as potentially convenient diagnostic tool for the localization-delocalization transition.  A general result on the ubiquity of Cauchy (aka Lorentzian) distribution was proven to hold in a surprising generality.  This result brought to the fore questions concerning the emergence and the role of Lorentzian ensembles in the joint distribution of Green function elements. This, and also the relation of the above to other spectral characteristics are now being investigated.     3) Critical Phenomena  A breakthrough was reached in the use of stochastic geometric methods in the study of the phase transitions in ferromagnetic spin models. Combining the `random current' method, which was previously developed by the PI, with more recent insights on percolation phenomena in correlated systems, it was proven that the spontaneous magnetization vanishes at the critical point of the three dimensional Ising model (joint work with V. Sidoravicius and H. Duminil-Copin).   The statement, which addressed a long open challenge, is part of a more general result concerning the phase transition in homogeneous Ising models. The three dimensional case quoted above has been the most elusive one; its dimension falling above D=2, where the model is solvable, and below the upper critical dimension of D=4.  The more general statement carries implications also for the single case in which the spontaneous magnetization is known to be discontinuous - the one dimensional model with the long range inverse-square interaction. It shows that in that situation the transition (reached by crossing a critical temperature, at zero magnetic field) is of mixed order, i.e. it does not fit the usual pattern of phase transition of first order.  4) Effects of quenched randomness on phase transitions:  In the analysis on the 2D random field model, for which we had initial indications of a phase transition which is reached by varying the strength of the disorder, we found reasons ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
