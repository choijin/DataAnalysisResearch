<AbstractNarration>Peer learning can provide students with an engaging learning environment that nurtures development of higher-order cognitive skills needed by engineers for innovation. This collaborative project led by the University of Oklahoma Norman Campus with partners from Tuskegee University and the Pennsylvania State University, University Park is using mobile smart devices to facilitate peer learning. Open ended problem solving ability is one key student outcome being enhanced by this project. In the Teaching to Learn (TeatoL) environment participants serve as both teacher and learner and will collectively learn from each other's experiences. The project is developing new understanding in how students (a) understand their own cognitive processes, (b) respond to peer teaching and learning, (c) can develop peer critique and reflection, (d) use mobile devices and social networks to enhance learning. In addition the project will develop a better understanding of how "flat" classrooms impact learning, and the impact of peer learning on underrepresented STEM students.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: Instruction modes need to allow students to grow as critical thinkers with proficiency in learning, and in creative problem solving for increasingly complex and uncertain engineering environments.

The main findings of this work are:  We determined that student generated instructional material content and their qualities facilitate peer-to-peer information exchange in an online flat learning environment.  Correlation study between number of in-depth comments and learning gains of all topics, showed a significant correlation and a dependency on the level of knowledge on the topic for the learning community (class) and the number of meaningful comments provided by their peers. Additionally, students provided more comments on the topics in which they had more knowledge and better understanding.  A negative relation was seen between quality of peer generated content and the number of in-depth comments received.

Meaningful comments have shown to help students in content poor groups to have higher learning gain than the students in content rich and average groups. This study shows that students provide more superficial comments when they review videos with good/average content but provide more in-depth comments on their peersÆ misunderstanding and misconceptions, when they review videos with poor content.  Although our study concluded that receiving meaningful comments from peers is a dominant mode of learning, students believed they learned more from reviewing/commenting on peersÆ work. One student in TeatoL explained his/her experience while reviewing his peersÆ work: "By reviewing other students work, I was able to compare my own with theirs and in turn develop a more sufficient process to solve or analyze an issue. By commenting, I basically recalled and scrutinized my own problems and realized what flaws I had if any".  Students explained that reviewing othersÆ work helped them reflect and compare their own design.  Well-designed peer learning environments for online courses can enhance student learning through providing meaningful peer-to-peer knowledge exchange. Meaningful peer-to-peer learning helps develop virtual learning community to provide a richer learning experience for students in online and MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses).  Underrepresented minority students in engineering also showed learning gains and improvements to solve open design problems.      Broader Impacts:  The structure of the flat learning environment can be applied to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Some of the deficiencies for MOOCs courses ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
