<AbstractNarration>This Research Coordination Network grant brings together and international, multi-disciplinary team of scientists and educators to better mobilize cases of long term human ecodynamics on the century to millennial scale to aid national and global efforts to develop effective future sustainable development and to create resources for Education for Sustainable Development (ESD).  This RCN project will develop a collaborative research network that will identify conditions that allow people to develop sustainable relationships with the environment over the millennial scale or have led to unsustainable outcomes. This proposal draws upon widespread recognition that inter-generational sustainability education efforts and formulation of long-term environmental policy for adaptive management are ill served by short observational spans, restricted case pools, and disciplinary stove-piping. This RCN will promote development of a transdisciplinary millennial scale perspective for a genuinely sustainable future through three interlinked working teams; 1) building capacity in long-term sustainability investigations through systematic inter-regional comparison of cases representing long-term human ecodynamics ?experiments? of coupled natural and human systems impacted by climate change, multi-generational human impact, and inter-regional connection; 2) building cyberinfrastructure support through common data management, digital dissemination and visualization tools that both aid sustainability researchers and connect with sustainability educators; 3) Enhancing local and national initiatives in sustainability education and community involvement in global change science by innovative application of digital technology and creating direct links with education professionals and involving active  local community participation in sustainability science &amp; education.</AbstractNarration>

Our mission ( and intellectual merit) has been to link international scholars, institutions, and regional teams who have been engaging in the study of "long term human ecodynamics" : interactions of humans, climate, and environment on the millennial scale.  The teams worked to connect across regions, to develop digital tools for communication and for modeling complex human-resource-climate interactions through time, and finding better ways to go "beyond outreach" in more effectively and directly engaging the public and modern resource managers.   We have worked to connect teams across regions (desert southwest North America to sub-arctic North Atlantic, Scotland to Puerto Rico) and across disciplines (environmental science, social sciences, environmental history, environmental humanities, education for sustainability) to do a better job of bringing the wider perspective of the human past to bear on problems directly relevant to current attempts to secure a genuinely sustainable future for our planet and ourselves.  We worked to connect best practice approaches and agencies (notably Environment Scotland and the US National Park Service) and build a community of collaborators that not only connected across national boundaries and scientific disciplines but also engaged with local residents affected by global change and the wider public.    The RCN sponsored 82 workshops and meetings  in six years and produced multiple peer reivewed academic publications, digital tools for communication and public engagement, and helped a very hard working international team of grad students and early career scholars to expand networks and jump-start their careers. Our work has been featured in multiple media, including popular articles in Scientific American, Science, The New Yorker, and National Geographic. We have had significant broader impacts on national and international discourse and understanding of the relevance of past human ecodynamics to our own situation in a rapidly changing earth.   We have been successful in building bridges and working relationships with the natural science communities  that have led major global change research initiatives and have linked our data sets to efforts to better manage key natural resources in a period of acclerating environmental change.  The RCN has established and strengthened the contribution of the disciplines of the past to global change organizations like Future Earth, International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES), and the Integrated History and Future of Humans on Earth (IHOPE) while getting archaeological perspectives into the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the first time.  Archaeology is increasingly recognized as a global change science, and our data and perspectives on the roots of the Anthropocene are now seen as key elements informing scenario builders aiming to guide us towards desirable futures while avoiding pitfalls and "collapse".  We have also  coordinated documentation of the widespread impacts of climate change on the archaeological record, where rising sea levels, increasing storminess, wildfires, rising soil temperatures (and declining organic preservation) in high altitudes and the circumpolar north have had devastating effects in the past decade.  This RCN has aided collaboration to develop response strategies, and has been directly involved in the formation of the Society for American Archaeology's Climate Change Strategies and the Archaeological Record Committee and the allied European Archaeological Association's Climate Impact Committee.  We have worked to coordinate the work of rescue teams and bring in local communities in a collaboration to rescue endangered heritage and science.  We sponsored publication of the first conference volume aimed at climate change response, and have worked to improve internet resources for local responders, while linking our results to modelers and resource managers interested in our increasingly valued but endangered data sets.   We have become a broad and growing network of collaborators and friends, and with growing institutional support and help from the public we will be continuing to build upon the NSF SEES support provided in this grant for years to come.
