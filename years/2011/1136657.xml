<AbstractNarration>Human-induced global change is altering most ecosystems on Earth. Highly diverse ecosystems may be better buffered against change, maintaining key functions even as the physical environment changes. How ecosystems respond will likely depend on their biodiversity, but how different components of biological diversity (biodiversity) determine ecosystem responses to global change are still poorly understood. Genetic diversity enhances the ability of populations to adapt to change and functional diversity allows different species to carry out key ecosystem functions, but little is known about how these components of diversity will interact with each other and with the number of species present in a changing environment. Sixty years of existing ecological data, field sampling, genetic analyses, experiments, and  mathematical models will be used by an interdisciplinary team of researchers to examine multiple aspects of biodiversity in the largest, oldest and most biologically diverse lake in the world, Lake Baikal in Siberia. A major goal of the project will be to develop the ability to predict how this ecosystem will respond to rising temperatures and other stressors. Holding 20% of world's unfrozen fresh water, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is recognized internationally as a globally important freshwater resource, a treasure trove of biodiversity and a unique natural laboratory in which to study evolution. With an unprecedented diversity of endemic species found nowhere else, Lake Baikal serves as a model for ecosystems with highly unique biota and cold aquatic environments undergoing rapid warming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers and students will engage in an interdisciplinary international collaborative research program. Funding will support graduate training in both applied and basic areas of science, including molecular biology, ecology, and informatics. Data collected by this project will be publically available so that they can be used by other scientists and educators. Project results will be communicated to environmental organizations in Russia and the US and to a US-based film team planning an IMAX movie about Baikal and freshwater conservation. School teachers from Michigan, Texas and Tennessee will participate in the project and, together with researchers, develop educational activities on aquatic ecology, biological diversity and global change.</AbstractNarration>

Results of laboratory experiments confirmed that the cosmopolitan species exhibit higher survivorship and reproduction in warm water, whereas the unique cold-water species experiences elevated mortality and reduced reproduction in warm water.  Furthermore, the cold-water species become more susceptible to parasitic infection in warm water than do the cosmopolitan species.  Despite its vulnerability to warming waters and parasites, the unique cold-water species appears to have a refuge in the lake?s deep cold waters into which it vertically migrates each day.  There, temperatures are more amenable for its survivorship and reproduction, and transmission and growth of the parasite is slowed.  This may explain why the abundance of this species has not changed as surface waters warmed.  These findings suggest that vertical migration, a behavior typical of many freshwater and marine species, may protect biota from warming surface waters in some aquatic ecosystems.        Other environmental threats, in addition to climate change, confront lakes world-wide including L. Baikal.  In a complimentary project we explored how heavy metal concentrations in the Baikal seal, the world?s only exclusively freshwater seal, changed between the 1930?s and 2013.
