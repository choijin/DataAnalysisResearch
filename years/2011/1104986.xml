<AbstractNarration>This project will support the 6th International Conference on Ethical Issues in Biomedical Engineering that will be hosted by The SUNY Downstate Medical Center in collaboration with the Polytechnic Institute of New York and New York Academy of Sciences during April 1-3, 2011. The conference will   bring together faculty, researchers and students in the rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of biomedical engineering to discuss the challenging ethical issues faced by biomedical engineers in their research and practice.  Biomedical engineering is responsible for many of the dramatic advances in modern medicine. However, biomedical technology has also contributed to dilemmas and has challenged some of our moral values. These include ethical issues in stem cell research &amp; cloning, conflicts of interest, allocation of scarce resources, research misconduct, animal experimentation, clinical trials and marketing of new medical devices and many other new emerging issues.  Research and development executives from biomedical companies will also be invited. International participants will also be welcomed to present papers at this conference. The goal of this conference will be to present an overview and an in-depth discussion of the ethical issues encountered in bioengineering research and practice that are presently being conducted at various institutions and biomedical industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is expected to have a broad spectrum of attendees (faculty, scientists, philosophers, students, physicians, lawyers and industry representatives).</AbstractNarration>

Featured highlighted topics included recent advances in (i) regenerative medicine and (ii) nanotechnology and (iii) ethical issues in dentistry.  The presented abstracts were published in a special issue of the International Journal of Medical Implants and Devices (Vol. 5, No. 1, 2011).     New treatments and technologies emerging from the field of biomedical research have prompted demands for updated ethical guidelines. The Sixth International Conference on Ethical Issues in Biomedical Engineering brought together biomedical engineers, clinicians, research scientists, and philosophers, who discussed the design and implementation of new policies and interventions to guide emerging biomedical technologies, biomedical research, and medical practice.
