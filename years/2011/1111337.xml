<AbstractNarration>Quantum information science has yielded deep theoretical insights into the nature of information and communication, while raising the hope of dramatically more capable computers and communication networks. But the achievement of these practical goals is hindered by the inherent fragility of quantum information. Traditional approaches for obtaining reliability through simple redundancy do not work; instead, fault tolerance must, and can, in principle, be obtained through subtler techniques that contrive to measure and correct errors without learning anything about the encoded data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately present methods for fault-tolerant quantum computation require significant overhead, and present understanding of quantum channel capacities remain very limited. For example, no quantum code is known on which arbitrary fault-tolerant quantum computation can be performed without leaving the code space. And only very recently was it discovered that classical information can be sent at rates exceeding the long-conjectured Holevo bound. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will attempt to develop new methods for reliable quantum communication and computation in the presence of noise. First, the research will push the capabilities and boundaries of quantum error-correction techniques, both by extending and delineating the types of correctable errors, and by determining the scenarios under which such error correction is or is not possible. The second goal is to develop the deep but heretofore largely unexplored connections between quantum codes, entanglement, and many-body physics, complexity theory, cryptography and high-dimensional geometry. The objective is to advance our understanding both of quantum codes as well as the related areas of mathematics, physics and computer science. Finally the team will seek to elucidate the subtle differences between quantum communication and its closest classical analog---private communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research endeavors to contribute definitively to realistic embodiments of large-scale quantum computers, which would dramatically improve mankind's ability to process and communicate information. And the research program itself is deeply interdisciplinary, bringing together physicists, computer scientists and mathematicians from industry and academia, and training students and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How can a realiable system be constructed from unreliable components?  This is a key question facing quantum computers, whose basic components are typically highly unreliable, due to to the notorious fragility of quantum states.  This fragility is inherent in quatnum systems, because their quantum properties are attained only when perfectly isolated from the environment, yet invetibly intrusions must be engineered to allow quantum gates to be sequenced, and quantum computations to be controllably realized.    This project realized for the first time a novel way to achieve reliable quantum computation, which allows quantum states to remain protected by a single quantum error correction code during the entire computation time.  Previously, a fundamental no-go theorem has been proved, stipulating that the most common recipe for fault-tolerant quantum computation, known as "transversal" quantum gates, could not be utilized for universal quantum computation within a single standard quantum code.  "Piecable fault tolerance" is the new method introduced by this project, which circumvents this no-go theorem, by being the first non-transversal fault-tolerant quantum logic gate construction, which works on a single standard quantum code (see figure for illustration).   The simplicity of this construction means that the threshold of minimum reliability necessary for fault-tolerant, reliable quantum computation, will be easier to experimentally achieve, reducing the barrier to realization of general-purpose, large-scale, quantum computation.  Beyond this, the project also investigated other approaches to realizing useful quantum computation using unreliable or uncalibrated components.  Two notable additional major results from this project were (a) the discovery of a quantum algorithm for fixed-point quantum search, which converges on the marked object independent of the number of search iterations performed; and (b) the formulation of "quantum signal processing" for optimally simulating quantum systems.  These new quantum algorithms embody a level of natural robustness to imperfect settings and calibrations, and this robustness will be helpful in the quest for useful quantum computation.
