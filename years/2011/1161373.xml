<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry supports a new conference, the 2012 Water and Aqueous Solutions Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), organized entirely by and for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who are doing research related to water and aqueous solutions. This GRS will precede the associated 2012 Water and Aqueous Solutions Gordon Research Conference (GRC). The focus of these two meetings is on identifying key questions, describing recent breakthroughs, and unveiling surprising discoveries related to water and aqueous solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water is an important and unique substance that plays a central role in a wide variety of problems ranging from bioengineering to weather predictions to material processing and development. Although water is a deceptively simple three-atom molecule, it possesses a unique set of distinguishing physical properties that set it apart from any other substance on Earth. Understanding the fundamental principles governing the structure and dynamics of water, and particularly how water mediates chemical interactions and processes, continues to pose formidable challenges and yield abundant surprises. The planned GRS will provide a unique forum for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas in fields related to water and aqueous solutions. A key aim of the GRS is to enable young investigators to become active conference participants through an educational and encouraging platform that facilitates the establishment of networks with their peers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[           The Gordon Research Seminar on WATER &amp; AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS was held at Holderness School Holderness, New Hampshire, August 11-12, 2012. The Conference was well-attended with 59 participants (attendees list attached). The attendees represented the spectrum of endeavor in this field coming from academia, industry, and government laboratories, both U.S. and foreign scientists, senior researchers, young investigators, and students. Of the 59 attendees, 20 voluntarily responded to a general inquiry regarding ethnicity which appears on our registration forms.

In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.          Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
