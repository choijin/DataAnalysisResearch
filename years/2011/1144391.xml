<AbstractNarration>Changes in the global climate exert significant abiotic stresses (salinity, drought) and constitute major challenges for crop production. Unlike animals, plants cannot move to escape adverse conditions. Hence, they evolved mechanisms to detect changes in their environment, communicate these to different organs, and adjust development accordingly. One of these adaptations is the phloem, a long-distance trafficking pathway, which is essential for the communication of environmental cues. Determining the nature of signals and the mechanisms by which they are communicated through the phloem will lead to a more complete understanding of how the plant adjusts development in response to stress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lipids are known to act as signals at the cellular level. However, their role in long distance signaling has received little attention. It is a new area of research which is expected to contribute new concepts to plant development.  To act as long-distance signals, lipids have to be released into the phloem, moved bound to a protein "chaperone", and be detected by a receptor. An earlier  study of Arabidopsis phloem exudates revealed lipid-binding proteins with potential roles in performing those functions. Lipases could function in the release of lipids; phloem lipid-associated family protein (PLAFP), a predicted stress-induced lipid-binding protein, could facilitate lipid transport throughout the phloem; PIG-P proteins (subunit P of a phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) could function as part of a lipid receptor. This project aims to use biochemistry, molecular biology, microscopy, and mass spectrometry to characterize the expression of these proteins in response to abiotic stresses (drought, salt, osmotic), investigate the lipid-binding characteristics, and study the impact changes in lipid-binding and protein expression have on this stress response and the phospholipid profile. The experiments, which will be conducted with a graduate student, undergraduate student, and a high school student, will provide an insight into the mechanism of stress-induced lipid signaling and its effect on the plant's response to our changing environment.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Lipids are essential components of plants. They provide energy for metabolic processes, are structural components of membranes, and are intracellular signals that enable plants to survive environmental changes. Furthermore, several lipids have been discussed in relation to long-distance signaling of biotic stress, but roles as abiotic stress signals are also possible. Thus, lipids can convey information that triggers critical changes in gene expression and development. Climate change, population increases, and the resulting scarcity of arable land provide a challenge to food security. Hence, it is essential to understand how plants signal environmental changes not only locally, but also to distal parts of the plant. Plants have developed two long- distance transport systems: the xylem for water and mineral distribution from the roots throughout the plant, and the phloem. The view of phloem function has evolved from that of a simple assimilate transport system to also encompass a trafficking system for stress signals and developmental regulators in the form of small molecules, peptides/proteins, nucleic acids, and more recently, lipids. Our analysis of <em>Arabidopsis</em> phloem exudates uncovered lipids and several lipid-binding proteins. As a result, my group was among the first to propose that phloem phospholipids could act as long-distance developmental signals or in response to abiotic stress and that they are released, sensed, and moved by phloem lipid-binding proteins (Figure 1; Hoffmann-Benning, 2015; Barbaglia and Hoffmann-Benning, 2016)<em>.</em></p> <p>In this proposal we examined three of the identified predicted phloem-localized lipid-binding proteins: a GDSL-lipase as a protein that releases the lipid into the phloem; a PIG-P-like protein with a putative receptor-like function, and a novel protein of unknown function (PLAFP), which could be phloem mobile. We showed that all three proteins bind lipids, particularly phosphatidic acid (PA; Barbaglia et al., 2016), which we had identified in phloem exudates as well. PA is not only an intermediate in lipid metabolism but, importantly, is an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intracellular signal</span> in response to many stresses, including drought and the drought-stress signal ABA. Yet virtually nothing is known about its possible function in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">long-distance signaling</span>. Therefore its function and interaction with phloem LBPs is likely essential for the plants&rsquo; developmental response to environmental cues. We showed that the genes encoding GDSL-lipase, PIG-P, and PLAFP are expressed in the companion cells (Fig.2), as would be a requirement for a phloem-localized protein, and investigated their expression in response to the abiotic factors that lead to the production of PA. PIG-P is not induced by any tested stress. This is not surprising if it functions as a receptor. GDSL lipase and PLAFP show opposite responses, suggesting that they do not act in &ldquo;relay&rdquo; but likely in distinct signaling paths. <em>PLAFP</em> expression in seedlings is increased significantly within five hours in response to PEG and ABA (Fig. 3).&nbsp; This response is maintained for up to 24 hours. These findings suggest that like PA, PLAFP plays a role in ABA signaling and, based on its location that PLAFP-PA acts in long-distance signaling. The high affinity of PA-binding of PLAFP (5.6 nM) suggests a function within the PA signaling path; its presence in the phloem an important role in long-distance signaling!

These findings suggest that PLAFP may regulate plant, and mostly root development under non-stress conditions.
