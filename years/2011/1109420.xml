<AbstractNarration>This award will support an observational project to investigate the progenitor stars of supernova explosions.  Theory and observations currently suggest two possibilities:  close binaries with two white dwarfs that merge through the loss of angular momentum, or close binaries with one white dwarf gathering mass from a companion star.  The latter are observationally detected as recurrent novae, symbiotic stars, or supersoft X-ray sources.  This project has two parts.  The first part will search supernovae remnants in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way) for remnants that survived after the supernova explosion; in the scenario involving two white dwarfs, no remnant star would be detected.  The second part of this project is to test whether recurrent novae could be supernova progenitors by studying these novae during and after their eruptions, especially to detect orbital period changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of supernova progenitors is important as a test for stellar evolution theory and for the use of supernovae to explore the evolution of the universe's expansion through time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The identity of the type of star system that makes for a Type Ia supernova is one of the most important questions in modern astrophysics, partly because the supernova event is a keystone for stellar evolution, and partly because a knowledge of the progenitor is needed for knowing how the very-distant supernovae differ from nearby supernovae as needed by the big-time supernova cosmology projects that are the only way to measure the mysterious and all-embracing Dark Energy.  A variety of types of star systems have been proposed as progenitors, with the two most prominent being recurrent novae (binaries with multiple nova eruptions within a century) and the so-called double-degenerate systems (pairs of massive white dwarfs in close orbit).  The long-standing progenitor problem is that we do not know which of the many possibilities actually make most of the Type Ia supernovae.  This NSF grant was aimed at solving the progenitor problem, with two approaches.               The first approach is to look deeply at the centers of known Type Ia supernovae for a surviving companion star (an ex-companion star) that was in orbit around the exploding star just before it exploded.  This can distinguish between models, as they all have different predictions for the nature of any ex-companion.  For example, recurrent novae will have most ex-companions as being red giant or sub-giant stars, while the double-degenerate systems will have no ex-companion at all.  For this task, we have looked very deep in the core of a known Type Ia supernova remnant (from an explosion 400 years ago) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a nearby galaxy) to see that there are no ex-companions to very deep limits.  And we have proved that the prior claims for a sub-giant ex-companion inside Tycho's supernova remnant is not correct.  And we have looked in several other supernova remnants, and exploding supernovae to prove that these do not have any ex-companions at all, to deep limits.  So the strong result from this first approach is to show that Type Ia supernova do not have ex-companions, and this uniquely points to the double-degenerate progenitor.              The second approach is to test the possibility that recurrent novae are the progenitors.  For this, we have two decisive new results.  The first is to take archival data to prove that most recurrent novae are neon novae.  A neon nova is one where the element neon is a dominant component of the ejecta.  This can only happen when the underlying white dwarf has a neon-carbon-magnesium composition, and the nova eruption dredges up and ejects the neon-rich material.  This proves that the white dwarf ejects more mass during its eruption than it gains from accretion between eruptions, which is to say that the white dwarf mass must be getting smaller, and thus the star is getting further away from the Chandrasekhar mass required to make a supernova eruption.  Also, this proves that the underlying white dwarf does not have a composition of carbon-oxygen, as is required to get enough energy to make for a supernova explosion.  Thus, that most recurrent novae are neon novae, we show that most novae cannot become Type Ia supernovae.  The second of our decisive results is that we have measured the mass ejected for five different recurrent novae.  This is a wonderful result, using historical sky photographs extending back over a century plus many nights at the telescope measuring eclipse times.  The idea is to measure the orbital period before the eruption (the hard part) and the orbital period after the eruption, all by measuring the times of eclipses, so as to measure the change of the orbital period across the eruption.  This change in the orbital period has a simple and confident conversion to how much mass is ejected.  The ejecta mass can be compared to the mass accreted onto the white dwarf between eruptions.  In all five cases, we found that the mass ejected was larger than the mass accreted between eruption, in three ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
