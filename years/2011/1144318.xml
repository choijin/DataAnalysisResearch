<AbstractNarration>As many as 20 million Americans identify themselves as Scottish or Scots/Irish in descent. One of the primary heritage languages of this community, Scottish Gaelic is the medium for a rich culture of literature, song, poetry, history and indigenous knowledge-systems. It also provides an important window into the world-view and culture of the ancestors of the Scottish-American community. The loss of native speaker knowledge about this endangered language is imminent. The Scottish Gaelic language is of particular interest to scientific linguists. Gaelic is very different from English in the ways it signals grammatical relationships between words. In particular it has a mechanism for indicating grammatical notions such as tense, gender, aspect, and possession by changing the first consonant of one of the words in the relationship. For example, the initial consonant in the word cù 'dog' (a k sound) is pronounced with a hard ch sound like German Bach when it is appears after possessive words like mo 'my' (written as mo chù). These changes, called "initial consonant mutations," are a productive and critical part of the grammatical system of the language. This mechanism for indicating grammatical inflection is extremely rare in the world's languages and is very poorly understood. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In order for linguists to properly understand the sound system of a language, they have to use instrumental measures of how speakers articulate sounds and use psycholinguistic experiments to measure how speakers understand and use the patterns of sounds. Using modern linguistic instrumental and psycholinguistic techniques. Professors Andrew Carnie, Diana Archangeli, Michael Hammond, Natasha Warner and Adam Ussishkin, along with Scottish Gaelic native speaker Muriel Fisher will investigate the articulation, patterning, and perception of initial consonant mutations. For example, this study will determine whether speakers store both the mutated and non-mutated words in their minds by asking them to identify the word while they listen to obscured (or "masked") speech sounds. A related experiment, where the sounds people hear are subtly artificially modified (or "gated"), will be used to study that the exact point in the sound stream at which listeners can identify whether the word is mutated or non-mutated. A study of the relative statistical frequency of sounds in mutated and non-mutated in a collection of language (or corpus) will show how productive the process is and how it corresponds to statistics on the frequency of sounds in the larger grammatical system of the language. Psycholinguistic techniques, including judgments and nonsense word tasks will be used to investigate the mental procedures speakers use to produce these mutations. Finally the actual articulation of these mutations will be investigated using modern phonetic instrumental measures such as ultrasound and airflow volume. The output of this research project will be a description of the Gaelic consonant mutation that will help complete an on-going description of the language. In addition, in doing this research graduate students will be trained in the techniques of sound analysis of an endangered language. This training will allow the students to conduct similar experimental studies on other endangered languages. This work has significant implications for documenting and preserving the linguistic traditions of the Scottish and Scottish-American communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many linguists are interested in questions of how people store words in the mind and how they produce and understand words. One way to approach this topic is by looking at comparing how different languages make new forms of words. Scottish Gaelic is a particularly fruitful test bed for this kind of investigation, because it has a rare kind of word-forming pattern called initial consonant mutation (ICM). This process takes the first consonant of a word and changes into another one. For example, the verb p&ograve;s æto marryÆ is put into the past tense by changing the first consonant from a æpÆ sound to an æfÆ sound (spelled ph&ograve;s æmarriedÆ).  Our study used techniques from experimental phonetics, psycholinguistics and computational modeling to investigate the nature of these ICMs. Scottish Gaelic is a minority language (with between 30,000 and 60,000 speakers). Running experiments on languages like this is unusual and requires careful planning and implementation to effectively use the limited resources of the community.   Using an ultrasound machine, similar to the kind used in medical scans, we were able to precisely measure tongue placement of sounds produced in ICM. This allowed us to tell if the mutated sounds were pronounced in the same way as unmutated sounds. For example, when an æsÆ sound and a ætÆ sound are mutated, they both turn into an æhÆ sound. We checked to see if that æhÆ sound was pronounced differently if the corresponding unmutated word started with an æsÆ or a ætÆ. We discovered that it did not. This contributes to our understanding of how people organize sounds into abstract sound units in their minds.  We used techniques of elicitation (where we ask native speakers to say certain forms) and compared the results to statistical patterns we find in a collection of written Gaelic.

Scottish Gaelic is not only an interesting language for linguists, it is also the heritage language for millions of Scots and Scottish Americans.
