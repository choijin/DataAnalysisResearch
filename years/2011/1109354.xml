<AbstractNarration>Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution (SAMs) use relatively simple, but physically motivated parameterized prescriptions for the effects of complex processes such as merging, gas accretion, star formation, and feedback to follow a simulated population of galaxies through cosmic time. Though inexact, SAMs are necessary since direct simulation of these processes is still beyond the reach of computational hardware and techniques. The disadvantage of SAMs is that the degeneracies among the adjustable parameters can be large and poorly understood. In response, the proposing team has developed a Bayesian inference based SAM. The Bayesian approach yields the posterior probability distribution of the SAM parameters for a given set of data, and an assessment of how well a particular model is supported by the data. In this project, the team will apply their analysis to archival data on high-redshift galaxies, and address the following issues: (1) how galaxies assemble their masses, how star formation proceeds in different galaxies, and whether a universal stellar initial mass function is consistent with the data; (2) how feedback affects the gas component in galaxies, and why most of the baryons today are not in galaxies; (3) the growth of supermassive black holes, and how feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) affects galaxy formation and evolution; (4) the properties of ionizing sources at high redshift and how the Universe was re-ionized; (5) whether the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm can accommodate all observational properties of galaxies. These models will be used to create mock galaxy catalogs tailored to the properties of specific galaxy surveys; the team will make these mock catalogs available to the community. The project will support the work and professional training of a graduate student, and is intended to provide research opportunities for undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The vast ocean of space is full of shining islands called galaxies.These objects, which are beautiful and diverse, not only are the localities within which stars and planets  form and evolve, but also serve as the lighthouses that allow us to explore the structure, history and origin of the Universe. In the past 20 years, much information about the galaxy population has been collected by large (and expensive) observational programs, such as the Hubble Space Telescope,  Spitzer, Herschel, and Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These observations not only allow us to witness the properties of galaxies, such as their masses, shapes, sizes and mass contents, at the present time, but also to map the evolution of the galaxy population  in the entire history of the Universe,  all the way to a time when the Universe was only a fraction of its present age and size.        The primary goal of this proposal was to understand how  galaxies form and evolve during the history of the Universe, capitalizing on the wealth of the variety of observational data obtained from large observatories.     To this end, we have developed a new method, a Bayesian inference - based semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, which allows us to use different observational data in a systematic way to explore physical processes that shape the galaxy population we observe. We found that some of the currently popular scenarios are not able to accommodate the observational data, suggesting that some new physical processes have to be explored. We have found a model that is able to accommodate all current observational data.  We have used the results to show (1) how galaxies assemble their masses, and how star formation proceeds in different galaxies; (2) how feedback from star formation affects the gas component in galaxies, and why most of the atomic and molecular gas today is not in galaxies; (3) how the growth of supermassive black holes affects galaxy formation and evolution; (4) whether the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm can accommodate all observational properties of galaxies, or a change in dark matter (to e.g. Warm Dark Matter) is actually preferred by the data. Our results also provide a powerful tool to produce large, realistic mock catalogs that can be tailored to mimic a specific survey. These mock catalogs  can be used to test, calibrate and optimize strategies of future observations and analysis.   During the proposal period, multi-disciplinary training opportunities were provided for students to develop skills in the analytical treatment of physical processes, in numerical and statistical analysis, in data mining, and in advanced computational methods.
