<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Peter C. Zee  New Zealand 2011     The 2011 NSF EAPSI Fellowship afforded me the opportunity to travel to New Zealand to do research in the laboratory of Dr. Paul Rainey at the New Zealand Institute for Advanced Study at Massey University.  During my stay in New Zealand, I undertook several collaborative research projects using the bacterial model system for the study of evolution Pseudomonas fluorescens.  First, I studied how different genetic backgrounds and environments can significantly impact both the rate and extent of evolutionary diversification. Using two different evolutionary timepoints of P. fluoresens as ancestors, I measured the number of derived cell types at several distinct evolutionary times.  Not surprisingly, in a static environment (with more ecological opportunity) there was faster and more extensive diversification.  More interestingly, though, was that one genetic background had a significantly constrained rate and extent of diversification, suggesting that certain mutations in the genetic background constrained or precluded further diversification.  Second, I conducted a three-way competition experiment in two different environments to investigate the fitness relationships between a three different P. fluorescens cell types: a smooth (colonizes the liquid media), a wrinkly (colonizes the air-liquid interface), and a "switcher" (a bet-hedging genotype evolved in a changing environment).  The results of our experiment did not meet out expectations that the switcher would have the highest fitness across both environments.  Our results point to the possibility of complex indirect interactions in the competition.  These three-way competition experiments are currently being investigated further.  Lastly, I investigate the response to group selection for increased mat strength in P. fluorescens.  Preliminary data suggests that certain suites of traits in mats evolve together, indicating a shared genetic basis. Interestingly, strong mats evolve with distinct groups of traits, suggesting that there are several evolutionary solutions to increasing mat strength.
