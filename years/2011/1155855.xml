<AbstractNarration>Ethane and propane are released in abundance to the ocean through natural seepage, as byproducts of photosynthesis, and by the petroleum industry. For example, ethane and propane together constituted greater than 5% of the total mass release during the Deepwater Horizon event and were the primary drivers of oxygen decline in the deep waters of the NE Gulf of Mexico during the spill. Despite the importance of these gases, little is known about their release into the ocean, the capacity of marine bacteria to consume them, or the fate and impacts of the carbon and energy they store. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project researchers at the University of California at Santa Barbara will specifically address the consumption of ethane and propane in the ocean by developing, validating and applying highly sensitive tracer techniques to quantify consumption rates for these gases in ocean waters. Two specific hypotheses will be tested with the goal to better understand the factors controlling ethane and propane consumption in the ocean. Hypothesis 1: The capacity for ethane and propane oxidation is ubiquitous throughout the upper ocean and along continental margins, with constitutive rates that depend on regional input and total bacterial abundance; Hypothesis 2: Propane and ethane consumption are readily inducible beyond a basal level on the timescale of days, propane consumption more so than ethane consumption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will address these hypotheses in two steps. The first step will entail the development of a method to quantify the consumption rates for ethane and propane, including the laboratory synthesis of radiolabeled ethane and propane, purification of the products, systematic investigations of tracer storage to minimize effects of autoradiolytic exchange, and validation of the measurement through intercomparison. The second step is the application of the method to interrogate the rates of ethane and propane consumption in the ocean, including the coastal ocean and along the continental margin off California. The field component of the research will take place during a series of short cruises in the Santa Barbara Basin, and during one value added cruise aboard a UNOLS vessel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts This project will provide support for the dissertation research of one graduate student. Several undergraduate students will receive laboratory training and participate in the coastal research. A field studies course will bring several undergraduates on a research expedition and provide them a rich hands-on educational experience, truly integrating teaching and research, using an established methodology. The PI will continue to lead outreach efforts by example, serving as a resource to journalists, federal agencies, and members of Congress, and through popularization of appropriate aspects of this research</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hydrocarbons including oil and natural gas enter the ocean through both natural seepage and through human activities.  The transport and fate of such hydrocarbons is important because of impacts on Ocean health and ecology.  This research project focused on understanding the fate of natural gas &ndash; ethane, propane and butane &ndash; upon entering the ocean.  While not themselves toxic, these gases can be important for diving biological activity; for example, these gases drove oxygen declines in the deep ocean following the Deepwater Horizon event.   The intellectual merit of this research focused on the fate of ethane, propane and butane in Ocean water.  Findings of the research show that natural gas is consumed rapidly following its release from a seep to the coastal ocean, being consumed by bacteria within a matter of days post discharge.  This timing was surprisingly rapid, but helps to explain the succession of hydrocarbon consumption that occurred following the Deepwater Horizon event.  Additional aspects of this research revealed that some components of natural gas can be degraded in the absence of oxygen, while other aspects inform the utility of novel isotope measurements to understand the production of natural gas in geologic settings, and yet another aspect reveals that natural gas can be used to feed deep-sea symbioses..  The broader impacts of this work included training of Undergraduate and Graduate Students, and Postdoctoral Scholars.  Several project personnel are members of underrepresented minority groups.  This project also allowed for undergraduate students to participate on an oceanographic research expedition, where they learned a host of valuable skills.   Several of the Undergraduate Student participants have gone on to pursue graduate degrees.          Last Modified: 09/19/2016       Submitted by: David L Valentine]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
