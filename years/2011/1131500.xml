<AbstractNarration>This project will undertake research that responds to the specific analytic and operational requirements of the Census Bureau and other federal statistical agencies to improve their estimates while reducing costs and respondent burden.  The project will use administrative data, and more generally, data generated by households and businesses in the course of their normal activities to produce economic and demographic measurements that currently rely on surveys.  The project will develop and evaluate methodologies that use the vast constellation of data generated by ordinary activity in a modern society and that protect the privacy of individuals and businesses.   The project will examine administrative records created by businesses, individuals, and governments, streams of data from social media sites on the World Wide Web, and detailed geospatial data.  The project will analyze these multiple source of data and relate them to data collected on surveys.  It aims to improve survey measurements of economic and demographic data and potentially supplement or replace surveys with statistics based on administrative, Web-based, and geospatial data.  Applications of these approaches include the following: using linked survey-administrative data to assess attrition, selective non-response, and measurement error in surveys; using Web-based social media to measure job loss, job creation, small business creation, and informal economic activity; using administrative geo-spatial data to enhance small-area estimates; and training in the use and creation of linked survey-administrative datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Federal statistical agencies have pressing needs to innovate in light of the rapidly changing structure of the economy and the interaction of these changes with the fundamental ways in which households and businesses produce and use information.   This project will combine expertise in social science, survey research, and information science to address the scientific and practical problems that the statistical system must confront.  The project will advance the science of measurement and serve to renew the statistical system both by bringing frontier methodology to measurement problems faced by the statistical agencies and by nurturing a new generation of scholars, both within the statistical agencies and academia, who will collaboratively address these issues.  This activity is supported by the NSF-Census Research Network funding opportunity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Federal statistical agencies have pressing needs to innovate in light of the rapidly changing structure of the economy and the interaction of these changes with the fundamental ways in which households and businesses produce and use information.   This project produced innovations in using such data&mdash;often called "big data"&mdash;that are foundational for modernizing how Federal statistical agencies measure the economy in the twenty-first century.   This project provided novel estimates and analyses including the following:  Using financial transactions data, the project produced a new way to estimate households? spending, income, and debt at high frequency and with great accuracy.  Analyses using these data provided evidence on how households manage their spending and debt payments over their pay period.  It also showed how households adjust to adverse shocks to income by drawing down cash and delaying payments. These results show the extent to which households face financial risks if they have very low cash on hand to meet unexpected events.  Using social media data, this projected produced new indices of job loss and job finding that complement official statistics.   This approach demonstrates the usefulness of using new sources of data&mdash;specifically Tweets about jobs&mdash;in identifying labor market trends.  In particular, social media provides novel insight into how workers feel about the strength or weakness of employment prospects.  Techniques developed using social media data will be useful for economists and other social scientists aiming to construct real time indices of social and economic behavior and outcomes.  Collaboration between social scientists and computer scientists produced tools that can be applied to extracting time series of social and economic indicators from social media.  Geospatial images also provide a novel source of data for assessing economic trends with greater resolution than conventional data sources.  This project used satellite measurements of land cover to measure the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on economic activity in southeast Michigan.  A modern statistical infrastructure combines survey and administrative data. Some information, including inherently subjective variables, can best obtained from surveys of individuals.  Other data are much better measured by administrative data.  This project advanced the joint use of measure survey and administrative data by developing new techniques for matching survey responses about employers to administrative data.  These techniques have better performance&mdash;better match probabilities and fewer false positive matches&mdash;than conventional procedures. These innovations will be available to statistical agencies as they improve official measures by combining survey and administrative data.  In addition to improving data quality, the use of such record linkage can reduce the cost of administering surveys and the time burden of households when they respond to surveys.  The project compared survey and administrative measurement of permanent job loss. It examined the implications of these different measures for estimates of how job loss affects workers? prospects for future earnings and employment.  This work allows novel assessment of how business conditions are perceived by workers and the differential effects on workers.  The Federal statistical system faces important challenges in renewing its workforce.  This project sponsored training in using techniques related to its findings, engaged in collaborative methodological research with researchers at the Census Bureau and other participants in the NSF-Census Research Network, and disseminated the project?s results via participation in conferences and scholarly publication.
