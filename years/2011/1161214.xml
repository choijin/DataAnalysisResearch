<AbstractNarration>This Type 1A project is working to increase the number of graduates receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM through focused recruiting, early academic support, and ongoing mentoring and student engagement. These activities build on existing support structures at the university and adapt effective practices from other universities to increase STEM enrollment and to reduce attrition among first- and second-year students. The recruiting efforts include evidence-based practices for non-traditional recruiting of underrepresented minorities through contact with parents, churches, and other community organizations. Early academic support features a five-week credit-bearing residential bridge program to address common deficiencies in mathematics, longitudinal learning communities to establish a system of major-oriented peer support, and peer-led supplemental instruction to improve student performance in key freshman- and sophomore-level introductory courses in the STEM programs. Ongoing mentoring and student engagement build on the university's prior success in placing students in undergraduate research positions and internships with university faculty and regional STEM-related employers. The STEP to Success Program is expected to increase enrollment of first-time freshmen in STEM majors by 20% and increase year-to-year retention by 10 percentage points, producing 16 additional STEM graduates per year by the end of the award period, including at least 10 per year from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its goal of establishing a lasting institutional infrastructure to continue its targeted recruiting efforts, early academic support, and provision of opportunities for student participation in research and internships. The project is exercising broader impact by working through an existing network of sister Historically Black Colleges and Universities to disseminate the results and findings of the project and offer training to faculty, administrators, and students at other institutions interested in replicating the approaches the project is finding most effective.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the Fall of 2012 West Virginia State University (WVSU) was awarded a Type 1A STEM Talent Expansion Program grant with specific aims to increase recruitment and retention within the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.  We identified five objectives, to accomplish both this task as well as supporting K-12 schools offering STEM courses.  By focusing on these objectives, WVSU?s STEP project has helped identify the needs of proper STEM recruitment and retention while also creating a pathway for long-term university historical memory in this area.  Two major initiatives were designed to help WVSU meet the grant objectives.  The first was the Summer Math Bridge program. This program was designed to help students will lower Math ACT scores boost their abilities before they enter the introductory courses in their chosen STEM field.   The second was a supplemental PEER instruction program where students could seek academic help via student lead study sessions. We have found that these two programs have helped us work towards several primary and secondary goals of the STEP initiative, including developing additional educational programs and creating additional resources in STEM recruitment and retention programs.  Although we believe that with continued support it could be successful, based on the results of the Summer Bridge Program, our goals were not fully achieved.  The Bridge Program was a 4-week residential math intensive program to assist students who have been academically under-prepared for college algebra.  We faced challenges in recruiting and retaining students into the Summer Bridge Program.  Our initial goal for the reporting period was 120 students (4 programs ? 30 students a year).  Unfortunately, after intensive recruiting efforts only 39 students signed up for the program for a 32.5 % recruitment goal.  The information and experiences learned from this program has allowed the University to develop a new Bridge program that focuses on developmental Math and English across the University campus.  The second program created was the supplemental instruction (SI) program.  SI is a peer-assisted academic support program utilizing study sessions to enhance student performance and retention.  Data indicates that in the SI courses, students who had attended sessions earned statistically higher final course grades with a higher completion rate. The STEP grant supported SI leaders for 50 STEM courses during the nine semesters, exceeding 3500 contact hours and serving over 1000 students in 970 SI sessions. The mean attendance among the students who took SI sessions was 7.28 sessions per semester and mean size for SI session was 3.55 students. The final course grade for SI participants was significantly higher than the other students with 82% of SI 10+ group students receiving a final grade of C or higher, compared to 63% of SI group attending less than 10 sessions and 47% of non-SI program participants.  The University also increased several retention activities to help struggling students through gateway STEM courses.  By looking at the data from our cohort, Counseling and Academic Support Services (CASS) identified additional resources that could help students through these classes.  Since many of our students struggle with financial difficulties leading to problems in textbook purchasing, CASS purchased one copy of all the textbooks needed for STEM classes and kept them on reserve in the TAPP room which is one of the tutoring office on campus.  These books have enabled students to complete homework or study for exams.  Additionally, the university now administers STEM area questionnaires to identify problems and provide relevant counseling support to students in need.  To assist area schools in STEM offerings the university worked with all 8 public high school in Kanawha County to recruit students who would like to take the General Chemistry or General Biology courses needed for majors in the STEM field.  The initial class saw 5 students complete one of these courses.  The grant paid for the books and tuition for these students so the program would not be cost prohibitive.  Of these students, three are completing their senior year in high school, one is pursuing a social science degree at WVSU, and one is attending college as un undecided major.  The STEP grant has been incredibly beneficial to both the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and West Virginia State University.  It has resulted in an increase in retention rates of STEM majors as well as an increase in recruitment activities.  This grant has been instrumental in providing additional resources to University students and increasing university awareness in area K-12 schools.  This increased awareness has come by hosting science activities on campus and trips by University staff to K-12 schools.   In this period, the University hosted the Regional Science Bowls, Chemistry Olympiads, ?You be the Chemist? competitions, and the ?Health, Science, Technology Academy?. Some of the recruitment activities have already become fully funded by private donors for long after the grant has ended.
