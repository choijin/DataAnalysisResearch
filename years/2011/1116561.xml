<AbstractNarration>PI: Donald R McCarty (University of Florida - Gainesville)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPI: Karen E. Koch (University of Florida - Gainesville)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborators: Carolyn Lawrence (Iowa State University/USDA-ARS) and Marty Sachs (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign/USDA-ARS)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A public resource for functional genomics of maize will be constructed by sequencing and mapping of thousands of transposon insertions in the maize genome.  By generating mutations in genes, transposons provide an important tool for dissecting the functions of maize genes.  The resource will be based on the UniformMu population.  UniformMu is a large inbred maize population developed specifically for transposon mutagenesis of the maize genome. Thousands of unique, heritable transposon insertions in the population will be mapped in the maize genome using Next Generation DNA sequencing technology. The precisely mapped insertions will be searchable online using the MaizeGDB.org genome browser and database tools. Insertions are linked online to high-quality, sustainable seed stocks distributed to the public without charge by the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center (maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu).  By achieving the following objectives the project will approximately double the size and genome coverage of the UniformMu resource:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Create sustainable seed stocks of 5,760 mutant enriched UniformMu F3 lines for the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Map the unique germinal transposon insertions in the F3 lines using Next Generation sequencing methods; and, &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;3) Enhance public awareness and accessibility of the UniformMu resource via MaizeGDB and the Maize Stock Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broad relevance of the UniformMu resource is founded on 1) the importance of maize to basic and applied biological research in the US; 2) the uniqueness of the UniformMu resource inside and outside the US as a tool for functional genomics of maize; 3) the breadth of expected usage by the research community including scientists working with other plant species; and, 4) the dissemination of the resource through established community and national resource centers (MaizeGDB, Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center and Genbank) ensuring long-term public accessibility and sustainability of the UniformMu resource. In addition, the project provides a rich training environment that engages diverse undergraduates and postdoctoral mentors in integration of large scale field genetics, transposon biology, next generation sequencing technology, bioinformatics and genomics methods.  The resource is accessible online at MaizeGDB.org and seed stocks are distributed by the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center (maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu). Consensus sequences used to map the transposon insertions are deposited in Genbank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UniformMu transposon resource was created as a research tool to help genetics researchers analyze functions of the thousands of genes in the genome of maize.  Maize (corn) is a highly productive crop essential to the agriculture and economy of the US.  Transposons are genetic elements that cause mutations by inserting into genes thereby disrupting their function.  By studying plants that have mutations in specific genes researchers are able to identify the genes that are important for grain yield, response to environment, disease resistance, tolerance to stresses, and many other important biological processes.    The UniformMu resource includes seed of over 14,000 individual genetic stocks.  Seed for each of these stocks was carefully prepared to ensure accuracy, quality and sustainability of the resource.  Information about each stock and the locations in the maize genome of 72,000 transposon insertions contained in the resource is readily accessed through MaizeGDB.org. These stocks provide transposon mutations in over 17,000 maize genes (about 43% of all genes).  Through links from MaizeGDB.org,  seed for these stocks is distributed free of charge to researchers around the world by Maize Genetics Cooperative Stock Center.   Broader impacts of project outcomes  One measure of the impact the UniformMu resource has had on maize genetics research is its widespread utilization by researchers.  Demand for UniformMu stocks has grown steadily since the first version was released in 2009.  By mid-2017, seed requests had been fulfilled for 1,754 users distributing &gt;27,000 stock.  Demand has continued to grow through the present.     In the course of building the resource, project scientists developed new tools and methods for efficient high-throughput mapping of transposon insertions in the maize.  To further enhance the accuracy of transposon map locations, project scientists participated in a successful collaboration to sequence the genome of the W22 inbred used to create the resource.
