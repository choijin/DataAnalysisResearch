<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue development and commercialization of a nano-engineered high capacity sorption media for removal and recovery of phosphorous from water. This media addresses issues caused by nutrient-related pollution, which significantly affects drinking water supplies, aquatic life and recreational water quality. Phosphorus comes primarily from agriculture and waste treatment sources, including on-site generated wastewater and is the limiting nutrient that usually controls eutrophication in temperate climates. Better, low maintenance/ lower cost approaches are needed to reduce discharge levels. In Phase I, the feasibility of a high performance phosphorous removal media was demonstrated, showing a sorption capacity that is significantly greater than other media reported in the literature. The feasibility of phosphorous recovery and media regeneration was also shown. In Phase II, the sorption of the media will be improved further and will be tested in both the laboratory and as add-on tertiary systems that will be designed, fabricated and operated in the field with the help of commercialization partners. Scale up of manufacturing and regeneration processes will be examined. Successful completion will lead to a superior phosphorous removal media and data required for commercial introduction of products that are needed for wide scale commercialization into the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that phosphorus originating from smaller on-site wastewater systems and water runoff from agricultural and other locations is becoming recognized as a major cause of impairment to streams and lakes and degradation of the water bodies like the Florida everglades. Efficient, low maintenance technologies are needed to reduce discharge levels and a lack of effective solutions exists today. Removing phosphorus is common at municipal wastewater treatment plants where chemical flocculation is available, but such approaches are impractical for dispersed sources of generated wastewater. Lower cost approaches are also desirable for these municipal treatment plants. This new media will have a much higher capacity and longer life. This will provide an economic alternative to mitigate the negative effects that phosphorous has on the environment and will offer ways for recovering the economic value of the phosphorous, a non-renewable resource that is necessary for food production and which is becoming limited in supply. Further development and optimization is warranted to move toward verification in field trials that will accelerate the commercial use of this new phosphorous removal technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Phosphorus is a naturally-existing element and a nutrient crucial to the life processes of plants and animals and is essential in the growth of crops.  However, phosphorus nutrients degrade water quality of streams, lakes and water bodies, especially in form of harmful algae blooms that cause eutrophication.   Phosphorus is manufactured from "Phosphate Rock" and declining reserves of this mineral creates an urgency to recover more phosphorus from waste water and other sources.   This SBIR project resulted in the development of a nano-engineered, highly porous ceramic media that can be used multiple times and has an exceptionally high capacity to sorb soluble reactive phosphorus (PO4) ions from water due to the high concentration of nano-iron oxyhydroxide sorption sites.  After saturation, these ions can be removed and recovered using mild chemicals to regenerate the media. Shapes can be made and assembled into modules for efficient hydraulic flow of water for sorption of PO4 ions. Capacity to remove phosphorus (P) is much higher than other natural or manufactured sorbents, often ten times more.    Phase II resulted in:  Further improvement in media performance Design requirements for P-removal systems were developed Efficient methods for media regeneration and P recovery were established Manufacturability of the media at larger scales were demonstrated Field testing to demonstrate performance occurred Media commercialization was initiated Chapter on phosphorus removal and recovery in Aquananotechnology: Global Prospects published in 2015 (edited by David Reisner and T. Pradeep)  Patents in US and in the EU and China Leveraged the NSF SBIR to obtain EPA SBIR on P removal at Municipal Waste Water Treatment Facilities and a USDA SBIR on P removal from agriculture runoff water.   Lab and field testing shows an excellent capacity to remove phosphorus at both high and low concentrations.   Removal below 0.1 mg/L is feasible, thus making it applicable for treating waste water from industrial, municipal, and on-site septic system, as well as removal at low concentrations in lakes and other water bodies.  Media can be regenerated using a mild base chemical to remove sorbed PO4 ions, which can then be economically recovered as a phosphate compound, thus providing an alternative source of recovered phosphorus removed from the environment.  During this program, processes were developed and scaled up for preparation of a porous substrate with high surface area (~15 m2/gram) used for growth of nano-iron crystals from surfaces.  This provides a high number of sorption sites to capture PO4 ions. Growth of nano-iron oxyhydroxide uses a multistep chemical modification process that was significantly improved during Phase II.  It can add over 10% Fe per gram of ceramic substrate, which can remove ~3,000 mg of PO4/gram of Fe.    Economic processes for regeneration of media were also developed during Phase II to remove PO4 ions and to prepare media for reuse.  Media is expected to last for more than 15 uses.  Because regeneration is relatively inexpensive, multiple uses of media significantly lowers the average cost and extends replacement life, often for years.  In summary, the media developed under this SBIR includes these benefits:  Holds much more phosphorus per kilogram than other sorption materials  Effective in removing P at  both high and low concentrations Can be reused multiple times  Flexible Shapes &amp; Sizes for system design  Long Life &amp; Cost Effective removal for many applications Phosphorus can be recovered as valuable by-product   Processes for making porous substrates, modification by growth of nano-iron crystals and media regeneration and recovery of phosphorus were scaled up from treatment of grams to production of kilograms of product, which is being marketed under the trade name PO4 Sponge&trade;.   Sales of product started for some small applications during Phase II and have expanded since.  Near term sales of over 100,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
