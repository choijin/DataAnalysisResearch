<AbstractNarration>Texas Southern University (TSU) will establish a CREST Center for Research on Complex Networks to address some of the most challenging problems of network science, network optimization and network control. The three research sub-project areas of the Center are (1) Energy Efficient Wireless Sensor Networks, which is to develop energy efficient schemes by integrating secured data aggregation and dynamic power management, investigating efficient multiple adaptation algorithms for uncertainty-aware sensor networks, and exploring dynamic control and optimization strategies; (2) Urban Transportation Environmental Networks, which is to develop and implement vehicle emission models and real-time intelligent network control methods to reduce greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions, thereby improving urban air quality; and (3) Distributed Computational Networks, which is to develop and implement algorithms for computing on networks for which the resource allocation is uneven. The research activities in the Center will involve the disciplines of computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering technology, environmental science, and transportation. They will be strongly integrated with the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education programs at Texas Southern. An critical outcome of the Center will be to increase the number of under-represented minority students who pursue advanced graduate degrees, contributing to meeting the future critical workforce needs of the Nation in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the Center will be the development of novel theoretical models, advanced simulation tools, and efficient physical test-beds for the study of complex networks through a multi-disciplinary approach. Moreover, the outcomes of the research will advance the knowledge of complex networks; integrate knowledge from diverse scientific areas to focus on the understanding of complex networks; and target their practical applications in real-world complex networks. The Center will have a transformative impact on TSU's effort to become one of the top research universities among Historically Black Colleges and Universities and will promote the University's collaboration with its partners from academia, industry, and government. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts that will result from the Center's activities will be an increase of the number of under-represented minority undergraduate and graduate students, including Ph.D. students, who will be motivated to pursue cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in STEM fields. Partnerships between TSU and leading research universities in the region as well as with national laboratories will be developed. The activities in the Center will enhance the existing Ph.D. program in Environmental Toxicology in the College of Science and Technology at TSU, and will develop a new Master's degree program in the multi-disciplinary Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) at TSU. Beyond these local broader impacts, the research of the Center will provide a knowledge base for the understanding of complex networks that could allow for the development and implementation of policies for global environmental sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
