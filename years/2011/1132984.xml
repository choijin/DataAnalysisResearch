<AbstractNarration>The Salton Trough is a critical structure where two very different styles of deformation meet; spreading-center dominated deformation to the south in the Gulf of California and dextral strike-slip deformation along the San Andreas fault system. Extremely high heat flow, young volcanism, shallow metamorphism and micro-seismicity led early researchers to interpret the southern Salton Sea as a buried spreading center with a NE-striking system of normal faults. To date, however, a critical portion of this system at the intersection between the San Andreas Fault with the Brawley Seismic Zone (BSZ) in the southern Salton Sea remains poorly understood, in large part, due to a lack of seismic imaging in the Salton Sea. To address this problem, the NSF has funded two projects, one a marine seismic study of the Salton Trough and the other an onshore study. These projects are highly complementary in that seismic signals from both onshore and offshore will be recorded by both experiments, but the deployments of airguns for the projects requires a boat of sufficient size to deploy the ocean bottom seismometers and safely operate the airguns. The project is scheduled to commence in March, 2011, and this award will provide funds for a suitable platform to carry out the project. The broader impacts of the combined projects include improved understanding of earthquake hazards in southern California and benefits to State of California studies of the Salton Sea, a research experience for a science educator through the California Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence (CACOSEE), and support for a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          Newly acquired active-source marine seismic data from the Salton Sea, California in 2012 help place important constraints on how strain is partitioned across the Imperial&ndash;San Andreas pull-apart system. Though previous high-resolution seismic CHIRP studies in the Salton Trough have revealed fault geometries that are similar to that seen in the northern Gulf of California and other pull-apart systems world-wide, new multi-resolution seismic reflection data in the Salton Sea show a more complicated system that includes both unexpected regions of transtension and transpression.  Most notably, a zone of transpression within the pull-apart basin proper, near the southern end of the San Andreas Fault, quickly evolves northward into a zone of transtension, with stratigraphic relationships highlighting a long-term, down-to-the-southwest component to slip on the San Andreas Fault.  Deformation associated with the Brawley&ndash;San Andreas pull-apart sub-basin appears to be rather short-lived with significant changes to present day fault architecture occurring ca. 20&ndash;40 ka. The evolution of basin architecture may be related to an ongoing northward propagation of the Imperial&ndash;San Andreas pull-apart system, with the southern end of the San Andreas Fault dying and giving way to a northward migration of the youthful (and transitionary) Brawley Fault.  The combination of multi-scale seismic reflection and seismic refraction provides insight into the evolving segment boundaries and the interplay of strain partitioning between these active fault zones.  The inherent complications within this system (i.e., zones of transpression and transtension) may also play a part in the communication of stress during earthquake triggering scenarios on the San Andreas Fault or other nearby fault systems, by either inhibiting or promoting dynamic or static triggering mechanisms during earthquakes.
