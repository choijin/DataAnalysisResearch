<AbstractNarration>Jackson State University, lead institution for the Louis Stokes Mississippi Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-MAMP) will continue to make a significant contribution to the nation?s science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce through the statewide alliance.   The LS-MAMP is a consortium of six (6) state supported universities (Alcorn State University, Jackson State University, University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi, Mississippi Valley State University), one private college (Tougaloo College); and a community college (Hinds Community College). &lt;br/&gt;The partnership will continue to implement and improve recruitment and retention strategies through community college bridge programs, synergistic scientific leadership development programs, global internship research programs, business, industrial and governmental (BIG) STEM internship programs, outreach programs, institutionalization programs, and other programs that will contribute to LS-MAMP?s systemic shared transformative (SST) vision.   The vision is to produce and increase the competitiveness and number of globally astute STEM graduates from historically underrepresented minority (URM) populations in the state and nation who are prepared to make a positive impact in graduate school and/or the workforce.   &lt;br/&gt;Through the LS-MAMP program, the number of highly competent, competitive, globally astute URM STEM graduates who are prepared to make a positive impact in graduate school and/or the workforce within Mississippi and the nation will be increased. Furthermore, through the LS-MAMP  Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program, alliance institutions will increase the number of STEM doctoral degrees to historically underrepresented minorities who will become well-qualified scientists, STEM faculty members, mathematicians, and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

Despite URM students? enthusiasm for and knowledge of the importance of a STEM education, many high school graduates do not pursue a STEM major as they have not acquired or been exposed to the tools necessary for success in these disciplines.
