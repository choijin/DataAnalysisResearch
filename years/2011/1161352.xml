<AbstractNarration>In problem-based learning models, such as scenario-based learning (SBL), learning activities are situated in contexts that resemble those students would encounter in the workplace.  Yet integrating scenario-based learning into the community college environment requires change and an understanding of the ways that this pedagogical approach can be adapted to meet the needs of the faculty practitioner.  Action research is used to engage faculty, under the guidance of professional researchers, in examining the challenges of implementing SBL instruction in technician education.  An online community of practice is developed by establishing a library of SBL resources and by linking to ATE centers and projects, initially in biology and bio-informatics.  Three prototype online wizards are developed and tested to support community college instructors in editing existing SBL activities, in creating new SBL activities and in creating principled assessments items using the ideas of evidence-centered design.  An advisory board of industry representatives and educational researchers in the fields of teaming, problem based learning and collaborative learning guide the development and validation of the scenarios.  The evaluation determines metrics to measure the extent to which the SBLs prove useful to faculty and students in technical education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Destination: Problem-Based Learning (DPBL) project at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno, Nevada (2011-2015) advocated for the scaling up of problem-based learning (PBL) nationally though (a) deepening our understanding of PBL in practice through faculty inquiry and research; (b) sustaining our work through communities of practice around PBL that support faculty-led efforts to expand the adoption of PBL in workforce education; and (c) spreading knowledge of how to implement, revise, assess, or create PBL curriculum materials and how to facilitate PBL workshops and build PBL community.  The broader impact of the project centers around the dissemination of quality PBL nationally, including the development of models, methods, and tools designed to support PBL faculty and students.
