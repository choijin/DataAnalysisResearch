<AbstractNarration>Wireless Internet Center for Advanced Technology (WICAT)&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1127960&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Wireless Internet Center for Advanced Technology (WICAT) sites at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU (lead), Auburn University, the University of Virginia, and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601.  The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Increasing demand for video services on handheld and other wireless devices has made efficient exchange of video data using wireless devices a necessity. However the continual changes in user demand, network traffic and hardware of the wireless environment pose significant research challenges to achieving this goal.  The proposed research seeks to address these challenges via a three pronged effort to explore wireless technologies able to adapt to changing communication system states.  A test bed environment for the conduct of the proposed work that will provide system surveillance and cloud computing infrastructure will be provided by Cisco Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient and seamless use of video on wireless platforms in the emerging cloud computing environment will have major economic impact in virtually all economic sectors.  Ubiquitous implementation and widespread adoption of these services will also create societal impact through the degree of communication it will enable.  The proposed work has the potential to inform and define approaches to achieving this video content integration.  The work has the potential to strengthen collaborative ties and link resources among the four participating center sites to further both research and education in this critical area.</AbstractNarration>
