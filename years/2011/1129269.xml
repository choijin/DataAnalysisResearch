<AbstractNarration>The University of Washington's Center for Information Assurance and Cybersecurity (CIAC) is supporting three cohorts of graduate students via a new Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program.  These students are mastering the new skills required for managing security in the cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located in one of the top twenty universities in the world, this existing academic program has already produced over 200 graduates in two Information Assurance (IA) programs. The SFS students are participating in research in partnership with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Cybersecurity directorate; an active Chapter of the Honeynet Project; and the Applied Physics Laboratory work on malware and botnets. Other strengths of the program include: five IA certificates; dozens of adjunct faculty-practitioners offering interdisciplinary cybersecurity courses across campus; and collaboration with Agora and Infragard (FBI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SFS project is having an immediate impact on the cybersecurity capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with expertise in the security of cloud computing and smart grids. More than 50% of the University of Washington student population is female and more than 30% is from ethnically  diverse groups; this diversity is reflected in the recruiting efforts. The Center's is actively engaged with organizations instrumental in developing the cloud, including Amazon, Boeing, Booz Allen Hamilton and Microsoft.  The program is uniquely positioned to specialize in the management of cloud security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  University of Washington's Scholarship for Service (SFS) program achieved its goal to develop a diverse team of out-of-the-box cybersecurity problem-solvers ready for government service who each mastered skills required for managing security in the cloud. The major program design elements included:  Cloud security focus Smart grid focus Interdisciplinary collaboration and curriculum design Working efficiently across domains (industry, government, academia), locally, regionally and internationally Impacting multi-dimensional diversity in CyberCorps.      Outcomes  Cloud Security: Students joined the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and several participated in developing cloud security guidance offered to membership and related research.  For example, students participated in the North American Team for Interpares IV, an initiatve focused on trust in the cloud, sponsored by the Social Sciences and Humanites Research Council of Canada and entitled "2012 Trust and Digital Records in Increasingly Networked Society."  Smart Grid: Students explored smart grid security from multiple perspectives.:one interned at Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL) during the year for the Assymmetric Resilient Cybersecurity program, focusing on code-level implementation for the project: Cyber Contingency Analysis Leveraging Power Grid Contingency Analysis Techniques for More Resilient Cyber Networks. Others built a solar array and industrial control systems lab with students from 2 other campuses and 5 colleges. Another studied with NATO at Talinn University, developing malware for the Locked Shields exercise[1] .  Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Mentored by an interdisciplinary faculty--computer science, economics and engineering--students graduated from four different degree: MS Security Engineering, MS Information Management, MSCS, Master in Infrastructure Planning and Management.    Additionallly they expanded their knowledge taking: 1) The award winning UW Information Security Risk Management certificate.  2)  The Friday Seminars program. Summer prepared them for graduate studies; Fall for the Job Fair;. Winter they studied specific technologies, leveling understanding among between technology and policy students; Spring they learned research methods preparing them to think critically, resulting in academic publications and presentations.  Working across domains: Advantaged by being in the epicenter of commercial development of cloud computing, students had opportunities: to participate in collaborative learning: working on smart grid projects at Bonneville Power and PNNL and interning with CSA, Fraunhofer Darmstadt Germany, and T-Mobile--giving them hands-on experience that made them "government-employment-ready,."  Impacting multi-dimensional diversity: 45% of the cohort were women and minorities  (3 women, 3 Native American/Pacific Islanders, 1 African-American and 1 Asian-American). Students also had diverse experience;  some were recent college graduates, some mid-career professionals, one a senior enlisted veteran transitioning into a civilian career.      Academic Contributions and Systemic Implications  Students made contributions to cloud security, digital forensics, and smart grid technology collaborating with American, Canadian and German researchers. The Drs. Popovsky?s KBP Pedagogical Model for IA Curriculum Development was validated through application to tthe development of job-ready SFS students and is described in ACM Inroads[2], This has since been replicated with additional populations of mid-career professionals, graduate students and transitioning military  with the intention of expanding the supply of ?breach-ready? cybersecurity professionals able to perform on-the-job immediately upon hire.        Professional Placements - Success Stories  All students who completed the UW SFS program have found employment in government. Six are employed by MITRE, three teach cybersecurity at the University of Washington (UW) and North Seattle Community College. Two work at UW in cybersecurity analysis and research. The remaining six work at DHS, FTC, TSA, NSA, PNNL and the City of Seattle, respectively.  Aaron Alva finished his Law degree in addition to the SFS-funded MSIM degree. He was named a Fellow at the FTC where he works on legal policy related to cybersecurity.   Upon completing a paid internship at the City of Seattle, MIPM graduate Ginger Armbruster became the City?s first Privacy Program Manager responsible for developing policies, implementing the program and briefing the Seattle City Council.     Sean Chung has had several promotions at MITRE and recently won a prestigious award for technical contribution.     Key Outcomes and Achievements  Our goal was to develop out-of-the-box cloud security cybersecurity professionals. Our graduates are gainfully employed in government positions and all have received promotions and recognition. As a result of the SFS grant, UW CIAC has established strong, on-going relationships with industry and government through our collaborative education approach.
