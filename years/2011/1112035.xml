<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Charles G. Riordan at the University of Delaware to carry out fundamental studies on the reaction of nickel complexes with dioxygen.  Using ligand design and chemical synthesis strategies, new nickel-superoxo, -alkylperoxo and -hydroperoxo complexes are sought.  The geometric and electronic structures will be defined by applying a range of spectroscopic methods.  Reactivity of the new molecules with exogenous substrates susceptible to oxygen atom transfer and C-H activation will be explored in an effort to correlate structure with reactivity.  Complementary efforts are aimed at garnering evidence for high-valent oxonickel intermediates.  These studies require that student coworkers develop intellectual breadth in synthetic and mechanistic inorganic chemistry and molecular alternative energy.  They further afford students the opportunity to collaborate on advanced spectroscopic measurements with colleagues at the Universities of Wisconsin-Madison and California-Davis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal-mediated oxygen activation is a central process in Nature as well as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  The development of new reagents using abundant, i.e. cheap metals, for stoichiometric and catalytic oxidation of organic molecules remains a significant challenge.  The fundamental studies of this project will provide insight into how to harness the redox attributes of nickel for these chemical transformations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Metal complexes facilitate a wide range of chemical reactions that are of import to biology, chemistry, human health, agriculture, the environment and energy.  Fundamental understanding of the basic principles that govern these reactions is key to bringing about advances that impact these fields.  This project focused on the utility of nickel complexes to activate oxygen, sulfur and selenium (collectively referred to as chalcogens).  In a bioinspired approach, in which we sought to apply lessons learned from Nature, the nickel complexes were designed to interact with the chalcogens generating new metal complexes.  These new materials were carefully and fully characterized and then, used to activate hydrocarbons.  In doing so, we sought convert the hydrocarbons to higher value, oxidized chemicals.  Specifically, a well-characterized nickel-superoxo complex, broadly reminiscent of the oxygen carrying molecules in human blood, was shown to effect interesting and novel oxidations of organic molecules.  Detailed experimental studies provided insight into how reaction proceeds revealing a new pathway for metal-superoxo reactivity.  Similarly, a nickel-selenium complex was prepared and shown to activate the carbon-hydrogen bonds of certain molecules.  The unprecedented transformation portends the opportunity through further research to install selenium into hydrocarbons.  This program provided a rich environment for the education and training of the next generation of STEM professionals.  Students, (undergraduate and graduate) including four women (3 graduate and 1 undergraduate) were exposed to discovery and hypothesis based experimental science, which including professional development in communications, environmental health and safety and research integrity.
