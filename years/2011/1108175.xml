<AbstractNarration>Given the importance of dogs to northern culture and their intertwined relationship to humans, this research project is designed to address questions related to the timing and spread of dogs from Asia to Alaska and Canada/Greenland and the development of local breeds. Using modern genetic methods to extract DNA from tooth and bone remains from well dated archaeological contexts in combination with radiocarbon-dating and analysis of recent samples, the PIs propose to (1) Provide a detailed temporal-spatial analysis of dog remains across the North American Arctic, (2) analyze the genetic history of prehistoric, contact period, and modern Arctic dogs using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the Y chromosome, and (3) contribute to anthropological and archaeological discussions concerning the movements and cultural interactions of indigenous peoples across the north.</AbstractNarration>
