<AbstractNarration>Networks-on-chip (NoCs) are an on-chip interconnection fabric of choice for general-purpose chip multiprocessors and application-specific multiprocessor systems-on-chip. This project focuses on network-on-chip modeling and optimization to enable early-stage design exploration that fully elaborates the achievable envelope of NoC power, area, speed, reliability and cost.  An architectural estimation thrust develops new architecture-level estimation methods that are portable to different router microarchitectures and that can accurately capture implementation effects.  The thrust addresses the automatic generation of architectural estimation models, the modeling of chip design implementation flow choices and their impacts, and new trace-aware and workload-dependent estimations.  An architectural optimization thrust develops new methodologies for trace-driven optimization of router configurations, packet routing and network topology, with consideration of runtime network resource contentions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will help network-on-chip and multiprocessor system-on-chip designers reduce design effort while improving chip area, delay and power metrics. This will be enabling to the efficient design of more complex, higher-functionality integrated-circuit products within given cost and power limits. The research will also produce software tools to establish a foundation for further work by other research groups.  Through research participation, both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in this emerging aspect of system-on-chip design.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main outcomes of this research are described as follows.     (i) Floorplan Optimizer for Silicon Photonic NoCs  Many-core chip architectures are now feasible, but the power consumption of electrical networks-on-  chip does not scale well. Silicon photonic NoCs (PNoCs) are more scalable and power efficient, but  floorplan optimization is challenging. We have proposed a more comprehensive,  cross-layer optimization of the silicon PNoC and core cluster   oorplan. Our simultaneous placement  (locations of router groups and core clusters) and routing (waveguide layout) considers scheduling  policy, thermal tuning, and heterogeneity in chip power profiles. The core of our optimizer is a  mixed-integer linear programming formulation that minimizes NoC power, including (1) laser source  power due to propagation, bend and crossing losses; (2) electrical and electrical-optical-electrical  conversion power; and (3) thermal tuning power. Our experiments vary numbers of cores, optical  data rate per wavelength, number of waveguides and other parameters to investigate scalability  and tradeoffs through a large design space. This work is published in DATE-2014.     (ii) Tuning and Workload Allocation policies for Silicon Photonic NoCs  We have extended work in by adding new thermal tuning and workload allocation policies.  New contributions in this paper include FreqAlign, a thermally aware policy that reduces the  frequency mismatch between ring resonators in a PNoC, in conjunction with an accompanying  Adaptive Frequency Tuning (AFT) policy. We showed that together, these two policies can reduce  the frequency gradient between ring resonators by 50 ?? 60% when compared to existing workload  allocation policies. The policies resulted in reduction of average (max) thermal tuning power of  14:93W (30:21W). This work is in submission to TCAD.     (iii) Flattened 3D Mesh: Network Diameter Reduction via Virtual 3D Routing  Two-dimensional mesh-based Networks-on-Chips (NoCs) have been  widely proposed for the interconnection of cores in tiled-multiprocessor architectures. Although  they are scalable in size, their effectiveness at global communications significantly diminishes with  the increasing diameter of these networks for two reasons: First, the worst-case number of hops  between two communicating cores grows linearly with the network diameter.   Second, the bisection load of the network also increases linearly with the network diameter, which  correspondingly diminishes the network capacity and effective throughput. We have proposed a  flattened 3D mesh by dividing a 2D mesh into four quadrants and interconnecting them into a  virtual 3D stacking arrangement by means of hyperlinks.   The proposed virtual 3D stacking significantly reduces the network diameter,  which significantly improves both the latency and the effective throughput.     (iv) QoS-Aware Memory Controller using Single-Tier Virtual Queuing  Heterogeneous MPSoCs have been widely deployed for mobile  devices to reduce power while improving system performance. Unfortunately, memory requests from different   cores can interfere with each other,  and this memory interference between cores is a critical impediment to system performance.   We have proposed a new memory controller architecture with single-tier virtual  queuing (STVQ) for multiple heterogeneous cores. Rather than maintaining separate per-source  transactions and per-bank command queueing stages, our proposed architecture only maintains  one queueing stage, with a QoS-aware scheduler for scheduling this single queue stage. Four  major components reside in the STVQ controller: single-tier virtual queues (VQ), a bank arbiter, a  transaction scheduler and per-bank command generators. The main idea is to maintain a set of per-  bank virtual queues for each source. The QoS-aware scheduler then directly matches source memory  transactions to memory banks for command generation.
