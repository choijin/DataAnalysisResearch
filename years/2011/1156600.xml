<AbstractNarration>This award supports a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at the University of Texas Brownsville.  The site includes a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) component.  The REU and RET site will focus on research in frontier areas of phenomenological, experimental and applied physics at state of the art facilities. In gravitational wave astronomy students will be given a coherent unified view of the field and learn the scientific value of both the potential wealth of astrophysical information to be obtained from this new astronomical window and of the challenges posed in developing the technological expertise necessary at the instrumental level in opening this new window. In photonics they will learn of the challenges and promises that this fast evolving discipline holds for new electronics. In biophysics participants will be exposed to state of the art techniques in one molecule spectroscopy and in investigations in the role of amino acids in protein structure and function. In materials science they will learn about thermoelectric materials and their potential use for renewable energy.   In addition, this summer research experience for undergraduates will have a close mentoring and guidance system from the faculty in place during the entire duration, fostering interaction and active participation by students through seminars, lunch meetings, colloquia and presentations.  This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the summers of 2012, 2013 and 2014 a total of 37 undergraduate students and 9 teachers participated in the The University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) Department of Physics and Astronomy  REU and RET programs. Thirteen of the undergraduatestudents were from UTB and 24 from institutions across the country.  Fifteen of the participants were women (11 REU and 4 RET, total 32.6%) and twenty three were underrepresented minorities (15 REU and 8 RET, total 50%).  This group included one active military participant and one community college student.  In addition 4 volunteer summer research students participated in the program activities, including three local high school students.  REU students have come from Brigham Young-Idaho, Cal State-Long Beach, Dickinson College, Duke University, Florida State, Harvey Mudd College, Illinois Wesleyan University, Rice University, Rutgers University, San Antonio College, Southwestern University, St. Mary's College of Maryland, The University of Chicago, University of Alaska-Fairbanks, University of Maryland, University of Mississippi, University of Oklahoma, University of Pennsylvania, UT-Austin, UT-Dallas, UT-El Paso, and UT-Pan American.   Each participant in the program produced a paper and poster based on the research they conducted.  Many of the students presented their work at regional and national conferences and or published their results in journals.   A workshop on ethics and communication was offered for the students as part of their training and professional development.   Several of the students have been accepted at graduate programs in physics thorughout the country. The teachers who participated  expressed having obtained significant benefits from the experience,   which they feel have empowered them in the classroom. All these High School teachers serve a student population that is more than 90% Hispanic American. One of these wrote to the PI of the project an appraisal of her experience that is worth reproducing:  "In the summer on 2014, I was a teacher in the RET program.
