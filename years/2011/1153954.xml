<AbstractNarration>The project is a collaborative program of research, education and training based on the Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI) Workshop and the Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling (GSMM) Camp.  These annual meetings, held during successive weeks in June, attract mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from academic institutions and from indusry.  University participants include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty.  The focus of the MPI Workshop is a set of problems brought by contributing participants from industry.  These problems span a wide range of areas of applications, often in fluid and solid mechanics but also in mathematical biology, data analysis, and mathematical finance, among others.  Recent problems have included, for example, mathematical models for electromagnetic wave interactions with nanostructures, mathematical problems related to drawing of glass sheets, medical ultrasonic imaging, and automatic defect recognition in industrial inspection applications.  The work on the problems is done in vertically integrated teams consisting of the representatives from industry, senior and junior faculty, postdocs and graduate students.  The scientific objective of the activity generated by the Workshop and its intellectual merit is the study of mathematical problems of significant interest for industrial applications.  The GSMM Camp is held during the week prior to the Workshop, and graduate students attending the Camp also attend the Workshop.  The main objective of the Camp is graduate student education and training.  At the Camp, graduate students work together in teams, with the guidance of invited faculty mentors, on interdisciplinary problems typically inspired by industrial applications.  The problems are carefully chosen to promote a rich set of problem-solving skills, both analytical and numerical, and to provide a warm-up for the difficult problems considered at the Workshop.  The two meetings complement each other and form a comprehensive program of interdisciplinary research, education and training that is unique amongst universities in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is an ongoing effort organized by the principal investigators at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, University of Delaware, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and New Jersey Institute of Technology.  The MPI Workshop has run annually for the past 26 years with the principal aim of promoting research and education in applied mathematics and of developing links between academics and industry for the mutual benefit of both sides.  For the past 8 years, the research and educational activities of the Workshop have been enhanced by the introduction of the GSMM Camp.  In addition to these established meetings, the project involves a number of new activities associated with the Workshop and Camp designed to further advance the research and educational objectives of the collaborative program.  These activities include the introduction of a graduate student fellowship program, support for early-career mathematicians to attend the meetings, and the development of a graduate student exchange program in cooperation with the Oxford Center for Collaborative Applied Mathematics.  Overall, the Workshop and Camp, and its associated activities, have a broad impact on the education and development of early-career mathematicians, and on the interdisciplinary research and educational activities of participating faculty.  The Workshop also promotes collaborations with industry and has an impact on the development and analysis of new technologies in industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant has supported three yearly cycles of the Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling Camp and the Mathematical Problems in Industry Workshop, held at the University of Delaware, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and New Jersey Institute of Technology.  The Camp and Workshop have fostered a number of very productive interactions among industrial researchers and faculty and graduate students in the mathematical sciences.  The unique combination of training through mentorship and real-world problem solving has inspired a new cohort of graduate students to apply their skills to problems inspired by industrial processes, and has brought academic faculty and industrialists together to shed light on difficult and highly-relevant problems.  This grant has produced four published journal articles, with another submitted and two more in preparation. Websites for each of the three MPI Workshops provide free access to all reports.  The Principal Investigators have delivered or participated in four research talks at conferences on topics directly related to the GSMMC and MPI Workshop, in addition to three outreach talks, and have invited two other Workshop participants to give professional development seminars at NJIT on the use of mathematics in industry.  The PIs have participated in similar meetings held in the UK and Argentina to share best practices.  The intellectual merit of the activities supported by this grant lies in the difficult challenge of organizing a Camp-Workshop system that is both pedagogically effective and scientifically relevant.  Proof of the first is offered by the large number of prior GSMMC students who now participate regularly in MPI either as academic faculty or as industrial researchers.  Proof of the second is found in the fact that MPI has several companies that are eager to return each year with new challenges, looking for new and innovative solutions.  The funded activity has several broader impacts, beginning with the introduction of a large cohort of students to the important role mathematics has to play in a vital industrial sector.  These students are highly sought-after graduates after passing through the GSMMC/MPI system, and are poised to add significant value to the US economy.  At the same time, the industrial participants benefit directly from intensive analysis performed on their problem during the week of the MPI Workshop, and often afterwards through ongoing collaborations.  The companies participating in the Workshop range from small high-tech firms to large multinational corporations, and their engagement with the GSMMC and MPI represents an important model for partnership between industry and academia to develop the human capital necessary for high-quality jobs to be filled by PhDs from US institutions.
