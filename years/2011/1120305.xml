<AbstractNarration>This project will examine neural circuits that make up a unique region of the insect brain, called the central complex, and will study its role in guiding the insect as it turns to move around barriers. This large midline brain region appears to be involved in processing large amounts of sensory information, then using it to influence movement. The Ritzmann laboratory will employ a range of electrophysiological and behavioral techniques to examine how central complex circuits process mechanical and visual information from antennae and eyes and to identify the neurons that perform these functions. Regions of the central complex will then be reversibly inactivated with local anesthetics to examine their effects on behavior. The results are critical to our understanding of how brain systems influence complex movements. They will complement recent advances in motor control stemming from neurogenetic techniques from several other laboratories. Indeed, because similar interactions between higher brain systems and local reflexes exist in virtually all legged animals, including vertebrates, the results will have wide ranging neurobiological impact. Moreover, the PI has a long-term commitment to bringing knowledge of biological systems to the design of legged robots. As such, the project should also lead to more advanced robots that can move autonomously through tortuous terrain with less direction from a driver. The project will continue the PI?s successful record of training both graduate and undergraduate students and extend this opportunity to pre-college students. Undergraduate and pre-college students will have the opportunity to work directly with graduate students and other senior laboratory personnel on the project under the direct guidance of Dr. Ritzmann. This arrangement generates a unique opportunity for novices to experience research while providing mentorship experience for the senior personnel.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Under this grant we were able to advance our understanding of how neural circuits within a prominent region of the insect brain respond to visual and mechanical stimulation, use that information to identify navigational cues and ultimately direct leg movements. We developed techniques for recording from the central complex (CX) in restrained, tethered and freely behaving cockroaches. Using this technique we found that CX neurons respond to wide field visual cues. We presented moving stripes to the insect and found some neurons that responded during the entire time that stripes were presented (tonic cells), while others just fired a burst at the onset or termination of the presentation. Tonic neurons responded differentially to right and left moving stripes. These effects could be used in an optomotor response where an insect would turn its body when presented with moving stripes in an attempt to stabilize its visual field. To test this we examined the cockroach&rsquo;s turning response to moving stripes. We then injected procaine into the CX. This local anesthetic silences neurons near the injection site but only for about 20 minutes. During that time, the optomotor response was eliminated but then returned as the procaine effect wore off. We also established that mechanical stimulation of both antennae are combined but in a complex manner suggesting that both excitation and inhibition are present from each antenna.&nbsp;</p> <p>The visual experience can be used in navigational tasks as the insect moves through a complex environment. To that end, we tested whether head direction or compass cells similar to those found in the rat hippocampus are present in the CX. After implanting electrodes in the brain of a cockroach we mounted the insect on a computer controlled turntable in the center of a darkened arena (Fig. 1). The only visual cue was a white cardboard landmark. The turntable rotated the insect 30 degrees then paused for 10 second. This was repeated until an entire circuit was completed 5 times. It was then repeated in the opposite direction. Activity was recorded during the 10 second stationary period and compared at each angle relative to the white card. Finally we moved the landmark card and repeated the entire experiment. We found many neurons that had enhanced activity at specific angles relative to the landmark (Fig. 2A and B). When the landmark was moved to a new location, the preferred direction often shifted with it (Fig. 2B). It also persisted if the landmark was removed, suggesting that these cells &ldquo;remembered&rdquo; the preferred direction (Fig. 2C). Moreover, these and other cells seemed to recall the direction through which they were rotated. That is, neurons were found that responded much stronger to clockwise rotations than counter-clockwise (Fig. 3)</p> <p>Finally, we tested the motor consequences of CX neural activity. In both tethered and freely moving insects, we found neurons that fired at enhanced levels just before a cockroach altered its movements (Figure 4).These data allowed us to develop motor maps of forward speed verses left and right rotations. By examining many cells in several animals, we found neural populations that were associated with specific maneuvers (move forward rapidly, turn to the right rapidly, turn to the left slowly) (Fig. 5). Stimulation in those same regions evoked similar movements. This suggests that population codes exist in the insect brain that direct changes in movement. Moreover. we could move the insect with the electrodes in place to a preparation dish where specific leg reflexes could be tested with and without brain stimulation. We found that brain stimulation altered reflexes consistent with expected changes in turning.</p> <p>These findings greatly advance our understanding specifically of the role of the CX in complex behaviors such as navigation. Moreover, it contributes to a greater understanding of interactions between higher brain centers and local control in all animals, including vertebrates. Finally, it has the potential to promote the development of bio-inspired robots that capture the complex behaviors of intact normally behaving animals. To that end colleagues in the CWRU engineering department have developed a praying mantis robot that uses visual signals to control altered leg movements through reflex reversals exactly as we demonstrated in the cockroach. Through the course of this project, we trained four PhD students (two completed their dissertation and one will do so this year), two postdoctoral researchers and three undergraduates who worked with the senior personnel.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/16/2016<br>      Modified by: Roy&nbsp;E&nbsp;Ritzmann</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120305/1120305_10117697_1474037386042_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120305/1120305_10117697_1474037386042_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Setup for Head Direction Experiments"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1120305/1120305_10117697_1474037386042_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Setup for Head Direction Experiments"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fig. 1.
