<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences contribute funds to make this award. This award supports theoretical research and education in the field of molecular mechanisms of protein nucleic-acid interactions. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and proteins are some of the fundamental molecules of living systems. In a living organism they perform their biological function based on their interactions with each other. The overarching goal of the research under this award is to develop theoretical models of the complex phenomena resulting from these interactions. The research will be in close collaborations with experimentalists resulting in immediate feedback between model building and experiments and thus leading to a deep understanding of the biological phenomena of interest based on molecular mechanisms. There are three specific phenomena that will be studied:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. As cells repair damage to their DNA they have to clear the stretch of DNA to be repaired from associated proteins such as transcription factors and histones. For DNA mismatch repair this is the function of the protein complex MSH2/MSH6 which forms a sliding clamp on the DNA in the vicinity of a mismatch. Quantitative models developed under this award will reveal the detailed molecular mechanism underlying this clearing of DNA through binding of MSH2/MSH6.&lt;br/&gt;2. When retroviruses, such as HIV, infect a cell, they use a special protein to 'soften' the secondary structures of their RNA genome and enable several molecular processes that are necessary for successful host infection. Under this award a quantitative model will be developed to explain how nucleocapsid and similar RNA binding proteins change the secondary structure of RNA molecules and its dynamics and how these structural changes affect the processes necessary for retroviral infection.&lt;br/&gt;3. RNA molecules can be threaded through protein and artificial nanopores that are so small that only a single strand of the molecule can pass through them. Thus, the secondary structure of these molecules has to unravel in order for the molecule to pass through the pore. This makes nanopore translocation experiments a unique vehicle to study RNA secondary structure kinetics. However, this requires molecular scale models of RNA structure kinetics and interactions with the nanopore which will be developed under this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and educational activities will provide a highly interdisciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students through various avenues such as direct involvement in the research and participation in biophysics courses and seminars. The scientific impact of the models developed under this award will be maximized by incorporating these models into existing or newly developed web servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences contribute funds to make this award. This award supports theoretical research and education in the physics of biological molecules. There are three major classes of molecules that life is based upon, namely proteins, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and lipids. These different types of molecules have their distinct roles, but in order for a living cell to function they all have to work together. The research under this award specifically focuses on the interplay between proteins and nucleic acid molecules. The overarching goal is to develop theoretical models of the complex phenomena that arise as proteins and nucleic acids interact. These models in turn will allow the interpretation of experiments and enable a deep understanding of diverse biological phenomena. The specific phenomena of interest here are how cells correct errors in their DNA in order to avoid cancer, how retroviruses (such as HIV) infect a host cell, and how RNA molecules pass through minuscule holes and reveal their dynamical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and educational activities will involve training graduate and undergraduate students at the frontiers of research at the interdisciplinary interface between the life and the physical sciences. All projects will be performed in close collaborations with experimentalists thereby providing a unique training environment to the students involved in the research. In addition, the models developed in the course of this research will be disseminated through interactive web pages in order to enable their utility to as broad a group of users as possible.</AbstractNarration>

While proteins and the two nucleic acid molecules have their specific roles, they achieve their biological functions only when working together.  The purpose of this project was to build theoretical models of the interactions between the two nucleic acid molecules and proteins. These models allow us to better understand the molecular mechanisms through which cells use these biopolymers and to interpret biophysical experiments probing these mechanisms.  The ultimate goal of such detailed understanding of molecular mechanisms is to be able to recognize and eventually treat deficiencies manifesting themselves in terms of diseases on this molecular level. In this context, we developed two different models:  First, we developed a model that describes the interplay between RNA structure and protein-RNA interactions. RNA is made in a cell by copying the information from individual genes within an organism's genome.  RNA is a polymer made from four different bases that attract each other and form intricate folded structures.  These structures are often very important for an RNA to perform its biological function and methods to predict these structures given the sequence of the four bases in a given RNA are well established.  However, most RNA molecules do not perform their biological function by themselves but they interact with many proteins during their lifetimes.  For the type of proteins we studied here, a protein binding to the RNA prevents the bases to which it binds from attracting other bases.  Thus, binding of proteins and the formation of RNA structures affect each other.  The computer models we developed in this project allow us to understand this interplay between RNA structure and proteins.  We can predict where on an RNA proteins bind, how easily they bind, and how the structure of the RNA changes as they bind.  Most excitingly we found out that the binding of one protein at one place on the RNA can actually make it easier or harder (depending on the RNA and the protein) for a second protein to bind at another place on the RNA, i.e., not only do the RNA and the proteins interact with each other but it appears as if the proteins interact with each other through the RNA.  This could play a role in how a cell internally processes information, an idea that we now pursue in follow-up studies.  Second, we investigated the interactions between DNA-bound proteins and DNA.  When the DNA of a cell gets damaged, a molecular configuration called a mismatch is generated.  Since DNA damage is dangerous for the cells and eventually will lead to cancer, cells have mechanisms to repair such mismatches.  The first step of repair is the clearance of a long stretch of DNA around the mismatch from other proteins that bind DNA and might interfere with the mismatch repair machinery.  It is believed that this clearance of the surrounding DNA is performed by a specific protein that forms a "sliding clamp" at the mismatch and then passively slides back and forth on the DNA.  We suspected a while ago that the mechanism by which these sliding clamps can clear the DNA at some distance from the mismatch is by forming what is known as a "Tonks gas".  The mathematical idea of a Tonks gas is 70 years old and it is known that a Tonks gas can exert a force along the one dimensional object it lives on, in our case a DNA molecule.  In order to find out if this is really what these DNA repair sliding clamp molecules are doing, we developed theoretical models of how many sliding clamp molecules should be attaching to a specific piece of DNA and how this should affect the binding of proteins called transcription factors to this piece of DNA.  Our experimental collaborators then performed the corresponding experiments and we found that the models provide a very good description of the observed experimental data.  We thus now established that the mechan...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
