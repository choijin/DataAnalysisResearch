<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to investigate the feasibility of new game-based software in which youth play the roles of adult professionals.  This approach has demonstrated the potential for raising knowledge of and interest in civics and the local community for young people, many of whom are not being reached by traditional curricula. Civic epistemic games are collaborative, interactive games in which young people use sophisticated technologies to learn to think in innovative and creative ways about complex problems. But to realize the potential of these games, the software requires extensive customization for local conditions and to meet district and state standards.  The approach in this effort is to focus on an industry-standard social media platform to quickly develop a game that can be tested for traction among the youth market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While platforms are currently being developed for the rapid prototyping of educational multiplayer games for augmented reality, these games involve limited-duration problem-solving exercises placed in narrative frameworks drawn from entertainment gaming, and often feature activities that mimic but do not reproduce professional practice. As well, they are not scaled for large groups of learners. Epistemic games, in contrast, are based on simulations of complex thinking practices--they are authentic recreations of the activities by which professionals learn to solve complex problems. But bringing epistemic games into classrooms requires development and distribution platforms that can host integrated curricula up to 15 weeks long and reach potentially millions of simultaneous users. Early indication from large education-systems providers indicates that there may be a significant market opportunity associated with this effort.  If successfully deployed, this effort will address the youth market for educational games and provide a new platform for civic engagement.</AbstractNarration>

Simply Volunteer encompasses all three phases of a comprehensive volunteer management and recruitment system. A social media front-end will attract younger volunteers whose lives are oriented to social media; allow them to personalize and share opportunities with friends; geo-check to automatically log their volunteer activity; earn badges and rewards in a game-like atmosphere; and build a personal volunteering profile that is portable through a lifetime.
