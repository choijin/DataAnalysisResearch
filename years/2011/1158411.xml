<AbstractNarration>This project establishes a new virtual institute, Wireless Innovation between Finland and US (WIFIUS), for promoting and sustaining mutually-beneficial research and education collaborations between US and Finland in the area of wireless networks. The institute provides an environment for creative international collaboration that  leverages the synergies and resources for research and education in the two countries in order to accelerate the rate of development of research innovations and the development of talent and work-force capable of excelling in the a new highly interconnected world. The objectives of the institute are to: (1) facilitate and support existing and new international research and education activities in the broad area of wireless networks, (2) enable sharing of knowledge and cross-fertilization among the participants of various relevant international projects, (3) enable sharing of expertise with emerging experimental platforms, standards and wireless technology policies in the two countries, and (4) facilitate and support interaction between academia, industry and government agencies of the two countries. The proposal also describes the activities and mechanisms that will be adopted in order to achieve these objectives. The technical focus of the institute is on wireless spectrum efficiency technologies, which intellectually aligns along the interests of researchers in the two countries, as well as the countries' national priorities. The institute employs a number of activities including: (a) a web portal that provides services and content to participants, (b) physical and virtual PI meetings, (c) physical and virtual student investigator meetings, (d) yearly summer schools and (e) graduate student exchange.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This 2-year project is one of the first three awards made under the inaugural round of NSF Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) program funding in 2011. The objective of this SAVI is to facilitate the creation of a community of international researchers and educators between US and Finland in the area of wireless cognitive radio networks. This was accomplished through the support of virtual and physical meetings, workshops, panels, collaborations, student/visitor exchanges, and summer schools.  Following yearly workshops that were open to the community, and after the usual rigorous peer review process at NSF, several awards (total 11) were made by NSF in 2012 and 2013 for US-Finland collaboration, with the Finnish funding provided by Tekes Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation and The Academy of Finland.  The key activities accomplished in this project include: (a) regular virtual meetings for all the principal investigators (PIs), (b) a yearly physical meeting in 2012, 2013 and 2014, all open to the entire research community, and attended by representatives from each project, (c) yearly jointly-taught summer schools in 2012, 2013 and 2014, for undergraduate and graduate students in the US and Finland (d) several special technical sessions at conferences, including CROWNCOM 2012, CROWNCOM 2013, CROWNCOM 2014, and VTC 2015, and (e) a public web site at http://www.wifius.org for consolidating and sharing WiFiUS events, activities and material.  WiFiUS facilitated the creation of an international research community that contributed significant results in the area of cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access. Dynamic spectrum access and cognitive radio technologies are the enabling technologies for broadband Internet access, including to rural areas, and to the proliferation of Internet technologies. They are also a key component of the future generation of wireless e.g. 5G, technologies.   The results include (a) theoretical results on interference management and resource allocation, as indicated by over 100 publications in technical society peer-reviewed conferences and journals, (b) measurement facilities, including distributed spectrum observatories in the US and Finland, (c) hardware prototyping, including multi-antenna and reconfigurable antenna systems, and (d) simulations and demonstrations of cognitive radio capabilities.   WiFiUS enabled the training of undergraduate and graduate students by offering free summer school opportunities. The SAVI also facilitated the exchange of international students and faculty for training the next generation of students who can operate in international research teams, required in today's connected world. A US summer school participation involved more than 40% from under-represented groups. The SAVI project facilitated the exchange of expertise of using various facilities, and utilization of complementary laboratory facilities at the participating institutions.   Due to the success of this WiFiUS SAVI project, NSF created a new NSF program with the same name starting in Fall 2014 (NSF solicitation #14-563).
