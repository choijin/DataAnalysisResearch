<AbstractNarration>Researchers at the American Association of Variable Star Observers, the Living Laboratory at the Boston Museum of Science, and the Adler Planetarium are studying stereoscopic (three-dimensional or 3D) visualizations so that this emerging viewing technology has an empirical basis upon which educators can build more effective informal learning experiences that promote learning and interest in science by the public. The project's research questions are: How do viewers perceive 3D visualizations compared to 2D visualizations? What do viewers learn about highly spatial scientific concepts embedded in 3D compared to 2D visualizations? How are viewers' perceptions and learning associated with individual characteristics such as age, gender, and spatial cognition ability?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project personnel are conducting randomized, experimental mixed-methods research studies on 400 children and 1,000 adults in museum settings to compare their cognitive processing and learning after viewing two-dimensional and three-dimensional static and dynamic images of astronomical objects such as colliding galaxies. An independent evaluator is (1) collecting data on museum workers' and visitors' perceived value of 3D viewing technology within museums and planetariums and (2) establishing a preliminary collection of best practices for using 3D viewing technology based on input from museum staff and visitors, and technology creators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatial thinking is important for learning many domains of science. The findings produced by the Two Eyes, 3D project will researchers' understanding about the advantages and disadvantages of using stereoscopic technology to promote learning of highly spatial science concepts. The findings will help educators teach science in stereoscopic ways that mitigate problems associated with using traditional 2D materials for teaching spatial concepts and processes in a variety of educational settings and science content areas, including astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Researchers at the American Association of Variable Star Observers, the Living Laboratory at the Boston Museum of Science, and the Adler Planetarium studied stereoscopic (three-dimensional or 3D) visualizations as a tool for science learning. The first study focused on stereoscopic slide shows for children. In an experimental study, they found no difference in children&rsquo;s ability to perceive spatial elements in scientific imagery shown either in 2D or in stereo. However, children who saw images consistently in stereo did show more detail in their subsequent drawings of the images. In a second, semi-experimental study, adults were shown astronomy films in either 2D or stereo. Researchers found no difference in science learning between the two presentation formats on an immediate post-test. However, in an identical post-test given six months later the stereoscopic group scored consistently higher than the 2D group., suggesting that stereoscopy can contribute to better long-term learning. Both studies controlled for the novelty effect that can increase audience excitement about viewing stereoscopic content. An analysis of these studies, plus other resent scholarship on stereoscopic learning, suggests that stereoscopy by itself shows little advantage over 2D imagery and should be used for specific applications in education. Specifically, it should be used for showing highly spatial, complex data that needs to be recalled over time. Also, the researchers suggest a set of stereoscopic design principles that content creators could use to maximize learning with stereoscopic visualizations. Those principles are: gradually adjust viewers to the stereoscopic presentation format, respect stereo discipline (use stereo only when needed), utilize pictorial depth cues (shadows, etc.) and minimize other sources of cognitive load. An independent evaluator studied the use of stereoscopy by museum staff and also best practices for conducting research of this type in museum settings.
