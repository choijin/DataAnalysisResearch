<AbstractNarration>This NSF award to Princeton University funds U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by the G8 Research Councils Initiative on Multilateral Research through the Interdisciplinary Program on Application Software towards Exascale Computing for Global Scale Issues. This is a pilot collaboration among the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Canadian National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), the German Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR),and the United Kingdom Research Councils (RC-UK), supporting collaborative research projects selected on a competitive basis that are comprised of researchers from at least three of the partner countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fusion of light nuclides forms the basis of energy release in the universe, which can potentially be harnessed and used as a clean and sustainable supply of energy on Earth.  In order to build the scientific foundations needed to develop fusion energy, a key need is the timely development of an integrated high-physics-fidelity predictive simulation capability for magnetically confined fusion plasmas.  An associated central physics challenge is understanding, predicting, and controlling instabilities caused by the unavoidable spatial variations (gradients) in a magnetically-confined thermonuclear plasma. One consequence is the occurrence of turbulent fluctuations (microturbulence) which can significantly increase the transport rate of heat, particles, and momentum across the confining magnetic field in a tokamak device such as ITER --  a multi-billion dollar international experimental device being built in Cadarache, France and involving the partnership of 7 governments representing over half of the world?s population.  Microturbulence can severely limit the energy confinement time for a given machine size and therefore it?s performance and economic viability. Understanding and possibly controlling the balance between these energy losses and the self-heating rates of the actual fusion reaction is key to achieving the efficiency needed to help ensure the practicality of future fusion power plants.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate calculations of turbulent transport are vitally important and can only be achieved through advanced simulations. The current U.S. project uses ab initio particle-in-cell (PIC) global (3D) codes to solve the nonlinear equations underlying gyrokinetic theory with excellent scaling to more than 100,000 processor cores having already been demonstrated. It is planned that these codes will be deployed at the two supercomputing centres involved in this G8 project (Argonne National Laboratory in the U.S. and Juelich Supercomputing Centre in Germany), where state-of-the-art HPC systems are operative.  In order to move in a timely manner to producing  simulations with the highest possible physics fidelity, it is expected that computing at the exascale will be necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of computational fusion research ? an integrated predictive simulation capability that is properly validated against experiments in regimes relevant for practical fusion energy production.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ G8 NuFuSE NSF Project Outcome Report 1128080      Submitted  By:     William Tang &ndash; Principal Investigator        Title:  G8 Initiative:  G8 Research Councils Initiative on Multilateral Research Funding     Objectives:  The overall goal of the G8 NuFuSE Project was to significantly improve computational modelling capabilities that enhance the predictive capabilities needed to help build the scientific foundations required to develop fusion power.  In order to address key physics challenges commensurate with "path to exascale" progress in supercomputers, we focused on delivering new high-physics-fidelity predictive simulation capability for magnetically-confined fusion energy (MFE) plasmas.  An associated goal was to help contribute to producing a new interdisciplinary international community of fusion scientists capable of utilizing modern HPC resources at the extreme scale to help accelerate progress in understanding fusion grade plasmas.  Significant Results:   New results delivered by our NSF-supported G8 NuFuSE project deals with new physics findings in the core region of the plasma -- with the key result that more efficient confinement may be achievable in large burning plasmas such as ITER.  For over a decade, both experimental observations and theoretical simulations of turbulent losses of fusion-grade tokamak plasmas have indicated that energy confinement degrades as the size of the tokamak increases in the  so-called "Bohm regime." However, these earlier simulations have also predicted that for sufficiently large tokamaks there will be a turnover point into a "Gyro-Bohm regime," where the losses become independent of system size.  For burning plasma devices such as ITER, it is of key importance that systems can operate in this favorable Gyro-Bohm regime.  A modern gyro-kinetic code (GTC-P) capable of utilizing world-leading HPC platforms &ndash; such as the  "Mira" and "Sequoia" BG/Q supercomputers in the U.S. and the "K-computer" in Japan &ndash; has been developed by the Princeton-University-led team to achieve unprecedented phase-pace resolution enabled by successfully running on over 1.5 million processors. Associated physics studies in the plasma core region have been carried out with the discovery that the magnitude of turbulent losses in the Gyro-Bohm regime can be up to 50% lower than indicated by earlier much lower-resolution simulations and that the Bohm to Gyro-Bohm transition is much more gradual as the plasma size increases.  This finding was made possible only after going to high-resolution, long-time scale simulations needed to achieve the physics fidelity enabled by computing at extreme scales.   Associated Award:  The International Data Corporation (IDC) announced during the SC'13 Conference that William Tang (Princeton U/PPPL), Bei Wang (Princeton U), and Stephane Ethier (PPPL) have received a "High Performance Computing (HPC) Innovation Excellence Award" for using high-end supercomputing resources to carry out advanced simulations for the first time of confinement physics in large-scale magnetic fusion energy (MFE) plasmas with unprecedented phase-space resolution and long temporal duration to deliver important new scientific insights.  This research was enabled by the new GTC-Princeton (GTC-P) code, developed to use multi-petascale capabilities on world-class systems such as the IBM BG-Q "Mira" at DOE-SC's Argonne Leadership Computing Facility and NNSA's "Sequoia" at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, http://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/idc-announces-winners-hpc-innovation-excellence-awards/, (November, 2013).  Broader Impacts:  It can be concluded that the key findings from the G8 NuFuSE Project have also made an impact on other disciplines because the associated accomplishment represents a clear example of how computing at extreme scale &ndash; an area of broad interest to the general scientific community &ndash; can lead to important "discovery science" in an accelerated manner t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
