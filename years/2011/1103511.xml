<AbstractNarration>In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter (protons and neutrons) represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of large backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. However, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the galaxy, yielding a day-night modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. Of current searches with directional detectors,  the Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment is a leader, having a decade of experience. The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in DRIFT's unique and powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These advances in background rejection, combined with the fact that further limit setting capabilities are hampered by the small volume of DRIFT-II, suggest that DRIFT should scale-up. This award will enable the collaboration to continue running DRIFT-II in the Boulby mine in England. In addition to running DRIFT-IId, these funds will provide hardware for a second detector, DRIFT-IIe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work include the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of hardware and software experience. Finally, the DRIFT detector technology has promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the DRIFT collaboration is the detection of halo dark matter with a directional signature.  The requirements for this search are quite stringent.  The detector must have low threshold, be completely free of backgrounds at low energy and be low pressure to see the directional signature.  With support from the National Science Foundation this goal has been achieved by the DRIFT-IId detector.  There is no detector on the planet with DRIFT-IId's powerful capabilities.  Two amazing features were added to the detector during the course of this proposal.  First the collaboration invented a texturized, submicron, aluminized Mylar cathode to reduce our worst background, radon decays on the cathode.  Second work at Occidental discovered a new mode of operation for TPC detectors.  The additional of a small amount of oxygen to our gas mix created different species of drifting ions which allow for the complete removal of our only known background.  Our most recent results are completely background-free at low energy threshold and with proven directional capabilities.  We have not seen any candidate events but our sensitivity is 3500x times better than our directional competitors.  Additionally we have used the detector to measure the incredibly low flux of neutrons in the underground laboratory where we do our work.  This has practical applications across a broad range of areas.  DRIFT will continue to explore the potential of this unique technology.
