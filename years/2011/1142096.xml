<AbstractNarration>The McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica are among the coldest, driest habitats on the planet. Previous research has documented the presence of surprisingly diverse microbial communities in the soils of the Dry Valleys despite these extreme conditions. However, the degree to which these organisms are active is unknown; it is possible that much of this diversity reflects microbes that have blown into this environment that are subsequently preserved in these cold, dry conditions. This research will use modern molecular techniques to answer a fundamental question regarding these communities: which organisms are active and how do they live in such extreme conditions? The research will include manipulations to explore how changes in water, salt and carbon affect the microbial community, to address the role that these organisms play in nutrient cycling in this environment. The results of this work will provide a broader understanding of how life adapts to such extreme conditions as well as the role of dormancy in the life history of microorganisms. Results will be widely disseminated through publications as well as through presentations at national and international meetings; raw data will be made available through a high-profile web-based portal. The research will support two graduate students, two undergraduate research assistants and a postdoctoral fellow. The results will be incorporated into a webinar targeted to secondary and post-secondary educators and a complimentary hands-on class activity kit will be developed and made available to various teacher and outreach organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Early investigations of McMurdo Dry Valley (MDV) soil bacterial communities yielded only a handful of unremarkable bacterial isolates, leading to the conclusion that these soils were essentially sterile. However, with the application of molecular biology techniques to investigate MDV soil biodiversity, a surprising bacterial richness has been revealed.  This apparent discrepancy has led us to question how such a high level of microbial diversity could exist in the MDV.  Could this bacterial richness be essentially illusory, perhaps a relic of bacterial cells deposited with dust?  We detemined if bacterial cells were growing in Antarctica soils by incubating soil samples in the field with heavy  18O-water. When cells divide they synthesize new DNA and some of the 18O atoms from the water will be incorporated into the new DNA. Therefore the production of 18O labeled DNA is compelling evidence that bacteria are growing in MDV soils.  After 30 days of incubation, we detected 18O-DNA in our samples.  Labeling of DNA was sufficient to separate labeled DNA from non-labeled DNA in an ultracentrifuge.  The labeled DNA was analyzed and we were able to identify the microbial populations that grew.  Not all bacterial populations detected through standard DNA sequencing analysis grew and these may be populations that blew in on storms from other continents.  We manipulated  Carbon, Nitrogen, and salt concentrations in our incubations and found that these manipulations had a strong impact on which populations grew.  Salt, in particular, depressed growth of many bacterial populations in MDV soils.  However, we did detect a salt specialist, named Herminiimonas sp., capable of robust growth in cold saline soils.  There are several important applications of research into bacterial populations that can grow in cold, saline and low carbon environments, including astrobiology and industrial microbiology.
