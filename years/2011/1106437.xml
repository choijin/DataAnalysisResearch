<AbstractNarration>Clusters of galaxies can be used to constrain cosmological parameters such as the cosmological constant and are an important probe of dark matter and dark energy.  However, their use in these roles is limited by their remaining systematic uncertainties in such nonlinear thermal and nonthermal processes, such as cosmic rays and magnetic fields. This project is focused on using advanced adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) N-body computer simulations with physics constrained by multiwavelength observations.  The principal investigator used previous NSF funding to develop the framework to support these investigations using the Enzo computer code.  In the proposed project, Cloudy, a new radiative cooling computer software module, will be combined with three different models for distributed heating---star particles, massive galaxy constructs, and active galactic nuclei.  These additions to the simulations will help provide more realistic modeling of cluster evolution that will improve our general understanding of cluster properties, such as biases in current mass estimation and limitations of using clusters as probes of precision cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on previous NSF-funded work on developing code to simulate cluster evolution.  The proposed more advanced simulations will lay important and timely groundwork for interpreting upcoming Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect, weak lensing, radio, and X-ray surveys.  The proposed work will do an excellent job of closely matching simulations with observations in the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray portions of the spectrum.  This work is at the forefront of such investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator offers several ways to extend the impact of this project.  Educationally, (1) a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student will participate and be mentored in the project, and (2) modules will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework to teach such physical principles as large scale structure formation and turbulence in the Universe.  For public outreach, cosmological simulations will be incorporated into public planetarium programs locally and freely distributed nationally to other planetariums.  Finally, the principal investigator will make the developed software modules publicly available to the benefit of the entire scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Clusters of galaxies are important laboratories for the study astrophysical plasma processes on scales associated with the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe (hundreds of millions of light years).  Such properties include heating (via feedback from giant black holes in the nuclei of central galaxies), cooling, turbulence, cosmic ray acceleration, and magnetic field amplification.  Our NSF-sponsored project studied new approaches for simulating these plasma processes using advanced computer codes and comparison with observations.  Our primary simulation tool, called Enzo, was enhanced during this study to include new algorithms for cooling and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD, evolution of magnetic field within the plasma fluid that fills the spaces between galaxies in clusters).   We applied the results from these new simulations to X-ray and radio observations of two nearby galaxy clusters.  A new technique for producing high fidelity temperature maps from X-ray data (from the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites) was applied to clusters Abell 85 and Abell 3667.  For the case of Abell 85, we discovered very hot regions in the vicinity of cluster-subcluster mergers indicating the presence of mildly supersonic shocks consistent with our findings of cluster evolution from our Enzo supercomputer simulations.  For Abell 3667, we investigated the properties of a "cold front" within the intracluster gas which also suggests recent merger activity.  Further out from the cluster center is a double "radio relic" probably created during the collision of a smaller cluster with the main body of Abell 3667.  The combination of the X-ray and radio data allowed us to probe the shock statistics over a wide radius in the cluster; the resulting distribution of Mach numbers agrees well with our numerical simulation.  Finally, we examined a set of 12 cosmological MHD simulations from Enzo so we could characterize the nature of the nonthermal and thermal properties of the intracluster gas; there is a significant difference in the gas velocity anisotropy for clusters with and without ongoing mergers but surprisingly little difference in the magnetic field properties.
