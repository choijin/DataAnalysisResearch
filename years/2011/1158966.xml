<AbstractNarration>The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Amanda I. Banet to work with Dr. Scott G. Hinch at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, sockeye salmon have experienced temperature and water velocities during migration that are higher than their historical average.  This project examines the influence that the maternal environment during migration has on offspring swimming ability in migratory sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Recent work shows that sockeye salmon females that are physiologically stressed upon arrival at spawning grounds produce offspring with impaired swimming performance, which in turn can reduce migration success and make them more vulnerable to predation. This research disentangles the effects of maternal identity, external environment (migration conditions), and internal environment (stress hormones in utero) on offspring swimming performance by using offspring reared from females that experienced natural migrations, simulated migrations, and simulated maternal hormone treatments. Three main hypotheses are addressed: (1) High levels of maternal stress have persistent negative effects on offspring swimming performance, (2) maternal effects on offspring performance have an environmental component, and (3) deleterious maternal effects are exaggerated under stressful conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines genotype by environment interactions and intergenerational effects in a rapidly changing habitat. Maternal effects are widely recognized in biology, but few studies have examined them in the context of changing climate and anthropogenic habitat degradation. Results from this project will contribute to the fields of evolutionary biology, ecology, conservation biology, and physiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional management and conservation of migratory fish populations has relied primarily on facilitating reproduction. However, if deleterious maternal effects caused by a difficult migration environment persist into the next generation, then conventional recovery programs may not be enough to ensure the continued health and sustainability of a species. The results of these studies will provide information that will be invaluable to environmental managers making decisions affecting aquatic migratory species.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research examined how natural and anthropogenic stressors affect the survival, reproduction, physiology, and behavior of Pacific salmon.  A previous study showed that Pacific salmon females that are physiologically stressed upon arrival at the spawning grounds produced offspring with impaired swimming performance, which in turn could reduce offspring migration success and make them more vulnerable to predation.   The differences found in that study could be because the offspring of stressed females were exposed to high levels of maternal stress hormones early in development, but the design of the study allows for alternative explanations.  For example, it is possible that the females had genetic differences in swimming ability that made some less equipped to deal with the demands of migration, and these genetic differences in swimming were passed on to their offspring.  This distinction is important because it has implications on how to best manage and conserve these fish.  To disentangle genetic vs. hormonal effects on offspring swimming performance, this work collected eggs from several species of female Pacific salmon at the end of migration and exposed a subset of eggs from each female to the stress hormone cortisol in order to simulate high levels of maternal stress. Eggs were then fertilized, reared to fry, and put through a series of swimming performance trials. By comparing closely related siblings that either had or had not been exposed to high levels of cortisol, we were able to examine the effects of the hormone exposure while controlling for genetic background.  The main findings of this study show that:  Pacific salmon exposed to high levels of the stress hormone cortisol early in development have poorer aerobic performance later in life.  Aerobic performance is important because it affects growth rates, migration success, survival, and future reproduction. Exposure to cortisol early in development has no effect on fish schooling behavior. Exposure to cortisol early in development has no effect on egg survival from fertilization to hatch, regardless of incubation temperature.   Traditionally, the management and conservation of migratory fish populations has relied primarily on facilitating reproduction. However, this work shows the negative effects of maternal stress can persist into the next generation through a reduction in offspring aerobic performance, which can in turn affect the growth, survival, and reproductive success of the next generation.  The results of this study suggest that conventional recovery programs may need to take into account the intergenerational effects of stress in order to ensure the health and sustainability of Pacific salmon.
