<AbstractNarration>The Carolina Cyber Defender Scholarship program is jointly offered by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, NC A&amp;T State University, and Johnson C. Smith University. This program prepares students to become intellectual leaders in cybersecurity. Students can pursue baccalaureate, masters as well as doctoral studies.  Scholarship students engage in rigorous academic programs that emphasize both theory and practice of cybersecurity and incorporate research and experiential learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each scholarship student is required to contribute to one of many cutting edge research projects led by experienced professors and develop capabilities in critical thinking, problem formulation and problem solving. The program has a rich set of extracurricular activities including frequent seminar speakers from industry and academia as well as participation in national and international hands-on cybersecurity competitions. Professional development, including effective communication as well as leadership, is emphasized. The curriculum covers a broad spectrum of cybersecurity topics including network security, configuration security, penetration testing, software assurance, data privacy, mobile and wireless security, usable security, access and identity management, computer forensics, policy and governance, security risk management, and cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholarship program is aimed at creating a cadre of diverse cyber security professionals to address the nation's critical need for talent in key national security as well as critical infrastructure protection positions.</AbstractNarration>
