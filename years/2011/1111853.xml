<AbstractNarration>The Himalaya?Tibet orogenic system has been the subject of extensive research for decades, and continues to be a fruitful laboratory for understanding orogenic processes and continental evolution. Geological and geophysical studies have provided important insights into the structure and dynamics of the modern system, but imparted less information about the orogen?s early development, and the characteristics of the colliding continents that may affect subsequent evolution.  The goal of this project is to investigate how crustal and lithospheric thickness changes in southern Tibet in order to establish the ?boundary conditions? for the India-Eurasia collision (~50 My ago) and how lithosphereic thickness changes during and after collision.  As pointed out by the PIs, lithospheric thickness defines the thermal state and rheology of the crust and lithosphere, which are important boundary conditions and properties necessary for understanding the nature of crustal and lithospheric deformation during collision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will integrate geochemistry, geochronology, paleoelevation, seismology, tectonics, and modeling to understand the pre-collision structure and evolution of the leading edge of the southern Asian continental margin ? the Lhasa block ? and its role in controlling the development of the broader orogen.  They seek to answer two sets of related questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? How has the crustal thickness of the Lhasa block evolved from collision to the present?&lt;br/&gt;? How have the elevation and denudation histories changed through time?&lt;br/&gt;? What role does metamorphism play in altering crustal rheology and density and as a consequence   facilitate surface uplift and erosion?&lt;br/&gt;? What is the contribution of lithospheric deformation to thickening of the region?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of questions is relevant because of the way crustal thickness and surface elevation can influence the mechanics of an orogen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second set of related questions addresses the later evolution of the Lhasa block:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? What is the origin of post-collisional magmas?&lt;br/&gt;? To what extent has melting contributed to crustal weakening and flow?&lt;br/&gt;? How have magmatic and aqueous fluids and lateral heterogeneity in their distribution influenced evolution and deformation of the Lhasa block?&lt;br/&gt;? Why are elevations in the Lhasa block relatively uniform despite considerable variations in geology, exhumation, and deep structure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of these questions derives from the control that rheology and its spatial&lt;br/&gt;variations play in determining how orogens deform at large and small scales.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rocks exposed in the Lhasa region of Tibet provide an archive of materials that were formed and processed over the last ~50 million years since initiation of tectonic collision of the Indian and Asian plates.  In this project, we collected rock samples in this region over multiple field campaigns to provide materials amenable to analyses using geochemistry, geochronology and thermochronology.  Our objectives were to use these observables to study process of continental collision, and the region?s past evolution in crustal thickness, surface elevation, topography, and mass flow associated with extrusion, erosion, and melt redistribution.  The Berkeley Geochronology Center component of this project focused on the past development of topography using low temperature thermochronological methods involving the (U-Th)/He parent-daughter system.  This work was carried out by collaborative teams of Ph.D. students and faculty across several institutions and internationally.  Intellectual merit: By quantifying continuous cooling paths of rocks between ~400 oC and 40 oC through geologic time using thermochronology, we constrained the evolution in past depths of rocks now exposed at the surface.  Exhumation of rocks is directed related to past erosional and tectonic processes.  We found that there was a rapid change from very high exhumation rates from ~20-15 million years, to very low rates during the last 15-10 million years in the Lhasa region, and very little exhumation since. This finding has important implications for how the Himalayan mountain belt to the south evolved, and how the river drainage network in the Lhasa region may have evolved in response to the uplift of the Himalaya in response to congoing continental collision.   Broader impacts: Results of our work have been presented in international meetings and published in peer-reviewed publications. This work supported the training of a UC Berkeley Ph.D. student who has become an expert in applications of low-temperature thermochronology to study topography development through geologic time, and who is now developing her own research program as an assistant professor at a leading research university.  This project also helped establish international collaborations in China with the PIs and graduate students. Our work has shown how geochemical methods can complement geophysical and geodynamic methods to help understand how continental collisions evolve over millions of years.
