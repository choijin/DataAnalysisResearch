<AbstractNarration>Our research addresses the collapse of a civilization and the consequences of deforestation in the tropics.  The ancient Maya reached a high population density, deforested much of their environment, and caused significant soil erosion in southern Mexico and northern Central America by about 800 AD. In the next century their civilization declined over large areas, with populations reduced by 90% in some regions. Our goals are to: 1) understand the interactions between the ancient Maya and their environment that contributed to the collapse of their civilization in northwest Belize, Central America, and 2) to assess the impact of ancient Maya land use, ending 1200 years ago, on the present environment. To do this we will study archaeology, geology, and ecology at the same research sites and overlay the results to reveal connections among ancient land use, ancient impacts on soil and topography, and the present soil characteristics and tree species composition of a tropical forest. We will work in an area where there was a variety of intensive ancient Maya land uses, but where there has been little disturbance since the collapse of the Maya and the re-growth of the forest beginning c. 1200 years ago, which means that the footprint of the ancient Maya in our study area should be more evident than in other places.  The study will be carried out in the 250,000-acre Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area, administered by the Programme for Belize (PfB), a Belizean conservation organization, and be conducted under the auspices of the PfB Archaeology Project, operated by the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Humans increasingly affect the planet, for example, by deforesting the landscape and accelerating soil erosion.  These changes could lead to "tipping points", when ecosystems suddenly change radically and no longer support agriculture, provide adequate water, or otherwise supply human needs. Scientists need to study these impacts and suggest how to mitigate the present changes and prevent future tipping points. But we can also learn by studying tipping points reached in the past, such as the collapse of the ancient Maya described above. To understand that collapse we are combining social science (archaeology), geo-science, and ecological science to study past events at sites of ancient Maya civilization in present-day Belize. Archaeologists in our team will study past land use. Geo-archaeologists will study past topography and soils. Ecologists will study past and present forest environments. Our work is guided by a model connecting ancient land use, deforestation and soil erosion, consequences for the environment, and responses by the ancient Maya to these landscape changes. In addition to understanding past events we are interested in the long-term consequences of ancient deforestation for the present-day forests. The similarities and differences between ancient deforestation (after which the modern, fairly diverse forest re-grew in Belize) and modern deforestation could provide clues to the consequences of modern land use and provide recommendations for improved use. Another goal for us is to create a model collaboration between social, geological, and biological scientists for the study of the ancient Maya and the modern forest, and that can be a general model for studying and managing environmental problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ THE ANCIENT MAYA AND THE MODERN FOREST  Research  The research goals of our project were to determine 1) the effect of ancient Maya land use on the modern forest in Belize, and 2) to judge from the modern forest how use of the landscape could have supported the Maya.  In the southern Maya lowlands (southern Yucatan, Belize, and northern Guatemala) the Maya civilization flourished until about 900 AD, at which point the Maya went into steep decline.  The Maya had cleared or otherwise intensively managed most of the landscape.  After the decline forest re-covered the land, and much of that regrown forest has remained undisturbed to the present.  Given the tremendous changes in tropical forest environments in the past several decades, it is valuable to learn about long-term effects of forest removal and regrowth by studying the modern "Maya Forest".  For our first goal, to determine the effect of ancient Maya land use on the modern forest in Belize, we formed a team of archaeologists, geo-archaeologists, and ecologists to study a large area of forest in Belize that is underlain by abundant remains of the Maya but has not been disturbed since ancient times.  The task of the archaeologists has been to map ancient Maya land uses in the study area.  The task of the geo-archaeologists has been to determine the impact those land uses on soils and topography in the study area.  The task of the ecologists has been to determine the impact of the ancient soil and topography changes on the modern, regrown forest in the study area.  Soil and topography significantly affect forests, because different tree species are adapted to different types of soil and topography; so any change in those variables attributed to the ancient Maya should be registered in the present distribution and abundance of different tree species.   The study was carried out in 200, 400-square meter plots in two study areas in the Belize forest.  In these plots we quantified ancient land use, soil and topographic characteristics, and tree species composition.  All three types of resulting data &ndash; ancient land use, effects on modern soil and topography, and modern tree composition &ndash; are being compared to evaluate correlations among the data sets and determine possible causal links from ancient land use to modern forest.  For our second goal, to judge from the modern forest how use of the landscape could have supported the Maya, we have evaluated how variable the present soil and topography are, to suggest how a spatially fine-tuned approach to agriculture could have exploited this variability.  The modern Maya use a fine-tuned approach that the ancients probably used also.  We are still analyzing much of the data, but we do have valuable preliminary results.  First, the Maya remains on the landscape suggest there was a great variation in land use in the study areas.  Second, our study of dated layers in soil visible in excavated soil pits suggest that the Maya caused much erosion and thus altered soil and topography.  Third, our studies of trees show that tree species composition depends greatly on soil and topography.

Above all, our research has shown that to understand the modern environment we need to understand history.  Likewise, to understand history, we need to understand ecology.  The National Science Foundation funded our work, in part, to demonstrate the value of interdisciplinary research.  Indeed, we have shown that there is a productive mutualism between ecology and history.   Education and conservation  Many undergraduate and graduate students participated in this research, doing field and laboratory work.  The principal and co-principal investigators presented the research in talks to undergraduates and to a Kiwanis group.  The ecological research was described in a popular article in the magazine Scientia.   Identification of organisms is the basis for research and conservation; one must know what organisms exist in an area to then learn about patterns and processes on which to base research and conservation plans.  Therefore, the ecologists produced a field guide to trees of the study areas.  The guide was the basis of a 2.5-day workshop in Belize on tree identification, presented by the ecologists.  The workshop was attended by 11 Belizeans involved in environmental education, forestry, and/or conservation.
