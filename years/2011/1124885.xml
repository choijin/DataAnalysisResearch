<AbstractNarration>Wesley Allen of the University of Georgia is supported by an International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) award in the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms program of the NSF Division of Chemistry for a joint theoretical/ experimental study of hydrogen tunneling in carboxylic and amino acids. The research is performed in collaboration with Professor Peter R. Schreiner of the Justus-Liebig University of Giessen, Germany.  The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) is the partner agency supporting the German side of the collaboration.   &lt;br/&gt; Chemical reactivity is conventionally understood in broad terms of kinetic versus thermodynamic control, wherein the driving force is respectively the lowest activation barrier among the possible reaction paths or the lowest free energy of the final products.  Very recent breakthroughs in the preparation and characterization of hydroxycarbenes (R-VC-VOH) have demonstrated that quantum mechanical tunneling is a third driving force that can supersede traditional kinetic control and govern reactivity based on nonclassical penetration of the potential energy landscape intervening reactant and product.   The Allen and Schreiner research groups investigate the role of hydrogen tunneling in the conformational dynamics of organic compounds of biological significance, namely, -Ñ-keto carboxylic acid (1) and -Ñ amino acid (2) paradigms. For this purpose, matrix isolation experiments in Germany are joined with high-level ab initio theory in the United States. &lt;br/&gt; This ICC award supports wide-ranging, innovative activities that comprehensively address NSF broader impacts criteria. The professional training and intellectual development of graduate students is a key mechanism for broader impacts, and thus the project revolves around Ph. D. students in American and German research groups that are ethnically diverse and strongly international in character. Theory students will travel from Georgia to the German laboratory for immersion in the experimental environment.  Likewise, German students will visit Georgia to experience the realm of high-level theory. Advanced computational methods resulting from the theoretical research will be freely shared with the scientific community via the PSI electronic structure package. Undergraduate research projects involving computational applications of tunneling methods will be undertaken with the aid of the Ph. D. students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          Quantum mechanical tunneling, whereby a molecular system passes through an energy barrier that it could not overcome classically, is a mystifying but established phenomenon.  In chemical reactions tunneling is generally thought to play only a secondary role as an enhancement of over-the-barrier processes. The underappreciation of tunneling mechanisms is witnessed in modern organic chemistry textbooks, which barely mention the subject. In particular, rotational bond isomerizations via tunneling are neglected in explaining conformational changes. However, recent studies of hydrogen tunneling under very large barriers (even up to 30 kcal/mol), as well as heavy-atom tunneling, have initiated broader recognition of tunneling as a decisive effect.            To cement the idea of tunneling control of chemical reactions as a third distinction next to classical kinetic and thermodynamic control, numerous processes must be documented that are dominated by the tunneling mechanism and would not otherwise occur to any appreciable extent.  The Schreiner group found recently that even the simple benzoic acid molecule undergoes a conformational isomerization rapidly by tunneling; it is surprising that such a fundamental process had not been documented before.  With such key findings in hand, this international collaboration was undertaken to combine matrix-isolation experiments in Germany with high-level theory in the United States to study some essential naturally occurring carboxylic and amino acids. Of course, the conformational behavior of amino acids is paramount in determining the properties of proteins.  The NSF part of the collaboration supported the Allen group in the application and development of definitive ab initio quantum chemical methods for investigations of potential energy surfaces, reaction mechanisms, and tunneling rates. The cutting-edge focal point analysis (FPA) techniques applied in the project employed the highest possible levels of electronic structure theory to compute relative energies and anharmonic vibrational frequencies, inter alia, typically to accuracies of 0.1 kcal/mol and 5 wavenumbers, respectively.           Some of the key outcomes of the research are as follows:  (1) Establishment of a heretofore unseen domino tunneling mechanism in oxalic acid, in which higher energy conformers cascade downward exclusively by quantum tunneling until the ground-state conformer is reached. This work was published in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 7828-7834.  (2) Theoretical analysis of the domino-tunneling matrix-isolation experiments by means of an exact coupled kinetic model involving multiple conformers existing in different matrix sites and simultaneously interconverting by tunneling at different rates. Global, nonlinear fits of all infrared bands simultaneously provided a rich source of parameters to unravel the tunneling phenomena.  (3) Exhaustive, high-level quantum chemical computations on the amino acid serine that discovered a total of 85 unique conformers. The lowest 12 conformers fall within a 2 kcal/mol window, and for these species geometric structures, precise relative energies, equilibrium and vibrationally-averaged rotational constants, anharmonic vibrational frequencies, and numerous other spectroscopic constants were all determined.  The results will aid experimental efforts to characterize serine conformers and yield important benchmarks for force field and density functional methods applicable to biochemistry. Moreover, a detailed roadmap now exists for discovering pathways and rates for conformational tunneling in serine.  This work was published in J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 3571-3582.  (4) Experimental observation and theoretical corroboration of a previously undocumented conformational tunneling process in carbonic acid (H2CO3) occurring under cryogenic conditions over a period of several hours.  Theoretical analysis of the very intricate kinetic behavior of this fundamental species revealed three phenomenological types of matrix-isolated molecules: a frozen class, in which tunneling is precluded by the environment; a slow class with hindered conformational tunneling and half-lives of 11-26 h; and a fast class, characterized by half-lives of 2-5 h, for which the matrix appears to interfere to only a limited extent with the conformational tunneling.  This research was published in Chem. Commun. 2016, 52, 7858-7861.  (5) High-level computations of the tunneling rates interconverting all conformers of glycine.  This survey showed strikingly that many glycine conformers decay much too fast by intrinsic tunneling to be experimentally isolated or even be detected as transients by usual spectroscopic means. Notably, conformer IVn has escaped conclusive detection while higher-lying species IIIp has been repeatedly observed in cryogenic experiments.  The elusiveness of glycine IVn was demonstrated to arise from fast tunneling (60 ns computed half-life) to the lowest-energy conformer.  (6) High-level theoretical proof that the E-conformer of C6H5COOH decays by tunneling with a half-life of only 60 microseconds, while the same conformer of C6H5COOD persists for 2 minutes. Benzoic acid was used as a test case of an improved tunneling theory by incorporating full multidimensional coupling into the computations based on a quartic force field of the isomerization transition state.   (7) No less than seven Ph.D. and undergraduate students learned fundamental skills and gained scientific training by performing this compelling research.
