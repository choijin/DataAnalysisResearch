<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Frieder Jaekle of Rutgers University at Newark will use conjugated organoborane oligomers and polymers for the development of new rod-coil type amphiphiles, study their self-assembly into higher order structures, and probe their response to different chemical and physical stimuli. As a result of their electron-deficient nature, organoboranes offer a unique set of desirable features including strongly pi-accepting electronic properties and a pronounced tendency to form Lewis acid-base complexes. A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students will be trained and high school students will be involved through the ACS project SEED. Their learning experience will be further enriched through international collaborations and student exchanges. As part of an effort to build bridges between research and undergraduate education a new experiment on conjugated polymers will be implemented in the Inorganic and Materials Chemistry undergraduate laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will generate new fundamental knowledge in the field of main group element chemistry and in the areas of conjugated polymers and supramolecular materials. Studying these types of conjugated polymers could lead to novel functional materials with characteristics beneficial to optical, electronic, and sensing applications.</AbstractNarration>
