<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches: The objectives of this research are to develop key enabling technologies that will facilitate the design of three-port micro invertors which are able to convert DC power from conventional photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected systems into acceptable AC power. The approach is three-fold - (1) Investigating circuit operation and power stage design considerations of three-port micro invertors (2) Performing digital control design and studying the stability of the proposed three-port micro invertors by means of modern nonlinear theory (bifurcation and chaos theory), (3) Developing proper modeling procedures tailored to derive the small signal model of the three-port micro inverter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research focuses on creating new concepts of three-port micro inverters, topology optimization, small signal modeling techniques, digital control, and nonlinear analysis. The aim is to reduce power losses and generate clean energy with greater efficiency. The research aims to investigate novel approaches to current energy conversion challenges, while satisfying the standard requirements of regular utility grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Renewable energy sources and associated energy conversion technologies are imperative for a sustainable and prosperous future. The proposed research would improve the fundamental understanding of key technologies in power converter design, manufacture, and application. Not only would this research offer an innovative, cost-effective method for the generation of power anywhere in the world and thus contribute to universal economic and social development, but would also strengthen the power electronics curricula at the University of Central Florida (UCF) and Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) and attract the best students to the promising field of alternative energies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome:  1) Carried out comprehensive topology review, analysis, and gave detailed for a new design specifications for three-phase mircoinverter.  2)  Developed New control techniques for three-phase inverters with increased efficiency and reliability.  4) Developed a new modeling of the inverter as "generator" system for grid stabilization.  5) Carried out experimental verification for the designed modules.  Summary:  The goal of the project was to explore and develop a new low-cost, reliable inverter with high power density and improved efficiency by using advanced control techniques. During the project, we developed new control techniques to increase efficiency for a micro-inverter with current mode control zero voltage switching (ZVS) output stages. The first technique is dynamic dead-time optimization wherein PWM dead times are dynamically adjusted as a function of load current. The second method is advanced phase skipping control which maximizes inverter efficiency by controlling power on individual phases depending on the available input power from the photovoltaic source. These enhanced control method increased the efficiency and power density of the micro-inverters and features both reduced number of components and easy digital implementation. Zero voltage switching is achieved by controlling the inductor current bi-directional in every switching cycle and results in lower switching losses, higher operating frequency, and reduced size and cost of passive components, especially the magnetics.     Developed further the concept of Virtual Resistance based DC Link Voltage regulation technique which will allow DG inverters to continue to source their available power even when the power demand is higher than their capacity without shutting off and isolating from the MG. This technique has been modeled and implemented using a 133 Watt single-phase inverter prototype.
