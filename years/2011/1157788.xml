<AbstractNarration>This project integrates molecular dynamic simulation and experimental measurement to develop a dynamic model for photosynthetic electron transfer in reaction centers of the purple nonsulfur bacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  Current simulations on this system have suggested that the involvement of slow, collective protein modes in mediating these reactions is key, and as a result, the amount of reorganization energy available during a reaction is profoundly dependant on the time scale of the reaction, particularly as one moves from picoseconds to nanoseconds. Here, a theoretical group and an experimental group have joined forces to explore how proteins dynamics is involved to balance two competing electron transfer reactions that are critical to solar energy conversion in photosynthesis.  The first is a productive electron transfer reaction that takes place on the 200 ps timescale from a bacteriopheophytin intermediate to a quinone.  The second is the competing unproductive recombination reaction in which the electron returns back to the original electron donor on the 10-20 ns time scale.  Simulations and measurements will be performed as a function of the driving force and temperature for these two reactions and compared directly, the goal being to understand how Nature has optimized protein structure and dynamics to promote productive photosynthetic function.  A series of surface charge mutants and different pH's will be investigated, testing the concept that that the charge distribution at the protein/water interface controls the shape of the initial and final state potential surfaces, as suggested by simulation.  In addition, internal mutations, thought to alter the displacement between potential surfaces, will also be investigated. The ultimate objective is to provide the capability to quantitatively predict biochemical reaction dynamics and associated function from protein structure in this complex biological system.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a quantitative, structure-based model of the relationship between structure, dynamics and function in the photosynthetic reaction center would be broadly valuable.  The reaction center in this respect represents something of a "lab on a molecule" with high resolution structural data and the inherent optical probes for monitoring electron transfer in considerable detail. The project will support the development of a complete, participatory learning experience for the students in the Mesa High School Biotechnology Academy,  based on genetic manipulation and spectroscopic probing of photosynthetic bacteria.  This will involve both teacher training in the ASU laboratories during one summer and then PIs working directly with the teachers and students in the academy to perform the activity during the subsequent years.  The PIs are very heavily involved in undergraduate mentoring  having had 25 undergraduates in the lab during the last 5 years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome: A key aspect of the biological mechanism of photosynthetic energy conversion, witch ensures a nearly unity quantum efficiency, is the role of the protein environment that facilitates the electron transfer reactions.  What we have come to understand in recent years is that the protein does much more than just hold the chemically active cofactors in the right positions.  The fact that the protein can move on a large number of time scales makes it a very special kind of solvent for chemical reactions.   To further our understanding of these ideas, we have taken advantage of specific features of the photosynthetic reaction center from purple nonsulfur bacteria (its structural simplicity, spectral characteristics, and electron transfer on multiple time scales), and utilized it as a "lab on a molecule" to explore the detailed role of protein structure and dynamics in electron transfer.  In this study, we were able to integrate the large-scale molecular dynamic simulation up to 15 millisecond and multiple time scale time-resolved laser spectroscopic measurement to develop a dynamic model for photosynthetic electron transfer in reaction centers of the purple nonsulfur bacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  The simulations on this system have suggested that the involvement of slow, collective protein modes in mediating electron transfer reactions is key, and as a result, the amount of reorganization energy available during a reaction is profoundly dependent on the time scale of the reaction, particularly on the hundreds of picoseconds and beyond.   Several competing reaction center electron transfer reactions have been studied.  The first is the forward electron transfer that takes place on the 200 ps timescale from a bacteriopheophytin intermediate to a quinone.  The second is the competing recombination reaction in which the electron returns back to the original electron donor on the 15-20 ns time scale.  The generation of the triplet state of the primary electron donor resulted from the charge recombination, as well as the triplet energy transfer to the carotenoid were also investigated. The third is the electron transfer from the first to the second quinone occurring on the microsecond time scale.  In those studies, the effect of driving force and temperature on these reactions were specifically investigated.  A series of mutants were explored to test the concept that thought to alter the displacement between potential surfaces.  Our study has indicated that protein dynamics modulates the rate and pathway of the various electron transfer reactions, therefore manipulate the overall efficiency. This is because proteins can move on many different timescales and in specific ways, they can "break" the usual rules of thermodynamics and kinetics that apply to homogeneous solvents like water. Effectively, the ability of the protein to thermally equilibrate with reaction intermediates changes dramatically with the time scale upon which the reaction occurs. As a result, the key energetic parameters that control chemistry, including the activation energy of a reaction that determines how fast it proceeds, become dependent in a fundamental way on the time scale of the reaction. In the photosynthetic reaction center, this means that electron transfer reactions on different time scales can be optimized essentially independently, even though they use the same physical cofactors of the reaction center.  This provides evolution with a dimension for functional optimization beyond the static structure and the dynamics of the groups that are directly involved in the reaction mechanism itself.  Impact &amp; Benefits: Proteins mediate nearly all of the chemistry of life.  The realization that thermodynamics is fundamentally dependent on protein dynamics provides both theoretical and experimental bases for quantitative modeling of protein structure/dynamics/function relationships, allowing us to predict how protein structure and dynamics will affect the energetics and kinetics of the reactions it mediates.  This has significant implications for functional protein design. Protein dynamics in the reaction center makes the solar energy conversion process robust; the system can operate over a wide range of conditions.  Clearly much has been done to use our understanding of protein structure and function to optimize catalysis, understand disease and design drugs.  By adding the ability to understand and control dynamics in a structurally defined way, the potential for designing or redesigning protein function can be greatly enhanced.  Background &amp; Explanation: This research was made possible through NSF MCB support of fundamental research in experimental aspects of protein-mediated chemistry. Our researches on the experiment primarily used ASU's ultrafast laser facility, also funded by NSF, which acts like a high-speed motion picture camera that can capture data from these lightning-fast reactions. The theoretical work of the research, the dynamic simulation were carried out on the Teragrid supercomputer where Matyushov?s group has an allocation through an NSF-supported Teragrid grant.
