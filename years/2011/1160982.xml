<AbstractNarration>/UCRC for Tire Research &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1160977 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University; Saied Taheri &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1160982 University of Akron; Celal Batur &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Tire Research (CenTiRe) will focus on supporting a research program in tire materials, modeling, manufacturing, and testing combined with rubber material prototyping and testing, and parallel computing and dynamic simulation capabilities. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) and the University of Akron (UA) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with VT as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of the proposed center are to initiate formal partnerships with various industry partners and national laboratories that have an interest in tire technologies, and to discuss fundamental issues and topics for research. The Center will fulfill the needs of the tire manufacturing companies by providing innovative solutions in all four research thrust areas of materials, modeling, manufacturing, and testing. The vehicle manufacturing companies are more interested in the application of tire in their products. The Center is built upon the knowledge and expertise of multi-disciplinary researchers in Mechanical, Polymer, and Chemical Engineering at Virginia Tech (VT) and the University of Akron (UA). CenTiRe intends to provide the industry with highly trained undergraduate and graduate students who will contribute to this growing industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed Center has the potential to improve sustainability and profitability of US tire manufacturing industry by developing new technologies that will reduce energy consumption, pollution and increase driving safety. The Center plans to graduate a new generation of specialists in tire engineering providing the industry with access to potential employees. The members and the organizational structure of the CenTiRe will promote precompetitive research that will allow the members to rapidly and cost-effectively bring new products to market. Finally, the Center will become a conduit for the professional training and education of not just graduate students from underrepresented and women engineering groups, but also representatives from industry through its outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Tire research is multi-disciplinary since tires are complex composite materials.   CenTire research projects covered by this NSF funding aimed to advance the field of tire technology by understanding the dynamic relations among several components of tire materials such as rubber, steel, polymers and nano-fillers. Projects also advanced the area of tire-vehicle testing and simulations and attempted to   configure technological foundation for the next-generation autonomous vehicles. Multiscale analysis and modeling of tire dynamics is strongly complex and nonlinear in nature, encompassing topics in materials, testing and  modeling its system dynamics.  Cars and trucks play a major role in our nation?s economy. Demand for engineers and scientists who are highly knowledgeable in the tire technology involving various aspects of their engineering will grow significantly. CenTire provided our member companies with the highly trained undergraduate and graduate students who can contribute to this growing industry sector. CenTire has contributed to improve sustainability and profitability of US tire manufacturing industry by developing new technologies on materials, testing, manufacturing, and modeling that can reduce energy consumption, increase sustainability, and add driving intelligence.   Specifically, CenTire has focused on:  -          To advance, develop and promote research into the fundamentals and technology of tire science and engineering. This is done through research, development, education, and technology exchange among academic, industry, and government entities;  -          To increase the quantity and quality of the professionals prepared to work in the area;  -          To involve faculty of the member universities (University of Akron and Virginia Tech)  in research in areas of common interest to member companies and universities;  -          To perform research that will allow tire, transportation, and materials companies to be competitive in the world economy.  The CenTire mission inherently recognized the opportunity created by the formation of a multi-university science and engineering center that has both a strong mathematical modeling component (Virginia Tech) and an equally strong material and polymer science capability (University of Akron.) This combination provided the intellectual leadership to meet future tire science and technology needs of our member companies. The focus has been on the development of competitive, reproducible tire materials and compounds. Below, we list the specific areas that CenTire has worked on.  a. Materials   This research thrust area has focused on the development of new advanced materials or novel use of existing materials to enhance specific performance of the tire while maintaining, or perhaps also enhancing other performance areas.  New materials technology is of high value to the tire, automotive, and materials supplier companies.  b- Modeling  Molecular level modeling, constitutive modeling, tire-road interaction modeling, physical and empirical tire modeling, road profiling and modeling, and developing simulation technology for use with pre- and post-production tire and tire/vehicle performance assessment has become an essential element of tire design and is the focus of this research thrust area.  c- Testing   This research thrust area has focused on the development of new equipment, procedures, or techniques for testing in areas such as new materials and validating their constitutive equations, tire-road interactions, and novel testing of tire performance.  Providing more accurate, realistic, efficient, and economical testing capabilities is of great interest to our member companies.  d- Manufacturing   This research thrust area has focused on the development of new manufacturing processes and equipment, to improve product quality, process efficiency, and to minimize the environmental impacts of tire manufacturing.
