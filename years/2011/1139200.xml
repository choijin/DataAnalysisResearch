<AbstractNarration>The Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium (http://www.math.uga.edu/~dkrashen/gags/)is a yearly gathering in which we will bring together local algebraic geometers with outside experts to focus on emerging developments. Half of the talks will be longer, with the first part dedicated to graduate students. Speakers will include postdocs and finishing graduate students, and at least half of those funded will be early career mathematicians. Each conference will feature an open problem session and all talks will be filmed and made available online.  The first conference will take place May 25-27, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is one of the most established and active areas of mathematics and has deep connections with many other subjects. The Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium will strengthen the local community of researchers by publicizing recent advances and perspectives and promoting collaboration. This funding will enable junior algebraic geometers to present their work, and interact with the broader community. Talks aimed at graduate students will make concepts more accessible. This focus on early career algebraic geometers will enable their training, enculturation, and future employment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is the final report for the conference grant to fund the Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium (GAGS), which has now become a regional yearly conference in algebraic geometry cycling between the University of Georgia, Emory University, and Georgia Tech. Through GAGS, we have experienced the benefits of regular gatherings of algebraic geometers in the South. Such meetings have also proved to be popular and productive in various parts of the country, for example, WAGS (Western Algebraic Geometry), AGNES (Algebraic Geometry North Eastern Symposium), and TAGS (Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium) have been incredibly successful focal points for the growing community of up and coming algebraic geometers.   GAGS features local as well as national and international speakers, and focuses largely on graduate students and early career algebraic geometers.        Our primary source of funding has been the National Science Foundation.  We also received support from the University of Georgia's President's Venture Fund, the University of Georgia's Office Of the Vice President for Research, and the UGA math department.   In this final year, we supported 8 speakers and 72 outside participants.  Full lists of participants, speakers,  can be found on our webpage:  https://sites.google.com/site/galgeoms2017/        In terms of intellectual merit, the meeting stimulates and strengthens our growing community of algebraic geometers in Georgia and the south which has already seen increasedties since the start of the Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium     In terms of broader impacts, the majority of our funding has been used to support early career mathematicians. Our goal has been to provide an  opportunity for them to network with each other and to be exposed to the cutting edge developments in the field.  To fascilitate this, we have also set aside time for 10 minute talks by early career participants in order that they could disseminate their research to the community. As has been demonstrated in this and our previous Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposia, we are committed to supporting members of the community from underrepresented groups both financially as well as by having female speakers and supporting female participants.   .
