<AbstractNarration>The project, a collaborative effort among Smith College, Holyoke Community College and Mount Holyoke College, is building analytical competence in undergraduate geoscience students through use of Raman and FTIR spectrometers. Benchtop and portable spectrometers are being shared among the three colleges and others in the region, and are being used to develop, implement and assess innovative instructional modules through which students acquire mastery via hands-on, investigative learning. By analyzing unknown minerals and other materials, synthesizing data and predictions, and evaluating experimental results, students are learning not only geological content, but also how to use chemical analyses to solve relevant problems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The spectroscopic knowledge and analytical competencies that are targeted in the curriculum development are in increasing demand by the nation's geoscience workforce. The project is providing a direct benefit in broadening participation in the geosciences through its engagement with two women's colleges and a community college that serves a diverse population of non-traditional and first-generation college students. Project personnel are also disseminating their approach and curriculum modules beyond the region through a web portal, video postings, and hands-on workshops at national conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Analytical competence, especially the computer-assisted collection and evaluation of data on geological materials, is an essential attribute of geoscience students who hope to succeed in scientific careers.  Recent advances in the development of commercially available Raman and FTIR spectrometers make this technology accessible to students and faculty in the geosciences for whom spectroscopy has not traditionally been a focus.  These spectrometers are powerful tools that significantly expand our capability to identify and characterize geological materials and provide excellent opportunities to build analytical competence through their thoughtful use in geoscience curricula.   Accordingly, this proposal supported a collaborative effort among faculty at Smith College, Mt. Holyoke College, and Holyoke Community College to develop, implement, and disseminate instructional modules that are designed to build analytical competence in geoscience students through the use of Raman and FTIR spectrometers in geoscience courses and student research.  Benchtop and portable spectrometers were purchased and shared among the participating faculty and colleges for use in introductory and intermediate courses.  Results of this collaboration, including assessment, have been disseminated actively through presentations at national and regional meetings of the Geological Society of America, a Five Colleges summer spectroscopy course, and a workshop at the Earth Educators? Rendezvous of the National Association of Geology Teachers in Madison, WI.  We explored the utility of ATR data collection (powdered samples) vs. front reflection data collection (single crystal samples), and worked with gemstones in a diffuse reflection module. We built lists of minerals that are easy to identify with FTIR or Raman, and created streamlined data libraries of common minerals using data collected with our instruments on minerals that are in the Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, and Holyoke Community College mineral collections.  A website was created to consolidate and organize our own data as well as publicly-available spectroscopic data on minerals (http://nemo.cs.umass.edu:54321/). developed into a major resource for teaching spectroscopy, including data not only from Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, but also from many other sources (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, visible-near-infrared, etc.).

BROADER IMPACTS:  A principal goal of this proposal was to develop and share course activities that can be used to teach students how to collect and interpret analytical data with modern, computer-assisted instruments of modest cost. We accomplished this goal by using our modules in classes at three different institutions; assessment of those courses is ongoing. Students in these courses comprised those from Holyoke Community College as well as two women?s colleges (Smith and Mount Holyoke), so they included a disproportionate number from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences, including women, minorities, and first generation college students.

These students worked closely with University of Massachusetts graduate student, CJ Carey, who developed our mineral identification software for Raman spectroscopy.  A final goal was to provide resources for teachers of the geosciences to allow them to make use of instrumental advances in Raman and FTIR spectroscopy and to encourage and enable them to add spectroscopy to their courses.  By targeting teachers though workshops and publications, and by providing course materials, we have impacted the education of a great many students, well beyond those in our own classes.
