<AbstractNarration>The Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) effort has created and maintained an experimental, real-time, high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) capability for the United States Antarctic Program (USAP). It additionally supports a wide range of NSF scientific and logistical activities across Antarctica (including on-Ice emergencies), offers numerical guidance to international Antarctic forecasting efforts, and provides a research tool and database for researchers and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the proposed renewal effort are to: &lt;br/&gt;a) maintain and enhance AMPS while providing numerical forecasts tailored to the needs of the USAP; &lt;br/&gt;b) improve the WRF (AMPS numerical weather model) capability in its high latitude applications; and &lt;br/&gt;c) foster collaboration among forecasters, researchers, and students to advance NSF operational and scientific aims, while positioning AMPS to serve the Antarctic scientific community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award was supported in part with funding from the CIF21 Venture Fund for Software re-use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes  (as of April 2015)     The Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) is a numerical weather prediction system run in support of the U.S. Antarctic Program and its forecasters.  The goals of the AMPS project have been: to maintain and enhance the system while providing numerical forecasts tailored for the needs of the USAP forecasters; to improve WRF in its high-latitude applications; and to foster collaboration among Antarctic forecasters, researchers, and students.  These goals continue to be met.      The core outcome of the project has been the successful support of the USAP and of NSF science and activities across Antarctica.  The project has provided reliable and tailored model forecast guidance to the USAP and SPAWAR.  It has contributed to cost savings through reductions in flight aborts and lost or delayed missions.  It has supported USAP resource deployment and scientific fieldwork across the high southern latitudes.      AMPS continued to run WRF on nested forecast domains with spacings of 30 km, 10 km, 3.3 km, and 1.1 km.  In addition, a single, expanded, 3.3-km grid was added to cover the entire South Pole&ndash;Ross Sea sector, and it replaced two smaller domains.  Furthermore, two additional 27-km/9-km forecast grids have been added to support the operations out of New Zealand and around Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula.      NCAR began running a WRF ensemble in AMPS, primarily based off of differing initial and boundary conditions.  The outcomes have been (i) an expanded range of model guidance to the forecasters, and (ii) an ability to run a hybrid data assimilation approach in AMPS.       The AMPS web page (http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/rt/amps) was updated with new capabilities and products.  A recent example of a valuable new product is the 4-panel display.  The overall outcome is tailored forecaster support.  The backup AMPS web page (http://amps-backup.ucar.edu) was also maintained, providing robustness and redundancy in the forecast delivery system.     The project served scientific field campaigns.  In the 2014&ndash;2015 season, AMPS supported for SG-WEX, the South Georgia Wave Experiment, with a special WRF forecast grid.  This study focused on the nature and variability of gravity waves generated over South Georgia Is.  AMPS also provided preliminary test products for the future planned AVOCET experiment (Antarctic Vortex Chemistry, Energetics, and Dynamical Transport).  The AMPS project also regularly supported the cruises of the NSF research vessels Nathaniel B. Palmer and Laurence M. Gould.  The outcomes have been directly-provided guidance to NSF for its science and operations.     AMPS has assisted forecasting in emergency operations in Antarctica.  The more recent episodes have been medevacs from McMurdo in April 2013 and May 2013.  In addition, in January 2013 AMPS supported the search attempts for a Twin Otter aircraft that crashed in the Transantarctic Mtns.  Through its provision of model output, AMPS also assisted international scientific efforts in Antarctica, including those of Italy, UK, Australia, Germany, Chile, South Africa, Argentina, China, and New Zealand.     The AMPS project has involved significant collaboration with the Antarctic meteorological community and has been central in the organization of the annual Antarctic Meteorological Observation, Modeling, and Forecasting (AMOMF) Workshop.  Over the past year, NCAR and OSU contributed to the planning and proceedings of the 9th AMOMF Workshop (June 2014).  The effort has produced papers describing the effortÆs support of the USAP and polar WRF development and results.     The project served the research community through its AMPS archive, the storehouse of model forecast output.  The AMPS archive has been published on the Earth System Grid (ESG) web portal (http://www.earthsystemgrid.org/project/amps.html), greatly improving accessibility for users to the data.  In addition, OSU produced a separate, onlin...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
