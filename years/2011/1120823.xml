<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches: The overall research objective of this Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) award is to develop high speed, ink-jet based roll-to-roll nanopatterning (i-R2R Nano) for cost-sensitive applications such as thin film photovoltaics (PVs). The specific objectives include: (i) Investigation of top-down (nanoimprint) and bottom-up (nanoparticle or block co-polymer) R2R nanopatterning; (ii) Development of enabling technologies for high throughput R2R processes (&gt;50 ft/min) with a total patterning cost target of &lt;$2/m2; and  (iii) Optimization of broadband light trapping in nanostructured a-Si PVs on flex substrates using aperiodic plasmonic structures to obtain significantly enhanced efficiencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The basic scientific contributions will include: (i) Nano-fluidics, material rheology, multi-scale mechanics modeling, and real-time sensing/control for high-speed i-R2R systems and processes (ii) Design of imprint materials, solvent based self-assembly materials, and interfaces for rapid pattern formation in TD and BU processes; and (iii) Novel material integration and device design for optimum light trapping in thin film PVs on flex substrates.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This interdisciplinary program will create fundamental knowledge in the areas of high-speed R2R nanopatterning with low material usage, and in the design of controlled nano-structures for high efficiency PVs. Thin film PVs is representative of the most demanding nano-scale requirements and cost constraints among the various potential applications of R2R nanopatterning. The outreach activities will promote innovation/entrepreneurship; and synergistic activities at the undergraduate level through the UT-Austin Equal Opportunity in Engineering T-REX program.</AbstractNarration>

The project has directly supported 7 graduate students and 2 post-doctoral staff, with the broader synergistic research team consisting of nearly 30 personnel. The research output from this award has led to 35 journal articles, 12 conference presentations, 1 book chapter and 6 research theses. There has simultaneously been broad dissemination of the knowledge gained from this project through new graduate and undergraduate level classes and summer training camps for high school students and teachers.  1. Tool and system development: This award facilitated the development of a roll-to-roll inkjet-based nanopatterning test bed, which is capable of patterning sub-50 nm features on flexible substrates at throughputs of 6 ft/min. An automated machine-in-the-loop inkjet control system for automatically optimizing the actuation waveform for piezoelectric inkjets has also been developed.

The silicon was shown to provide very high etch development contrast that enabled production of high aspect ratio patterns of the sort required for image transfer. There was a concerted effort to drive the resolution of these patterns to the absolute minimum. The most recent materials demonstrate very clean formation of 50 angstrom lines and spaces.

Numerical solutions of equations governing the dynamics of the process show how the concentration profile evolves as a result of flow driven by heterogeneous evaporation.   3. Device development: The device application component of this project involved the exploration of a variety of nanostructures fabricated over large areas (~1cm2 and larger) for applications in solar energy harvesting. Both photovoltaic devices (solar cells) and photoelectrochemical devices (solar fuel generation by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using solar energy) were explored. For solar cells, one approach pursued in this project involved the design and fabrication of structures much smaller than the wavelengths contained in incident sunlight, and integration of these structures both directly on the surface of conventional solar cells and on the surfaces of transparent packaging materials used to protect the cells from the ambient environment.
