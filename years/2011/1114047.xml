<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop transparent electrodes based on silver nanowires and polymer substrates to replace indium tin oxide for applications in thin-film and flexible electronic devices. The approach is to form a silver nanowire-polymer composite with sheet resistance and transmission comparable to indium tin oxide coated on glass. A transfer technique will be employed to produce smooth electrode surface free of protruding silver nanowires. The expected outcome of the project is a new transparent electrode technology, with less than 10 nm surface roughness, 85% transmission, and 10 ohm per square sheet resistance.  The project will also demonstrate high-performance thin-film electronic devices based on the composite electrodes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a viable alternative to indium tin oxide to reduce the production cost of important electronic devices such as organic light emitting diodes, thin-film solar cells, and liquid crystal displays. The combined markets for these devices represent a substantial growth opportunity in the near future. However, the rising cost of indium and the lack of flexibility of indium tin oxide have become a major challenge. In this project, new composite electrodes will be developed, which are anticipated to be low cost, flexible and even stretchable without compromising device performance.</AbstractNarration>
