<AbstractNarration>The  goal  of  this  research involves the study of high-end  parallel  finite element mesh generation software capable to deliver and sustain concurrency  which will fully utilize  current  Teraflop   and  next  generation  Petaflop  high-end architectures.  Other than the direct impact to supercomputing this research will have a broader impact to many (bio-) engineering applications that can benefit from scalable field solvers and Teraflop/ Petaflop supercomputers.  Such software can also provide challenging and realistic benchmarks which can help to understand the behavior of end-to-end dynamic  applications on multi-layered architectures, and thus will be invaluable for the performance evaluation community and design of new supercomputers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome of this research is  an  effective   and  efficient implementation  of   adaptive  finite  element   mesh  generation  and refinement on high-end parallel architectures.  However, parallel mesh generation belongs to the broader class of  adaptive and irregular applications which are challenging and labor  intensive to develop and maintain. As a result, parallel mesh generation is one of the last applications to be installed on parallel architectures. This research will  remedy  this problem for high-end architectures by   focusing on the following objectives. Develop a runtime  system  for multi-layered  parallel  adaptive and  irregular applications that can efficiently orchestrate intra-  and inter-layer data movement and load balancing. Use the runtime system to design an evolutionary  approach  for  developing  multi-layered  parallel  mesh generation software  capable of exposing concurrency from the very beginning of the execution and sustaining up to one quadrillion concurrent work units.</AbstractNarration>
