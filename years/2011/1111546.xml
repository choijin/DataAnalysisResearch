<AbstractNarration>Professors Bert Holmes and George Heard of the University of North Carolina Asheville are supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program to carry out a joint experimental and computational study of the kinetics and energetics of reaction pathways of molecules in the atmosphere, with particular attention to processes involving a unimolecular rearrangement as a part of the reaction pathway.  This research builds on the PIs' experience in identifying unusual rearrangements of hydrohalocarbon molecules, and expands that study to include compounds containing sulfur atoms as well as cyclopropanes.  Molecules will be studied by a combination of direct synthesis from radical combination, and computational modeling using ab initio and density functional theory with a focus on characterizing transition state geometries for rearrangement and elimination processes.  Computational and experimental projects intersect by the comparison of relative rate constants using RRKM theory and direct measurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research outcomes from this project should be an increased understanding of fundamental processes going on in the upper atmosphere and an understanding of the chemistry of compounds released regularly in incineration processes.  This project will support seven undergraduate students per summer in research that is intended to improve problem-solving skills and provide preparation for a career in advanced chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CHE-1111546 award supported a collaborative experimental and computational study of unimolecular reactions (a single molecule undergoing reaction) conducted by undergraduate students under the mentorship of two faculty members at the University of North Carolina Asheville (UNCA).  The results from these studies have been reported in 10 published papers that involved undergraduates as co-authors 23 times.      A broader impact of this project was the preparation of UNCA undergraduates for future, productive careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.  As a result of the research funded in this proposal thirteen students graduated with a BS degree in chemistry and six more are seniors or under-class students who are finishing their chemistry major.  To encourage K-12 students to seek careers in STEM, and to improve the public perception and appreciation of science, the undergraduates who participated in this research also engaged in community outreach events, such as the North Carolina Science Festival, Earth Day at the Roper Mountain Science Center, and National Chemistry Week at the Spartanburg Science center.     Most of the molecules investigated by this project are hydrochlorofluorocarbons, HCFCs, hydrochlorocarbons, HCCs, or hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs.  HCFCs and HFCs are classes of compounds that have been used extensively in commercial or industrial applications where they replaced CFCs (also known as Freons).  CFCs were banned by the Montreal Protocol because they destroyed the ozone layer in the stratosphere.  Many of the HCFCs and HFCs are to be removed from use by 2020 or 2030 and destroyed by combustion, incineration or pyrolysis, all of these processes occur at high temperatures.  A common first step in the high temperature degradation of HCFCs or HFCs is a unimolecular reaction similar to ones studied in this project.  We have measured rate constants for these unimolecular reactions that provide information about how rapidly these compounds decompose, giving an indication of their likely persistence in the upper atmosphere.  Finally, we modeled the decomposition pathways using electronic structure calculations that allow us to visualize the movement of atoms during the unimolecular reaction.  In addition, the calculations can be easily repeated for systems where we have made systematic changes in the molecular groups attached to the reaction center to judge whether substituents increase or decrease the rate of the decomposition reactions.
