<AbstractNarration>AST-1109061/1108830&lt;br/&gt;Ferland/Kulkarni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heavy elements are produced by stellar evolution and then distributed into interstellar space.  Understanding the enrichment history of galaxies is therefore crucial to understanding the star formation and feedback processes that are central to galaxy evolution.  Absorption lines of damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorbers in the spectra of background quasars or gamma-ray burst afterglows provide the most sensitive tools to measure the heavy element content of distant galaxies.  High-resolution spectroscopy has revealed some interesting puzzles, especially relating to variations in metallicities and enrichment.  Current and proposed large telescopes will greatly expand the observational database, especially at high redshift, but unfortunately essential atomic data - both oscillator strengths and recombination coefficients - are highly uncertain or unknown for most elements beyond Magnesium in the periodic table.  These gaps in the existing atomic database are the greatest weakness in deriving abundances from spectra and realizing the scientific potential of the observations.  This project will improve that situation by carrying out the following steps: 1) calculate more accurate oscillator strengths for transitions of all relevant ions from Aluminum to Zinc using state-of-the-art quantal codes; 2) calculate dielectronic recombination coefficients for all relevant ions of key elements; 3) incorporate these data into the widely used photoionization code 'Cloudy'; 4) apply the new 'Cloudy' models to existing and new spectral data; and 5) provide feedback to the atomic theory from the observational and modeling results (the last and most crucial step).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will help to determine whether the current picture of chemical evolution of galaxies is accurate, while providing a much-needed improvement in atomic data and photoionization modeling.  Because the team combines expertise in atomic physics, plasma simulations, and observational spectroscopy, they are uniquely qualified to carry out this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The improvements to the widely available modeling tool 'Cloudy' will be of immediate benefit to other areas of astrophysics ranging from star-forming clouds to active galactic nuclei, because that utility is used extensively and cited in over 200 publications each year.  The work includes significant educational benefits at both institutions and a strong outreach involvement, and continues a strong international collaboration, to which the junior researchers will be extensively exposed.  Due to the make-up of the team, it also enhances the quality and diversity of the scientific workforce in a geographical region with few astronomers, and especially very few minority or women astronomers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While the Big Bang created most of the hydrogen and helium around us, the heavier elements like carbon or oxygen were produced by stellar evolution and then distributed into interstellar space as stars died. Understanding the enrichment history, how the amount of these elements changed over time, is crucial to understanding how star formation made planets like the Earth possible. Absorption lines produced by damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) absorbers in the spectra of distant background quasars provide the most sensitive tool to measure the heavy-element content of distant galaxies.  Light emitted by very distant quasars passes through galaxies before reaching the Earth.  High-resolution spectroscopy with very large telescopes measures the effects of these intervening galaxies and the elements within them upon the spectrum of the quasar.  Astronomy is an observational, not experimental, science, so such observations are all that can be done.  But we have an advantage over laboratory sciences; we can look back in time by measuring galaxies at greater distances from the Earth, allowing us to measure how the universe changes over time.  This project developed and applied the tools needed to make these measurements.  Quantum mechanics and atomic physics are used to determine how light interacts with matter.  The project filled gaps in the existing atomic database that had been the greatest weakness in deriving abundances from spectra.  The oscillator strength, a measure of how easily an atom can absorb light, must be known if we are to determine how much of an element was present in the distant galaxy and affecting the spectrum. We calculated accurate oscillator strengths for many spectral lines of sulfur and zinc atoms with one electron removed. We integrated these improved new data into Cloudy, a large computer program that can simulate conditions in a galaxy and predict how the spectrum will be affected.  We then applied these new simulations to observational datasets to determine how the amount of these elements changed over time, a test of the current picture of the chemical evolution of galaxies.  Because these improvements are included in Cloudy, they were of immediate benefit to other areas of astrophysics ranging from star-forming clouds to active galactic nuclei. Cloudy is openly available, in keeping with NSF sharing policies, and its documentation is cited by more than 200 papers per year, making it one of the most widely used codes in theoretical astrophysics.  A significant effort went into supporting this open use of the code.  The amount of physics incorporated into Cloudy is large, and there is a steep learning curve as a result.  We organized a number of weeklong workshops that allowed young people to gain hands-on experience using the code and applying it to research topics of their choosing.  All workshops hit their enrollment limit, and participant feedback was very positive.       Last Modified: 12/28/2015       Submitted by: Gary J Ferland]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
