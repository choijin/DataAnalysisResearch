<AbstractNarration>In this proposal, the PI seeks to extend previous research on the homotopy theory of homotopy theories in several ways.  A major topic of interest is the continuation of work in progress on higher-categorical generalizations of these structures.  While a few models have been introduced for doing so, in part motivated by work in algebraic geometry and topological quantum field theory, it is important to establish that they are all equivalent to one another analogous to the PI's previous work.  In related work, analogues of these models in the world of operads are being developed, and again it will be important to see which known results can be carried over and how comparisons can be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In another direction, the PI seeks to use homotopy-theoretic tools to explore further the relationship between Hall algebras and quantum groups.  A longtime open question in representation theory is to find a derived version of the Hall algebra from which all of the corresponding quantum group can be recovered.  It is anticipated that newly-developed techniques in homotopy theory will provide new insights into solving this conjecture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of this proposal is concerned with homotopical categories.  These structures consist of objects and functions between them, but allowing for deformations between sufficiently similar functions.  They have received significant attention in recent years due to their applicability to a number of areas of mathematics, including algebraic topology, representation theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics.  While much of my own work is concerned with understanding the nature of these structures,and different ways to understand them, I have also made some connections with representation theory and combinatorics.  Much of this work has been collaborative, with many of the coauthors junior researchers. One project was completed as part of the Women in Topology workshop, bringing together one other senior researcher, two postdocs, and one graduate student, and resulting in two papers.  The broader impacts of this proposal include broad dissemination of the research and student development.  I have given many talks on my results, not only at research conferences for specialists, but also at undergraduate seminars and summer programs and a summer school for graduate students from the United States and Mexico.  I have mentored seven undergraduate students in research projects, and have published a paper with two of these students.  Most of these students have been members of underrepresented minority groups.  I have mentored two postdocs and have supervised four PhD students, one of whom recently completed his dissertation.
