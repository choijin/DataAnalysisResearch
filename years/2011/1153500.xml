<AbstractNarration>CBET-1153500&lt;br/&gt;PI: Vafai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pioneering works in the area of fluid transport as well as some aspects of heat transport in porous media go back to the beginning of this century. Convective heat transfer in fluid-saturated porous media has gained considerable attention in recent decades due to its relevance in a wide range of applications such as thermal insulation engineering, water movements in geothermal reservoirs, heat pipes, electronics cooling, bio applications, underground spreading of chemical waste, nuclear waste repositories, direct contact heat exchangers geothermal engineering, grain storage, combustion and enhanced recovery of petroleum reservoirs. This is due to the wide range of applicability of these research areas in contemporary technology.  Radiative heat transfer and multiphase transport processes in porous media, both with and without phase change, have also gained extensive attention. Three highly successful conferences on Porous Media and its Applications in Science, Engineering and Industry were held in 1996 in Kona, Hawaii, and in 2007 in Kauai, Hawaii, and in 2010 in Montecatini, Italy. Various researchers in porous media worldwide attended these conferences. This conference is built on the last three conferences to reflect the research done internationally in the currently active areas of the topic. The presence of the highly successful Journal of Porous Media and both editions of the very well received Handbook of Porous Media and the book entitled Porous Media: Applications in Biological Systems and Biotechnology creates an additional impetus to further galvanize this conference.  Papers of high quality will be considered for submission to the Journal of Porous Media and Special Topics and Reviews in Porous Media-an International Journal and other leading journals in the field of porous media. This conference will clarify various outstanding issues in the field of porous media through interactions with experts in this field.  This conference will be held on Potsdam, Germany from June 17 to 22, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will convene world experts in various aspects of the field of Porous Media.  The experts in the field will convene in an ideal setting and discuss the state of the art and various controversial issues. The results of these in depth discussions will very helpful to both the experts as well as the researchers in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experts from various disciplines participate in the conference as members of the organizing committee and as speakers.  A number of relatively younger researchers from different disciplines will be involved in this conference.  The broader impact of this conference will cover fields of Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Hydrology. It is anticipated that a review article based on the results of this conference will be published in one of the leading journals related to Recent Advances in Porous Media Research and its Future Implications.</AbstractNarration>

The surveys taken from the attendees as well the additional unsolicited comments and emails once again pointed to an extremely well received conference by the participants.  There was a strong demand for repeating this conference in couple of years.  Detailed parts of the following pertinent aspects of the conference were discussed in the submitted final report.     1. General aspects of the conference and listing of organizing committee  2. Final program details  3. Oral &amp; Poster presentations  4. Final list of participants  5. AIP Proceedings  6.
