<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator will perform an extended evaluation of long-term solar wind trends. This will include using proxy data (specifically, quiet-time dayside magnetometer observations) to (1) determine whether solar wind dynamic pressure has been increasing throughout the 20th century along with the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF); (2) explore the newly discovered relationship between the solar wind helium abundance and the IMF; and (3) investigate the changes in that relationship as the helium abundance has plummeted to values far below the normal level for the last 50 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research might point the way to a comprehensive phenomenological framework that provides an understanding of solar wind changes in terms of the evolution of the solar cycle, and perhaps even provide evidence that the more than century-long Grand Solar Maximum is at an end.  This line of research may also provide important clues for solar physics more broadly, as it attempts to improve our understanding of the Sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support the training of an undergraduate student who will be deeply involved in the research. In addition, a better understanding of solar activity, as well as the use of solar wind trends to predict solar activity, will allow our civilization to improve space weather forecasting and thereby mitigate the negative effects on the on-orbit and ground-based technology upon which we depend and which is vulnerable to space weather effects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of the propoal was a exploratory study to determine in mid latitude, ground-based  magnetometers could be used to extrapolate the solar wind pressure back in time to the early 20th century, before the space age.  This would allow us to determine if the long term variation in the solar wind pressure observed by spacecraft (increasing the the latter third of the 20th centerury, then decreasing in the 21st century) is matched by the variations extending back to 1900.  Unfortunately, we were not able to use the ground-based data to reliably predict the solar wind pressure in the space age, thus making any extrapolation problematic.  The broader impacts of the work included providing a undergraduate research project to a female undergraduate physics major (she used this work to fulfill her senior seminar requirement).  Also, the long term solar wind varation is connected to the broader question of whether the sun is entering a Maunder Minimum state.  While we cannot answer the question of whether the solar wind pressure increased steadily in the first 70 years of the 20th century, we did show that in increased from 1970-2000, at which point the long-term trend reversed.  This doe suggest that the sun is moving to a long-term period of weaker solar activity.  The broader implications of this finding for climate change could be significant.
