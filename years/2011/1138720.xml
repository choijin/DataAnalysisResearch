<AbstractNarration>An outstanding problem in magnetospheric physics involves understanding the source and loss mechanisms of the Earth's radiation belt electrons. It is thought that various plasma waves play an essential role in this regard. A recent observation  suggests that there may be large-amplitude whistler waves propagating obliquely with respect to the ambient magnetic field.  These waves may play a significant role in accelerating the radiation belt electrons to relativistic energies within a few seconds time scale. This project will rigorously study the propagation of large-amplitude whistler waves in an inhomogeneous magnetic field and plasma density by solving the fully nonlinear cold electron fluid equation coupled with relativistic test particle simulation code.  Previous work in this area has been limited to the quasi-linear regime, uniform magnetic field and density and parallel propagation of the whistler waves.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide variety of physics based models are being developed to forecast radaition belt variations for space weather applications. It is important to know whether or not obliquely propagating waves are an important source of particle acceleration.  It is similary important to know to what extent a fully nonlinear treatment of the problem is required.  In addition to the societal benefits of this research because of its relevance to space weather forecasting, the project has educational benefits as well because a postdoctoral researcher will participate in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Among the discoveries made in the 1960s by artificial satellites is that the Earth's upper atmosphere, also known as the space environment, is filled with radiation. The so-called radiation belt is named after the discoverer James Van Allen. The radiation belt is made of highly energetic electrons that may damage or adversely influence the satellite operations. This region coincides with geo-stationary satellite orbits, so it is important to understand natural processes taking place in such regions for communication and surveillance purposes. For this reason, the study of how these electrons are energized is ongoing. The University of Maryland Principle Investigator of the NSF-funded project, Dr. Peter H. Yoon, developed a theory according to which, whistler waves may interact with the electrons and energize them to high energies. Whistlers are familiar radio signals that are generated by atmospheric lightening, and can be remotely detected on the ground in the opposite hemisphere with radio receivers. That is, lightening strikes in Amazon forest that generate whistler waves can be detected in North America with simple radio receivers. In the space environment much farther out than the radiation belt, known as the solar wind, similar whistler waves can be generated naturally by energetic electrons constantly streaming out from the surface of the Sun. When such natural whistler waves interact with the electrons in the outer space, they can resonate and accelerate the electrons to high energies, in much the same way as the radiation belt electrons are energized. Dr. Yoon took a general approach in which the radiation belt processes as well as physical phenomena taking place in the much wider solar wind can be discussed under a uniform formaiism. An armada of spacecraft orbiting around the Sun at a distance roughly equal to Earth's distance away from the Sun are constantly monitoring the electrons and other radiations emanating from the Sun. Among them are spacecraft called WIND and STEREO. In collaboration with scientists from the University of California Berkeley, Beijing University, China, and Kyung Hee University, Korea, Dr. Yoon recently compared the energy spectrum of the electron distribution function measured by WIND and STEREO spacecraft, against his theoretical energy spectrum, which is based upon the said whistler-electron interaction model. He found a very reasonable comparison, and his finding is published in The Astrophysical Journal [S. Kim, P. H. Yoon, G. S. Choe, and L. Wang, Asymptotic theory of solar wind electrons, Astrophys. J., vol. 806, 32 (2015)].</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/01/2015<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;H&nbsp;Yoon</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
