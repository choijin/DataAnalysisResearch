<AbstractNarration>20th ACM International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC) seeks to increase student participation in symposium and the field. The proposed funding would support the travel of eligible US students to the symposium. Recipients would be able to attend the main conference, workshops, and tutorials. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

For the students who received the travel awards, it made a difference in that they were able to attend one of the top conferences in distributed systems.  Training and Development:  The research skill that the participating students learned by attending the ACM HPDC 2011 conference is invaluable in shaping them into future researchers and professors.  Contributions within Discipline:  The goal of the grant was to encourage the research interests and involvement of students who would otherwise have been unlikely to attend HPDC due to a lack of funding, under-representation in the field, lack of institutional tie to the HPDC community, or other reasons. The impact on these studentsÆ education and enthusiasm for research in high-performance computing and distributed systems was high. They had the opportunity to witness first hand cutting edge research, presentations, and discussions, an experience they would likely not otherwise have.  Contributions to Human Resource Development:  15 students were able to attend the HPDC 2011 conference as a direct result of this travel award.
