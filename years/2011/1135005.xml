<AbstractNarration>Column shear-axial failure in existing vulnerable reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings constructed before the mid 1970's is a major seismic risk. The challenges associated with spatial response and system load redistribution capability at the onset of collapse has not been resolved yet. The acceptance criteria in current seismic rehabilitation provisions are defined at the element level with no due consideration for the system robustness.  Four sets of three-dimensional, geographically distributed hybrid simulations (HS) will be conducted using the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) facility at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to obtain the response up to collapse of a representative three-dimensional structural system subjected to one-directional and tri-axial seismic ground motions. This research will investigate, characterize, model, and derive practical procedures for the consequences of column shear-axial failure on the collapse of existing vulnerable RC structures. The project will develop system-level acceptance criteria and analytical tools for near collapse seismic performance of existing non-ductile RC frame structures.  Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES Project Warehouse/data repository at http://www.nees.org.  This project is a collaborative effort between researchers from Northeastern University and Western Michigan University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project utilizes the unique HS capability provided by the NEES facility to simulate near collapse response of existing vulnerable RC buildings through the integration of large scale physical experiments and numerical models. If successful, this research project will shift the philosophy of structural assessment of vulnerable buildings from component-level to system-level evaluation. The application of system-level evaluation methods developed in this project can lead to more efficient and cost-effective rehabilitation methods for existing non-ductile RC buildings against collapse by identifying and prioritizing buildings susceptible to partial/total collapse. Thus, optimal use of limited resources can be made. A multi-level education and outreach program will provide students from K-12, college, and underrepresented groups, as well as high school physics teachers, with the opportunity to participate in project activities. This will include development of three teaching modules suitable for elementary, middle, and high school students covering the basics of earthquake engineering and topics relevant to collapse analysis. This award is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).</AbstractNarration>

These deficiencies can lead to failure of building columns during a severe earthquake. Perhaps the most important type of failure due to these deficiencies is what is known as shear-axial column failure, which is dangerous due to the increased risk of structural collapse after such failures. The effects of these failures on a buildingÆs global response during a severe seismic event, and the risk of collapse due to shear-axial column failure has been difficult to study in the past. Due in part to the complexity of system-level response, current seismic rehabilitation standards do not consider collapse resistance due to shear-axial column failure as a system-level behavior. Little information exists on the system-level response of three dimensional structures after shear-axial column failure.  Funded through the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) program and using the MUST-SIM laboratory (a NEES facility) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, this project aimed to study the system-level response of two representative pre-1970 building models through hybrid simulation.

The project consisted of four hybrid simulations, each involving full-scale column tests. The simulations were successfully conducted and in each test multiple full-scale reinforced concrete columns in the lab interacted with a mid-rise (7-10 story) older reinforced concrete structure modeled in the computer program OpenSees, and the combined systems were subjected to severe earthquake motions to observe the damage and collapse-resistance.  It was determined from the simulation results that the shear failure of a column can cause additional demand in the column directly above it, which can lead to a chain-reaction of failures along the height. However, in this project it was demonstrated that these additional failures only marginally affect the system response after failure, which is an important finding in identifying buildings that are susceptible to collapse in practice.  Modeling two subsequent failures in an RC element is known to be challenging. In this project, two new models were developed, which capture such behaviors:  1)      A new model for bar slip was developed, which had two main advantages over existing models, in that it can capture the column behavior after flexural-axial failure and is computationally more effective compared to existing models.  2)      A new element was developed to capture the combined flexural-shear-axial failure behavior observed in the second test, in which the failure had started with flexural-axial failure.  These new models can be used to more effectively evaluate response of reinforced concrete structures under earthquakes through more accurate representation of column damage in analytical studies.  The researchers on this project have supported outreach programs with the community, each year introducing young students and children to STEM fields and specifically to earthquake engineering research through shake-table demonstrations and hands-on projects. The research of this project was an integral component in the fulfillment of studies for graduation of one MS student, one PhD student, and several undergraduate students, all of whom gained significant research experience in the field of seismic response of structures, hybrid simulation, and experimental testing.  The physical test columns in the lab were largely destroyed during each of the experiments, in most cases losing all of their lateral strength and their capacity to hold the weight of the floors above them. However, the building structures did not collaps...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
