<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PIs propose just the first-year study of a program of research for "Hybrid Aerial Vehicles" that routinely execute dynamic maneuvers to land on, move along, and take off from sites such as walls, roofs, trees and power lines. These platforms combine the best attributes of unmanned aircraft and climbing robots. They can reach remote sites rapidly, flying directly to them. After landing, they can move along surfaces to strategic locations and provide stable inspection platforms while consuming little power for hours or days. If they cling tenaciously, they can also ride out weather that is too rough for flight. When conditions improve, or the mission changes, they can jump off and become airborne, flying to a new site..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Although this is only an initial investigation, the PIs suggest, in addition to the usual publication and web-based dissemination, the long-term impact of the larger project will be enhanced with workshops organized to bring together academic and industry experts in the emerging topic of perching aircraft. The proposal also includes a new course to be offered during MIT?s Independent Activities Period that will introduce undergraduates to interesting problems that arise at the intersection of aerodyamics, robotics and bio-inspired mechanisms. The course takes advantage of the low cost of small RC planes to provide hands-on testing and prototyping. Based on the experience gained in running the course, the same material will be adapted to a short course for high school students, organized in collaboration with the Stanford School of Education. Both laboratories have a strong track record of involving undergraduates and under-represented minorities in research and in outreach to local high schools. To help disseminate the educational material, all software and hardware will be open source.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under this program, we have developed numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for feedback control of high-speed and agile UAVs, as well as more general algorithms for planning and feedback control through contact.   In the work led by student Ani Majumdar (now faculty at Princeton), we have developed a planning and control strategy for UAVs using a library of motion primitives that guarantee safety during high-speed maneuvers in the face of bounded uncertainty using sums-of-squares optimization.  Our algorithms combine these motion primitives with fast online collision checking to give rigorous certificates of a UAV darting through dense obstacles.   We were able to extend these algorithms to "hybrid UAVs", and more generally to any mechanical system that makes and breaks contact with the environment.  We have developed trajectory optimization algorithms for planning through contact (without apriori specifying the contact sequence), and using sums-of-squares to verify stability of the multi-contact system.  Making these algorithms tractable required finding and exploiting some surprising connections between sums-of-squares Lyapunov analysis and models of non-smooth mechanics. Finally, we turned our attention to dealing with the types of perception systems available onboard UAVs.  Our last year developed a series of algorithms for reactive control for very high-speed flight with depth sensing through dense obstacles.  These address the limitations in sensing at high-speed -- avoiding the need to build a globally consistent map (which is hard due to IMU errors at high speeds).   The algorithms developed here are already being investigated for use by major industry partners for autonoous driving and they formed the basis for MITs entry in the DARPA Fast-Lightweight Autonomy (FLA) program.
