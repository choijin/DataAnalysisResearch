<AbstractNarration>We receive and analyze information from our environment through multiple senses (i.e. sensory channels).  When we interact socially, for example, we not only listen to someone?s words but we also read their body language to interpret their meaning.  But how does information from different sensory channels interact to influence our social decisions?  In this series of studies we will determine how acoustic and visual cues influence mate choice decisions in the túngara frog.  As do most frogs, túngara frogs advertise for mates with loud and conspicuous mating calls.  Females compare mating calls among males and use this information to choose a mate.  But the female?s decision is also influenced by the presence of a visual cue, the male?s large and conspicuous vocal sac.  Using robotic frogs we have shown that females prefer a calling male with a large inflating-deflating vocal sac to a male producing the same call but without a dynamic vocal sac.  We build upon those results to address several fundamental questions about how acoustic and visual cues interact to influence female decision making: What is the relative value of acoustic and visual cues? Does the addition of visual cues influence a female?s memory of calls? Do visual cues aid in recognizing individual males in large choruses? Does the addition of a visual cue influence the time it takes for females to make decisions? All of these studies will provide insights into how animals, including humans, integrate information in the environment around them through different sensory channels.  In the process of this work, we will be training approximate 25 students, many of them women and minorities, in the use of robotic technologies to study behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Animal signals in nature are diverse and include fascinating ornamentation and behavior.  For example, peacock tails, complex bird songs, butterfly wing colors, the red hourglass on black widow spiders, and vertical leaps made by antelope have all evolved as communication signals to other species.  In this project, we set out to understand how natural processes shape the evolution of such animal signals.  To do this, we studied the t&uacute;ngara frog and it?s primary predator, the fringe-lipped bat.  Male t&uacute;ngara frogs gather at ponds nightly during the tropical rainy season and produce vocalizations, often in large groups.  While vocalizing, the males also inflate a conspicuous vocal sac in their throat.  Female t&uacute;ngara frogs listen to the sound that males make and look for the inflating vocal sac.  Because the signal has components in both the acoustic and visual modalities, it is referred to as a multimodal signal.  If a female deems a male?s multimodal signal to be "attractive enough" she will choose to mate with him and the male?s genetically heritable signal will be passed on to future generations.  If not, the male will likely never mate, and his signal will not be passed on.  In this way, female mate choice can determine how male signals evolve.  Unfortunately for the male t&uacute;ngara frog, females are not the only ones observing them.  So are fringe-lipped bats.  These bats have specially modified ears that allow them to passively listen for the male?s call.  In addition, they use their sophisticated echolocation system to find the male?s inflating vocal sac.  This allows the bat to accurately locate individual males in a group and single them out for a meal.  So male t&uacute;ngara frogs face the dual challenge of attracting a mate and avoiding their bat predators.         T&uacute;ngara frogs are an excellent system to address questions about signal evolution because both frogs and bats readily respond to experimental playbacks of male mating signals.  By employing a robotic frog that closely mimics a live calling male, we were able to ask a series of sophisticated questions about how both bats and frogs detect and respond to complex, multimodal (e.g. audiovisual) signals.  One of the major hypotheses for why animal signals are often multimodal, is that the additional components make it easier for intended receivers (e.g. members of their own species) to pick out the signaler.           Our research has revealed a far more complex and interesting system than we originally suspected.  For t&uacute;ngara frogs, the visual component of the male?s vocal sac does improve a female?s ability to locate a male.  This improved ability is quite limited, however.  When we simulated a more noisy acoustic environment, similar to what frogs often face in nature, we found that the visual part of the signal became less effective at allowing females to pick out males.  In fact, when the acoustic complexity got high enough (e.g. overlapping noise), it actually made female performance even worse than if no visual cue were present at all.  When the visual cue is present, the nervous system of female frogs automatically integrates both the vision and acoustic signals together.  As the background noise reaches a certain level, the frogs seem to experience a sort of "cognitive overload" and lose their ability to efficiently choose a mate.  Interestingly, this is not unlike how humans integrate lip movements and sounds into speech comprehension.  Like the frogs, visual cues enhance our auditory processing abilities, but only to a certain point. Bats on the other hand, do not seem to suffer the same problem.  They tend to prefer to hunt by passive listening for male calls.  When the mating scene becomes especially noisy, however, they switch tactics and rely more on echolocation, specifically honing in on the male?s moving vocal sac.  In this way, the bats appear to be better equipped to "cut through the noise" and continue to be able to efficiently locate their prey.          Thus our research has shown that nature has favored the use of audiovisual signals for frogs communicating in small groups.  When the group size becomes too large, however, the effectiveness of this complex signal breaks down, effectively overloading their nervous system.  The bat nervous system, however, has evolved to more efficiently handle noisy environments.  Our results point to exciting future avenues of research that will likely reveal how different vertebrate brains have solved problems of communicating in noise.      In addition, we have produced a graphic-style novel, museum displays, acoustic training workshops, and mock experimental studies.  These have served to increase public understanding of the natural history of frogs and bats as well as the science of acoustic ecology.
