<AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Energy, Power, and Adaptive Systems (EPAS) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) and the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) Program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives and Approaches:  The objective of this research is to design, fabricate and characterize unique solar cell devices based on strained core-shell semiconductor nanowires.    The approach is to design the strained core-shell nanowires so that spatial separation of the electrons and holes occur quantum mechanically on a very short time scale which results in longer charge lifetimes.  Photovoltaic devices will be fabricated from these nanowires and electronic structure and performance will be confirmed through optical and transport measurements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Most existing solar-cell technologies use electric fields to separate electrons and holes which can be inefficient and slow.  Design of strained core-shell nanowires can enable the rapid separation of electrons and holes through quantum confinement into different layers which should dramatically increase the efficiency for converting light into usable power.  Control of the strain allows tuning of the band structure and offsets, which provides a route for optimizing the resulting solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This research has strong societal impacts because of the potential for designing high-efficiency solar cells for reducing dependence on fossil fuels.  The increased fundamental knowledge of electronic structure and transport in strained core-shell nanowires also significantly impacts nanowire electronics and nanowire-based chemical or biological sensors.  The proposed research will train undergraduate and graduate students in advanced theoretical and experimental nanotechnology techniques.  In addition, a summer workshop for select high school teachers will guide new educational materials development to allow future students to share in the excitement of and knowledge behind this alternate energy research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Semiconductor nanowires have recently emerged as a new class of materials with significant potential for the advancement of understanding of fundamental physics and for new applications in device physics. This research in this project has brought together expertise in state-of-the-art semiconductor nanowire growth, in modeling of these structures, and in experimental efforts that will advance the understanding of semiconductor nanowires which have a core and a shell composed of the same material but grown with two different crystalline symmetries or composed of two different materials with different lattice constants.  Both of these configurations can lead to remarkable phenomena with new technological opportunities, including unique solar cell designs.  Intellectual Merit:  We have designed, grown and then fabricated and characterized devices based on these two configurations of semiconductor nanowires.  We have used both optical techniques, including the new technique of transient Raleigh scattering as well as photocurrent spectroscopy to advance the understanding of the wurtzite crystalline structure of the semiconductor nanowire indium phosphide (InP), a structure not found in nature.  We have explored the energy levels of the valence band as well as a second conduction band, measurements required in order to explore suitable device configurations.  Strained core shell nanowire configurations were found to have a large number of defects and so work was pursued on the two materials GasAsSb/InP which are largely unstrained, have appropriate bandgaps with spatially separated electrons and holes, and which were measured to be coherent and defect-free structures.  Fourteen papers were published on this work providing new information and techniques for utilizing nanowire heterostructures for new technologies.  Broader Impacts:  This research has strong societal impacts because of the potential for designing high-efficiency solar cells for reducing dependence on fossil fuels. The increased fundamental knowledge of electronic structure and transport in these nanowire structures also significantly impacts nanowire electronics and nanowire-based chemical or biological sensors.  As part of this program we have trained both undergraduate and graduate students in advanced theoretical and experimental nanotechnology techniques.   Both graduate and undergraduate students have been involved in outreach to the public as part of the Cincinnati Museum Center, and worked with students in elementary to high schools, providing an introduction to scientific research into nanostructures.
