<AbstractNarration>The strengthening effect of grain boundaries is one of the key components in the development of modern structural materials which is responsible for beneficial effects arising from ultra fine grained and nanostructured materials, and grain boundary engineering. The precise nature of the often beneficial effects of grain boundaries, however, has not been understood to a level which would allow for theory-guided optimization of microstructures and accelerated alloy development. In this research, based on collaboration between Michigan State University (MSU) and the Max Planck Institut für Eisenforschung (MPIE) in Düsseldorf, Germany, the investigators combine, improve, and apply recently developed approaches to examine and quantify the micromechanical behavior of grain boundaries using techniques based upon microscopy and conical indentation tests. Combined use of electron backscattered electron pattern mapping, atomic force microscopy, 3-D x-ray characterization, and focused ion beam/electron imaging methods provide quantified measures of activated slip behavior. These methods are used to assess deformation caused by conical indentation to relate detailed indentation topographies to the plastic anisotropy of single crystals. The methods provide an efficiency advantage over traditional single and bi-crystal experiments. Initially, ?single crystal? characterization will occur using indents in grain interiors, and as modeling fidelity is developed using dislocation density based constitutive models implemented in crystal plasticity finite element analyses, indentations near and on grain boundaries will be used to assess the grain boundary transmissivity of slip and mechanical twinning behavior. From observed transmissivity behavior, models for grain boundary transmissivity will be implemented into the constitutive models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implemented approach, combined with state of the art characterization and simulation methods, can lead to a quantitative understanding of the interplay between grain boundaries and heterogeneous plasticity in titanium polycrystals. Complementary skills in characterization (MSU) and simulation (MPIE) are available to reach the stated goals. Extensive exchanges between the two laboratories occur principally during summers in order to integrate experimental and analytical outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The effect of grain boundaries[1] on deformation, strengthening, and damage generation is a key issue upon which material development and design depends.  As grain boundaries must accommodate the heterogeneous deformation that takes place in grains on either side, the overarching goal of this program was to combine advanced characterization tools and crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) modeling to gain a better understanding of the role of grain boundaries on mechanical behavior. This knowledge was used to assess how well crystal plasticity models simulate heterogeneous polycrystalline deformation.  This joint research project between Michigan State University (MSU) and Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Eisenforschung (MPIE) in D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany made use of our complementary expertise in characterization (MSU) and simulation (MPIE) that enabled us to reach our goals.  Progress was enhanced through exchange visits at both partner sites for a full month each year.   Using nanoindentation[2] with a spheroconical tip, we investigated and quantified the micromechanical influence of grain boundaries on dislocation activity triggered by localized deformation near grain boundaries.  When combined with backscattered electron imaging, electron backscattered pattern (EBSD) mapping, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and focused ion beam (FIB) sectioning, dislocation slip behavior[3] across boundaries was quantified.  We developed an automated method to generate a computational model of an indent adjacent to a grain boundary, illustrated in Figure 1.  Simulating these events allowed details of the deformation processes to be directly related to indentation topographies.  In the example shown, slip on a prism (rectangular shaped) plane under the indent impacted the grain boundary and stimulated slip on a prism planes in the neighboring grain.  Analysis of differences between the experiment and computational model reveal how much the boundary resisted the transfer of strain from the prism slip to the basal slip planes, and indicates what kinds of modeling strategies are needed to capture the physical processes of deformation that take place at grain boundaries.   We also used far-field 3-D X-ray microscopy approaches recently developed by other researchers to measure heterogeneous elastic strains within grains during deformation (detector is far from the sample to resolve elastic strain) and to identify mechanical twin nucleation[4] at grain boundaries (which accommodates heterogeneous strain evolution).  Figure 2 illustrates how a tensile sample was deformed while a sheet of X-rays were producing diffraction patterns.  The elastic strain from individual grains in the beam cross section was determined from these diffraction patterns and converted into the resolved shear stress acting on 6 different potential twin variations.  A mechanical twin was observed to nucleate on variant 3 in grain 124.  Upon unloading, this twin shrank, but did not disappear, as illustrated in the near-field slice that accurately reveals the grain geometry after the sample was unloaded.  This is the first time that the stress state associated with twin nucleation, as well as subsequent detwinning, was measured quantitatively.  This data set has been used to generate a 3-D computational model of the grain structure in this sample to enable direct comparison between model and experiment.  The intellectual merit of this work has led to quantified understanding of how computational modeling needs to incorporate the physics of deformation transfer across grain boundaries.  From improvements in modeling the heterogeneous deformation processes near grain boundaries, it will be possible to predict conditions that lead to rare events such as damage or crack nucleation.  Thus, the broad impact of this work will enable prediction of microstructural features that lead to damage, and thus enable strategies for designing material processing paths that minimize critical damag...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
