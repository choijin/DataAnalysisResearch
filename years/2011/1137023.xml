<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant will investigate the impact of project and problem based learning techniques on student performance in engineering statics, a course that serves as a "gateway" to engineering degree programs at most universities.  The study will rigorously investigate the effects on learning and motivation using sample and control groups drawing on expertise from both engineering and learning sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is that by understanding the impact of these teaching methods on students in large, introductory engineering courses it may be possible to improve student performance at the large number of engineering schools that offer similar courses.  The proposal includes a plan to develop a strong research partnership.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this study, group design projects were introduced to a sophomore level engineering course that is traditionally taught with only lecture.  Students in the section with projects were compared to students in another section taught without projects.  Tools to measure student content knowledge and studentsÆ attitudes toward engineering were used to make the comparisons. Student groups were also video recorded in order to analyze how they approached the design project. We found that the use of projects helped students form a link between their beliefs about their own engineering abilities and their expectations about engineering.

However, in this course innovation was not as necessary to complete the assignment. Hence, although more studies are needed, it was determined that the level of innovation required to solve or complete a project may be another variable affecting gender interactions.   This project makes a contribution to research about engineering education by evaluating the effect of design projects in a routine course, as opposed to a senior design project course.  It is also unique in that it looked at student outcomes beyond just content knowledge.  By providing evidence about the effectiveness of different teaching techniques this project contributes to efforts to reform engineering education.  An important challenge facing engineering education is the need to retain more students.
