<AbstractNarration>This workshop evaluates the possible opportunities for new and innovative social scientific research presented by the increasing interplay between social science scholars and law school faculty. Law schools have hired an increasing number of PhDs in the social sciences; law professors are increasingly more interested in empirical social science research methods; and there has been a strengthening of research and educational ties between law schools and other academic departments and units. The workshop evaluates these trends and considers ways in which this interplay may be organizationally and programmatically consolidated in order to ensure continuation of high quality research by socio-legal scholars in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will lay the foundations for enhanced collaboration among law and social science programs and centers/institutes with respect to research projects, as well as graduate training and mentoring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A two-day workshop on the interplay between social science and law schools convened on May 3-4, 2012 at the Center for the Study of Law and Society at the University of California, Berkeley.  The workshop brought together 40 leading faculty members and 16 doctoral students from a range of universities and programs in law and social science.  Participants represented expertise in the anthropology of law, criminology, critical race theory, law and economics, legal history, law, legal studies, law and political science, law and psychology, and the sociology of law.  Among the participants were multiple law school deans and directors of major research centers and programs in law and social science. The goal of the workshop was to think critically about the visions, challenges, and future trajectories of the interplay between the social sciences and law schools.  The occasion for the workshop stemmed from three trends: the continued presence and rise of multiple interdisciplinary (e.g., law and society, empirical legal studies, new legal realism, critical legal studies, critical race studies, law and economics) and disciplinary movements (e.g., interest sections in every major social science disciplinary association) that address law; increasing numbers of law school faculty with PhDs in the social sciences, ranging from 20% to 40% of tenure-track faculty in top-25 law schools; and the strengthening of ties between law schools and social science units on university campuses.  Participants discussed the trade-offs of alternative structures of PhD education in social science and law, including joint degree (PhD/JD), interdisciplinary law-school and arts-and-science based, and certificate/concentration programs.  A consensus emerged that educational structures differed in the degree of integration they offer between law and social science, the depth possible in either law or a disciplinary social science, and the implications for career pathways for graduates.  No single structure emerged as "best" in discussion; rather, participants believed the existence of a plurality of structures could serve students with different educational and career goals. A discussion on deanÆs perspectives focused on the underlying rationales for PhD training in law and social science, including how such training might alter the curricula and faculty hiring for law schools.  A third discussion focused on the differences between social science and legal scholarship in terms of goals, methods, and evaluation (e.g., peer review versus student review of articles).  A summary discussion among participants covered a number of topics, including how differential patterns of PhD appointments to law schools might further fragment the field and alter curricula and educational goals at elite and non-elite schools.  To extend these discussions, Calvin Morrill presented a summary of the May workshop at a panel (organized by Anna-Maria Marshall) on the future of law and society at the 2012 Law &amp; Society Association annual meetings and organized a panel (with Lauren Edelman, Laura G&oacute;mez, Sid Liu, Mark Suchman, and John Sutton &ndash; all of whom attended the May workshop) on the future of the sociology of law in sociology departments and law schools for the 2013 American Sociological Association annual meetings.
