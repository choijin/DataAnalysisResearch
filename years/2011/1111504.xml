<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Helen O. Leung and Prof. Mark D. Marshall of Amherst College and their undergraduate research students will investigate pathways of chemical reactions through the analysis of rotational spectra obtained via Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy.  Included in these studies are the interactions responsible for bringing molecules together for reaction. This involves the interplay between electrostatic and steric effects. They will be explored in  systematic studies of gas-phase intermolecular complexes between protic acids and haloethylenes, the first signs of electron rearrangement that signal the start of chemical reaction in complexes containing the reactive hydroxyl radical, and the ultimate disposition of chemical energy at the end of reaction by determining the partitioning of energy among the internal degrees of freedom of sulfur dioxide produced in thermal extrusion reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will contribute to a better fundamental understanding of the basic principles responsible for the chemical transformation of matter and could potentially have direct application to the chemistry of the atmosphere and of combustion.  Through it, Prof. Leung and Prof. Marshall will provide their undergraduate research students with the opportunity to perform demanding experiments where they learn to integrate and apply material learned in the classroom and to communicate their findings through presentations at national profession meetings and publications in the scientific literature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the early days of modern organic chemistry and continuing to the present, the addition of electron withdrawing or electron donating groups to hydrocarbons has been recognized to influence both the site of reaction and the identity of the products in chemical processes.  Through this NSF-supported research, which determines structures of weakly associated complexes formed between two molecules, it has been found that these simple ideas are not sufficient to fully explain the interactions between two molecules.  Understanding these interactions is important because they are a necessary first step on the path toward chemical reaction.  In addition to the influence of oppositely charged regions of the pair upon each other, the manner in which the two molecules best fit together, like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, must be considered.  These two effects may act in concert with or in competition with each other.  The nature of this interplay is clearly seen in the results from this research.  For example, three departures from previously observed behavior are seen in the structures of complexes formed between the simplest unsaturated hydrocarbon, ethylene, in which one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced with a fluorine and/or chlorine atom on the one hand, and a small protic acid, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, or acetylene, on the other.  Prior to this work, all complexes were observed to be planar with an interaction between the acid and a fluorine atom (if available) on the haloethylene.  Additionally, the general shape of the complex, or mode of binding, was independent of the acid used.   New results show that (1) the binding mode of the acid to vinyl chloride depends on the acid identity;  (2) vinyl chloride-hydrogen chloride is nonplanar; and (3) the binding of acetylene to (Z)-1-chloro-2-fluoroethylene proceeds via the chlorine atom.  Finally, the characterization of complexes formed between various halogenated ethylenes and the argon atom, obtained simultaneously with the protic acid species, suggests that a third influence, the dispersion interaction arising from the quantum mechanical, wave-like nature of the correlated motion between electrons on the two molecules is an important influence in many of these complexes.  NSF support allowed further development of and improvements to a chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectrometer.  Using state-of-the art electronic technology for high speed generation and capture of microwave signals, this instrument continues to greatly enhance the capabilities of the laboratory.  In particular, when used in conjunction with more established cavity-based instruments, also in the laboratory, it has proven to be an effective method for introducing undergraduates to molecular spectroscopy and scientific research.  This NSF grant has provided 36 separate research opportunities to 18 undergraduate students.  Through active research, these students become familiar and comfortable with the increasingly complex technological world.  The integration of theory and practice in a research lab is the essence of science and must be experienced first-hand by a student.  In addition to the specific skills learned in microwave spectroscopy and in quantum chemistry calculations, participation in research provides training in critical thinking and allows students to explore their options for a career in science.  The research experience is especially valuable during the studentsÆ formative years as young scientists, as they learn to integrate and apply material learned in the classroom and through textbooks.  The hands-on approach of a realistic, challenging, and relevant research project using multi-component, state-of-the-art equipment is a necessary part of a complete education.  With NSF support, many of these students have attended the International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy where some have had the additional opportunity to present their results in a contr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
