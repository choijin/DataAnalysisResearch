<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Debra Dolliver of the Department of Chemistry &amp; Physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, in collaboration with Professors Kevin Shaughnessy and Professor Timothy Snowden from the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, will study synthetic methodology to produce N-heteroatomic imines in single geometries and applying these compounds for the synthesis of asymmetric amines.  There are three specific aims:  1) to investigate the palladium-catalyzed coupling of N-heteroatomic-substituted imidoyl halides with a variety of coupling partners; 2) to initiate studies to reverse the role of the imine species in Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions from that of the organohalide to that of the organometallic reagent by synthesizing an N-heteroatomic imidoyl metal compound; and 3) to synthesize geometrically-controlled N-heteroatomic imine derivatives containing an asymmetric center in the heteroatomic group attached to nitrogen and investigate facial selectivity of these compounds to nucleophilic addition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has significant impacts on fundamental biological sciences, pharmaceutical and agricultural industries, as it would provide ready access to chiral amines important in the chemical synthesis of complex molecules of potent biological activities.  The project also provides trainings for undergraduate students in preparation for careers in the physical science fields, which is very significant considering the high percentage of first generation college students and groups underrepresented in the physical sciences at the PI's institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work supported by this grant established routes to synthesize oxime ethers such that the atoms in these types of molecules have specific placement in three dimensional space.  This is relevant to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry as nature is very sensitive to the orientation of atoms/groups in space, and development of strategies to establish reliable 3D placement of these atoms/groups is important to these industries.  In addition, this work contributed to the fundamental understanding of the geometric stability of carbon-nitrogen double bonds in certain molecules.  Molecules containing this group often have biological activity, and a better understanding of the geometric orientation of groups attached to a carbon-nitrogen double bond can help in the design and development of synthetic routes to important pharmaceutical compounds.    The funds from this grant allowed eight undergraduates to directly participate in publishable research at Southeastern Louisiana University during the regular term and at The University of Alabama in the summer.  Of these eight students, five are currently in graduate chemistry programs at various universities (University of Michigan, Purdue, Louisiana State University, Duke) and one is currently applying for graduate school.  Two of the students are only juniors, but have intent of pursuing careers in chemistry.   The desire of all these student to seek  a higher degree in chemistry was certainly positively impacted by the research experience provided by this grant.
