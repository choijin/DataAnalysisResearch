<AbstractNarration>This award provides $25K funding per year for three years for a PI and co-PI to provide staff support to a Roundtable on Technology, Science, and Peacebuilding.  The roundtable will convene individuals from government, industry, and non- governmental organizations to identify opportunities for the use of science, engineering, and technology to enhance peacebuilding. The roundtable will facilitate a collaborative effort to address major challenges giving rise to global conflict and to apply appropriate science and engineering knowledge and technologies to specific problems in conflict zones.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By applying science and engineering knowledge and technology to major issues that give rise to international conflict, such as natural resource scarcity, this award may have a significant impact.  A sizeable portion of the world population lives in areas of conflict or potential conflict. The roundtable also provides an innovative model for education and outreach for the next generation science, engineering, and technology workforce.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The roundtable brings together experts in foreign policy, peacebuilding, business, and science, engineering, and technology research.  This promotes understanding of the complex issues giving rise to global conflict and of potential strategies for addressing them.  It also facilitates broad-based public-private partnerships that enhance the impact of NSF-funded research in addressing societal problems and promoting innovation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) established the Roundtable on Technology, Science, and Peacebuilding in 2011 to forge sustainable connections among organizations and individuals working in the technology, science, engineering, and peacebuilding communities in order to strengthen and expand the roles that technology, engineering and science can play in reducing and preventing violent conflict around the globe.

Financial support for the initiative was provided by the following participating organizations: USIP,  NAE Fund, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Departments of State, Defense and Agriculture, Qualcomm, Inc., and CRDF Global.  During its first two years, the Roundtable focused on four areas of opportunity.  Each was the subject of a workshop involving experts in peacebuilding, engineering, and science from major stakeholder communities that resulted in a published workshop summary.       The May 1, 2012 workshop, Adapting Agricultural Extension Systems to Peacebuilding, assessed what peacebuilding activities might be delivered as components of existing agricultural extension services in zones of conflict and what organizational modifications and new capabilities would be required to support these efforts.  Subsequently, in January 2013, with funding from U.S. Department of Agriculture, USIP staff traveled to Faisalabad, Pakistan to test curriculum developed to train Afghan and Pakistani agricultural extension agents in conflict analysis.   http://www.nap.edu/catalog/13428/adapting-agricultural-extension-to-peacebuilding-report-of-a-workshop-by  The May 23, 2012 workshop, Using Data Sharing to Improve Coordination in Peacebuilding, identified the needs a data sharing system must address in order to secure participation of other federal agencies and non-federal organizations with a role in peacebuilding, and thereby facilitate more effective coordination in conflict zones.

Presentations explored  scenarios of potential violence drawn from recent country cases, and identified a set of technologies, applications and strategies that might be adapted for conflict prevention or mitigation by those directly involved.  http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18349/sensing-and-shaping-emerging-conflicts-report-of-a-joint-workshop  The November 20, 2012 Workshop on Harnessing Operational Systems Engineering to Support Peacebuilding assessed the potential of operational systems engineering (OSE) to improve effectiveness of peacebuilding efforts in diverse conflict zones. It examined important challenges facing peacebuilders in Kenya, South Sudan, and Haiti that lend themselves to the useful application of OSE methods and approaches, and mapped out targeted collaborations between the peacebuilding and systems engineering communities to improve t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
