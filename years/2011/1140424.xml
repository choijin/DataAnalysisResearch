<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project between the University of Texas at Austin (a PhD granting university) and the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth (an MS granting institution) is investigating the impact of undergraduate engineering curricula on the innovation capabilities of undergraduate engineering students. The mechanical engineering departments at both universities are studying innovation capability of students and looking for correlations between their curricula and changes in innovation ability. The goal of the research is to determine to what extent the undergraduate engineering curricula improve graduate innovation capability. The project is establishing instruments for measuring the innovation capability of students that consist of concept generation exercises where students solve open-ended design problems and a survey to investigate student creative self-efficacy. These instruments contain metrics for assessing the level of originality and technical feasibility of student designs and are being used to determine the effect the complete undergraduate curriculum and the effect of individual courses (design-oriented courses, for example) on student innovation capabilities. This is being accomplished by assessing student innovation capabilities at the entry and exit points of the curriculum and at the beginning and end of selected courses. The research is also correlating innovation capability with student technical performance as measured using the student's grade-point ratio. Because the work is being carried out using very distinct student populations, the work will have a national impact. Major contributions of the project include an instrument for assessing innovation capabilities and a better understanding of the relationship between engineering curricula and the development of innovative engineers.</AbstractNarration>

We defined innovation capabilities as how well students were able to generate original solutions to open-ended design problems involving the development of next-generation products, such as alarm clocks or litter collection systems.   In assessing the effect of the undergraduate curriculum on the innovation capabilities of engineering students, we had 3 aims: 1. Develop a way to measure innovation that would be validated, repeatable, applicable to multiple design problems, and shareable with researchers across universities. 2. Build fundamental knowledge of the effect of the undergraduate curriculum by comparing students at different points in their college careers (ex. freshmen vs. seniors) and assessing student groups over time (longitudinal analyses). 3.

Future research should develop educational interventions to build studentsÆ creativity skills earlier in college.   To address the third aim of assessing the role of student characteristics in innovation capability, we measured academic ability by collecting studentsÆ grade point averages (GPA) and having them fill out a survey of their engineering design self-efficacy, which is defined as a studentÆs belief in his/her abilities to develop solutions to design problems, present design ideas to others, and be creative. We tested the relationships between engineering design self-efficacy, GPA, and originality scores. For the majority of the students, GPA and engineering design self-efficacy were unrelated to their originality scores. We found a different result, ho...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
