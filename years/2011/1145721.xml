<AbstractNarration>Neuropeptides are important modulators of neuronal activity.  They are synthesized by and secreted from neurons to change the electrical properties of their target cells (other neurons or muscle cells).  In order to understand the way the nervous system controls behavior, a complete description of the neuropeptides and the precise way they affect their targets is needed.  In vertebrate nervous systems (including the human brain) this information is woefully incomplete because the number of neuropeptides is so large, and because the circuits they control are so large and complex.  This project will exploit the unique properties of the nematode nervous system; it is extremely simple, containing a total of only 298 neurons.  This enormous reduction in complexity should enable us to understand the role of neuropeptides in controlling the activity of the individual neurons within a circuit as they in turn control behavior.  Achieving this understanding is our ultimate goal.  The proposed research will involve a newly developed method for picking out identified neurons one at a time, and finding their peptide content by mass spectrometry.  The amino acid sequence of each peptide can be determined at the same time. This is a powerful method for finding which peptides are found in each individual neuron.  After the peptides have been identified and characterized, their biological activity will be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the striking simplicity of the nematode nervous system and its experimental accessibility, this project will allow us to continue to provide the valuable training opportunities that have already been made available to students, both pre-college students and undergraduates, who are entering research for the first time.  Previous efforts have already specifically involved the recruitment of women and underrepresented minorities into research, and this project will enable us to extend this important opportunity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are two important aspects of the outcomes of this project to report. First, and of highest importance, is the science that was completed.  The second was outreach and educational activities, which we take very seriously.  Scientific Progress.  We are studying the role of neuropeptides in the neuronal circuitry of the large parasitic nematode Ascaris suum. Neuropeptides are probably the most important class of neuromodulators. For many years we have concentrated on the motor nervous system, with the goal of understanding the cellular basis of locomotory behavior. Twenty-five years ago, we showed that the connectome, the network of synaptic connections between the constitutive neurons of the motor circuit, was not sufficient to describe locomotory behavior.  Our "functional circuit" included the electrophysiological properties of the neurons and their synapses, but it was not enough.  We then showed that there are many neuropeptides, numerically comparable to the number of neurons.  After chemically isolating endogenous peptides from the worm, we showed that they cause profound changes in the electrical properties of neurons. Clearly, the peptides and their physiological activity are a sine qua non for understanding circuit function.  Whether this additional information about peptides is sufficient to explain behavior remains to be seen.  One of the experimental strengths of A. suum is that the neurons are large and identifiable.  We can dissect single neurons and determine their neuropeptide content by mass spectrometry (MS); we can also determine the amino acid sequence of each peptide by tandem MS, all from a single neuron. In motor neurons (there are 7 classes of motor neurons, 5 excitatory and 2 inhibitory) the excitatory neurons (all cholinergic) fell into two further subsets, anteriorly projecting neurons controling anterior locomotion, and posteriorly projecting neurons controling posterior locomotion. Each class contains 7 peptides encoded by 2 genes, afp-14 and As-nlp-21 for anterior projectors, and afp-1 and afp-4 for posterior projectors.  Most peptides have profound effects on locomotory behavior and acetylcholine-induced muscle contraction.  The inhibitory motor neurons (neurotransmitter = GABA) also contain a peptide, As-NLP 22, which itself has a potent inhibitory action on muscle contraction (IC50 = 10-8M).  We also studied neuropeptide receptors. In most systems, almost all peptide receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).  We showed by single-cell RNA-Seq that each type of motorneuron expressed several GPCRs.  To simplify the analysis, we used a rapid screening technique in which single cloned receptors were expressed in yeast, in a strain which had been engineered by Prof James Broach (Penn State University) so that peptide-receptor binding stimulated an increase in growth rate. By bioinformatics, we identified several putative peptide-activated GPCRs expressed in motorneurons, and tested them with a large panel of peptides. We found surprising promiscuity.  Each GPCR was activated by 4-5 peptides.  Furthermore, estimates of binding constants gave very high values (ca. 10-4M).  These results are problematical, and we believe that the presence of an outer membrane on yeast cells may affect access of peptide to receptor and distort the results.  Outreach and Educational report  There are two mentoring situations to report.    The first was an undergraduate (Colin Wruck) who was supervised by Ms. Jennifer Knickelbine (female graduate student supported by this NSF grant). He is very intelligent and developed excellent laboratory skills.  He analysed the effects of peptides on the locomotory behavior of A. suum.  The second was of two African-American high-school students who joined the laboratory for 6 weeks.  They were mentored by Mr. Wruck, who was supervised by Ms. Knickelbine, and he undertook their training with great enthusiasm.  They were introduced to research, which was completely novel to them.  At first, they lacked confidence, but they became adept at performing experiments. They reported that they now felt much more prepared for the stresses of a college curriculum because they had responded successfully to the demands put upon them, which included not only conducting the experiments, but also creating a poster presentation, writing a research paper, and giving a PowerPoint presentation.    Ms Knickelbine has put great emphasis on her activities as a mentor.  She has been a mentor in A Million Women Mentors, pledged to commit at least 20 hours/year for 4 years to mentoring young scientists. Mentoring was a large part of her graduate education, particularly helping undergraduates and high school students to get lab experience in preparation for careers, college, and professional school. She has mentored 9 undergraduates and 2 high school students as part of UW-Madison’s Summer Science Institute.  We started a new undergraduate Neurobiology laboratory course, directed and taught by the PI and Prof Peter Lipton (Dept. of Neuroscience), with an additional section on animal behavior taught by Prof. Corinna Burger.  The new course was first offered to 12 undergraduates in Spring 2015 and continued each year until the PI retired in 2018, and Prof Lipton died in the summer of 2019.
