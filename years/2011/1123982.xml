<AbstractNarration>1123982&lt;br/&gt;Sheaff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place March 5-16, 2012 at the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Organized by Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Dr. Marcela Carena of the University of Chicago, and Dr. Daniel Chung of the University of Michigan, the institute will focus on the exploration of the Terascale, covering topics in particle physics, cosmology, and astrophysics.  The program will give students a broad picture of the three frontiers along which particle physics must advance to solve some of the crucial mysteries of our universe such as: the origin of mass, the nature of the dark matter, the generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry, and the possible unification of forces.  The three frontiers have been identified as the Energy Frontier, the Intensity Frontier and the Cosmic Frontier.  The PASI will also explore how current and planned future experiments in physics will advance our understanding of these frontiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation of young U.S. physicists along with their peers from a number of other countries in the Americas will provide them with international experience early-on in their careers.  This will help them prepare for the large global collaborations that involve people from very diverse backgrounds, which have now become frequent in these areas.  The organizers will develop and widely advertise web pages to disseminate the materials presented at the institute to the wider community.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    PASI2012 - Exploring the Terascale and Beyond     The University of Buenos Aires played host to this Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute from March 5 through March 16 of this year.  The three frontiers along which particle physics must advance in order to answer the many questions still outstanding in this field, the Energy, Intensity, and Cosmic Frontiers, provided the theme for the multidisciplinary program.  While the fields of particle physics and cosmology could be treated as separate fields some twenty years ago, it is clear by now that they are closely intertwined and advances in either one inform the other.     Thirty-one post docs and advanced graduate students, eighteen from institutions in the United States and thirteen from institutions in five countries in Latin America participated through an award  made by the PASI program supported jointly by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.  The PASI  award leveraged additional support from Brazil, Chile, and Argentina that allowed an additional 42 students from those countries to take advantage of this unique educational opportunity.  The student participants  from all countries were outstanding, which made for a very worthwhile and intellectually stimulating activity.    Approximately half of the advanced graduate students who participated were local, which reflects the high-quality of particle physics education in Argentina.     The international organizers, most of whom lectured at the institute, came from the U.S. and three different countries in the Southern Hemisphere.  The U.S. members were Marleigh Sheaff, chair, and Daniel Chung, both of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and  Marcela Carena of Fermilab and the University of Chicago.  They were assisted by three professors from Latin America, Gustavo Burdman of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, Marco Aurelio Diaz of the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile, and Daniel de Florian of the University of Buenos Aires.  De Florian also acted as chair of the local organizing committee.     The lectures covered a broad range of topics on all three frontiers. The advanced series of multidisciplinary lecture courses was augmented by discussion sessions at which the students could clarify their understanding through detailed answers to their questions,.  There were also many student talks and posters as well as a special one-day session highlighting experiments sited IN Latin America, AUGER (Argentina), DES(Chile), and HAWC(Mexico).  .  The full program can be viewed on the PASI2012 Web site, "http://www.hep.wisc.edu/~sheaff/PASI2012".  Carlos Garcia Canal, a well known Argentine particle theorist from the National University in La Plata, organized a round table on Collaborations as a wrap-up of the day's activities.  Two U.S. students gave short presentations at this round table.  Both had applied for and been awarded grants that allowed them to travel to Latin America to work with colleagues there.  Amanda Yoho, a graduate student at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, traveled to Brazil for a short-term visit,  Zigried Hampel-Arias, now a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, obtained a Fulbright fellowship that supported him to work for one year in Argentina  on the Auger experiment with the group in Bariloche.      Two more recent outcomes have resulted from contacts made at PASI2012.  One is that Boris Kayser of Fermilab was invited to Brazil to participate in  the XXXV Congresso Paulo Leal Ferreira.  This conference was held at the Institute of Theoretical Physics (IFT) of the State University of Sao Paulo (UNESP) from October 17-19, 2012.   It is organized by graduate students at the Institute.  One of the four organizers for this year's event was Fatima Araujo Machado, who was one of the Latin American student participants supported by this award.  Because she was so impressed by Kayser's lectures at PASI2012, she invited him to take part in the Congresso.     The...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
