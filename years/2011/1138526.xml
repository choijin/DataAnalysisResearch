<AbstractNarration>The University of Colorado proposes Computational Thinking for Teaching Computing (CT4TC) to develop a Computational Thinking (CT) empowered 21st century workforce by extending and validating the the research base of an iDREAMS strategy project. The iDREAMS project developed the Scalable Game Design curriculum that has been embedded in existing courses and used to introduce students to computational thinking through game and STEM simulation design. CT4TC will explore the influence of mediation as a pedagogical and scaffolding approach employed by teachers to implement Scalable Game Design curriculum, and assess subsequent impact on student motivation, performance and ownership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will have two expected outcomes. First, CT4TC will verify a theory of broadening participation in computing.  The project staff will explore the influence of mediation as pedagogical and scaffolding approaches employed by teachers as they implement Scalable Game Design curricula, and assess subsequent impact on student motivation, performance and ownership. Gender and ethnicity-specific effects of scaffolding approaches employed by teachers will be systematically researched and validated. Second, CT4TC will deliver CT education with measurable learning outcomes.  Measurable learning outcomes are essential to an iterative design approach based on providing feedback to professional development  models. The Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis, developed by the iDREAMS project, employs a unique Latent Semantic Analysis inspired mechanism of computationally analyzing games and STEM simulations submitted by students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will bring CT education to K-12 students in tech hub, urban, remote rural, and Native American communities. The focus of this investigation will be at the middle school level in computer education and STEM (mostly Science and Math) courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Based on student motivation data and observed practices from the iTEST iDREAMS project, we observed an emerging relationship between teachersÆ classroom practices and patterns in student motivation data. We theorized that pedagogical approaches influence mediation and other instructional decisions employed by teachers as they implemented Scalable Game Design curricula, which impacts student performance, ownership, engagement and efforts to broaden participation (in particular, with females in computer science education). This observed relationship, however, was preliminary and required further systematic study involving the development and validation of a classroom observation protocol focused on teacher-student and student-student interaction and mediation.       To study this interaction between pedagogy, student motivation and student learning we developed and validated instruments and methodology that could contribute to a theory of broadening participation in computer science education.    Beginning Spring 2012, we initiated a series of validity studies involving the CT4TC project advisory panel, teachers with varying levels of experience implementing Scalable Game Design units, and participating students. The instruments that we developed and validated during this period included:    1) Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis (CTPA) -- designed to measure student-learning skills and represent student content learning through real time analysis of studentsÆ programming projects.

The new tool is accessible on all computer platforms and has been pilot tested with students. An analysis of student responses using the revised CTP-VS found that many students were able to successfully make connections between new situations and prior games. StudentsÆ responses also illustrated ways in which they were able to infer computational thinking patterns from natural and social phenomena.      Using classroom instruction data collected from teachers using SCOPE and student motivation data from those same teachersÆ students, we summarized the percentage of students interested in taking another game design class and disaggregated the data by gender. Differences between the percentage of males and females interested in similar experiences were computed. We also summarized the observed pedagogical approaches for each teacher according to four c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
