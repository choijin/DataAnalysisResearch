<AbstractNarration>Dr. Simon and his team undertake a search of the Milky Way's four southern dwarf spheroidal satellites to identify and characterize extremely metal-poor stars. Many of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way host stars formed in the early universe. The elemental composition of these presumably ancient stars is very metal-poor (relative to their hydrogen content and elemental abundances in our sun). The chemical makeup of these stars holds clues how the earliest stars and the proto-galaxies formed. Existing surveys of the Milky Way halo have largely been mined but yielded only six stars with an iron abundance less than 1/10000 that of the Sun. It is known that nearby dwarf galaxies contain more extremely metal-poor stars than the galactic halo, and therefore these are ideal targets to search for and to learn more about extremely metal-poor stars. Highly efficient observations of about 6000 stars in these galaxies are planned using the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) wide-field imager and multi-object spectrograph at the Magellan telescope, comprising a nearly complete, magnitude-limited sample. The Ca K line is used as a metallicity indicator to identify the most metal-poor objects. These stars are then observed at high spectral resolution to obtain new constraints on the elemental yields of the first supernovae, the initial mass function of the first stars, the nucleosynthesis sites responsible of producing of the heaviest elements, and the formation of the stellar halo of the Milky Way.&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Simon is partnering with Los Angeles-area teachers through the national outreach program Project ASTRO, which is run by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. The program matches elementary through high school teachers with professional and amateur astronomers to bring astronomy into their classrooms. Dr. Simon's new Project ASTRO activity is directly related to the current research on the production of chemical elements in stars through cosmic time, and their dispersal by supernova explosions that allows them to be incorporated into new stars, planets, and life.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In order to study galaxies at the time of their formation directly, astronomers must look all the way across the universe to the most distant galaxies and gas clouds they can detect.  The oldest stars provide an alternative probe of the first stars and galaxies that can be examined in greater detail because they are much closer to us.  The atmospheres of old stars retain the chemical composition of the gas from which they formed, offering a unique opportunity to learn about what galaxies looked like many billions of years ago.  Because the ages of stars are very difficult to measure accurately, astronomers usually rely on the heavy element content of stars as a proxy for age; heavy elements are produced by previous generations of stars, so the oldest stars are those with very few heavy elements (where "heavy elements" refers to elements other than hydrogen and helium).  Searches for the oldest stars in the Milky Way have required decades of work, yielding a small number of stars that appear to have formed shortly after the Big Bang.  The new approach in this project is to identify and study the oldest stars in nearby dwarf galaxies.  Dwarf galaxies are the smallest galaxies, and the targets of this proposal contain no more than ~10 million stars and are located within a few hundred thousand light years of the Sun.  These galaxies are much less enriched in heavy elements than the Milky Way, suggesting that old stars with very small amounts of heavy elements might be relatively common in them.  Moreover, their tiny sizes mean that their early histories were much simpler than those of large galaxies like the Milky Way.  The latest generation of wide-field optical spectrographs on large telescopes makes it possible to observe many stars in dwarf galaxies simultaneously, enabling the first efficient searches for their oldest stars.  During the course of this project we obtained spectra of thousands of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies and measured their heavy element abundances.  We substantially increased the number of known extremely heavy element-poor stars (those with less than 1/1000th the heavy element content of the Sun) in these dwarfs.  We demonstrated that such stars are prevalent in dwarf galaxies and that they become more common the smaller the galaxy is.  In the smallest known galaxy, more than 40% of the stars have heavy element abundances less than 1/3000th that of the Sun.  We then measured the relative abundances of a number of chemical elements in these newly-discovered old stars.  There were three significant results from these measurements.  First, we showed that the dwarf galaxy Segue 1, which is the least luminous confirmed galaxy, is a "fossil" left over from the early universe.  Unlike every other galaxy known, Segue 1 never underwent any chemical evolution: its more heavy element-rich stars exhibit the same chemical abundance pattern as its most heavy element-poor stars.  We concluded that Segue 1 likely formed all of its stars within a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, and has been preserved as a pristine remnant of the early universe ever since.  Segue 1 therefore provides our best look at one of the first galaxies ever formed.  Second, we identified two new extremely heavy element-poor stars in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy and studied them along with three other similar stars found previously.  We found that the two oldest stars in this group contain very unusual chemical abundances, with deficiencies of calcium, magnesium, and silicon that are exceedingly rare among old stars in the Milky Way.  We demonstrated that the heavy elements in these stars likely originated in a single supernova explosion soon after the formation of the galaxy.  These stars provide an unprecedented record of the chemical fingerprints left behind by the earliest generation of stars in Sculptor.  Third, we discovered that most of the stars in the dwarf galaxy Reticulum II are highly enriched in the heaviest elements, which are formed by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process).  The Reticulum II stars have 100-1000 times more of these elements than typical dwarf galaxy stars do.  We showed that the astrophysical events in which r-process elements are created must be very rare and produce large amounts of such elements.  These results are best explained by the merger of two neutron stars, providing a crucial clue toward resolving the long-standing mystery of the origin of elements such as europium, uranium, gold, and lead.  Two postdoctoral researchers at Carnegie Observatories and two graduate students at MIT received training as part of this project. Other broader impacts associated with this work included astronomy lessons for elementary school students and a series of lectures presenting research results to the general public.
