<AbstractNarration>Morehouse College proposes a research and development project to recruit high school African American males to begin preparation for secondary school science, technology, engineering and mathematics(STEM) teaching as a career. The major goal of the program is to recruit and prepare students for careers in secondary mathematics and science teaching thus increasing the number of African Americans students in STEM. The research will explore possible reasons why the program is or is not successful for recruiting and retaining students in STEM Teacher Education programs including: (a) How do students who remain in STEM education differ from those who leave and how do these individual factors (e.g. student preparation, self efficacies, course work outcomes, attitudes toward STEM/STEM education, connectivity to STEM/STEM education communities, learning styles, etc) enhance or inhibit interest in STEM teaching among African American males? (b) What organizational and programmatic factors (e.g. high school summer program, Saturday Academy, pre-freshman program, summer research experience, courses, enhanced mentoring, cyber-infrastructure, college admissions guidance, leadership training, instructional laboratory, program management,  faculty/staff engagement and availability, Atlanta Public Schools and Morehouse College articulation and partnership) affect (enhance or inhibit) interest in STEM teaching among African American males?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two cohorts of 40 students will spend six weeks in an intensive summer program with a follow-up Saturday Academy during their senior year before formally beginning their academic careers at Morehouse College. The program will integrate STEM education with teacher preparation and mentoring in order to develop secondary teachers who have mastery in both a STEM discipline as well as educational theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pre-service program for future teachers will recruit 80 promising eleventh grade African American male students from the Atlanta Public School District to participate in a four-year program that will track them into the Teacher Preparation program at Morehouse College. The research will focus on the utility and efficacy of early recruitment of African American male students to STEM teaching careers as a mechanism to increase the number of African American males in STEM teaching careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Discovery Research K-12 (Dreams to Teach) program at Morehouse College was designed to increase the number of African American (AA) male Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) majors and STEM teachers.  Dreams to Teach program recruited AA male students the summer after their eleventh grade, prepared them for college success, provided curriculum-specific activities for college readiness, provided rigorous academic advisement and mentoring during their college matriculation, and provided preparation for secondary science and math teaching careers.  This Pre-Service STEM initiative prepared AA males for STEM teaching careers through a collaborative effort between Morehouse College STEM and Teacher Preparation faculty and the Atlanta Public Schools secondary school STEM faculty. Dreams to Teach supported students through their college matriculation.  There were six major program components: High School Summer Program; Saturday Academy I, II, and III; Pre-Freshman Summer Program; and Summer Research Experience. In addition, participants had a number of opportunities to gain teaching and mentoring experience with middle school and high school students. Dreams to Teach students were provided assistance during classroom and study time, observed the teaching of classes, provided extended exposure and support by participating in field experiences and field trips. During the school year, Dreams to Teach students spent four (4) hours per week working with middle and high school students in an after-school program entitled Raising Expectations providing tutoring and assistance with homework; served as student teachers for the Nuclear Material and Space Science (NuMaSS) program for middle and high school students; and the TRIO Upper bound program for high school students. In addition, Dreams to Teach students served as student teachers for the National Science Foundation funded Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) entitled Innovative Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics Strategy Project (iSTEM) program for middle school students during the academic year and summer.     A number of important lessons were learned during the program.  The number of applicants over the two cohorts (n=129) greatly exceeded the number of students that could be served by this grant with the second cohort (n=86) having twice as many applicants as the first cohort (n=43). This suggests large pools of un-served minority men are interested in becoming STEM majors, and would consider teaching careers given a similar educational opportunity.  The curriculum team for Dreams to Teach Included Teaching professionals from both College and K-12.  The team met early on weekly to design the curriculum to close the gaps and challenges identified in order for student to matriculate and persist to graduation from College.  Once the curriculum was established the team continued to meet at least monthly to ensure program components met student needs and program objectives.  This team ensured pedagogical and content knowledge from both pre-college and college levels integration for a successful transition into college.  High school faculty understanding of students? current competencies as seniors in high school along with college faculty understanding of competencies critical for success as STEM major needed to be aligned and appropriate transitional educational support was provided through program components. Dreams to Teach curriculum modeled strategies students will use when they become classroom teachers by emphasizing interdisciplinary approaches for learning science and mathematics and integrated inquiry-based learning, technology, and problem solving. Ongoing weekly advisement sessions provided strategies for students to remain on track with courses/grades and progress successfully.  Students indicated the level of importance of opportunities provided by Dreams to Teach were to them.  Eighty-five percent (85 %) of Dreams to Teach students indicated the following opportunities were either Extremely Important or Somewhat Important: Opportunity to learn about teaching and learning, Opportunity to become Peer Mentor/Leader, Opportunity to participate in Learning Community, Availability of assistance in applying to college, Opportunity to live in learning community, Availability of assistance with study skills, Availability of assistance with time management.      Students who completed High School Saturday Academy:  Cohort 1: 90.5% of the 21 inner-city AA male students gained admission to college.  Cohort 2: All of the 26 inner-city AA male students gained admission to college.        Students that attended Morehouse College:  Cohort 1  11 inner-city AA male students entered Morehouse College 11 were STEM majors Five (5) have graduated college and two (2) are currently attending another Institution.    Four (4) graduated with both a STEM major and will pursue STEM teaching    Cohort 2  19 inner-city AA male students entered Morehouse College 19 were STEM majors One (1) has graduated college; Fifteen (15) are currently attending Morehouse College; and One (1) is attending college elsewhere One (1) graduated with a STEM major; Fourteen (14) are anticipated to graduate with a STEM major One (1) graduated with both a STEM major and will pursue STEM teaching; Ten (10)  are anticipated to graduate with both a STEM major and will pursue STEM teaching; One (1) will graduate and pursue teaching in a non-STEM area.
