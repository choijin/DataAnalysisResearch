<AbstractNarration>The Mw 9 March 11, 2011 Tohoku earthquake, resulting in 25,000 fatalities, was the largest&lt;br/&gt;earthquake to strike Japan in modern times. The failure of long-term forecasts to anticipate an&lt;br/&gt;event of this magnitude is leading to a reevaluation of our scienti c understanding of subduction&lt;br/&gt;zone fault dynamics. At the same time, the enormous Japanese investment in seismic and&lt;br/&gt;geodetic monitoring provides an unprecedented opportunity to study processes leading to giant&lt;br/&gt;earthquakes. The investigators will focus here on two aspects of the quake that raise central issues for our ability&lt;br/&gt;to forecast future hazards globally: 1) the constraints that geodetic strain accumulation place&lt;br/&gt;on the seismic moment budget, and 2) how the distribution of mechanical properties on the&lt;br/&gt;plate interface control seismic versus aseismic slip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forecasts of seismic hazard rely primarily on the historical record, paleoseismology, and&lt;br/&gt;geodetic strain accumulation. While a strict time-predictable model has proven inconsistent&lt;br/&gt;with geodetic data in some areas, the rate of strain accumulation must strongly in&lt;br/&gt;uence the recurrence rate and/or size of large earthquakes. Previous analyses of the extensive Japanese&lt;br/&gt;GPS data set regularize the underdetermined inverse problem; the inferred plate coupling is&lt;br/&gt;thus conditional on the choice of regularizing functional. In addition, most assumed no coupling at the trench, an area that effectively lies in the model null-space. The researchers propose rather to estimate rigorous bounds on the moment deficit rate, independent of any regularizing functional. They also propose to systematically explore the effects of time-dependent viscoelastic effects on estimates of slip deficit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tohoku earthquake also raises profound questions about the frictional properties of&lt;br/&gt;the subducting plate interface. Mw &gt; 7 events along the Japan-Kurile trench have repeated&lt;br/&gt;in nearly the same locations. Substantial afterslip following these events suggested that the&lt;br/&gt;fault surrounding these seismic `asperities' have different frictional properties, e.g., velocity&lt;br/&gt;weakening `asperities' surrounded by velocity strengthening regions. The fact that the March&lt;br/&gt;11 earthquake seems to have ruptured through both areas raises important questions. Is the&lt;br/&gt;asperity paradigm fundamentally flawed? Or did the M 9 activate other weakening mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;(thermal pressurization?) that allowed it to rupture through velocity strengthening regions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To distinguish between competing hypotheses the researchers will use a combination of GPS data based&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis testing and physics based fault modeling. They will test whether or not post-seismic&lt;br/&gt;GPS data can be fit with afterslip only in regions that have not experienced seismic slip in&lt;br/&gt;the last several decades. They will test alternative physical models that could account&lt;br/&gt;for the observed behavior, by extending our numerical codes that couple rate-state friction,&lt;br/&gt;thermal pressurization, and dilatant strengthening to three dimensions. This will allow them to&lt;br/&gt;test for example whether dilatancy could stabilize slip in otherwise velocity weakening regions,&lt;br/&gt;or thermal pressurization could allow ruptures to extend into velocity strengthening areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is generally assumed that strain on active faults builds up at a steady rate in time.  In this study, we use precise Global Positioning System (GPS) data from northeastern Japan to analyze the rate of strain accumulation on the megathrust fault that generated the Magnitude 9 Tohoku, Japan earthquake in 2011.  After correcting for displacements due to a series of Magnitude 6 and 7 earthquakes and associated post-earthquake adjustments, we found that the rate of straining decreased in the 15 years prior to the earthquake.  This result implies an increase in the average rate of slippage on at least some parts of the fault. (If the fault were to slip everywhere at the same rate as the relative motion of the plates then no strain would accumulate).  Furthermore, we were able to use small repeating earthquakes to independently confirm that parts of this megathrust experience accelerated aseismic slip ("fault creep") during this time interval.     Accelerated creep prior to a Magnitude 9 earthquake was quite unexpected. We do not believe that this process was precursory, in the sense of accelerating slip leading to the initiation of the Magnitude 9 earthquake.  It occurred over too broad of an area.  In addition, slip did not continuously accelerate up to the time of the earthquake.   On the other hand, increasing slip-rate in some areas may have slightly increased the stress on the part of the fault where the earthquake ultimately started.     A second important result of our work was to show that the megathrust fault is not permanently divided into so-called "asperities" that generate earthquakes, and intervening areas that slip continuously, without accumulating stress.   It is commonly assumed that this is the case, due to different frictional properties operative on different parts of the fault surface.   If this were true, seismic asperities would be locked (not slipping) between earthquakes, whereas the intervening regions would slip continuously.   The data are not consistent with the hypothesis that asperities are permanent features with fixed size.  Rather, the data require that the locked zones decreased in area over the 15 years that we have data.   We proposed a physical model to explain the mechanical "erosion" of the locked asperities with time, that can be tested by future analysis of GPS and earthquake data.
