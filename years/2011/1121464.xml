<AbstractNarration>This effort is conducting a workshop to create a broad-based characterization &amp; measurement of the technological literacy of American undergraduates and the potential effectiveness of technological literacy courses. The workshop is utilizing and refining existing assessment tools to: 1) measure increases in technological literacy for undergraduates; 2) develop new shared assessment tools &amp; related standard learning outcomes; 3) investigate how increased technological literacy impacts actions &amp; attitudes; and 4) identify factors that promote the institutionalization of technological literacy courses. The combined results will help create a means to characterize and measure the technological literacy of American undergraduates and gauge the potential effectiveness of technological literacy courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project conducted work to develop methods to assess and measure what undergraduate students that are not specifically studying science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) know about technological concepts and engineering. America?s standard of living and way of life depend upon technology. It is vital both for both empowerment of the individual and national economic growth that informed citizens have an understanding of what technology is, how it works, how it is created, and how society influences technological development.  Since assessments of engineering students typically emphasize mathematics, other approaches are needed for non-engineers.  The intellectual merit of this work is found in the refinement of definitions of engineering and technological literacy, development, and testing of a framework for an engineering reasoning assessment, determination of what competencies non-engineers would like regarding engineering and technology, and identification of factors that help faculty members to offer courses on engineering and technology.  The project combined the efforts of a number of engineering faculty members that taught courses on engineering literacy.  A workshop was conducted to utilize and refine the existing assessments used by individual faculty into assessment tools that could be broadly applied. The project also utilized the collective experience of faculty to begin to develop methods to detect and measure how increased technological literacy impacts the actions and attitudes of individuals in their daily life.  Project work first focused on clarifying definitions of engineering and technological literacy. Engineering literacy was viewed as having a focus directed more toward the process of creating or designing technological artifacts or systems. Technological literacy includes a broader view of the products or results of the engineering process as well as the relation between technology and society.  The project developed a concise set of core ideas that encompass the essential dimensions of engineering and technology. Ten main principles were developed to serve as the core ideas describing the structure or nature of technological systems. The framework starts with the concept of function and extends through the design process and technological evolution. This framework is not dependent on any one specific type of technology and can be used to address higher order thinking rather than simple recall of specific facts or repetition of rote procedures.
