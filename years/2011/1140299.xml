<AbstractNarration>This project is creating mobile, smart phone applications ("apps") with the goal of increasing student performance on standard precalculus problems, measured in both achievement level and time on task. Content modules are being developed, each corresponding to a specific, traditional precalculus topic and including visualizations that illuminate concepts and encourage practice. The project's intellectual merit rests in two areas. First, the "apps" take advantage of the general portability of smart phones and their unique user interfaces, while addressing the challenges of screen size and processor speed. Each module also comes with practice problems for students to demonstrate mastery of skills. Second, usage data from phones are used to study patterns and modes of use of the apps by students. Learning measures include the number and level of practice problems completed successfully, as well as the increase in time-on-task within the smart phone environment. These data are then being correlated with performance in the classroom using standard assessment tools. The broader impacts of the project are felt through its targeting of improved student success rate in precalculus, a traditional bottleneck for students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The output and outcomes of the project are also informing future work by a growing community of developers for other courses, even those outside of mathematics. Through its nurturing of this community the project is positioned to transform the fast developing area of mobile technology in undergraduate education.</AbstractNarration>
