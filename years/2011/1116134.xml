<AbstractNarration>Wireless multimedia broadcast has been the central of human entertainments for a century. While the broadcasting signaling is being transformed to digital, its infrastructure is still incapable of supporting the full potential of wireless digital broadcast. This project develops a comprehensive framework to enable scalable and adaptive wireless multimedia broadcasting for an envisioned cellular-type infrastructure, as well as for infrastructures in transitional stages. The project consists of three components: 1) an adaptive channel coding scheme, 2) a stochastic power control and antenna beamforming algorithm, and 3) a feedback channel medium access control protocol. In the first step, the research develops an adaptive coding scheme to enable efficient and scalable broadcast communication over dynamic wireless channels with minimum channel information at the transmitters. In the second step, the research develops a stochastic power control and antenna beamforming framework to optimize energy efficiency of the broadcast system under communication throughput and delay constraints. In the third step, the research develops a medium access control protocol to feedback necessary channel information without sacrificing system scalability using a minimum amount of feedback channel bandwidth. This project also develops a demonstration system in wireless computer networks.</AbstractNarration>
