<AbstractNarration>This award from the National Science Foundation to Florida State University supports the operation of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) for a five year period, 2013-2017. High magnetic fields are a critical tool to the condensed matter physics and materials research communities and increasingly to the chemistry, biology and biomedical communities. The Laboratory provides a User Program for research using high-magnetic-fields at six unique facilities: Steady-State (DC) Resistive Electromagnets, Pulsed Electromagnets, Ultra-Low Temperature, Ion Cyclotron Resonance, Electron Magnetic Resonance, and the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance/Magnetic Resonance Imaging User Facilities. The Facilities are located at three geographically distributed campuses: Florida State University, University of Florida and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Each user program is built around unique magnetic-field capabilities supported by a world-leading scientific expertise. Access to the User Programs is provided on a competitive basis to the most meritorious proposals submitted from an interdisciplinary scientific community spanning materials science, condensed matter physics, magnet technology, chemistry, and biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NHMFL's nationally recognized education and public outreach programs will utilize the laboratory's scientists, infrastructure, and website to target K-12 students, undergraduates and teachers (via the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and Teachers (RET) programs), and to expand research and mentorship programs for female and minority graduate students and early career scientists that are tailored to advance each individual's career goals. The Laboratory has an updated diversity plan which is designed to play a leadership role in broadening participation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) is a multi-user, multi-disciplinary facility that exists to provide high magnetic fields to researchers from across the globe. Over 1,700 scientists per year use the NHMFL to perform their research, publishing more than 400 peer-reviewed publications annually by making use of NHMFL magnets that are up to 2 million times more powerful than the Earth's magnetic field. The National MagLab allows researchers to pressing global energy problems and enriching our understanding of the biochemistry that underlies living things.  Magnets Explore Materials  You cannot invent high-tech products without new materials and magnets help discover and explore new materials and behaviors that might be of technological importance. Magnetic fields have been vital to the development and understanding of electronics, lasers and fast optical switches used in the Internet, materials that have enabled products that have changed your life- and will continue to change it in ways we cannot yet imagine.  Researchers made important foundational discoveries on materials during this project period:  Finding new properties of topological materials that hold great promise for reducing energy consumption in electronics. Creating a way to significantly improve the performance of a decades-old superconducting material, promising future applications for particle accelerators and research magnets. Developing a new approach to building 'qubits' that could become a promising tool for developing quantum computers. Illuminating discoveries on superconducting materials - materials that conduct electricity without friction when they are kept cold. Research is showing promise for superconductivity at higher temperatures, which could lead to smart electrical grids, power storage devices or magnetic levitation. Scientists created a molecular nanomagnet based on a single nickel atom with record-high magnetic anisotropy - a quality that makes it a promising building block for applications like memory storage. Examining the material samarium hexaboride, scientists discovered that the material is apparently both an insulator and a metal, seemingly contradictory properties, and could be used as a new path to quantum computers and other next-generation electronics. Exiting research on two-dimensional materials like graphene and phosphorene could revolutionize computers, batteries, cell phones, televisions and even airplanes. Two research teams working with graphene observed a never-before-seen energy pattern known as the Hofstadter Butterfly.   Magnets Explore Energy  Creating, storing and conserving energy - a product for which there is limited supply and nearly unlimited demand - has been a topic of global conversation for decades. High magnetic fields are an essential tool for addressing a wide range of energy challenges.  During this project, researchers used high magnetic fields to better understand existing energy sources and explore new ones:  MagLab scientists have developed a new way, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), to study the way lithium ions travel through solids. Experiments revealed that those pathways vary significantly, depending on the composition and structure of the solid electrolytes, offering insights on the continued development of safe, high-energy-capacity battery designs. Researchers learned how an intriguing nanomaterial that is part of the carbon family -  a metallofullerene - is formed, findings that could help pave the way for applications in renewable energy and biomedicine. Scientists have developed a way to isolate emulsion-causing petroleum compounds, a technique that may lower energy costs for both oil companies and consumers.   Magnets Explore Life  High magnetic fields are the force behind MRI-magnetic resonance imaging. Most hospital MRIs have a magnetic field around 1.5 tesla. By comparison, at the National MagLab, MRI research is conducted up to 21 teslas, facilitating 'High-Definition MRI.'  Our customized magnet systems allow scientists to study everything from whole, living animals to individual cells to tiny disease proteins, leading to exciting discoveries during this project period:  A new technique narrowly applying energy to metabolites of a specimen exposed to a very high magnetic field revealed a new, innovative way to classify the severity of a stroke, aid in diagnosis, and evaluate potential treatments. Scientists discovered that a new titanium compound is four times harder - and can last much longer - than what is currently being used for medical implants. A chemist has determined how the flu virus tunnels into cells, paving the way for new treatments. For the first time, researchers characterized the structure of a protein implicated in the onset of some of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases. Scientists discovered biomarkers that make it possible to distinguish breast cancer cells from non-cancerous cells, based on identifying chemical modifications of histones, the molecules about which DNA strands are wound to keep them in the cell nucleus.   Education and Outreach  The National MagLab also grows a new generation of scientists through many education and outreach programs that get students interested in careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. During this project period, hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students were educated at the MagLab and scientific educational outreach was provided to over 10,000 K-12 students annually.
