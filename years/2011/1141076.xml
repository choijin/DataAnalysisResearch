<AbstractNarration>This project is creating hands-on activities to improve STEM problem-solving skills of students who are deaf and hard-of-hearing. Engineering professors affiliated with Rochester Institute of Technology, the National Technical Institute for the Deaf and Toyota Production Systems Laboratory are collaborating to develop three modules to present problem-solving content to students in a visual and hands-on mode that is closely tied to the type of problems that engineers solve in different industry settings. A professional evaluator is helping the investigators understand how the modules are assisting deaf and hard-of-hearing students' learning. This project is improving training for deaf and hard-of-hearing students and will ultimately broaden participation of deaf and hard-of-hearing students in STEM fields including engineering, mathematics and science. The results are being shared with faculty who serve students who are deaf and hard-of-hearing at specific institutions, through NSF Alliances for Students With Disabilities in STEM, and at conferences in disabilities education and engineering education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH) are underrepresented within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professional fields.  Though many DHH students choose to pursue STEM majors in post-secondary education, a small percentage of DHH students complete the minimum baccalaureate degree that is required in pursuing a career as a STEM professional (e.g., engineer or scientist).   This low percentage may be closely linked to the difficulties that DHH students experience in the development of the mathematical and problem-solving skills that are essential for the successful completion of STEM post-secondary degrees.   Despite a growing body of research in understanding how hearing students and DHH students differ in the development of mathematical and problem-solving competencies, researchers and practitioners have been challenged in translating this knowledge into effective pedagogy.  This project focuses on the development and evaluation of an intervention to enhance problem-solving skills among first-year DHH students in a post-secondary STEM program.  The approach is based on three distinct pillars: (i) experiential learning through active and collaborative learning; (ii) various best practices for teaching mathematics and science to DHH students; and (iii) the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) problem-solving method commonly utilized in industry.     The intervention immerses DHH students in an experiential, hands-on environment in which they conduct problem-solving exercises in a systematic and iterative manner.  Three modules were developed in which problem-solving activities are progressively and iteratively presented to the students who then use the PDCA approach to document their problem-solving process.  These modules incorporate case studies and hands-on problem-solving activities conducted in an industrial engineering laboratory.  Four case studies were developed to evaluate the development of problem-solving as students progressed through the various stages of the intervention.   Development of the intervention also involved the creation of multimedia materials to support the individual communication preferences of participating students (e.g., spoken English, ASL, captioned video, or written text).  Additionally, a Microsoft OneNote&reg; template was designed to interactively guide the students through the problem-solving approach and the supporting report.  This template guides the students through each step of the problem-solving process and provides examples of how to complete each step of the PDCA approach using embedded videos.  This template was installed on Microsoft Surface Tablets that students used throughout the experience and, in particular, during lab exercises.   To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, a case/control approach was used in which the problem-solving skills of the participating students were evaluated at various stages (prior to experiencing the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and at 6 and 12 months, post-intervention).  Students who experienced the intervention realized a 14.6% improvement in problem-solving proficiency compared to a control group, and this gain was maintained at 6 and 12 months, post-intervention.   The results of this project have been presented to several audiences of STEM educators who specialize in the instruction of DHH students.  Though aspects of the intervention developed in this project utilize a specialized engineering laboratory, the approach was developed to be adaptable for general application.  The materials developed to support the project are available online, and full description of the results have been published in the Journal of Deaf Education and Deaf Studies.
