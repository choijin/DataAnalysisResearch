<AbstractNarration>This project is a partnership between Snohomish School District and Everett Community College. Everett Community College will use facilities provided by Snohomish School District to teach Advanced Manufacturing skills. The partnership will better utilize equipment and facilities, allow middle and high school students access to advanced equipment, provide professional development for teachers and engage young students exciting them to study STEM fields. The opportunities provided by the work will increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who study STEM fields and enter the workforce. Since the local need for manufacturing workers, especially in aerospace, is expected to grow a well educated worker is a critical element to the continued success of the Snohomish County and Regional economy and this work will help ensure these workers are prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will increase the number of industry certificate holders in the area of advanced manufacturing by 20%, increase the number of associate degree holders with experience in advanced manufacturing by 100% and increase the number of community college transfers to a four-year institution by 15%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The applied learning/training in the program will increase student scientific literacy and provide more opportunity to be creative and create connections to business and industry making study more relevant and focused. The project's dual enrollment benefits student enrollment and early mentoring and could become a model that can be duplicated nation-wide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Snohomish County Advanced manufacturing Program (SnoCAMP) was organized to increase student experiences in scientific literacy, application of experimental design, and learning research in engineering and advanced manufacturing.  Due to the fact that current manufacturing involves applied learning in emerging industries, there is greater opportunity for students to make creative and supportive connections with business and industry.  These connections help improve student learning by making lessons more relevant to, and focused on, student interests.  As students prepare for postsecondary success in emerging fields, they become aware of the broad range of technical manufacturing applications and opportuntities.  Courses of Study were created that articulate from the middle school level through postsecondary with input from industry partners.     The main goal of SnoCAMP was to increase the relevance of advanced manufacturing education to more closely reflect modern manufacturing practices.  Using an innovative educational model initiated by SnoCAMP staff, opportunities in the areas of enginnering and manufacturing programs atthe secondary and postsecondary levels were identified.  SnoCAMP efforts were also geared to increase the numbers of students (including underrepresented populations) that attained enhanced competencies that would better prepare them to enter the workforce at several certificate and degree levels.  The consortium built educational pathways in advanced manufacturing including employment opportunities in aerospace, marine, and other manufacturing arenas.     Key curriculum related activites included:  Defining Engineering Design as an iterative process with known steps and sets of tools.  It was clearly distinguished from other problem solving models which may seem similar, especially Research and Design and Trouble Shooting. Viewing the making of a project as a cycle of activities.  Students and staff were involved atthe earliest possible time in every stage of planning and production, through design and manufacturing, ending with the delivery of the product to the customer. Students viewed measurement decisions based on successful research in relevant fields, knowledge of measurement systems, and specific tools available to make the types of measurements needed.  Measurements met product specifications and were expressed to the required accuracy and precision. Working in teams, students selected and completed a comprehensive group design project that required using leradership skills such as goal setting, advocacy, and communication to assure project success.  Peer assessment and Redlining were integral to the project. Utilizing learned skills and information from classroom instruction and demonstration, projects were manufactured utilizing a variety of materials used in modern manufacturing. Students demonstrated skills from four formerly seperate skill areas; Design, Sketching/Two Dimensional CAD, Modeling, and Manufacturing where iterative processess act aas a means of integration.   A main focus was to help students recognize when the manufacturing project requires a linear design-build cycle and when a non-linear cycle is needed.     To meet these Goals and Objectives, the SnoCAMP participants completed research and publication in the following areas:  Identification of science concepts in manufcaturing by learning and practicing new processes and incorporating Materials Science into curricular materials. Manufacturing Mathematics, to help understand how measurement and precision relate to design, prototyping, manufacturing, and the development of marketing materials. Web content, design, and delivery strategies were developed, tested, modified, peer reviewed, professionally reviewed, and published. Project design that imbeds science, mathematics, art, engineering, and writing components. Creation of prototypes used for destructive and non-destructive testing.
