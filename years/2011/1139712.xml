<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks support for The 8th International Conference on Scientific Computing and Applications (SCA 2012) to be held at University of Nevada Las Vegas during April 1-4, 2012.  The conference is the eighth in a sequence of international meetings held every two years in different countries in North America and Asia. The proposed conference will bring together researchers working in various fields of scientific computing and its applications to solve scientific and industrially oriented problems,  and to provide a forum for the participants to meet and exchange ideas between computational mathematics, engineering and industrial communities. The intellectual merit of the conference is embodied in its addressing many fundamentally challenging topics:  Multiphase Flow in Porous Media; Geophysical Fluid Dynamics; Climate Simulation; Modeling of Renewable Energy; Numerical Techniques for Wave Propagations; Numerical Methods for Stochastic PDEs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The NSF funding will be used to cover the travel cost for about 30 conference participants, who will be predominantly students and junior researchers from U.S., but the organizers expect to also cover the travel and subsistence expenses of some senior participants. The conference organizers will make their great efforts in attracting young participants, especially participants from under-represented groups, and providing valuable opportunities for them to network with leaders of computational mathematics. The conference will provide a better understanding and applications in areas of importance to the nation such as national security,  environment, nano science, and energy. Specific examples include developing robust and efficient scientific computing tools for oil reservoir simulation, fuel Cells, biofuels, design of invisibility cloak, ice-sheet models for the next generation climate simulation, etc.</AbstractNarration>
