<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Maria Buthelezi from Wheaton College and colleagues John Collins and Xuesheng Chen will acquire a pulsed laser/detection system with a tunable dye laser system, a detection system, and a cryogenic refrigerator system. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in the areas of (a) studies of host/guest interactions of photochromic molecules, and (b) luminescence properties of solid state materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tunable laser is a laser whose wavelength of operation can be altered in a controlled manner. The dye laser uses an organic dye as the lasing medium giving a system that can be used over a broad range of wavelengths. Some of the dyes can be large molecules that emit light via fluorescence. The tunable dye laser/detection system will enable excited-state lifetime and time-resolved fluorescence measurements that are important to the investigation of several processes that occur in molecular complexes: radiative decay that leads to conformational states, non-linear energy transfer processes, and fluorescence quenching mechanisms. This instrumentation will also foster the interdisciplinary curricular and research interactions between chemistry, physics and biology at Wheaton College.</AbstractNarration>

The goals of purchasing and setting up the equipment was met within the first year, and since then has been used in the fulfillment of the other goals.  The research conducted by the students was in the following areas: the luminescence characteristics of materials for lighting applications, optical properties of molecules for optical switches and sensors, optical properties of nanoparticles, optical properties of silver nanostructured films for use in the sensing of harmful metals.  Under the guidance of the PIs, approximately twenty undergraduate students were trained using the equipment. Of these students 75% were women and 25% were students of color.

Additionally, one international collaboration was also established with a research university in Lviv, Ukraine investigating the optical properties of silver thin films and nanostructured polymers for sensing applications.  In summary, the quantity and the quality of the research in the physics and chemistry departments at Wheaton College has been raised significantly as a result of this grant, and we anticipate the continued growth in the use of these facilities.
