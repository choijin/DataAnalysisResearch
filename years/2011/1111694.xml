<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Jos√© Madalengoitia of the University of Vermont will investigate the 1,3-diaza-Claisen rearrangement as novel method for the synthesis of guanidine compounds.  The overall reaction involves the addition of a tertiary allylic amine to a carbodiimide to afford a zwitterionic intermediate that in turn undergoes a 1,3-diaza-Claisen rearrangement.  The goals for this project are 1) to determine the optimal carbodiimide reactivity and to then explore optimal carbodiimides in ring expanding and intramolecular rearrangements, 2) to develop a rearrangement that proceeds through a cationic intermediate instead of a zwitterionic intermediate, 3) to develop a palladium-catalyzed rearrangement, and 4) to develop rearrangements in which a new stereocenter is formed stereoselectively.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve the training of graduate and undergraduate students in the area of organic synthesis.  In addition, high school students in collaboration with Project SEED will be trained the PI's lab during the summer.  Guanidine compounds are important as they have been used as catalysts for a number of reactions and guanidine derivatives have been reported to have a range of biological activities including anti-bacterial and anti-HIV activities.  This work will expand the ways in which guanidine compounds can be made and will broaden the range of guanidine compounds that can be easily made.  Societal benefits should come from the application of this work to the synthesis guanidine catalysts, guanidine natural products and guanidine pharmaceuticals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Our research has focused on developing ways to make molecules that possess a specific grouping of atoms that is called a guanidine functional group.  Our interest in guanidine-containing molecules is due to three reasons 1) there are many guanidine molecules made by nature that are biologically active (for example as anti-HIV infective agents), 2) there are pharmaceutical drug and drug candidates that are guanidine compounds, and 3) guanidine compounds have been found to catalyze several reactions.  The development of new ways to make guanidines can therefore have an impact on these areas through facilitating the ways in which these molecules can be made.     We have developed a reaction we have termed a 1,3-diaza-Claisen rearrangement.  In this reaction, a molecule called a tertiary allylic amine reacts with another molecule called a carbodiimide to transiently form a zwitterionic intermediate (an intermediate that has two opposing charges) that in turn undergoes a 1,3-diaza-Claisen rearrangement (reaction 1, Figure 1).  We have developed several variations on this reaction such as intermolecular reactions (reactions in which the tertiary allylic amine and the carbodiimide are not part of the same molecule, reaction 1), and intramolecular reactions (reactions in which the tertiary allylic amine and the carbodiimide are part of the same molecule, reactions 2, 3, and 4)).  In addition, we have developed not only the variant which proceeds through a zwitterionic intermediate (reactions 1, 2, and 3), but also one that proceeds through an intermediate that has a positive charge (a cationic intermediate, reaction 4).  We have additionally developed a 1,3-diaza-Claisen rearrangement that is catalyzed by a palladium catalyst.     These variants of the reaction are highly complementary to each other.  For example, there are some intermolecular reactions that don?t work, but the corresponding intramolecular reactions do indeed work.  Additionally, there is a high degree of complementarity between the intramolecular reactions involving zwitterionic and cationic intermediates.  For example, intramolecular reactions that form a zwitterionic intermediate with five atoms in the ring usually easily undergo a 1,3-diaza-Claisen rearrangement (reaction 2), while the corresponding reactions involving a cationic intermediate with five atoms in the ring are much slower.  Furthermore, intramolecular reactions that form a cationic intermediate with six atoms in the ring usually easily undergo a 1,3-diaza-Claisen rearrangement (reaction 4), while the corresponding reactions involving a zwitterionic intermediate with six atoms in the ring sometimes don?t undergo a 1,3-diaza-Claisen rearrangement.  In addition, we have explored the application of our methodology to ring expanding reactions.  An example of such a transformation is shown in reaction 3 in which the tertiary allylic amine has a ring with five atoms, but the guanidine product has a ring with nine atoms.  The importance of this transformation lies in the fact that rings with 8-10 atoms are typically challenging to make.  Altogether, these different variants allow access to guanidine compounds that would not be easily accessible through traditional methods for the synthesis of guanidines.
