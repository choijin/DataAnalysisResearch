<AbstractNarration>In adult humans, symbiotic microbes outnumber human cells ten to one. The composition of these microbial communities can influence whether individuals are lean or obese and the likelihood that pathogens are able to successfully establish themselves in the body. Amphibians also possess a diverse symbiotic microbiota, and these bacterial symbionts may limit infection by pathogens, such as the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) that has decimated many natural amphibian populations. This research will examine links between three critical diversity components of the symbiotic microbial communities that reside on amphibian skin: taxonomic diversity (number and relative abundance of species), genetic diversity (which genes are turned on), and functional diversity (disease resistance). Using focused field surveys and manipulative experiments, three objectives will be addressed: (1) establish the range of taxonomic, genetic, and functional diversity within the microbial community on five species of host amphibians in Panama, (2) examine how the presence of a pathogen (Bd) impacts diversity components, and (3) examine the relationship between microbial diversity and resistance to disease. As all animals host symbiotic microbes, these results will have broad applicability to other systems, including humans. In addition, new statistical methods for these complex datasets will be developed, which will rapidly expand the ability to integrate these diversity components in a wide array of systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will be trained in research. In addition, in Panama, a partnership with the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project (PARC) will be established. A PARC intern will be supported to work with school groups to stress the importance of conservation, beneficial microbes and biodiversity.  The partnership with PARC will extend to working with them on novel probiotic solutions, based on antifungal skin bacteria, that will allow successful reintroductions of threatened frogs, thereby helping to restore biodiversity to the Neotropics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant 1136662) is one part of a three-pronged effort to study the function and diversity of skin bacteria that inhabit amphibians in Panama. The Minbiole research group is tasked with the study of the chemicals (metabolites) on amphibian skin, while the Belden and Harris research teams have inquired into the taxonomic (species) and genetic diversity associated with the bacteria.  Taken as a whole, we aim to understand the impact of these three levels of diversity on the health of the frog hosts, particularly when facing a lethal amphibian disease caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatis (Bd).  Bacterially derived metabolites are of particular importance because they have been shown to have a key function: protection against fungal disease.  We have shown that certain bacterial metabolites are potent inhbitors of Bd, both in the laboratory and on infected frogs.  For this project, our work began with the development of a simple field swabbing technique that could gently remove chemicals from the mucus associated with frog skin, and in turn release the metabolites for laboratory analysis (all with no harm to the frog).  This procedure has been accomplished on nearly 1000 field samples, and has allowed for thorough analysis on the number, amount, and diversity of chemicals present on amphibian skin.  We refer to the outcome for each individual frog as a "chemical fingerprint," and in preliminary studies have shown this to correlate closely to the species of amphibian.  We subsequently worked to correlate our findings to Panamanian amphibian species, location, and disease state. Continuing analyses aim to correlate these fingerprints to the bacterial species present as well as genetic material on frog skin.  In sum, our NSF-supported project has led to the identifcation of an efficient sampling technique for amphibians (and other species) using inexpensive and rugged techniques; this strategy is effective at identifying frogs by species, which has already been helpful in species differentiation.  Large scale interpretation of chemical fingerprinting is ongoing, being merged with large datasets of species and genetic analysis.
