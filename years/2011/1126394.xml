<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers affiliated with Indiana University's Nanoscale Characterization Facility request support for the acquisition of an X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer, also equipped with Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is a fundamental analytical technique for surface and materials-based research. It is the equivalent of nuclear magnetic resonance to organic chemists, providing those studying solids with elemental composition and chemical/electronic state information of surfaces. This dual-use instrument will have immediate impact on research ranging from the development of organic or inorganic materials for solar energy, chemical sensing, and catalytic applications to fundamental studies involving structure determination of new materials and the interactions of water or organic molecules with surfaces.  Critical to these projects is chemical and electronic state information for prepared materials, of which XPS and UPS are the state-of-the-art methods used to obtain such information.  This instrumentation will allow us to elucidate the complex structure-function relationships of the nanomaterials we are studying, addressing fundamental questions while also propelling our projects forward towards more functional materials that address societal needs.  The information garnered from these projects will have broad impacts, forging links between scientific disciplines that include organic/inorganic/solid-state chemistry, condensed matter physics, surface science, material science, and the geological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscience is concerned with the unique properties of materials with sizes less than about a millionth of a meter. The ability to measure and understand the fundamental phenomena associated with such materials is essential to advancing many areas of modern science, including energy production, environmental remediation, and biomedical and information technology.  Research in these fields is highly interdisciplinary and requires access to shared instrumentation for creating and characterizing nanoscale materials.  Thus, Indiana University - Bloomington has established a shared facility, the Nanoscale Characterization Facility, and is requesting support for the acquisition of an X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer for research and education.  This instrument also will be equipped with Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy.  On-site X-ray and Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy will allow researchers and students affiliated with Indiana University to better understand how the structure and composition of a given material give rise to its unique properties.  This information will allow for the better design of nanoscale materials used in a range of applications.  The acquisition of this instrument will also have broad impacts, forging links between scientific disciplines, helping to elevate the NCF to a world-class research facility, enhancing undergraduate and graduate training in interdisciplinary science, and contributing to broad outreach activities in which the IU's Nanoscience Center partners with regional academic and research institutions (including HBCUs), industrial groups, K-12 educators, and campus organizations.</AbstractNarration>
