<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year continuing award for a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) entitled, RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site-Chicago Science Teacher Research (CSTR) Program, under the direction of Dr. Andreas A. Linninger. This is a renewal of a successful 3 year RET Site program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSTR program is an initiative by the faculty of three UIC Colleges, Engineering, Education and Liberal Arts and Sciences, in a strategic partnership with the Chicago Public School authorities and industrial interest groups to engage a total of 39 in-service teachers, 13 per year for 3 years, in emerging technologies and cutting edge research in the areas of life sciences, nanotechnology, bioengineering and biomedical engineering. The program will improve the mathematics and science performance of elementary, middle and high-school students through better trained teachers and bridge the gap between experience in pre-college classrooms and cutting-edge university science and technology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term objectives of the CSTR program are to advance math and science skills taught in Chicago area schools through the following three-tiered approach:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) Nurture a science education coalition engaging K-12 teachers with university faculty mentors.&lt;br/&gt;2) Conduct a seven-week summer apprenticeship for in-service teachers using a learning-by-doing approach at experimental facilities at UIC, including formal graduate education combined with an all year around follow-up program for the development of discovery-based experiments, lectures, and conferences.&lt;br/&gt;3) Integrate the RET program with a concurrent undergraduate research site (REU) on novel materials and processes in bioengineering and a high-school student mentoring program.</AbstractNarration>

James, Director of Science).     Intellectual Merit of the RET program: The goals of the educational initiative were to  introduce      teachers to methods and equipment used in cutting edge research, reinforce      the math and science content knowledge, practice      and expand skills and techniques to effectively disseminate such knowledge      to their students, provide      a research element for the continuing graduate level education of science      and math teachers.     The projectÆs focus was on the teaching philosophy of learning by doing. The immersion of teachers in the laboratory was aimed at not only enriching the teacherÆs personal experience &ndash; by participating in the research lab routine but integrating research-based knowledge into the class &ndash; by implementing teaching module. This personal experience has better equipped teachers with the kind of attitudes and experiences necessary for training students for math and science applications. The research efforts of the RET fellows culminated in a final report and below are the contributions made within specific scientific categories of research.     RET fellows conducted research activities in the areas of bioengineering, nanotechnology, material sciences, biopharmaceutical science, medical applications, and environmental sciences ; all reports can be found at our RET website (http://lppd.bioe.uic.edu/RET/Reports/Reports_v3.htm).     The CSTR RET program was referenced several times in publications and serial newspapers:  Abuhabsah, A., A. Linninger and P. Rousche.

CPS web site and Newsletter for Math and Science Initiative: http://www.cmsi.cps.k12.il.us/     Based on our external evaluation, the results demonstrate that the program had a significant impact on their science instruction. In addition, they convey an overall interest in gaining access to even more of certain existing elements of the program. Based on fellowsÆ feedback, they seem to believe that gaining a better understanding of æscientific inquiry,Æ or the æprocess of science,Æ was the main purpose of the RET program. In addition, their feedback also confirms that they greatly approved of this goal, feel it was successfully achieved, and is very valuable to them as teachers. On the other hand, they expressed a struggle with actually translating the lessons learned in the RET program into specific lessons that suits the ability and understanding of their students. Also important to note, student and teacher participantsÆ comments indicate that the classroom is more interesting and engaging than prior to the RET unit implementation. All our 39 RET participant are listed below.        List of RET Participants:  (2015)  Haroon Arrasheed, Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy  Asif Haq, Wells Community A...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
