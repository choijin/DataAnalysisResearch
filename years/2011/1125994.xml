<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program that is co-funded by Chemistry, Professor Stefan Paula from Northern Kentucky University and colleague Heather Bullen will acquire an isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) characterization of protein/ligand interactions, (b) impact of siderophores/metal oxide interactions on biofilm formation, and (c) studies of custom nanoparticle interactions with blood brain barrier lipid models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a very sensitive thermodynamic technique that is used to characterize binding interactions between species such as those between a small molecule and an enzyme. ITC measures directly the heat absorbed or released during a binding process. This provides insight on the strength of chemical and biochemical binding interactions. This calorimeter will also be incorporated into laboratory classes at NKU and will serve collaborators at nearby University of Cincinnati. This instrument will be used not only in research but also in educational and outreach activities with high and middle schools.</AbstractNarration>
