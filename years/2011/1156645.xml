<AbstractNarration>This three year REU Site program at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI) will engage undergraduate students in cutting-edge research in the area of bioprocess engineering (BPE). The objectives of the REU site are to: (1)introduce students to the field of bioprocess engineering (BPE) and its relevance in the future industrial economy; (2)teach students about the technological, social, and economical challenges facing the traditional fossil fuel based industry and the burgeoning biobased industry through classroom learning and discussion; (3) provide those students with a unique and timely experience performing research in bioprocess engineering; and (4)develop independence and decision-making skills in students through the research process and scientific method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BPE REU Site program is significant in that it is: 1) timely given the current energy and fossil fuel situation and 2) technological relevant because bioprocessing involves topics like fermentation, metabolic and genetic engineering, biomaterials, macromolecular structure, and self-assembly, which are all robust and growing research fields in engineering.  Participating undergraduate students will gain experience in a growing field with significant hiring potential in traditional technology companies and engineering departments and burgeoning biotech companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research could show how biological processes can be adapted to produce useful products like fuels, chemicals, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. This would circumvent the fossil fuel intensive routes used currently by the petrochemical industry that have proven detrimental to the environment. Students will develop scientific skills, be exposed to new and exciting avenues of research, and have the opportunity to make informed decisions and gain presentation and writing experience. Recruiting women and minority students into the REU Site will stimulate broader interest in new fields and create a pipeline for graduate student recruitment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."</AbstractNarration>

Students presented their research results at a campus-wide symposium at the end of the summer.         The research showed how pharmaceuticals, fuels, chemicals, and plastics could be made in a more sustainable manner.  The REU site gave research and professional development opportunities to 37 undergraduate science and engineering students over 4 years.  Most of the undergraduate students were from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  Students participated in professional development workshops on Graduate Record Examination (GRE) preparation, writing personal statements for graduate school applications, preparing a resume and curriculum vitae, mock interviewing, and business etiquette skills.  Students attended seminars on bioprocess engineering technology as well as entrepreneurship in bioprocess engineering.  Team building activities included kayaking, biking, hiking, and camping.            Last Modified: 05/09/2016       Submitted b...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
