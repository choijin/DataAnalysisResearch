<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of my EAPSI fellowship to Japan have been extraordinary, and I am extremely glad I applied for and participated in this project. The experience was made all the more meaningful in that it followed the devastation of the March 2011 earthquake and associated disasters, which frightened off many foreign researchers. Perhaps the first conclusion I can state is that Japan is open for business, tourism, and research; and that I felt in no way inconvenienced or endangered by the effects of the disaster despite my proximity to the Fukushima reactor and would have greatly regretted canceling my trip over unfounded concerns.     The research outcomes of the project are still being developed and have not yet been published, so I cannot provide much detail.
