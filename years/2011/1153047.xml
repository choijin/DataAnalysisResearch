<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Mark Watson of the University of Kentucky will explore the role of side chain structure in the assembly and conducting properties of conjugated polymers. The approach is to prepare three classes of donor-acceptor copolymers possessing unique repeat units: (1) donor monomers carrying alkoxy side chains with increasingly bulky branches placed at the alpha- and beta-positions from the polymer backbone; (2) donor monomers carrying alkynyl side chains with increasingly bulky branches placed at the 3- and 4-positions; (3) acceptor monomers with side chains positioned perpendicular to the polymer backbone.  Structure-property relationships in the synthesized polymers will be delineated using a series of characterization methods.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment, broadening participation of underrepresented groups in chemical sciences via visits to regional institutions to present hands-on science demonstrations and participation in week-long "Summer Science Camps" and a local children's museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.    Electrically conducting carbon-based (organic) molecules and polymers hold enormous promise for realizing highly efficient, affordable, and broadly available electronic and optical devices.  This research explores how the structure of the polymer affects its assembly which, in turn, impacts its properties and performance in electronic devices.  Ultimately, such work could lead to the development of organic electronic materials, low cost solar cells, light emitting displays, and chemical and biological sensors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was carried out to investigate the effect of flexible hydrocarbon units attached to polymers  useful in consumer electronic devices, to improve solubility and therefore allow their use in industrial processes requiring solubility.  In recent years, many advances in the designs of these type of polymers have led to continual incremental improvement in their performance in devices like transistors, solar cells, devices that sense biological markers, and so on.  The majority of the highly efficient published polymers for these devices will never find any practical application, as they are only soluble in solvents that industry will not use due to environmental concerns.  Very often, these two desired properties, solubility and performance, cannot be realized in one polymeric material.  Higher solubility often compromises performance, and vice versa.  In order to provide data useful to general scientific efforts in this area of research, our group chose to investigate how to render soluble one of the most poorly soluble classes of these polymers.  We first collected data that was established in many other fields of materials science and applied it to these particular types of polymers.  In various other fields, it has been long known that increased bulkiness of the hydrocarbon units attached to similar, but smaller molecules, can increase solubility while also enhancing other properties rather than compromising them.  We have shown that one of the most insoluble classes of these polymers can be rendered highly soluble.  Further, we have shown a clear demarcation in the types of hydrocarbon residues that must be used.              Last Modified: 03/03/2019       Submitted by: Mark D Watson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
