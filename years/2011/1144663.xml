<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a system that combines the strengths of both human and computer capabilities to help solve a complex societal problem: global climate change. The project will develop an on-line community called the Climate CoLab, in which many thousands of people around the world create, analyze, and ultimately select detailed plans for what humans can do about climate change. At the core of the system will be an evolving collection of user-created proposals based on computer simulations of the actions humans can take and the predicted impacts of those actions. Users will also be able to debate the pros and cons of different proposals and vote for the proposals and arguments they find most credible and desirable. By integrating three capabilities (computer simulation models, on-line debates, and electronic voting) in a novel way, the system lets a very large group of people define and evaluate alternative problem solutions while computers do the rapid calculations needed to assess key consequences of each alternative. By including relevant experts from different disciplines and members of the public who have novel points of view, the community can consider a wide range of plausible alternatives. And by involving policy makers and large numbers of citizens, the eventual political adoption of the most promising alternatives is facilitated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The primary intellectual contributions of this work will be generalizable lessons about how to design large-scale, on-line communities that use computational models to help solve difficult societal and managerial problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The project will help educate the general public about the issues involved in global climate change. In addition, by constructively engaging a broad range of scientists, policy makers, and concerned citizens, this system may help develop plans and policies that are actually better than any that would have otherwise been developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the Climate CoLab is to develop a system that combines what people and computers each do best to help solve a complex societal problem: global climate change. Inspired by systems like Wikipedia and Linux, the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence has developed a crowdsourcing platform where citizens work with experts and each other to create, analyze, and select detailed proposals for what to do about climate change (see accompanying screen shot of the Climate CoLab home page http://climatecolab.org).  Computerized simulation models project the environmental and economic outcomes of the actions proposed by community members, experts review and evaluate the proposals, and both experts and other users select the most promising proposals.   As of November 2013, more than 120,000 people from all over the world had visited the Climate CoLab site, and over 10,000 had registered as members.  Membership more than doubled in the preceding 6 months.  In addition to members of the general public, the community includes over 100 experts on climate change and related topics who serve as advisors, judges, and fellows.   The communityÆs most recent activities included 18 contests on a range of topics from how to reduce emissions from electric power generation to how city governments can adapt to changes brought on by climate change.  Almost 400 proposals were submitted, and winning proposals came from US, India, South Africa, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and other countries.  Winning ideas included (a) showing wasted heat from buildings using aerial infrared photography, (b) creating an aspirational lifestyle for Chinese consumers (the "China Dream") that is more sustainable than current Western lifestyles, and (c) developing a rating system for the climate impacts of different foods.  Winning teams in previous years presented their ideas in briefings at the United Nations in New York and the US Congress in Washington, DC.  The most recent winners did so in sessions with relevant experts and potential implementers at the MIT Climate CoLab conference attended by over 300 people in person and 500 people online.  By constructively engaging a broad range of scientists, policy makers, business people, and concerned citizens, we hope this forum will help develop&mdash;and gain support for&mdash;climate change plans that are better than any that would have otherwise been developed.
