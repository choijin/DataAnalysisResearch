<AbstractNarration>NSF and other federal agencies have supported numerous projects to improve STEM education for more than two decades.  However, the success of efforts to disseminate the advances developed in these projects (i.e. the extent they are being used by other STEM faculty members in their classrooms and laboratories) has not been carefully researched. Thus, an evidence-based, comprehensive listing of the factors that lead to dissemination success does not exist. Without such a listing, educators and researchers are hampered in understanding how to best design pedagogical innovations for maximum effectiveness. This research aims to fill this void by empirically determining which factors are the most important in success of efforts to disseminate STEM learning innovations.  A pilot study conducted at the 2011 TUES PI conference identified several important factors and this knowledge has been used to begin making recommendations to developers, implementers, administrators, and funders.  However, the pilot study was limited in scope.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is being guided by the following research questions, with an emphasis on the first two:&lt;br/&gt;1. How do the factors described in the published literature on the diffusion (or propagation) of innovation affect the success of dissemination of STEM education improvements?&lt;br/&gt;2. How do the predictors of dissemination success in the STEM areas vary by the type of innovation? (Possible types of innovation are instructional materials, instructional strategies, developing faculty expertise, and curriculum development.) &lt;br/&gt;3. Do the predictors of dissemination success for a given type of STEM education improvement differ by academic discipline (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)?&lt;br/&gt;4. Do the predictors of dissemination success for a given type of STEM education improvement differ by the target stakeholder group involved?  Possible stakeholders include faculty members, material developers, students, publishers, and grant providers.&lt;br/&gt;5. How does the level of awareness of the stakeholder affect the intention to adopt?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to rigorously examine these research questions, a research model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a widely-used, theoretical paradigm in the discipline of information systems, was developed.  The variables in this model are being tested using a mixed methods approach utilizing three complementary methodologies: (1) Content analysis of published results is being used to study current published work in order to identify possible additional factors, (2) Delphi methods are being employed to rate the perceived importance of the factors known (or suspected) to influence diffusion, and to identify additional factors, and (3) a survey methodology is being developed and administered that includes a detailed measurement study to develop psychometrically sound measures for each of the independent factors and the two outcome factors. The survey questionnaire is designed for distribution to a sample of stakeholders in the selected STEM disciplines. It is planned to use a synthesis of the survey results to refine the research model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although substantial funding has been expended to develop new educational innovations, especially in engineering, few have found widespread acceptance in the classroom.  Little is known regarding the interactions among the variables that influence successful dissemination and adoption.  This research (a) reviewed past literature to develop a framework, (b) conducted a Delphi study with an expert panel, and (c) implemented a well-designed survey that identified the important factors that influence faculty members in disseminating and adopting educational innovations.  The content analysis resulted in a framework (Figures 1 and 2) that provides a mechanism to link the outcomes, interventions, and context where the outcomes are the successful dissemination and adoption of educational innovations, the interventions are the characteristics of the innovation, and the context is the organizational readiness (readiness of faculty members, administrators, and students to adopt the innovation). For widespread dissemination and adoption to occur, educational innovators must incorporate positive characteristics in the innovations and implement them in organizations that are ready for such change.   The Delphi study obtained an expert panelÆs answer to the following question: "What are the most important characteristics that relate to the dissemination of educational innovations?"   In three rounds, 45 experts identified and ranked 11 characteristics of educational innovations, 6 characteristics of students, 13 characteristics of faculty members, and 5 characteristics of administrators that can relate to the successful dissemination of educational innovations. The results of this study led to the formation of a Characteristics of Dissemination Success (CODS) framework (Figure 2).   The survey research consisted of developing a questionnaire, receiving response from 335 electrical engineering and computer science faculty members, analyzing the results, and developing a set of findings. This study shows that awareness of an educational innovation, attitude to the innovation, and intent to adopt are direct antecedents to adoption which is a direct antecedent to routine use. Furthermore, this study finds that faculty membersÆ attitude to innovation is the most important critical success factor that influences intention to adopt and adoption and also moderates the relationship between intention to adopt and adoption.  Overall, this project provides clear guidelines to faculty members on the factors that they need to include when developing new instructional innovations, administrators on ways to create a more innovative educational system, and students on the factors that encourage educational innovations.  In addition, grant program managers are provided valuable information on the critical change variables that need to be present in a University/ department before a faculty membersÆ proposed innovations have some chance of widespread dissemination and adoption in that University and other Universities.  The request for proposals may have to be rewritten to ensure that faculty members and their administrators are cognizant of these variables before proposing large-scale innovative education projects.
