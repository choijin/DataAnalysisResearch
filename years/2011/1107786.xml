<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on design and characterization of a responsive thin polymer film platform comprised of functionalized mixed polymer brushes for the stimuli-triggered exposure of functional molecules to interfaces.  The project supports an international US-German research team from Clemson University, Clarkson University, University of California in Davis, Dresden Technical University, Leibniz-Institute for Polymer Research Dresden, University of GÃ¶ttingen, and Leibniz-Institute for Analytical Sciences (in Berlin) consisting of experts in polymer/surface/materials science and bioengineering. Financial support for the German participants is provided by the German Science Foundation (DFG). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Responsive polymer materials with dynamically changing interfacial properties are receiving increased interest, thanks to their great potential for biomedical applications. One of the important properties of such materials is the capability to present, to release, to hide, or to capture different functional groups upon receiving external signals.  Therefore, it is proposed to develop and study the responsive mixed brush platform for stimuli-triggered, programmable interfacial exposure of functional molecules (e.g., growth factors) that are important for the survival and differentiation of stem cells.  Specifically, the focus of the experimental work is on:  (a) precise design and synthesis of functional mixed polymer brushes; (b) comprehensive study of the microstructure and stimuli-triggered dynamical changes in the functionalized mixed brushes; (c) study of the dynamic interactions of the functionalized mixed brush system with functionalized probes; and (e) development of multifunctional dynamic biointerfaces.   It is also expected to determine how different stimuli such as temperature, magnetic field, and electrical signals can be used to introduce local changes in the mixed brush biointerface and result in exposure of the functional molecules.  The experimental studies will be paralleled by a coarse-grained theoretical modeling using three complementary techniques: (a) self-consistent field (SCF) calculations, (b) single-chain-in-mean-field simulations and molecular dynamics, and (c) phenomenological scaling considerations.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project is aimed to impact the field of polymeric materials for cell biology and biotechnology through the use of novel stimuli-responsive polymeric substrates. The project provides extensive opportunities to integrate research and education through cross-disciplinary student training and introduction of new educational modules in the curriculum.  The investigators plan to involve both undergraduate and graduate students in the proposed research and to train them to gain (i) expertise in nanofabrication techniques, (ii) familiarity with modern concepts in materials chemistry, (iii) the ability to synthesize and characterize nanostructured polymeric materials and biointerfaces, (iv) the ability to run experiments, gather data, and make discoveries, and (v) the ability to write scientific papers and make effective technical presentations. Students also will greatly benefit from their extensive collaborations among the participating US and German research institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Materials World Network project has focused on design and characterization of responsive thin polymer films capable of the exposure of functional molecules to interfaces.  The project supported an international US-German research team from Clemson University, Clarkson University, University of Georgia, University of California in Davis, Dresden Technical University, Leibniz-Institute for Polymer Research Dresden, University of G&ouml;ttingen, and Leibniz-Institute for Analytical Sciences (in Berlin) laboratories.                Currently, responsive polymer materials are receiving increased interest owing to their great potential for biomedical applications.  One of the important properties of such materials is the capability to present, to release, to hide, or to capture different functional fragments upon receiving external signals.  To this end, we have worked on development of the mixed polymer brush platform for stimuli-triggered, programmable interfacial exposure of functional molecules that are important for the survival and differentiation of stem cells. Our concept is to stimulate stem cells from the bottom-up using the switchable responsive polymer brush interfaces.  To this end, a number of key materials questions have been addressed over the course of the project:   What is      the best way to efficiently incorporate functional molecules into the      responsive brush interface?  How      should functional molecules be stored and delivered to the thin      film&ndash;mammalian cell interface?   What      stimuli are the most suitable for introducing interfacial changes in the      thin film and exposing or hiding functional molecules without damaging      cells?    Up to date we demonstrated that:  (a) deposition of thermoresponsive and reactive block copolymers provides an effective route to create thermally responsive brushes via a 1-step process, with properties equaling and surpassing that of traditional brushes obtained in multiple steps;  (b) the 1-step deposition of reactive block copolymers can be extended to fabricate mixed thermoresponsive block copolymer brushes;  (c) the mixed brushes are significantly protein repelling independent of temperature, while demonstrating thickness change associated with temperature variation;   (d) the mixed brushes modified with biotin functionalities demonstrate temperature switching of specific adsorption of avidin;  (e) temperature switching of specific cell adhesion to the mixed brushes functionalized with RGD-motive was found for a very narrow range of compositions;  (f) polymer brush can be responsive to magnetic field in the presence of magnetic nanoparticles;  (g) polymer brush grafted to protein surface can be degraded upon application of magnetic field.              We expect that the platform being developed will open routes to the advancement of stimuli-responsive polymer substrates that deliver a cascade of signals whereby different growth factors are presented to cells at different time points.  These biomimetic polymer surfaces will be designed in our future research projects to mimic the complex patterns of growth factor stimulation observed in vivo.  Immobilizing growth factor molecules on surfaces will also dramatically reduce the cost of performing stem cell culture experiments and will have a significant impact on stem cell-related commercialization. Overall, our interdisciplinary and international research program has the potential to transform the field of materials for cell biology and biotechnology through the creative use of novel stimuli-responsive polymeric substrates.    Educational activities of the project included the training of post-doctorate researchers, graduate, undergraduate and high school students.  The project provided ample opportunities to integrate research and education through cross-disciplinary student training in research labs, scientific seminars, and the introduction of new educational modules in the curriculum.
