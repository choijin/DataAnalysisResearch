<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to improve our understanding of certain key statistics of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems: return time statistics, extreme value statistics, dynamical Borel-Cantelli lemmas and large deviations. While there has been progress in describing these statistical properties for uniformly hyperbolic systems, uniform hyperbolicity seldom holds for physical systems and models based on non-uniform hyperbolicity are more realistic. Return time statistics quantify probabilities of a physical system transforming into or returning to a state in a certain period of time. Extreme value statistics give limit laws for successive maxima of a time series of observations on a system. Borel-Cantelli lemmas are a fundamental tool in establishing the almost-sure behavior of stochastic processes. The aim is to extend our understanding of these statistical properties to non-uniformly hyperbolic systems including those with polynomial correlation decay rate. A further goal is to obtain large deviation estimates for functions on dynamical systems with discontinuities (or singularities) or which give rise to multiplicative cocycles, such as matrix valued functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some physical systems are so complex that, although they may be modeled by mathematical equations, they are best described from the viewpoint of statistics. For example, knowing the probabilities of a hurricane located offshore affecting certain towns on the coast is useful information and more certain information usually cannot be given. However, it is a major problem that the classical statistical assumption of complete randomness (independence of successive observations) is seldom satisfied for realistic models of physical systems since successive observations are highly correlated.  Extreme value theory estimates the likelihood of observing an event of a certain magnitude, while large deviations estimates the probability of an outlier or rare event. This project aims to improve predictions of complex physical systems by providing an understanding of extreme value theory, large deviations and other statistics for a wide class of physically realistic mathematical models. The PI will also continue to work towards improving science education at all levels and by informing the public through outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

This  research was at the interface of applications and of interest to scientists modeling complex systems of biological or physical importance.  The results of  this work have been published in mathematical journals and also journals read by physicists, statisticians and probabilists to broaden their impact on the general scientific community. In particular the most significant findings of interest to statisticians were conveyed at a week-long joint workshop with statisticians on Extremes and Rare Events in 2014 at the Center for International Research in Mathematics, Luminy, France. Other aspects of this research were presented at a satellite meeting of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Daejeon, Korea.  The investigator also lectured  on facets of  this research at  two-week long summer schools for graduate students held in May 2013 and May 2014 at the University of Houston to roughly 70 graduate students from around the US.  These lectures focused on introducing probabilistic techniques  to the next generation of researchers. The investigator  initiated the mathematical statistics option in the PhD program at the University of Houston, and has developed and taught courses on statistics, probability, ergodic theory and nonlinear dynamics. These activities have been enabled by this funding.       Last Modified: 08/30/2014       Submitted by: Matthew Nicol]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
