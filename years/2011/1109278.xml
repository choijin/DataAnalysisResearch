<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research project is to develop methods for analysis, modeling, and computation for stochastic partial differential equations arising in nonlinear optics. The study of noise in these systems is complicated by several factors. In particular:&lt;br/&gt;(i) the complexity due to the interplay of many physical effects,&lt;br/&gt;(ii) the presence of multiple length and time scales, and&lt;br/&gt;(iii) the fact that the critical events that represent system failures are, by design, extremely rare.  We will address these challenges by (a) creating a set of analytical methods to obtain reductions from the stochastic partial differential equations that govern the system's behavior to a set of low-dimensional stochastic differential equations;&lt;br/&gt;(b) developing efficient methods for the study of noise across multiple time and space scales; and (c) implementing hybrid analytical-computational methods that can efficiently target the rare events of interest and ultimately estimate the reliability of these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lightwave systems have a wide range of applications, in particular as lasers and optical communication lines, and their emergence has had a dramatic impact on our lives over the last fifty years. Lasers are used at low powers in applications related to scanning and communications; at higher powers they are employed in surgical and industrial applications. As noise is a major limiting factor in optical systems, further technological progress will depend critically on understanding the impact of noise and on being able to control noise-induced system failures. This research will provide new analytical and computational tools that support the analysis and design of the next generation of optical devices.</AbstractNarration>

The physical importance of this study lies in its demonstration that, when quantifying how noise affects a physical system, it is often important to consider not only how small fluctuations dictate near-equilibrium variations of the system's state (e.g., the linewidth of an output laser line) but also how rare combinations of noise increments can accumulate to produce critical events such as phase slips that foil a laser's feedback mechanism. This is a particularly vital phenomenon in modern lasers used for precision timekeeping, a technology essential to proposals for the redefinition of the basic definition of the second, and for control of ultrafast chemical experiments, since these lasers require sensitive feedback to produce pulses of light with carefully controlled optical phases.  The intellectual merit of this study lies in the fact that recently developed numerical tools for the computation of minimizers of the action functional relevant to understanding the probability of large deviations in dynamical systems have seen relatively little deployment in applied physical systems, and virtually none in optical systems. Prof. Moore has used these tools to develop a numerical code for the computation of these minimizers in the context of pulsed optical systems arising in communications and laser settings, and has shown that the paths computed from finite-dimensional reductions of the full dynamical systems being studied can be used to inform importance-sampled Monte Carlo simulations in the full system.

The importance of the action associated with large deviations as a measure of distance between states in a stochastic system is being realized in a number of different fields ranging from materials science to neuroscience. Recent work uses this action for the purpose of observing which experimentally controllable parameters should be varied in order to induce structural bifurcations in large systems of stochastic differential equations occuring in genetic networks.

A final broader impact involves the application of methods learned in this study to a new project developed by Prof. Moore on the use of optimal control in the guidance of autonomous vehicles for the purpose of assimilating velocity fields into weakly nonlinear wave models.  Specific deliverables associated with this project include a single-authored journal article published in Optics Letters in 2014 titled "Trade-off between linewidth and slip rate in a mode-locked laser model" and a journal article co-authored with Dr. Cargill under review by the SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems titled "Incorporatin...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
