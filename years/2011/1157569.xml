<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research project is to design an effective system for managing smart grids and smart meters for electricity production and consumption, with the eventual goal of helping creating a sustainable energy future.  The scope of this research plan encompasses the robust management of smart grids, adaptive usage controls based on real-time information provided by smart meters, and the development of an effective mechanism for coordinating supply and demands.   Smart grids refer to a new and intelligent network of electricity production facilities, transmission grids, equipped with automation software and control systems for delivering and monitoring electricity to meet the demands.  Smart meters are a vital part of the smart grids technology.   These meters are equipped with intelligent sensors that track the real-time consumption of energy, enabling users to monitor their electrical usage during peak versus off-peak hours. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms and systems for making the smart grids more robust, and are able to withstand shocks within the systems will be developed.  There will also be a focus on developing a policy for controlling energy consumption in real-time based on the information provided by the smart meters. If successful, the project will facilitate the realization of smart grid's potential by developing the necessary optimization methods, control policies, and data analysis techniques for the management of smart grids and smart meters. The results of the research will be included in the curriculum of the Master of Engineering Program in Energy Markets and Risk by the IEOR Department at UC Berkeley.  The research will be translated into teaching modules that can be used for Master's students in this program.  Establishment of close collaborative relationships with companies in the energy industry and DOE national labs are planned.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcome Reports     The objective of the award is to design an effective system for managing smart grids and smart meters for electricity production, with the eventual goal of creating a sustainable energy future for our nation.  The plan encompasses research in high-dimensional complex optimization problems related to different aspects of the energy market, including dynamic resource allocations, energy portfolio assortment optimization, and real-time sourcing decisions.        Intellectual Merits:  During the lifetime of the award, we have investigated a number of high-dimensional complex stochastic-optimization problems related to the energy smart grid and smart meters, with a particular focus on dynamic pricing and resource allocations.  We will briefly describe each problem and discuss our contributions in each area.     Motivated by the availability of real-time price data smart meters, we formulate a stylized dynamic pricing model in which a monopolist prices a product to a sequence of customers, who independently make purchasing decisions based on the price offered according to a general parametric choice model. The parameters of the choice model are unknown to the seller, whose objective is to determine a pricing policy that minimizes the regret, which is the expected difference between the seller's revenue and the revenue of a clairvoyant seller who knows the values of the parameters in advance.  We establish the regret of the optimal pricing policy in this model. Furthermore, we show that when the demand curves satisfy a ``well-separated'' condition, the T-period regret of the optimal policy is of order log T.   Numerical experiments show that our policies perform well.  This work has been published in Operations Research.      In the dynamic assortment optimization, we consider the problem of real-time optimization of personalized assortments.  This problem is motivated by the availability of real-time data on customer characteristics, we consider the problem of personalizing the assortment of products to each arriving customer. Through actual sales data from an online retailer, we demonstrate that personalization based on each customer's location can lead to over 10% improvements in revenue, compared to a policy that treats all customers the same.  We propose a family of simple and effective algorithms, called Inventory-Balancing, for real-time personalized assortment optimization, that do not require any forecasting: An Inventory-Balancing algorithm, maintains a "discounted-revenue index" for each product, in which the (actual) revenue is multiplied by a (virtual) discount factor that depends on the fraction of the product's remaining inventory. Upon an arrival of each customer, based on the customer's type, the algorithm offers to her the assortment that maximizes the expected discounted revenue.  This research has been published in Management Science.     We have also investigated the problem of learning cross-price elasticity of demand functions associated with substitutable products.  This problem has applications in an energy market where there are multiple substitutable sources of energy (e.g. wind, carbon, solar, and many others), with each source having slightly different characteristics.  In addition, our model can be applied to a retailer who runs promotion on its products by placing a sale sign on the product.  With thousands of potentially substitutable and complementary products, the retailer wants to determine the optimal placement of the sale signs. The cross elasticities among products are unknown, and we can learn their values by performing price experimentations.  We must balance the tradeoff between experimenting with different sale sign placements to uncover the cross elasticity structure, and exploiting the best guess optimal decision to maximize revenue. The key challenge in this problem is the large number of products, which renders exhaustive price experimentations of each product impract...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
