<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1104670&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Eduardo Gonzalez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will investigate, using symplectic&lt;br/&gt;geometry techniques, invariants associated to Hamiltonian group&lt;br/&gt;actions. The first project will study (joint with A. Ott,&lt;br/&gt;C. Woodward and F. Ziltener) the construction of gauged&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants on punctured surfaces with fixed&lt;br/&gt;holonomies. The PI will also investigate the particular case of&lt;br/&gt;toric actions on affine complex spaces. Our second project is on&lt;br/&gt;the study of the invariance of gauged Gromov-Witten potentials&lt;br/&gt;for toric actions on affine spaces.  We will use established&lt;br/&gt;formulae to show that for Calabi-Yau wall-crossing the gauged&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten potentials do not change.  After this project is&lt;br/&gt;finished we will study the behaviour of the potential in the&lt;br/&gt;non-toric case. This will be done jointly with C. Woodward.  Our&lt;br/&gt;third proposed activity, joint with H. Iritani, will explain the&lt;br/&gt;relation between Seidel elements and Mirror Transformations for&lt;br/&gt;nef toric non-singular projective varieties. We will then try to&lt;br/&gt;apply our methods to the non-nef case. Our last proposed project&lt;br/&gt;with A. Cotton-Clay will attempt to resolve a conjecture due to&lt;br/&gt;M. Thaddeus relating Floer cohomology for symplectomorphisms and&lt;br/&gt;orbifold (stacky) cohomology for global quotients by finite&lt;br/&gt;groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research will advance the interplay of several subjects in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and physics where symmetries play a relevant&lt;br/&gt;role. The first project in this grant will advance the&lt;br/&gt;understanding and applications of symplectic geometry and gauge&lt;br/&gt;theory (the modern language of elementary particle physics) into&lt;br/&gt;physical theories called "gauged sigma models".  Our other&lt;br/&gt;projects will provide a different approach to the Mirror Symmetry&lt;br/&gt;phenomena using symplectic geometry invariants.</AbstractNarration>
