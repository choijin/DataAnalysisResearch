<AbstractNarration>The aim of the proposal is to use tools from free probability theory to study three areas of mathematics: random matrix theory, subfactor theory and the theory of von Neumann algebras. The tools involve a kind of differential calculus introduced earlier by Voiculescu in the context of his free information theory. Studying properties of differential operators from this "free calculus" will allow the investigator to formulate non-commutative analogs of PDE and SDE techniques. These in turn will give applications in von Neumann algebras, random matrix and subfactor theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the four areas - random matrix theory, subfactor theory and the theory of von Neumann algebras - are amazingly rich mathematically. For example, Jones' subfactor theory has led to the discovery of a novel knot invariant, which has uses in diverse areas of mathematics and beyond (including the study of structure of DNA). Research in random multi-matrix models has engineering applications such as cell phone design. The focus of the present research is on the interplay between these four areas with the aim towards developing tools and techniques that are likely to impact all of the areas involved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the key outcomes of our project is the development of a mathematical technique called free-probability transportation theory. This theory allows one to find ways of manipulating non-commutative variables (e.g. large matrices or operators on a Hilbert space) in order to effect a desired change of state.  Using these techniques, we were able to answer an old question in free probaility / von Neumann algebras: we showed that the so-called q-deformed Gaussian variables for small q generate the same operator algebras as the non-deformed ones.  This line of work has been continued by other researchers, enabling them to show that other operator algebras are the same ("isomorphic").  The same techniques found use in random matrix theory, where analysis of such transformations enabled deep results on the distribution of matrix eigenvalues.  Over the course of the project it has provided partial support (in the form of research assistantships) to four graduate students, three of whom have graduated (one currently has a tenure-track position and two have postdoctoral positions) and one of whom is expected to graduate in a year.  The project has resulted in a number of journal publications both by the PI and his students.  Preliminary results from the project were disseminated in the form of preprints.
