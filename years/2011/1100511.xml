<AbstractNarration>The investigator studies problems in structural and computational number theory, notably the arithmetic of varieties such as elliptic curves and surfaces, and their relations and applications to other areas of mathematics such as error-correcting codes and Euclidean lattices.  Specific projects include:&lt;br/&gt;Extending the investigation of high-rank K3 surfaces to supersingular surfaces in positive characteristic; continuing and extending the use of explicit equations and moduli of high-rank K3 surfaces in characteristic zero, with various applications to modular curves and varieties and to Diophantine records; further study of the connection between bilinear (Somos) recurrences, theta sequences, and explicit moduli spaces; generalizing results with Scott Kominers on harmonic weight enumerators via representations of Lie algebras to treat linear codes over arbitrary finite fields; improving and extending results with Henry Cohn and Abhinav Kumar on sphere packings and related questions; and working with Kent Boklan on completing the solution of Waring's problem for seven cubes in the remaining residue classes mod 18.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will continue to study problems in number theory concerning the mathematical structure of algebraic solutions of equations and the practical computation and applications of such solutions. This should lead both to better understanding of the structure of those equations and their solutions (elliptic curves, etc.), and to further connections with other topics such as the theory of computation, error-correcting codes, and sphere packing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Intellectual merit":  The most productive research direction was the study of algebraic K3 surfaces, which occupy a central place in 2-dimensional algebraic geometry, analogous to that of elliptic curves in dimension 1.  The PI continued to find and use explicit models and formulas for objects for which previous work gave theoretical existence proofs but could not exhibit actual equations.  Because of the ubiquity of K3 surfaces, this led to advances in several directions, such as new formulas for moduli spaces (with my student Abhinav Kumar) and elliptic fibrations in positive characteristic (with Matthias Sch?tt).  Research supporting or suggested by the K3 computations also produced results of independent interest: algorithms for classifying quadratic forms (a classical problem in number theory and elsewhere) that are fast enough to considerably extend the frontier of practical feasibility; and new bounds on the number of lines on an algebraic surface obtained by a new combination of algebraic geometry with the bounds on spherical codes that were also part of this proposal (see the first image).  Some of the PI's research found interest outside its home fields of arithmetic and algebraic geometry.  For example, elliptic fibrations of K3 surfaces arise naturally in string theory, so new formulas and algorithms are of interest there too.  Moreover, as has happened several times before, the PI was able to apply  his computational tools in unexpected directions; here, linear programming and recognition of algebraic numbers made it possible to find sharper bounds on band-limited "box minorants" in high dimensions (joint with Jacob Carruth, Felipe Gon?alves, and Michael Kelly; see the second image).  "Broader impact":  The PI continued to consult and serve on advisory boards at the Centers for Communications Research in Princeton and la Jolla, using his technical and problem-solving expertise to contribute to the Centers' classified mathematical work; advised and mentored graduate and undergraduate students, resulting in one doctoral thesis (Nathan Kaplan) and several undergraduate honors theses; gave expository mathematical lectures, some aimed at high school students or non-math majors in college, often featuring mathematical aspects of music; and gave numerous answers (some of which earned high "upvote" scores) on the public forums Math Overflow and Math Stack Exchange.
