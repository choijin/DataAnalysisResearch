<AbstractNarration>Dr. Lagarias will investigate three problem areas in number theory and geometry. The first topic concerns study of generalizations of the Lerch zeta function and their interpretation in representation theory terms. The second topic concerns the study of Hilbert spaces of entire functions and associated operators related to automorphic L-functions. The third topic concerns exploration of analogies between circle packings, conformal geometry and Diophantine approximation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subjects of number theory and geometry interact in several areas, including packing problems and the geometry of numbers. In recent years these connections have led to interactions across mathematics, physics and materials sciences. Number theory has also provided many useful applications in communications, coding theory and cryptography. Zeta functions encode both number theoretic and geometric invariants. The proposal will study one class of such functions to explore connections of this kind. There have also been connections noted between zeta functions and operators in mathematical physics, and Dr.Lagarias will investigate connections of this kind from the operator side. Thirdly, circle packings have recently been intensively studied, as they seem to provide a discrete bridge between conformal geometry and number theory. The problems considered may stimulate interactions between researchers in the fields: conformal geometry,mathematical physics and number theory. Dr. Lagarias is training graduate students in both number theoretic and geometric topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research area of this grant is number theory (the study of properties of integers) and its relation to analysis and geometry. A connection to geometry comes through connection to packings (``Geometry of Numbers"), which are important in communications and cryptography. In particular it includes circle packings with circles of various sizes and in various configurations, which can model the shape of surfaces with curvature.  The research in this grant covered diverse topics. One topic  concerned study of properties of  zeta functions and their relatives, Eisenstein series.These number theory functions encode data on the distribution of integers ofvarious kinds, and some of them encode statistical data on regular packings of geometric objects. A second topic concerned the study of the interaction between  the addition and multiplication operation on integers.  A third topic included the problem of reconstructing certain kinds of circle packings from specified data. A fourth topic  investigated the statistics of products of fractions inthe unit interval with bounded denominator. This work, done with an undergraduate, Harsh Mehta, found an unexpected connection to a central problem in pure mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis.     During the period of this grant 21 papers were published arising from this grant or from earlier ones.In addition 10 further papers were written, which are available as preprints, and which have been submitted for publication. Over the grant period the PI mentored 8  graduate students, 6 of whom completed the PhD. during the grant period. The following summarizes briefly  the  work of four of them.      Andrey Mishchenko (PhD 2012) worked on the problem of the structure of disk packings. Such packings can be used to model surfaces.He studied arrangements of overlapping circular disks where which disks overlap is specified and the angles at which such  overlapping disks intersect is specified. Here the size of the circles is not specified. He imposed a ``thinness" condition saying roughly that atmost $3$ circles cover each point. He showed a result establishing that  such  packing data uniquely specifies the packing under general conditions (up to a motion allowed in the given geometry, which is the non-Euclidean geometry that preserves circles).  Julian Rosen (PhD 2013) studied multiple harmonic sums.The harmonic sums  are the sums of the reciprocals first n integers. It is known that they can be related to the Riemann hypothesis. Generalizations of these statistics appear in evaluating Feynman diagrams in calculations in  quantum field theory. Julian discovered  new  regularities   concerning divisibility by prime powers of combinations of them.   Harry Altman (PhD 2014)  studied the problem of how complicated it is to build upa given integer using addition and multiplication ofsmaller integers already built up, starting from 1 . Such questions, which sound simple, raise  fundamental issues in computation, and are related to the  famous P versus NP  Problem, one of the Clay Mathematics Institute  Millennium Problems. He studied two different computational models: ``addition chains" and ``integer complexity". Harry studied the minimal values of these numbers in both models (which appear to be very hard to compute exactly) and found a surprising extra structure (``well-ordering") present in a statistics associated to them, which relates their values  to a more easily computable  quantity, the ``defect".  Trung Hieu Ngo (PhD 2014) constructed generalizations of the Lerch zeta function, a multivariable zeta function. The Lerch zeta function was discovered in the 1880's but it has resisted generalization in directions that have been done for many related zeta functions. His thesis found one way to do it. The properties of these new functions are under further investigation.      For broader impacts, this grant involved the training of  8 graduate students, 6 of whom  completed the PhD. degree over the gr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
