<AbstractNarration>The first part of this project focuses on infinite systems of stochastic equations.  Such systems provide natural models in their own right, but results in this part of the project will also provide essential tools for the study of the stochastic partial differential equations to be considered in the second part.  The second part of the project will develop methods for representing solutions of stochastic partial differential equation in terms of infinite systems of "particles."  These particle representations provide powerful tools for analyzing and approximating the associated models.  In some cases, the particle representations arise naturally from the phenomenological interpretation of the stochastic partial differential equation.  In others, they simply provide a mathematical tool for its analysis.  The particle systems are typically specified as solutions of infinite systems of stochastic differential equations, and uniqueness results to be developed in the first part of the project will play a critical role in obtaining the desired representations. The third part of the project continues work on models of intracellular reaction networks. One goal will be to provide algorithms that simplify the application of earlier work on model reduction.  A second will be to extend the earlier results to models that take into account the spatial structure of the cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of stochastic processes is concerned with mathematical descriptions of natural phenomena governed by "random" or "chance" mechanisms. Mathematical models of such phenomena may attempt to describe variation in time, in space, or both. The research to be performed is concerned with developing methods for specifying these mathematical models, approximating complex models by simpler ones, and constructing models addressing specific scientific applications.   One fundamental approach to specifying models of stochastic phenomena is to formulate equations with stochastic inputs whose solution is the desired model.  Different stochastic equations may determine the same model, and different equations may provide different insight into the model and the phenomenon the model addresses. The project is concerned with how to develop and exploit multiple representations for classes of models that arise naturally in physical, biological and financial systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Genealogical constructions of population models.  Mathematical models of the development and evolution of biological populations play a central role in understanding these systems.  The simplest models track the size of the population while more complicated models consider many types of individuals and their locations in space and how the distribution of types and locations changes in time.  Models that track a finite population are typically stochastic; however,  complex models are frequently simplified by assuming the population is large (infinite) and by approximating the large population model by a model given by an ordinary or partial differential equation or a stochastic model that has continuity properties that make it simpler to analyze or simulate.  Two individuals in a population may be related (third cousins twice removed), but these relationships are lost in the typical population model.  These relationships are central to the study of genetics and have typically been modeled by coalescent representations of the genealogies. Beginning with joint work with Peter Donnelly in the 1990s and continuing in a 2011 paper with Eliane Rodrigues, models were constructed that capture both the forward in time evolution of the distribution of the types and locations of the individuals and the backward in time genealogy for the population present at any point in time.  The constructions are carried out in such a way that the infinite population approximations are obtained as limits of finite population models in which both the population distributions and the genealogies converge.  The work with Donnelly focused on models in which the birth and death rates for individuals did not depend on their types or locations or depended only slightly.  The work with Rodrigues eliminated this restriction for a particular class of models called branching processes.  Work with Alison Etheridge, under the current project, extends these genealogical constructions to a much larger class of population models allowing for different ways of modeling births and deaths including such things as catastrophes in which a large portion of the population dies. These constructions can capture key forces of ecology and genetics within a common framework.  Particle representations for stochastic partial differential equations.  This approach to stochastic partial differential equations provides a powerful method for studying a large variety of stochastic models. One of the most intuitive examples is an idealized model of the pricing of some asset.  Consider a large number of traders interested in the same category of assets.  Each trader has his or her own opinion regarding the value of the asset and these opinions evolve stochastically over time.  If the current price of the asset is less than a trader's valuation, then if the trader owns a unit, the trader will sell.  If the trader's valuation is more than the price and the trader does not own a unit, the trader will buy.   Assuming that no trader owns more than one unit and that there are half as many units of the asset as there are traders (or pick some other fraction), then the price of the asset should be the median of the valuations of the traders.  As in the case of the population models, this type of model may be simplified by assuming an infinite number of traders and a proportional number of units of the asset.  For appropriate models, in this "infinite trader limit", the distribution of valuations of the traders will be given by a stochastic partial differential equation where the coefficients of the equation depend on the price of the asset which is given by the median (or some other quantile) of the distribution of valuations.   Stochastic models of chemical reaction networks.  Simple stochastic models of chemical reactions that tracked the numbers of molecules of all chemical species were studied in both the mathematical and physics literature 50 years ago.  Since stochastic effects in most chemistry lab or chemical industry scale reactions are small, interest in these models waned until biologists became interested in modeling chemical reactions inside of biological cells and recognized that the stochastic effects could not be ignored.  Biological reaction networks are large and complex and present a variety of problems not studied 50 years ago.  In particular, work in the current project studies ways of simplifying these complex models in such a way that the reduced model still capture important features of the original network.
