<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on reducing bioterrorism threat by integrating tools from genomics and statistics in ways that have not been previously examined. The investigators develop novel statistical theory and computational tools for accurate pathogen detection based on next generation sequencing data. Key research directions involve (i) classification by sequence enrichment; (ii) comparison of empirical clusterings and reference genomes; and (iii) shrinkage estimation and model selection in hierarchical log-linear models. In addition to an in-depth characterization of the theoretical properties of these new statistical inference techniques, the investigators perform a thorough assessment of their practical importance in the context of the detection and identification of bacterial genomes. This assessment is done using publicly available data from sources such as the Human Microbiome Project, the NCBI Short Read Archive, the European Bioinformatics Institute, and the Broad Institute. The applicability of this new methodology is broad and relates to high-dimensional settings in which choosing an appropriate class of candidate statistical models is difficult. The investigators study statistical ensembles, combinations of techniques that have been shown to provide more reliable inferences than any single statistical approach. As opposed to existing work which combines models from the same class, this new framework concerns ensembles that cross class boundaries and optimally combine inferences from multiple models from several model classes. These ensembles are expected to have distinct advantages over existing approaches, such as robustness to model misspecification and improved predictive performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new statistical methodology developed in this proposal has the potential to substantially improve the response of federal and international agencies to a bioterrorism attack through a rapid identification of differences in microbial genomes and their accurate classification as harmless or potentially pathogenic. The impact of these algorithms for pathogen detection on both information technology and civil infrastructure is maximized through their implementation in user-friendly, open-source computational tools and software that will be freely available to the public. The project also has a significant educational and mentorship component for students and postdoctoral fellows who are interested in enhancing our ability to respond rapidly and appropriately to (i) incidents of bioterrorism, and (ii) microbial threats to public health.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Discrete emergency events, such as terrorist attacks, occur frequently around the globe and regularly cause massive destruction. These emergency events can occur anytime, anywhere, and often without warning. Occurrences in rural areas or countries with poor communication and transportation infrastructure make it difficult to identify and respond to such emergencies in a timely and appropriate manner to avert full scale disaster. Delays in response can exacerbate the magnitude and length of the disaster period after an emergency event, resulting in serious epidemiological problems.  With the ultimate aim to decrease the humanitarian toll of post-event disasters, the fundamental goal of this project was to provide reliable statistical tools for the detection and identification of bacterial genomes from metagenomic next generation sequencing data. The tools we developed can be integrated in an online system that is able to measure in real time the risk of attacks with pathogens harmful to humans. During the course of our research, we discovered that we must extend out methods to jointly detect unknown bacterial genomes at multiple sites across the country. To this end, we focused on developing spatiotemporal statistical models that combine multiple sources of information, capture human behavior across multiple locations, identify outlier events and their potential causes. Our results suggest that human behavioral responses to extreme events are complex and multi-dimensional. We found significant temporal and spatial variance in responses to extreme events such as the ones that are associated with a disease caused by a pathogen. Our behavioral anomaly detection system is a significant contribution to the long-term project of creating an effective real-time event detection system based on metagenomic next generation sequencing data, geolocated human mobility information, and geographic information systems data.   The methodologies developed by this project will also make an impact on metagenomic analyses, which are relevant to understanding the biological and ecological processes which determine the human microbiome and health, the soil microbiome and sustainable agriculture, the food production, and the impact of pathogens on ecosystems.
