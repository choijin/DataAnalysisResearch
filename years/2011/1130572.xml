<AbstractNarration>How can we explain the widely observed mismatch between voter support for redistributive policies and actual levels of redistribution achieved? In contrast to most extant research, this project focuses on the redistributive role of tax policy. The project relies on an analysis of state-level administrative data as well as an analysis of media coverage to pursue three substantive goals: It examines how political, institutional, and organizational factors have affected variation in tax progressivity across states. It also examines whether the way tax rates are structured subsequently affects the redistributive character of state expenditure policies. Finally, the proposed research investigates how the way tax issues are framed in public discourse affects voter support for redistributive policies. In addition, the project seeks to develop a way to measure actual voter support for redistributive policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The general public has repeatedly demonstrated a pronounced interest in how taxes are used to finance entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Federal income tax progressivity has declined in recent years, while noticeable state-level differences in income tax policies persist. This research will produce a comprehensive data set of value to the public. Findings from this study may further our understanding of the substantial role that taxes play in redistributive policies.  These findings may be of interest to a broad range of stakeholders, including taxpayers, policy makers, and government officials at all levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During a period of rising economic inequality, the United States pursued a regimen of fiscal reform, drastically cutting top federal income tax rates.  In recent years, however, a bold experiment in fiscal policy has been happening in U.S. states.  Starting with New Jersey in 2004, nine states and Washington, D.C., have added new tax brackets at the very top of the income distribution.  These "millionaire taxes" have been seen as policy levers that can bridge budget gaps and reduce income inequality.  But are the fiscal and redistributive results of state-level millionaire taxes sustainable?  It is common wisdom that raising taxes in a locality will promote  out-migration by the wealthy, a view grounded in a simplistic  interpretation of neoclassical economics.  In his dissertation, supported  by the Doctoral Dissertation Research grant, Charles Varner develops  empirical evidence and a theoretical rationale for why this view is  incorrect.  Empirically, incomes of $1 million or more are infrequent and  sporadic and people are unlikely to leave when they are having a good  year.  Theoretically, the wealthy, like everyone else, are socially  embedded within particular places, and moving has costs.  In a series of three analyses,  Charles Varner demonstrated this reality.  First, a  time series analysis  of million dollar earners in California revealed  that top income  earners were less likely than others to leave the state  in the wake of a  new millionaire tax.  Second, a quasi-experimental  analysis of the  migratory response to a large increase in New Jersey's  top income tax  rate found a very small effect and revealed that  imposition of the tax  increased revenue and reduced inequality.  Third, a  discontinuity  analysis of all million-dollar income  earners in the  United States over 16 years demonstrated that millionaire  tax flight  occurs only at the margins of statistical and socio-economic   significance.  In the end, the dissertation confirms that simplistic   economic assumptions about the effect of increased taxes on migration   are wrong, and that states can indeed raise taxes on the wealthy (at   least at levels recently implemented in the United States) without   prompting an outflow of the wealthy and in so doing increase overall   revenues.  These important findings have obvious implications for state tax   policies in the U.S.       Last Modified: 02/26/2016       Submitted by: Charles E Varner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
