<AbstractNarration>Recently there has been a rapid growing interest in developing underwater acoustic sensor networks, which can be used in monitoring aquatic environments for scientific exploration, commercial exploitation, and coastline protection. The complexity of aquatic environments and the sophistication of the networking scenarios demand new solutions for underwater networks, and require significant research efforts at every level of the protocol suite. In this project, a novel approach of using surface radios to help underwater acoustics is employed. An integrated hybrid radio and acoustic distributed system for geometrydynamic shallow water applications is developed. This system has numerous benefits such as high energy efficiency, high reliability and low end-to-end delay. Deliverables include solutions to three critical tasks, namely, distributed gateway deployment algorithms to reduce computational complexity, joint optimization with underwater sensor network to improve the whole network performance, and dynamic gateway deployment for mobile network scenarios. A set of protocols and algorithms are also a part of the deliverables. These solutions and algorithms contribute toward the intellectual merit. Beyond the research significance, this project has important impact on education on three fronts including supporting graduate students in their advanced research, supporting undergraduates, women and other under-represented groups, and promoting multi-disciplinary collaborations among faculty and students across departments.</AbstractNarration>
