<AbstractNarration>The PIs and Co-PIs of grants supported through the NSF-NIH-BMBF Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program meet annually. This will be the seventh meeting of CRCNS investigators, and the first involving US-German projects supported by NSF/NIH and BMBF. The meeting brings together a broad spectrum of computational neuroscience researchers supported by the program, and includes poster presentations, talks and plenary lectures. The meeting is scheduled for October 9-11, 2011 and will be held at Princeton University.</AbstractNarration>
