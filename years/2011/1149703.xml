<AbstractNarration>CAREER: 3D Stacked Systems for Energy-Efficient Computing: &lt;br/&gt;Innovative Strategies in Modeling and Runtime Management&lt;br/&gt;Ayse K. Coskun, Boston University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy efficiency is a central issue in computing. In large-scale computing clusters, operational and cooling costs impose significant sustainability challenges. Embedded systems run increasingly complex, performance demanding workloads, making the well-known energy management policies inadequate. High power densities also cause high on-chip temperatures and large thermal variations, both of which degrade system reliability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goal of this project is to demonstrate that 3D stacked systems, where multiple chips are vertically attached, can provide dramatic increases in energy efficiency. Realizing this ambitious energy efficiency goal requires novel analysis, design, and runtime management techniques. This project?s objective is creating these catalyst techniques to make 3D systems effective agents for attaining low-power, high-throughput computing in both embedded and large-scale computing domains.  Specific research directions are: (1) developing a widely applicable methodology for jointly analyzing the performance, energy, and temperature characteristics of 3D multi-core systems; (2) designing runtime management policies to maximize performance under thermal or power constraints; (3) optimizing liquid-cooled 3D systems to push the performance bounds while maintaining reliable and low-energy operation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A realizable target for this project in the next decade is a significant reduction in overall energy consumption for computing infrastructure, which translates into monetary savings and carbon footprint reduction. The project also has immediate impact on the system and software design practice. Relevance of the research topic to today?s fast growing computing paradigms such as embedded systems, high-performance computing, and cloud enables constructing a broad educational and outreach plan for K-12 and college students.</AbstractNarration>

As computational demands increase across the board with emerging applications, power densities rise further and push the already challenging chip temperature levels. This project&rsquo;s claim was that achieving orders of magnitude of energy efficiency improvements requires novel system and software design approaches coupled with dynamic techniques that recognize the hardware-software characteristics and understand the complex interplay among performance, energy, and temperature. Specifically, the research aim was to demonstrate that 3D-stacked systems, where multiple chips are manufactured and vertically connected, has the potential to provide dramatic increases in energy efficiency, if carefully designed and managed. Realizing this ambitious energy efficiency goal, however, is non-trivial and requires novel analysis, design, and runtime management techniques.

Major technical accomplishments include the design of a full-system modeling methodology, design and software release of a thermal simulator for 3D-stacked systems, design of runtime management methods that optimize temperature and performance tradeoffs, design of resource &ldquo;pooling&rdquo; techniques on 3D-stacked architectures, and design of a hardware-software prototype for a 3D modular multicore processor.</p> <p>This project has so far resulted in a number of publications at top-tier conferences and journals, including (but not limited to) at DAC&rsquo;12, DATE&rsquo;14, VLSI-SoC&rsquo;13, IEEE Transactions on CAD&rsquo;13, ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies, DATE&rsquo;14, DATE&rsquo;16, and IEEE Transaction son CAD&rsquo;17, and &nbsp;also two book chapters.</p> <p>Differentiating aspects of the work have manifested in several fronts. (1) This project provided a general, widely applicable methodology for accurately and jointly analyzing the performance, energy, and temperature characteristics of 3D multicore systems (while most prior research targets either a specific architecture or only one of these three parameters). (2) Optimizing 3D systems with DRAM stacking was a core focus in the project due to the potential performance benefits of on-chip memory. (3) Modeling the heterogeneity in 3D systems (resulting from stacking different technologies together and from the distribution of vias or liquid cooling microchannels) was again a crucial component in the project.
