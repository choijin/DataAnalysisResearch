<AbstractNarration>Kahua A'o utilizes Hawaiian newspaper articles about Earth Science events written between 1843 and 1948 as a foundation for Earth Science education. In Hawai'i, a lack of qualified Earth Science teachers limits student awareness of Earth Science as a part of daily life, a potential career path, and a link to past events.  This is particularly relevant to Native Hawaiians who are 28% of students in Hawai'i's public schools but are underrepresented in STEM courses, majors, and careers.  Kahua A'o, a collaboration of the University of Hawai'i's College of Education, School of Hawaiian Knowledge, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, and Windward Community College employs translations of Hawaiian newspaper articles as a culturally responsive way to connect highly descriptive writings to place and standards-based Earth Science curriculum development and teacher training that includes science materials and fieldtrips to familiar geologic features, e.g., the Honolulu Volcanic Series' Diamond Head, Punchbowl, Koko Crater, and Hanauma Bay. &lt;br/&gt;Articles provide insights about living on islands with limited resources exposed to natural hazards e.g., volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunami, drought, and storms. Articles on Mauna Loa's 1859 eruption contributed to a recent report on channelized lava flows while others describe the land-based impact of storms recorded in shipping logs.  As over 95% of 1.5 million pages of text are still in Hawaiian, the project will 1) increase historical, place-based resources for science teachers, scientists, and informal science educators and 2) convey the science underlying Hawaiian cultural practices. Earth science modules and articles will be disseminated through teacher education classes, workshops, symposia and the worldwide web for K12 teachers to utilize as lessons bringing Native Hawaiian voices and viewpoints into geoscience education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes Report for Award Number 1108569  Kahua Aæo&mdash;A Learning Foundation: Using Hawaiian Language Newspaper Articles for Place and Culture-based Geoscience Teacher Education and Curriculum Development   Intellectual merit:  The University of Hawai?i and Hawai?i State Department of Education view Kahua A?o as a leader in integrating historical Hawaiian knowledge into science research and education.   The project developed two related bodies of knowledge: new information leading to better understanding of historical geoscience events and new curricular materials and pedagogical approaches supporting more effective Earth science teaching of culturally diverse students.  For students, science educators, and scientists, the project gave the first glimpse into a new resource, Hawaiian language newspaper articles, curated into a database of over 4,000 science-related 19th and early 20th-century Hawaiian language newspaper articles resulting from collaboration between JIMAR (Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research) a university-NOAA collaboration and Hawaiinuiakea School of Hawaiian Knowledge.  Broader Impacts:  From 2011-2015 Kahua AÆo was broadly disseminated through the project website (manoa.hawaii.edu/kahuaao), workshops hosted by Bishop Museum, Polynesian Voyaging Society, Hanauma Bay; presentations in P-20 classes, presentations at 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 NARST International conferences; presentations and workshops at 2013, 2014, 2015 Hawaii STEM Conferences; 5 posters at 2012, 2013, 2014 AGU Annual Meetings; 2 posters at the 2014 AGU/Ocean Science Meeting; 1 poster presented at the 2015 4th International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation (ICLDC), and 4 research papers published, in press or in review (e.g., The Hawai?i Hurricane of 1871 by Steven Businger, Puakea Nogelmeier, and Thomas Schroeder).     The high visibility of the project impacted ways of thinking about science education and more broadly, Indigenous language and knowledge in Hawai?i and other communities.   The project has been seminal in expanding the purposeful integration of historical Hawaiian-language resources into English-language and bilingual curricula.  The successful application to P-20 formal and informal science education in Hawai?i and in American S?moa suggests the Kahua A?o model demonstrating how cultural and historical resources may be incorporated into curriculum development and teacher education can be replicated and applied in other cultural settings.               The projectÆs networking and transdisciplinary collaborations are inherent strengths of the model.  From its inception, Kahua A?o has been presented in K-20 educational settings, local through international science conferences, and meetings of Hawai?iÆs P-20 educators and policy makers.  Kahua AÆo lessons have been incorporated into participating teachersÆ lessons and contributed to Bishop Museum and Sea GrantÆs Hanauma Bay education programs.  JIMAR continues to update and expand its database of earth science related Hawaiian language newspaper articles.  Sea GrantÆs recognition of the usefulness of newspaper articles in Kahua A?o research and education led to expanded support for translation of coastal zone-related Hawaiian language materials and a new website (seagrant.soest.hawaii.edu/hna) hosting all translated articles with original text and meta-data.  The website supports access, usability and collaboration, leading to inclusion of more than 100 translated articles and original texts from the JIMAR database.  Kahua A?o introduced a local and wider science community to the potential of Hawaiian-language resources for scientific study via statistical analysis of newspaper articles mentioning rain and drought published between 1870 and 1900.  Findings revealed the impact of El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a in Hawai?i while also providing evidence of ecological awareness and high literacy rates in the Hawaiian community.
