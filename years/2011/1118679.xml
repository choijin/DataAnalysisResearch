<AbstractNarration>The Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative (CCURI - www.ccuri.org) is a national consortium of community colleges, four-year schools, government agencies, and private organizations dedicated to the development, implementation, and assessment of a sustainable model for integrating an undergraduate research (UR) experience into community college biology curriculum. In partnership with the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR), CCURI has developed a fully-integrated model for integrating undergraduate research at a community college. This project aims to: 1) Expand a modified version of the CCURI model to 16 additional community colleges; 2) Implement a comprehensive evaluation of the CCURI model on student learning, competency, and retention in STEM; 3) Measure the impact of the CCURI model on developing institutional capacity at the 16 additional community colleges that are committed to developing an undergraduate research program; and 4) Disseminate the modified CCURI model of integration and the customized versions of the model as they exist at the institutional partners within CCURI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is responsive to the recommendations for biology education reform called for in both Vision and Change: A Call To Action (NSF/AAAS) and the BIO 2010 report (NRC). CCURI is working toward a fully validated strategy that community colleges can look to in understanding how to initiate reform. The CCURI model is novel in that it was developed from a Root Cause Analysis of the unique barriers that community colleges face in sustaining UR programs. The project includes economic impact metrics as a tool for evaluating a Community College Faculty Model and leverages a partnership with Tennessee Tech &amp; their CAT instrument to capture gains in critical thinking skills - an outcome with implications beyond biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is creating and sustaining a national network of Community Colleges committed to bringing the UR experience into biology curriculum. The model is helping community colleges overcome the unique barriers that have prevented them from employing the power of the UR pedagogy in the education of approximately 45% of all U.S. undergraduates including underrepresented groups and students who are the first generation of their family to attend college. The results from the extensive evaluation plan is being widely disseminated and used to refine the model for integrating the UR experience at a community college.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative (CCURI) supports community and technical colleges in integrating undergraduate research into their institutions. The CCURI model includes inquiry-based teaching and hands-on research experiences. Partners incorporate these experiences in courses, programs, and/or summers as part of their academic programming and curriculum reform efforts.</p> <p>With support from the National Science Foundation, CCURI has grown from a network of 6 regional community colleges to a National Network of over 40 institutional partners and affiliates. In 2014, CCURI established a southwest regional network of Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) as part of their network, which CCURI will target for expansion moving forward. This regional network was supported with targeted workshops and programming for HSI partners to share best practices and address challenges associated with the recruitment and retention of Hispanic STEM students.</p> <p>CCURI has supported approximately 4,000 students and 220 professional staff (faculty, administrators, and technicians) each year in the development, implementation, dissemination, and evaluation of a diverse portfolio of undergraduate research experiences within multiple different STEM disciplines. In support of program development, CCURI has provided the following resources:</p> <ul> <li>Faculty development in both field and laboratory methods</li> <li>Dissemination of faculty and student work at CCURI sponsored regional symposia</li> <li>Publications of best practices for undergraduate research at the community college</li> <li>Equipment and supplies for the development of novel research projects</li> <li>Support for evaluation of project and program outcomes</li> </ul> <p>In addition to supporting individual institutions with their program development, CCURI has devoted resources to conducting meta-analyses of the network in an attempt to develop a list of best practices that can then be shared with the academic community. As part of this effort, CCURI conducted a &ldquo;barriers study,&rdquo; which was aimed at identifying the primary barriers associated with developing a research experience as part of a course (CURE), a degree program (PURE) or summer experience (SURE). The results of this study were then used to inform new partner institutions as they joined the CCURI network. In doing this, new institutions were made aware of those barriers, and then best practices for meeting the challenge of those barriers were shared during program development. This significantly reduced the amount of &ldquo;onboarding&rdquo; time for new partners and help accelerate the implementation of their unique institutional plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/30/2016<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;Hewlett</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475253769587_DSC_1184--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475253769587_DSC_1184--rgov-800width.jpg" title="National Poster Session"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475253769587_DSC_1184--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="National Poster Session"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">CCURI student sharing her work as part of a student poster session held in Washington, D.C.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jim Hewlett</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">James&nbsp;Hewlett</div> <div class="imageTitle">National Poster Session</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475254089953_13668882_1010800598969237_180736096060954057_o--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475254089953_13668882_1010800598969237_180736096060954057_o--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field Methods Workshop"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475254089953_13668882_1010800598969237_180736096060954057_o--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Field Methods Workshop"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">CCURI faculty attending a session lead by Co-PI John VanNiel at the CCURI Field Methods Workshop at Finger Lakes Community College</div> <div class="imageCredit">Heather Bock</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">James&nbsp;Hewlett</div> <div class="imageTitle">Field Methods Workshop</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475254268478_11263080_808922392490393_1642783243426903030_n--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475254268478_11263080_808922392490393_1642783243426903030_n--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Poster Session"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475254268478_11263080_808922392490393_1642783243426903030_n--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Poster Session"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Eager CCURI students from all over the country heading to one of the CCURI sponsored student poster sessions</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kara Schmidt</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">James&nbsp;Hewlett</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Poster Session</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475254578042_14524348_1054974204551876_3440516033877574310_o--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475254578042_14524348_1054974204551876_3440516033877574310_o--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Laboratory Methods"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1118679/1118679_10132444_1475254578042_14524348_1054974204551876_3440516033877574310_o--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Laboratory Methods"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">CCURI faculty attending the CCURI Laboratory Methods Workshop at Tulsa Community College in Tulsa, OK</div> <div class="imageCredit">James Hewlett</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">James&nbsp;Hewlett</div> <div class="imageTitle">Laboratory Methods</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
