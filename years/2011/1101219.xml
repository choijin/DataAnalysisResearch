<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the international "Workshop on Partial Differential Equations and Several Complex Variables" that will be held from August 1-5, 2011, in Serra Negra, Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on a variety of topics in the area of several complex variables (e.g., the analysis and geometry CR-manifolds; analytic hypoellipticity of differential operators; overdetermined systems of partial differential equations and their applications in geometry), with the theory of partial differential equations providing the unifying theme. All of the topic areas cited in the proposal are central to analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities, especially in the mini-courses that will be offered by Jeff McNeal and Loredana Lanzani.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop focused on recent results and developments in two closely related areas of mathematics, namely, several complex variables and partial differential equations. Two mini-courses on topics of current interest in these fields formed an integral part of the workshop. The min-courses were designed especially for those participants who are at the beginning of their research career. In addition, there were several opportunities during the workshop when open problems were discussed.  This workshop promoted existing collaborations between several U.S. and Brazilian researchers. It also provided an opportunity to several graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s to interact with many leading experts and learn about important open problems in these fields. From the U.S., fourteen graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s and twelve senior mathematicians participated in this workshop. There were also many participants from Brazil, France, Italy, Ireland, and Austria.  Local support for the participants of the workshop was covered using grants from the Brazilian agencies CNPq, Capes, Fapesp, and IM-AGIMB.   A description of the talks, mini-courses, poster presentations, and a list of the participants is available at the site www.dm.ufscar.br/eventos/wpde2011.   The intellectual merit of the workshop includes the further promotion and advancement of collaboration between U.S. researchers and their counterparts in Brazil. Among the participants, at least five from the U.S. are collaborating with Brazilian mathematicians who attended the workshop.   The broader impact of the workshop includes the opportunity that it provided to graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s from the U.S. to present their results and discuss the status and future directions of their works with leading researchers from many countries. Five of the participants from the U.S. were women.       Last Modified: 06/03/2012       Submitted by: Shiferaw Berhanu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
