<AbstractNarration>IIP 1134684 &lt;br/&gt;University of Cincinnati; Lee &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1134676 &lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan; Ni &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1134721 &lt;br/&gt;Missouri University of Science and Technology; Sarangapani &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on Intelligent &lt;br/&gt;Maintenance Systems (IMS) was established in 2001. This proposal builds upon the accomplishments of the previous ten years and seeks funding to continue supporting a three campus operation among the University of Cincinnati (leading institution), the University of Michigan, and Missouri Univ. of S&amp;T. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center addresses the underlying issues in machine degradation modeling and prediction as well as develops the transformational technology in advanced prognostics. Over the past 10 years, the Center has developed systematic methodology and tools that made evident impacts to a number of member companies including Toyota, G.M., Boeing, P&amp;G, and National Instruments, amongst others. Over the next five years, the Center intends to advance the scientific base as well as to validate the developed tools to further accelerate the deployment and commercialization of the developed technologies. The center also plans to have international sites in Singapore, Brazil and Spain. In addition, the Center plans to develop spin-off companies with a compelling Marketing Plan in order to commercialize its tools through its member company, National Instruments, in 2011. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMS IUCRC fills an important niche to maintain industry global competiveness by continuous improvement of manufacturing effectiveness and efficiency. The center educates students and its membership through an extensive system of internship and scholar exchanges as well as international workshops and courses. IMS has developed and continues to execute an effective system for innovation and IP generation. The Center plans to develop spin-off companies with a compelling Marketing Plan in order to commercialize its tools through its member company, National Instruments, in 2011.</AbstractNarration>

The Center has leveraged these tools to deliver improved uptime, increased product quality, and enhanced  productivity. This impact has been across a number of industries, including discreet manufacturing, automotive manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing, and electronics manufacturing.  in 2012, the IMS Center was recognized as the most impactful I/UCRC by an independent audit of all I/UCRCs. The Center was shown to  have, as of 2012, generated over $855 billion in economic benefit with a $238:1 leveraging ratio.  Through over 100 engagements with industry, the IMS Center has honed its techniques and technologies for industrial applications, as well as investigating new platforms for expanding the adoption and utilization of these technologies through cloud-computing, mobile application development, embedded intelligence and licensing of the Center's tools for use in solution development environments.  Specific outcomes from the Center include:  Established leader and pioneer in prognostics and health management (PHM) field for industrial applications Trademark received for the Center's Watchdog Agent toolbox Coining of the concepts Near-Zero Breakdown performance and Industrial AI Grew to four university sites: The University of Cincinnati, The University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology and The University of Texas at Austin Recipient of five patents Graduated over 30 PhD students and over 20 MS students. Hosted over 30 engineers from industry as visiting scholars Over 75% of graduating students have joined IMS member companies Independently identified as the most economically impactful I/UCRC (2012) Commercialization of the Watchdog Agent by National Instruments Successful completion of an NSF I-Corps award for commercialization of the Watchdog Agent Creating of two spin-off companies: Predictronics and Cyberinsight Over 100 unique member companies and organizations since 2001, including Alstom, Boeing, Caterpillar, Denso, Eaton, Foxconn, Goodyear, Hitachi, Intel, Johnson Controls, Komatsu, LAM Research, Mazak, National Instruments, Omron, P&amp;G, Rockwell Automation, Samsung, Toyota, United Technologies, and Weichai, among many others. Conducted over 100 industry and government-funded projects Hosted over 100 Visiting Scholars from numerous countries including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, China, Taiwan, Japan, Brazil, Norway, Mexico, etc.   The IMS Center will continue to operate upon its graduation from the I/UCRC program and continue delivering impact to it's members and the broader scientificic community, industry, the economy and the world.
