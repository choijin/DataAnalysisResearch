<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1106165       PI:  Wagoner Johnson, Amy         ORG:  University of Illinois&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1105591       PI:  Murphy, William               ORG:  University of Wisconsin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Collaborative Research:  Regulators of cellular microenvironment and multiscale osteointegration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  Calcium Phosphates (CaP) are utilized in a wide range of applications including implant coatings and in bone regeneration/repair because of their many attributes that make them ideal to interface with bone.  However, the mechanisms regulating osteointegration of CaPs have yet to be understood.  Progress has stalled because of a lack of appropriate tools and methodologies that can isolate key regulators as well as combine them in a controlled and systematic way.  Three factors stand out as particularly important for the CaP system: microporosity, BMP-2, and biologic apatite.  The potential dominating mechanisms relating to osteointegration are hypothesized to be sequestration of BMP-2 and enhanced formation of biologic apatite in the presence of micropores.  The goal is to quantify the relative importance of and potential interactions between these factors at different stages of bone formation and to understand the mechanisms behind their influence, using CaPs as a biomaterial platform and a unique set of tools.  CaPs with macro (&gt;100um) and microporosity (&lt;50um) have greatly enhanced osteointegration as compared to those with only macroporosity.  While microporosity has been used primarily to enhance growth into macropores, there is now evidence that microporosity is also a space for bone and its inclusion in CaP scaffolds can result in multiscale ostointegration (MSO)- bone growth throughout both macro and micropores.  This has not been achieved with any other system.  The unique suite of tools will be used to examine the role of key regulators, microporosity, BMP-2, and bioapatite, and the mechanisms behind their influence on osteointegration.  The tools allow for (1) control of microporosity, which uniquely enables systematic exploration of microporosity and related characteristics, (2) attaching BMP-2 to CaPs with varying levels of affinity, which provides the unique opportunity to study the effects of both sequestered and releasing BMP-2, and (3) the capability to grow biological apatite on the surface of CaPs, which enables investigation of the influence of biological apatite on cell response.  Further, each of these parameters can be independently controlled.  The specific objectives are:  (1) Determine the minimum pore size through which cells will migrate given a potent chemotactic and osteoinductive stimulus, BMP-2.  This is critical for establishing bounds on pore characteristics for MSO.  (2) Determine the influence of the stimuli in attracting mesenchymal stem cells to the substrate.  (3) Determine the influence of the stimuli in matrix production and mineralization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  Taken together, the systematic approach used here to combine the factors described and the proposed analysis will provide new insight into the rational design of biomaterials that interface with bone.  The potential advances will lead to new understanding of bone/material interactions, could have huge benefit for those affected by bone loss or joint failure (e.g. coated implants), and could relieve some of the economic burden associated with these procedures.  The main educational activities are related to developing an instructional module that uses an inquiry-based approach and engages science teachers at the Campus Middle School for Girls (CMSG, Urbana, IL) in research activities.  The objective in working with CMSG is to positively influence girls' perceptions of STEM, which may lead to their persistence in the field.  The work with CMSG is in partnership with an existing NSF NSEC, and the learning module will become part of the existing educational programs in the NSF Center for use in programs that target underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ More than 1.5 million people undergo bone graft procedures annually in the US to repair bone defects that will not heal spontaneously. Such defects can be caused by cancer, traumatic injury, and non-unions. They are challenging to treat and can cause significant pain, disability, and disfigurement.

Hydroxyapatite is a calcium phosphate-based material with composition similar to the mineral phase in bone.  By tailoring the porosity on multiple length scales, we can enhance bone regeneration in vivo.  This work aimed to understand the role of microstructure, specifically microporosity less than 50 microns in diameter, in cell interactions with the material as an initial step in improving approaches to bone replacement and repair.  Intellectual Merit. This work had several important technical contributions, all of which contribute to improving repair of defects that do not spontaneously heal.  First, the work demonstrated the use of capillary forces in drawing in cells, in vitro and in vivo. Further, different types of cells are drawn into the material different distances, depending on cell size and stiffness, as well as pore size.  These capillary forces can also be used to localize cells to preferentially the surface of the material. The result is important because it has the potential to more efficiently and more precisely deliver cells into porous biomaterials for bone repair.   Second, we demonstrated that microporosity can be tailored to influence capillary forces by changing the size and fraction of the porogen used to generate the microporosity.  The microstructure, and therefore capillary forces, can also be changed by chemical modification that opens up spaces between pores.  The result is important because it demonstrates additional mechanisms by which capillary forces can be tuned to draw in cells and fluid to different depths, or to preferentially locate cells and fluid in the structure to enhance bone regeneration in vivo.   Third, we demonstrated that microstructure can also be used to incorporate and deliver molecules, such as proteins that stimulate bone regeneration in vivo.

For example, in addition to pore size and fraction, the size of the pores compared to opening between pores is important to delivery of the molecules.  This result is important because it offers an additional mechanism by which release of molecules from materials can be tailored.    Broader Impact. The research conducted in this study contributes to the broader goal of inventing, improving, and characterizing approaches that can be used to address the long standing challenge of bone replacement and repair.  The challenge is not going away &ndash; in fact it is increasing with the ageing population.  The research has been disseminated to a broad community through a number of mechanisms.  It has been used in education and outreach activities including teacher workshops, presentations and hands-on activities in an all-girls middle school as well as for a high school summer camp for girls, and in a display in Engineering Open House, an annual engineering showcase at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign that typically draws 20,000 visitors.  It has also been presented to a broad scientific audience approaching 250 attendees in Grenoble, France.  The research has been disseminated through presentations at national and international conferences on biomaterials and tissue engineering, as well as in invited research seminars in the US, France, and Switzerland. Finally, project has provided rich research and training opportunities for at least four female graduate students and one female undergraduate student, who have all been involved in the project at different stages.
