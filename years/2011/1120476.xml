<AbstractNarration>Tropical forests are known for their high biological diversity, and this is partly due to the large numbers of rare species they contain. One reason for rarity in tropical trees seems to be high rates of death from diseases that spread between individuals of the same species.  When a seedling of a rare species is surrounded by neighbors of the same species, its risk of dying from pathogens is much higher than that of a seedling of a common species surrounded by neighbors of that species.  This project will test the new hypothesis that rarity goes along with low resistance to disease because having just a small number of individuals of a species leads to also having a low diversity of the genes that are responsible for disease resistance.  The hypothesis will be tested through collaboration between scientists at the Smithsonian Institution and Pennsylvania State University.  Plant tissue will be collected from related pairs of rare and common species of tropical trees at the Smithsonian's Tropical Research Institute in Panama.  The tissue will be shipped to Pennsylvania, where a new technique in molecular genetics known as next generation transcriptome sequencing will be used to quantify the overall and resistance gene diversity of each species.  Back in Panama, experiments in the forest will test whether enhancing cross-pollination between trees can increase the genetic diversity of their offspring and give them greater resistance to disease and chances of survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide useful insights into how the abundance of a species can shape its ability to resist disease.  Knowing this will help us understand why some species are rare while others are common, and help forest managers make more informed decisions.  This project will be the first to obtain a large collection of resistance gene sequences from trees, information that can used in future studies of genetic diversity in agricultural and horticultural plants.  The project will also provide training for students and early career biologists in both the United States and Panama.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A number of endangered species such as cheetah, tasmanian devil, and black-footed ferret are well known for having low genetic diversity and vulnerability to disease transmission.  Genetic bottlenecks, caused by severe reductions in population size (over time), have caused a loss of critical immune gene diversity in these species.   In this project, we sought to determine if reductions in genetic diversity in small local populations also affect immune gene diversity and ecological outcomes.  We sampled local populations of 6 species of tropical trees that vary in local population size in an intensively studied forest community on Barro Colorado Island, Panama (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute).  For each species, we collected 15 seeds from beneath each of 5 parent trees. We evenly divided those familial sets of seeds into three soil treatments (sterile soil [control], salicylic acid treated soil, and soil inoculated with a standard mixture of live soil from the forest).  After one month, seedlings were harvested and we isolated RNA from their roots.  By sequencing the RNA (all expressed genes), we were able to observe gene expression (a trait, or phenotype) and polymorphism (genotype) over nearly all protein coding regions of the genome.  Our samples also contained genes from root-associated microbes (primarily fungi), which we identified bioinformatically and analyzed separately.  From those data we found that 1) small local tree populations have reduced functional (amino acid changing) polymorphism in immunity genes; 2) reduced immune gene polymorphism correlates with more negative effects of growing near oneÆs own kind (conspecific seedlings); 3) families of less abundant tree species are more co-susceptible to infection by pathogenic fungi; 4) tree species with less resistance gene polymorphism show reduced ability to turn on expression of defense genes when challenged with live soil; and 5) tree species with greater ability to activate defense gene expression provoke more self-defense gene expression (anti-oxidant genes) in their root-associated pathogenic fungi.  The latter result verifies that gene expression and polymorphism data that we obtained from the plants has a real effect on plant-microbe interactions.  These results, comprising a mixture of correlation and controlled experimentation, consistently support the conclusion that smaller local populations, just like bottlenecked populations of well-known endangered mammals, have reduced diversity in immunity genes and reduced ability to fend off pathogenic microbes.  Our results indicate that genetic bottlenecks happen over spatial as well as temporal scales, and have potentially large ecological effects (e.g. density dependent mortality).  Broader impacts of this work include the following:  A. Student and post-doctoral training: Four graduate students obtained signficant work experience (one Ph.D. research rotation; one Ph.D. bioinformatic programmer; two M.S. Biotechnology interns). Two post-doctoral researchers helped design and conduct the bioinformatics and data analyses.  Both of those post-docs obtained tenure-track faculty positions.  B. Technology transfer:  Penn State has submitted a patent application for our new bioinformatic process that identifies genes containing potentially important immunity function in any plant species, including long-lived species such as trees for which resistance locus identification via conventional breeding experiments is not feasible.  With collaborators, we incorporated our new methods into a proposal to identify and breed for better pathogen resistance in Theobroma cacao, the tropical tree from which chocolate is made, which suffers ~30% yield loss to fungi and oomycete pathogens, and which provides substantial income for millions of the world's poorest farmers.  We also identified a novel protein in root-associated fungi that is similar to known antibiotic peptides that are effective against bacteria and viruses ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
