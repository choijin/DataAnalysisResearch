<AbstractNarration>This award will fund a combined observational and theoretical study of luminous blue variables, which are massive stars experiencing strong mass loss and evolving to be red supergiants.  They are widely believed to the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae, but many of these may not explode if the mass lost during their lifetimes is high enough.  This team will conduct long-term observations of these variables in several nearby galaxies, in order to get an improved census of these objects, elucidate the mechanisms that may be responsible for giant eruptions, and to better understand the mechanism of mass loss and how stars evolve as they experience episodic (rather than steady) mass loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern supernova surveys are finding a number objects in nearby galaxies which are not true supernovae, the "supernova impostors," which may be objects like eta Carinae that shed 10-20 times the mass of our Sun in a few years.  The final stages of these most massive stars are important for a valid picture of stellar astrophysics and they are increasingly significant in cosmology. They are the likely progenitors of Gamma Ray Bursters used as cosmological probes, and many of the first stars in the universe are thought to have been very massive.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It has long been considered well-established that the most massive stars, more than 10 times the mass of the Sun, will end their brief lives as supernovae.  But, there is  growing evidence that this may not be the case for all of them.  Some may collapse directly to the back hole, but after they have already shed a lot of mass.  Many highly evolved massive stars that are approaching their final stages  have dramatic eruptions before their end state whether as a true supernova or as a black hole.  These objects are sometimes called supernova (SN) impostors. It is increasingly important to understand the role of  these eruptive and episodic mass loss events on how massive stars end their lives and how they enrich the interstellar medium by returning processed material for new star formation.  The primary goal of our observational program on the luminous and massive star populations (called supergiants)  in nearby galaxies was to obtain a more complete census of the rare objects, the Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), the Hypergiants and the SN impostors,  that experience ehanced mass loss episodes and even more violent eruptions.  Our resutls included observations of four SN impostors in different galaxies. We found that the progenitors had a wide range of initial masses and were proabably in different evolutionary states. In other words, they were not all the very most massive or most luminous stars.  One thing they all had in common though was evidence for previous high mass loss events revealed in their spectra and light curves,  and in the presence of circumstellar dust.  The most interesting example was the historic SN1954J in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2403. It has been more than 60 years since it had its giant eruption.  SN1954J has a very peculiar pre-eruption light curve with numerous erratic short outbursts before  its maximum light or explosion.  After the eruption it declined to more than 10 times fainter than the progenitor, the stat that originally erupted. So today it more than 10 times fainter.  What happended?  Some astronomers have argued that it was a true supernova. The star is gone. But an HST image showed a possible survivor.  Our spectra of this now very faint object, observed with the Large Binocular Telescope, showed that the survivor was actually two stars.  Combining information from  the spectrum, and the optical and infrared imaging, we showed that the survivor is now a hot  supergiant  with a dense wind, substantial circumstellar extinction from dust, and a  G-type supergiant companion.  SN1954J survived its giant eruption and is now surrounded by a thick cloud of circumstellar dust formed from the material it ejected 60 years ago. We estimate that the star expelled about half the mass of the Sun in this one eruption.       Last Modified: 08/11/2017       Submitted by: Roberta M Humphreys]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
