<AbstractNarration>New road infrastructure leads to numerous changes in affected regions, including economic integration, environmental degradation, and conflicts over natural resources.  This project will apply a systems approach that features resilience as an integrative concept to bring together economic, ecological and social science perspectives to better understand infrastructure impacts.  To evaluate system resilience to infrastructure, this project will use global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to quantify the probability that a key indicator of system state will go past a critical threshold, i.e., a tipping point, indicating loss of resilience via a change in system state.  The study system for this work is the frontier of the southwestern Amazon, a highly biodiverse region in which highway paving is underway.  The project will focus on two key issues that have been debated by scholars who study infrastructure impacts: changes in land tenure and livelihoods. The research will draw from different theoretical perspectives on these issues to model specific changes in land ownership, use, and livelihoods, which in turn affect two key indicators of system state: forest cover and forest value.  Dynamic simulation models will be developed to compare model output for forest cover and forest value as they depend on different assumptions about how highway paving affects tenure and livelihoods.  Simulation models will be integrated with sensitivity analysis to assess model uncertainty in predicting changes in forest cover and forest value, and to assess system resilience to highway paving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will strengthen collaborative ties between University of Florida and partner institutions in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru, and build tri-national capacity for social-ecological research in the Amazon.  Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained and gain experience in collaborative, interdisciplinary and international team research.  The study region has local governments and other stakeholders with needs for greater access to scientific findings regarding infrastructure.  This project will disseminate research results using an innovative knowledge exchange model designed to reach hundreds of stakeholders.  Such outreach and dialogue will support broader public participation in environmental planning by regional governments.  The modeling approach developed in this project will also contribute to understanding for other problems such as climate change and global market shifts.</AbstractNarration>

Findings from our initial simulations show that rural households have experienced large changes, such that their ability to earn incomes and accumulate wealth, as well as their activities to deforest their properties, vary substantially over time. There are moments of wealth accumulation as well as losses, and rapid deforestation as well as stability. The arrival of highway paving does yield improved incomes and increased deforestation, but the timing and extent of these effects varies across the study area. We also observe large differences in the incomes and forest clearing among different households. The model thus captures the complexity (non-linearity) of change processes over time, as well as social differences in the fortunes of different households.</p> <p>&nbsp;Because any model is highly dependent on the input data and model assumptions, we submitted the model to global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (GSA/UA). GSA/UA permits an evaluation of all sources of uncertainty in a model, and identifies the input factors to which model output is most sensitive. Our initial findings from GSA/UA have confirmed the importance of model sensitivity to some factors we anticipated would be important, such as high-value crops like bananas and important forest products like castanha nuts. But GSA/UA also identified other factors to which the model is sensitive, and we are pursuing additional inquiry into those factors.</p> <p>&nbsp;We focus on the case of the Inter-Oceanic Highway, a high-profile project under the auspices of IIRSA, the Initiative for Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America. Because the Inter-Oceanic Highway was paved in the southwestern Amazon, an area of exceptional biodiversity, there has been considerable debate about the prospective impacts. In particular, there has been discussion of how highway paving would affect connections between rural agricultural producers and urban markets. There is also debate over whether paving will lead to shifts in land tenure rules that govern resource use. We therefore developed several versions of the dynamic simulation model, built upon differing assumptions about connectivity and land tenure change. The variants of the base model do yield large differences in model outcomes. If we ignore local markets, households have fewer places to sell their products, resulting in lower incomes and deforestation. If we remove rules imposing limitations on resource management, households clear more and gain larger incomes, though later on in the simulations they experience income declines for various reasons. These findings confirm the importance of market access as facilitated by paving, but also show that public policies limiting deforestation can in turn lead to more sustainable resource use.</p> <p>&nbsp;In the process of model construction, we realized we had insufficient botanical data on the characteristics of rain forest vegetation in the study region. This led to negotiations with various groups of scientists at different institutions to exchange botanical data and thereby expand our data bases.

We have produced new maps of forest types in the study region with quantitative measures of plant diversity and forest carbon. These data permit more detailed analysis of the relationship of biodiversity to ecosystem services. That relationship was presumed to be straightforward, but recent work has shown otherwise. One analysis from our work shows that even in highly diverse Amazon rain forests, a few species are very common and represent a large proportion of forest carbon stocks. Hence forest carbon, which is important for regulating the global carbon budget that is related to climate, need not require high biodiversity.

At each stop, the team presents findings from research relevant to local peoples. Participants can ask questions and share their experiences and thereby exchange knowledge with researchers. In June 2016, we made several stops in the southwestern Amazon along the Inter-Oceanic Highway and met with hundreds of local peoples, ranging from school children to local agricultural producers to government personnel.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/20/2016<br>      Modified by: Stephen&nbsp;G&nbsp;Perz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div
