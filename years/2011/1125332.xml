<AbstractNarration>Large scale, realistic simulations of complex biological and chemical phenomena at the atomic level of resolution level present a grand challenge for molecular simulation.  Effective sampling of conformational space may require large numbers of computationally intensive simulations which are coupled to one another.  Enhanced conformational sampling algorithms based on the application of biasing forces and replica exchange generalized ensembles, whereby a large number of replicas of the system are simulated in parallel, among the most powerful methods to study a wide variety of physicochemical processes.  Uncoupled methods currently in use are very slowly convergent and often of dubious reliability as the independent simulations are not in equilibrium with one another.  The key aspect of replica exchange (RE) algorithms is that replicas of the system periodically exchange their state parameters allowing them to rapidly traverse conformational space and to enhance equilibration. Current synchronous formulations of the RE method in wide use, however, are highly limited in terms of scalability and control when many exchanging replicas are involved. This limitation precludes the use of RE simulations to new application areas that require the calculation of high-dimensional free energy surfaces, and necessitate the dynamic control of 103-104 replicas as the landscape evolves.  This project involves the development of a robust adaptive force biasing procedure coupled with an asynchronous replica exchange method.  The research team  is developing  a novel infrastructure, the Replica Exchange Frame work (REFW)  to enable the execution of very large scale RE simulations on a broad range of production computational resources, including but not limited to NSF TeraGrid (and its successor XD), cloud and campus-level cluster environments, as well as the forthcoming Blue Waters supercomputer.  The REFW  is being applied to  applications that present multiple levels of complexity, such as coupled ligand binding, conformational change and catalysis in the glmS ribozyme/riboswitch that were hitherto not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cyberinfrastructure created by this research team enables realistic simulations of important biological processes that have relevance in many areas of biology, biophysics, medicinal chemistry, and biophysics with the potential to impact human health. Additionally, the REWF may be applied in many other scientific areas that increasingly rely on realistic simulation including catalysis, earthquake prediction and petroleum engineering. The project is also training the next generation of computational scientists to apply these methods to solve high-impact interdisciplinary research problems. The resulting technology and training enables the study of a host of new reactive chemical problems of unprecedented complexity, and greatly facilitates innovation and discovery through advanced computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation Program award and is co-funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Award Title: CDI-Type II: Mapping Complex Biomolecular Reactions with Large Scale Replica Exchange Simulations on National Production Cyberinfrastructure  Federal Award ID: 1125332  Report Submission Period: 10/01/2015 to 09/30/2016     The primary goal of this project is to develop new enabling technology to solve driving biological problems that demand large sets of molecular simulations.  To achieve this, this project is focused on the development of advanced scientific algorithm called replica exchange (RE) and the implementation of a software framework to support the large-scale execution to run robustly on a series of computational clusters of varying architecture and performance.  This is a major advance to utilize supercomputer resources effectively, which is critically important when the biological system being simulated is large and requires potentially hundreds to thousands of replicas in order to gain insight into fundamental biochemical problems at the atomic level.  Consequently, effort is being made to engineer a flexible software framework that can integrate many kinds of RE simulations, including Hamiltonian, temperature, pH and ionic concentration, in order to enable access into completely new science questions.  The development of such a framework enhanced our knowledge of how the generalized ensemble diffuses through state space and converges to a final thermodynamic state. Understanding how different dimensions affect this diffusion will allow us to implement a high dimensional version of replica exchange.   Another achievement is the development of advanced scientific methods to analyze the large amounts of data generated from RE simulations, including the variational free energy profile method (vFEP), demonstrated building multidimensional free energy surfaces with much less data points, as well as constructing the possible minimal free energy paths quickly, and the stochastic weighted histogram method (RE-SWHAM), which has been shown able to handle significant amount data and a nearly 80-fold improvement in computational time compared to conventional methods.   On the applications to complicate biochemical problems, we successfully performed several multidimensional RE simulations, including studies of the free energy surfaces of three torsion angles of a model system with utilizing thousands of computational cores at the same time.  We demonstrated 2-D QM/MM simulations with an additional temperature dimension of replica exchange, from which detailed entropic and enthalpic contribution of chemical reactions can be extracted, and salt-concentration dependent conformational changes of nucleic acids through 3D replica exchanges (salt concentration and two geometric variables).  The opportunity for biological scientists and computer scientists to work together, learn from each other, and share resources made the development of asynchronous replica exchange with the resulting software frameworks, scientific methodology advances, and biological applications possible. This work has attracted Rutger's interest in building some high-performance computing infrastructure , and there is movement in that direction that has been directly influenced by this work, and we may contribute to the development of classes the train students to use computational chemistry tools in a HPC environment for research.
