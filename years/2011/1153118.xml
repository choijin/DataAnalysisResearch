<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Kenneth J. Shea of the University of California, Irvine will develop new green chemistries for the production of hydrocarbon macromolecules from single carbon atom, renewable feedstocks (C1).  The approach is to separate and study the mechanisms of the individual steps in the polymerization (initiation, propagation (early, middle and late stage), termination); to prepare reaction intermediates and measure their stabilities; and to prepare compounds necessary to enable and study the formation of stable polyethylene latexes.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students in fundamental polymer chemistry, broadly disseminating research results via publications and presentations at conferences, participating in outreach activities through the UC Irvine Environment Institute, and the potential societal impacts of manufacturing hydrocarbon compounds and materials from renewable resources.  Students will also work with industrial partners to explore large-scale applications of this chemistry for producing useful materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.  At present, plastics are derived predominantly from petroleum based resources.  This research will provide fundamental chemical knowledge that could be used to develop efficient, economical and practical methods for the production of plastics and waxes from abundant and sustainable carbon sources.</AbstractNarration>

The reaction utilizes C1 carbon sources, does not require expensive transition metal catalysts, and takes place in aqueous base at or near r.t. and atmospheric pressure. This new chemistry provides a convenient and "green" route to this important and useful class of materials, which can be derived from nonpetroleum sources. (Graphic 1).  The C1 polymerization (polyhomologation) is a living polymerization that affords precise control over molecular weight and provides an extremely narrow distribution of molecular weights (PDI). Although the reaction is catalyzed by simple, inexpensive organoboranes, their oxygen sensitivity can sometimes result in some loss of PDI.  We have developed new air stable organoborane initiators that simplify the polymerization reaction and provide a safe, low-tech method for the controlled synthesis of linear hydrocarbon polymers in molecular weights that range from oligomers to &gt; 106.  Copolymerization of two monomers can provide materials with an almost unlimited range of physical properties compared to the corresponding homopolymers.  There are a number of important types of copolymerizations including random, block, graft and gradient.
