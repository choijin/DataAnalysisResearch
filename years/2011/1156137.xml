<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This three year REU Site program will provide research experiences for undergraduates at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU), a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The goal of this REU project is to engage the students in research activities in the area of nanoscale device fabrication and characterization. It allows state-of-the-art research opportunities in the clean room environment associating fabrication, evaluation, and degradation of the semiconductor-based structural and conduction issues for the nanodevices and nanocomposites. The faculty members involved in nanoscale device research and graduate students will provide hands-on activities in the engineering research laboratories involving experimental and computational areas.  The primary objective of the program is to enhance research abilities of students and creative factors.  The participants will: (1) identify research problems and conduct related literature reviews; (2) conduct research, design, and implement plans via timeline and deadline; (3) develop and learn new methods, analyze and evaluate procedures; and (4) disseminate research findings through written and verbal presentations.  In addition to the research students will participate in a seminar series.  Topics of the seminar series include communication and presentation skills, the latest developments in nanoscale devices and engineering ethics issues.  During the final week of the program, students will participate in a half-day symposium.  Each participant will provide a twenty five minute oral presentation to the engineering and other STEM faculty members and students.  The best research work for a single participant will be acknowledged with a prize.  Also three best presenters and three best report writers will be judged for a prize.  A certificate will be presented to each participant in this REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will be directed toward students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority serving institutions.  A special emphasis will be placed on including minorities, women, and students with disabilities in the program.  Students will gain technical abilities necessary to conduct research in nanodevices and nanocomposites in conjunction with ethical conduct and practices in the work place.  The participants in this REU program will be encouraged to pursue higher academic degrees and eventual careers in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."</AbstractNarration>
