<AbstractNarration>This award is devoted to the studies on the interface of computational and combinatorial geometry.  Specifically, the relevant problems involve geometric arrangements, which are patterns formed, say, in the plane, when a number of geometric shapes are overlaid on top of each other.  A surprising number of computational problems can be cast in terms of arrangements.  Conversely, a significant number of combinatorial problems are equivalent to statements about arrangements.  The PI will focus on the interplay of these two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In slightly more technical detail, the PI will:&lt;br/&gt;-- push the state of the art in the area of arrangements, solving some of the challenging open problems in the subject;&lt;br/&gt;-- develop general techniques which will be of independent interest and which will find applications well beyond the set of problems listed in the proposal;&lt;br/&gt;-- by looking at classical problems in a radically different way, find simple solutions and reveal connections between seemingly unrelated questions;&lt;br/&gt;-- apply the machinery developed for dealing with arrangements of geometric objects to an entirely new set of problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will supervise a PhD student and a postdoctoral fellow, guiding them in their research activities and acquainting them with the latest tools of combinatorial and computational geometry.  The results obtained will be disseminated by participation in workshops and scientific conferences.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be introduced to a number of current research problems in the subject.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most of the work on this project focused on both algorithmic and combinatorial problems that arise in optimization questions of geometric flavor.  For algorithmic problems, exact and approximation algorithms were developed with good trade-off between the running time and the quality of the solution.  The combinatorial problems studied in this project were closely related to the efficiency of these optimization algorithms.  The main results obtained in this project include:  Construction of the first near-optimal constrained-memory algorithm for computing a triangulation of a simple polygon. Refutation of a decades-old conjecture about the maximum number of "holes" that can be formed by combining many translated and possibly overlapping copies of the same convex shape in three dimensions; this fact has implications for the understanding of the structure of three-dimensional Voronoi diagrams for polyhedral metrics. Exploration of how much information can be revealed by recording who talks to whom in a network of people, while, say, walking in a park, even in presence of people whose location services have been intentionally turned off, for reasons of privacy. Development of a way to answer point-location queries in the plane, where the response time depends on how close the query is to the boundary of a region, which confirms the intuition that points lying in the middle of large roundish regions should be easy to locate. A significant improvement of the best previously known bounds on the complexity of the union of triangles with large angles in the plane, later extended to more general "locally fat" shapes. Design of a fast algorithm for computing and/or approximating the best alignment between two piecewise-linear functions defined over different triangulations of the same domain. Proof of the fact that the segmentation problem for trajectories is in general intractable for non-monotone segmentation criteria, and identification of some classes of such criteria for which the segmentation question becomes tractable.   One MS and three PhD students worked on this project and were partially supported by the grant.  In addition, two woman postdoctoral fellows were partially supported, one of whom has since obtained a tenure-track position at a prestigious university.
