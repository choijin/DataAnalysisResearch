<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for student attendance at a cutting edge Symposium on Mechanobiology and Mechanotransduction during the Biomedical Engineering Society Fall Meeting 2011. The objectives of this symposium are three-fold:&lt;br/&gt;(1) To highlight the most recent advances on molecular and mechanisms and the genetic basis for mechanobiology and mechanotransduction;&lt;br/&gt;(2) To provide a platform for researchers to establish new connections and exchange ideas;&lt;br/&gt;(3) To honor Dr. Shu Chien's contribution to the field and inspire and facilitate students, especially women and minority students, to perform research in this area.&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide six travel awards of $500 to graduate and undergraduate students, based on the submitted abstracts and financial needs, with at least three of the awards to women and minority students and two awards to undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

The objectives of this symposium are three-fold:  (1) To highlight the most recent advances on molecular and mechanisms and the genetic basis for mechanobiology and mechanotransduction;  (2) To provide a platform for researchers to establish new connections and exchange ideas;  (3) To honor Dr. Shu Chien's contribution to the field and inspire and facilitate students, especially women and minority students, to perform research in this area.  We reviewed the abstracts submitted by students, and selected 5 abstracts for travel awards.  The symposium is one of the most attended symposium at BMES conference, with more than 200 participants, including faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students. The symposium stimulated extensive discussion on the presented topics, and received positive feedbacks from the faculty and students. Training and Development: The symposium include several outstanding speakers in the area of mechanobiology and mechanotransduction, and provide a platform for the communication and interactions betwwen faculty and students from many universities across the country. Outreach Activities: The information on the symposium was published on the BMES website and the brochure.  The presentations at the symposium caught a lot of attention of the researchers in the field of mechanobiology and mechanotransduction.The symposium provided an opportunity to bring together the thought leaders and researchers in the field and communicate with the state of art knowledge. In addition, this symposium inspired women and minority students to pursue research in this field. Several awardees are female or minority students.
