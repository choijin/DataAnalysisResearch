<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research study is to establish new constitutive laws for Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP)-strengthened reinforced concrete elements subjected to pure shear.  The use of FRP materials in civil engineering as an economical method for strengthening of deficient concrete structures dates back to the 1970s.  Development of material constitutive models for FRP shear-strengthened concrete elements has not been previously conducted due to lack of experimental data.  An element-based approach will be adopted in which constitutive relations of panel elements making up the composite structure are developed then integrated using the finite element method to predict the overall behavior.  In order to generate these relations, large-scale tests of a series of FRP-strengthened reinforced concrete panels subjected to pure shear will be conducted using the University of Houston unique Universal Panel Tester machine.  The NSF-supported program OpenSees will be used to develop the new finite element models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research study is expected to improve the accuracy of available design guidelines.  This research study will have broader impact through the development of new educational modules that aim at expanding the knowledge of FRP composite materials to K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as practicing engineers.  Recruiting of under-represented students will be conducted through coordination with existing outreach programs at the University of Houston.  A technology transfer plan will be implemented, in which the research results are disseminated to the practicing engineering community through a series of seminars and presentations at national and international conferences, and publications in refereed technical journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Several Investigations  have revealed that many aging civil engineering structures such as highway bridges are structurally deficient and need repairs and/or retrofitting.  Among various solutions, fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites serves as a promising solution and has been widely used in rehabilitation and strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Well established analytical models and design guidelines are already available for analyzing and designing FRP strengthened structures under flexure and axial-confinement actions. However, the understanding of the behavior of such members under in-plane stress field remains a subject of on-going discussion among several researchers and practitioners. Although researchers have devoted a tremendous effort on various experimental and analytical investigations, the predictions of shear behavior of RC structures strengthened by FRP (FRP RC) by different models show greater scatter and occasionally contradictory when compared with test results. This is due partly to the high level of complexity associated with the shear behavior, but more importantly due to the lack of rational constitutive models for FRP shear strengthened RC elements. An efficient method to study the overall response of an RC member is to identify the characteristic behavior and the contribution of each material constituting the structure; the behavior of that specific element can be predicted by taking into account the inherent characteristics and material laws of the constituents that lead to understanding the global shear response of the structure. The objective of this research project was to establish the shear constitutive behavior of externally bonded FRP strengthened RC elements subjected to pure shear through experimental investigations and development of associated analytical and finite element models. As a  first step of developing a shear model for FRP RC elements, constitutive laws of each material component, namely concrete, steel and FRP were studied through experimental and analytical investigations. Thirteen full-scale prismatic specimens and sixteen full-scale panels were tested using the Universal Panel Tester to study the stress-strain relationships of concrete, steel and FRP in tension, concrete in compression and the Poisson effect in biaxial loading.

The analytical model was tested and validated using existing experimental data. Furthermore, to investigate the serviceability conditions in FRP strengthened RC structures, the crack characteristics of a series of full-scale tensile tests of FRP strengthened RC prisms and test panels have been monitored by using a digital image correlation system. The experimental results were used to calibrate a newly developed equation to calculate crack spacing and crack width in RC elements externally strengthened with FRP. The results from both experimental and analytical study in this research project will provide a promising contribution to the prediction of the behavio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
