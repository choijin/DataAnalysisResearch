<AbstractNarration>1140000 (Huang).  This award is funded under NSF's Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES) activities, which aim to address challenges of creating a sustainable world.  U.S. manufacturing, a key component of national economic development and prosperity, has been greatly challenged by competitive trends over the past decade, as global manufacturing competition has begun to shift towards fast implementation, just-in-time model-based manufacturing, frequent product transitions, and shifting of technical personnel to meet those changing needs. Further burdens are being placed on all industries owing to uncertain energy prices and possible greenhouse gas constraints.  Revitalization of U.S. manufacturing is of utmost importance in the national economy. In academia, engineering sustainability, advanced manufacturing theory, alternative energy and biofuels have become very active but relatively disconnected research areas. Research coordination in the academic community and its networking with industries are insufficient and lack depth.  To bridge the gap between the academic knowledge discovery and industrial technology innovation for sustainable manufacturing, our multidisciplinary team proposes to create an interdisciplinary, international research coordination network to promote Sustainable Manufacturing Advances in Research and Technology (SMART). SMART reflects the theme of the joint effort among a number of leading academic laboratories, centers, non-government organizations, and major manufacturing industries.  During this project, the team will (1) conduct comprehensive and in-depth review of frontier research and technological development for sustainable manufacturing, (2) define the roadmap towards manufacturing sustainability and identify the bottlenecks in a number of focused research areas via several workshops, (3) coordinate research through sharing knowledge, resources, software, and results, (4) establish partnerships with industrial groups to expedite technology introduction, and (5) conduct education and outreach to a wide range of stakeholders. The SMART coordination network (CN) will be further strengthened through collaborating with eight leading research laboratories in seven other countries. Sustainable manufacturing research involves a wide spectrum of areas and disciplines, such as advanced manufacturing, sustainability assessment and decision making, product and process systems engineering, energy and environmental engineering, multiscale complex systems science and engineering, information technology, economics and sociology. The SMART CN will support a new paradigm for manufacturing sustainability and aggregate concerted efforts from multiple research groups with complementary expertise to transform the knowledge base of manufacturing sustainability, and develop a consensus roadmap for future efforts. It is anticipated that success in this endeavor will have a significant impact on industrial efforts in developing sustainable manufacturing technologies.  The SMART CN will serve as a starting point for further increasing the diversity of the next generation of researchers, especially under-represented groups, and will have a hub-type website to serve the different communities. The project will also generate a number of case study educational modules for sustainable engineering education that should be widely adoptable for undergraduate/graduate education and professional training in industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Global competition has greatly challenged America?s economic leadership, especially in industrial innovation. The challenges to the U.S. manufacturing, which is the heart of our economy, are on multiple fronts, as global manufacturing competition has begun to shift towards frequent product transitions, fast implementation, intelligent manufacturing, and shifting of technical personnel to meet these changing needs. Further burdens to the U.S. manufacturing are being placed due to the pressure of natural resource depletion, uncertain energy security, and environmental regulations. Revitalization of U.S. manufacturing is of utmost importance to the national economy. Funded by the NSF RCN SEES program over the past six years, the project team has established a strong research coordination network, which is called SMART (Sustainable Manufacturing Advances in Research and Technology) Coordination Network.  This network has a very active participation of leading researchers, educators, and practitioners in different disciplines from 14 domestic universities and seven foreign universities, as well as non-government organizations, and major manufacturing industries.  The multidisciplinary joint effort has contributed significantly to the advanced manufacturing communities that is featured by bridging the gap between the academic knowledge discovery and industrial technology innovation for sustainable manufacturing.  The project team has maintained the investigation on the frontier research and technological development in the challenging field of sustainable manufacturing.  It has organized successfully two NSF workshops, one for the development of a national sustainable manufacturing roadmap in 2013, and the other for identifying urgent research needs and multidisciplinary collaboration opportunities in 2015.  The findings from these two workshops that were summarized in workshop reports are highly valuable, as they were discovered and summarized by leading academic scholars and industrial leaders in the U.S.  The findings have been used by researchers to develop various research proposals as well as for establishing industrial collaboration on specific projects.  The project team have also played various leadership roles in developing and organizing a number of sustainability focused international conferences, including two conferences series: the International Congress of Sustainability Science and Engineering (the 3rd to 6th conferences) and the International Conference of Sustainable Chemical Product and Process Engineering (the 3rd and 4th conferences), and the 2014 U.S. NSF - China NSF Workshop on Sustainable Manufacturing.  In addition, the project team has very successfully organized a large number of sustainable engineering focused technical sessions of the conferences for AIChE, ACE and other professional societies.  Furthermore, the project team also led team efforts to develop and publish sustainable manufacturing focused special issues for the following four journals: ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering, Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, and Smart and Sustainable Manufacturing Systems, as well as an edited book, Treatise on Sustainability Science and Engineering published by Springer. The published papers were contributed by the researchers around the world.  All these events help researchers to share their views, knowledge, and experience with colleagues in the sustainable manufacturing community.  In addition to the research coordination, the project has also led to the development of educational modules on sustainable manufacturing.  The modules were developed by educators in multiple engineering disciplines from different academic institutions.  After being tested in classroom in different institutions, the modules have been standardized by the project team and disseminated to the engineering communities through the project website, ASEE summer school, CACHE Corporation, journal publication, and many international and national conferences.  This team effort has contributed to the sustainable engineering education both at the undergraduate and graduate levels nation-wide.  As advanced and sustainable manufacturing becomes increasingly important to the U.S. economy, the SMART Coordination Network team has been seeking opportunities to further enhance its research and educational coordination network with a number of federally funded advanced manufacturing institutes in the U.S., and to expand its network to major manufacturing research networks in Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America in the following years.
