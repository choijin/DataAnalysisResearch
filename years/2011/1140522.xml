<AbstractNarration>The Chemistry Department is encouraging more engagement of students with course content by incorporating, in a systematic and multi-course fashion, the use of novel case studies in General Chemistry discussion sections and in Organic Chemistry Laboratory sections.  The project is implementing problem-based case studies that focus on the interdisciplinary aspect of chemistry in these foundational courses taken by large numbers of first- and second-year students.  This allows the students to make connections between traditional content and topics of civic relevance that are well-matched to current students interests.  The project is focusing on connections to environmental science, biomedical science, and engineering and is establishing how this approach leads to increased retention of students in their pursuit of STEM degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introduction of case study discussions is changing the learning environment for the targeted chemistry courses; students are engaged in a more active and collaborative learning experience from that which existed prior to the start of this project.  In addition, the inclusion of case studies is furthering students' development of higher order critical thinking skills.  The project is developing Teaching Assistant expertise to lead open-ended case study discussions and is assessing the impact of this educational experience on TA performance and expected future use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is demonstrating how existing courses can be tweaked such that even large enrollment foundational chemistry courses can engage all students in an active and collaborative environment known to develop desired student skills.  Simultaneously, the project, by connecting students to real world issues of current civic relevance, is increasing the success rate of students by directly confronting a commonly perceived deficiency in current course offerings.</AbstractNarration>
