<AbstractNarration>The lowest layers of the atmosphere and their interactions with underlying complex terrain significantly influence forecasts of weather, distributions of aerosols and associated restrictions to visibility, and behavior of the earth's climate system.  In recent years field studies have produced a wealth of data on the lower atmosphere over mountainous terrain.  The goals of this project are to exploit these untapped data to 1) determine and quantify the spatial and temporal variability of aerosol and convective boundary layer structure in mountainous terrain and to identify the multi-scale processes responsible for this variability, 2) evaluate and improve numerical model representations of transport and mixing processes and associated orographic controls on aerosol distributions and convective boundary layer structure, and 3) create engaging experiences for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students that will allow them acquire and apply scientific inquiry skills.  This effort will utilize existing surface and airborne data sets including those from the T-REX (Terrain-induced Rotors Experiment) in which Doppler lidars play a critical role, as well as more comprehensive measurements from orbital platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this effort centers on development of more comprehensive data-driven descriptions of convectively-modified atmospheric behavior over complex terrain as well as new approaches for improved numerical representation of the effects of mountains on the lower atmosphere in regional and global models.  Broader impacts of this effort will include significant learning experiences created through 1) the development of online modules enabling and encouraging scientific inquiry, 2) partnerships fostering national and international collaboration, and 3) hands-on activities involving field work and atmospheric modeling.  A new meteorological facility in the Shenandoah National Park of Virginia is at the core of the hands-on student educational component of this effort, and will also allow for outreach to park visitors.  National and international collaboration will take place with short-term visits from international research fellows and underrepresented undergraduate students during five summers.  The development of online modules, hands-on experiences and national and international collaboration will promote lasting knowledge of scientific principles in mountain meteorology.  In the longer term, results from this study will be relevant for a wide range of applications including weather prediction, regional and global climate, and air quality management.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The atmospheric boundary layer (the lowest layer of the atmosphere) and its interactions with underlying complex terrain significantly influence weather forecasts, air quality, and behavior of the earth's climate system. The goals of this project were to investigate the variability of the boundary layer over mountainous terrain and the processes underlying this variability. Data from field experiments, output from weather forecasting models, and novel theoretical, observational, and modeling tools were used to address these goals. In addition, the educational component of this proposal aimed to create engaging experiences for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students which allowed them to acquire and apply scientific inquiry skills. Some of the main findings are:  Boundary layers typically follow the underlying terrain in the morning and are relatively independent of the underlying terrain during the afternoon.  Air pollution concentrations over mountain ridges and valleys and how these concentrations vary in time depend primarily on the boundary layer height.  Boundary layers over mountain ridges are often overestimated in weather forecasting models.  The poor performance of weather forecasting models over mountains is caused by the smoothing of mountains in coarse models and by the misrepresentation of processes that lead to wind and turbulence over the mountain surface.  The boundary layer over valleys and adjacent slopes is characterized by the presence of large organized rolls or cells. Surface measurements do not capture the effects of these rolls and cells on turbulence at the surface.   Unmanned aerial systems offered unprecedented opportunities to measure wind and turbulence in boundary layers over mountains.  Field work activities with middle-school and high-school students included the use of a research facility in the Shenandoah National Park, weather balloons, and unmanned aerial system. These helped students better understand mountain weather and climate.       Last Modified: 10/29/2018       Submitted by: Stephan F De Wekker]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
