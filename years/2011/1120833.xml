<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit.  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large membrane-bound sac for the production of many proteins in cells. However, a significant fraction of the proteins become defective during production or due to pathogenic insults, such as exposure to toxic agents or genetic mutations. To deal with this problem, cells have evolved an ER protein quality control system to recognize those defective proteins and extract them from the ER for destruction. When the quality control process does not function properly, defective proteins build up in the ER, which in severe cases can lead to cell damage and even cell death. Therefore, how defective proteins are removed from the ER is a fundamental biological problem, but unfortunately remains poorly understood. This project will investigate an unexpected physical and functional interaction, discovered in this laboratory, between importin beta and a group of other proteins in the ER protein quality control system. Importin beta is well known for its function in transporting proteins in and out of the nucleus. The research will establish a new role for importin beta in ER protein quality control and thus will provide new insights into the overall regulation of this important process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.  This project will involve high school students, high school science teachers, a postdoctoral fellow, and a PhD student. Trainees involved in this research will learn an integrative approach to the novel ER protein quality control function of importin Ã’ using interdisciplinary approaches, which will include molecular biology, biochemistry, and cell biology. To foster high scientific achievement of trainees, a questionnaire will be developed to assess the basic knowledge and skills they learn.  This information will also help to identify critical needs in training that will be incorporated into the mentoring plans for future trainees in the laboratory. The program will utilize established partnerships with local high school science programs to broaden the participation of underrepresented trainees. Science teachers involved in this project will help to recruit students for this project and through these experiences will inspire other students in their classes. Plans will be undertaken to foster collaborations with laboratories at other institutions to share research results and resources and to enhance outreach and training opportunities. Broad dissemination of this research will be achieved by encouraging trainees to present their work at scientific conferences and by distributing electronic educational materials through the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Each cell needs to make tens of thousands of proteins to survive, divide, and response to environmental stimuli and stresses. These proteins have to be made correctly, transported to the right locations in cells, and often assembled to protein complexes to fulfill their designated duties in cells. However, like product manufacturers, a fraction of the proteins produced are defective. Moreover, environmental factors, such as chemicals and heavy metals, can damage proteins. Cells have evolved a protein quality control system to identify and remove defective and damaged proteins or orphan component of protein complexes, to ensure cell survival and normal function. The research supported by this award was designed to study a new concept regarding how the nucleocytoplasmic transporter proteins regulate protein quality control. The results from this study have provided us important new insights to how cells handle and remove defective, damaged, or unwanted proteins. First, the major nuclear import and export proteins that were originally thought to carry only normal proteins in or out of the nucleus are now found to carry defective proteins for removal by protein destruction systems. Second, at least some of these nuclear transport proteins are not only transport defective proteins from nucleus, but also from the unexpected parts of the cells, the endoplasmic reticulum. The specific molecular mechanisms regarding these new functions for the nuclear transport proteins were elucidated. These nuclear transporter-mediated protein quality control mechanisms protect the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum against defective proteins-caused damage to cells. In addition, we have established a new technology that provides a unprecedented opportunity for drug discovery by high throughput screening. Moreover, during the course of this award we have trained seven students at different levels, including a minority high school student and a minority college student. The results from this study were disseminated in local and international meetings, and through seminars and collaborations.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Shengyun&nbsp;Fang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
