<AbstractNarration>The Arctic is currently warming more rapidly than other locations on the planet and the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to this warming is a focus of many current studies. Model projections of the contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to global sea level rise range from 4.5 to 17 cm by 2100.  This project will help to understand the possible response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to future warming by developing records of the ice sheet margin during past warm times particularly during recent interglacial period (the Holocene Epoch, 11,650 years B.P. to present).  The research will focus on the Kangerlussuaq region (67.0N, 50.7W) in western Greenland where a record of ice margin extents during the Holocene is marked by belts of prominent, well-preserved moraine ridges. Preliminary ages of moraines, determined by surface-exposure dating using the cosmogenic nuclide Beryllium-10, demonstrate the ability to date precisely the moraines near Kangerlussuaq.  Results from one set of moraines, the ?Orkendalen moraines?, located just outboard of (and in some places adjacent to) the historical moraines, indicate that the Greenland Ice Sheet was smaller than at present between ~6,500 years ago and the historical advance culminating in A.D. 1850. The project will develop a chronology of the Greenland Ice Sheet margin fluctuations near Kangerlussuaq using a combination of detailed geomorphic mapping and surface-exposure dating of moraines.  Ice sheet margin fluctuations will be compared with Holocene records of insolation, ocean circulation and surface air temperatures to examine the possible climate mechanisms that may have influenced the fluctuations of Holocene ice extent in eastern Greenland. The timing and spatial continuity of these fluctuations will provide insight into how the Greenland Ice Sheet will respond to future climate changes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will produce the first directly dated ice margin chronology in the Kangerlussuaq region in Greenland.  Ice cores from the Greenland Ice Sheet register temperature, dustiness and other atmospheric conditions over the ice sheet, but do not provide information on how the sensitive margins of the ice sheet have changed.  Combined with data from eastern Greenland, this new record from western Greenland will provide a geographically broad, spatial comparison of ice margin fluctuations that will be useful for testing hypotheses of climate mechanisms that cause ice sheet variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.</AbstractNarration>

Funding from this award was used to process and measure 18 10Be samples from western Greenland Ice Sheet margin as well as paying for travel expenses for co-PI Levy to travel to the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to measure the samples.     Broader Impacts  This research involved three major broader impacts: 1) education and research training for underrepresented groups; 2) outreach to public audiences; and 3) broad dissemination of research results, particularly Greenlandic people.  We broadened the participation of underrepresented groups in research by integrating two undergraduate women into the project. These students helped processed 10Be samples in the Cosmogenic Laboratory at Dartmouth College. Both women gained valuable laboratory experiences and were involved in discussion of project goals and results. Co-PI Levy mentored the undergraduate students and gained valuable experience as an advisor.  We conducted extensive outreach to public audiences.  We presented the results of this study and discussed the role of ice sheets in EarthÆs climate system.
