<AbstractNarration>Recently, reconstructing full and detailed 3D models for large-scale urban environments has become the crucial technology for many applications and offers a natural platform for different services. Although conventional structure from motion (SFM) techniques have been engineered to their maturity,  they normally do not utilize rich global structures of urban scenes, including regularity, symmetry, and self-symmetry; and the very repetitive shapes and textures ubiquitous in urban scenes make detecting and matching features extremely challenging for the conventional techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a novel approach for inferring highly accurate 3D geometry from an individual or multiple 2D images of an urban scene. It takes full advantage of the rich global symmetry and regularity in urban scenes by leveraging powerful computational tools from modern high-dimensional convex optimization. The developed method can accurately recover the regular 3D geometry and 2D texture of the scene directly from the raw image pixels/regions without relying on extracting any intermediate local features. The research includes developing a set of useful tools and a full system that can significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of 3D modeling of large urban scenes and give significantly more compact representation of the 3D geometry and 2D appearance, enabling online real-time rendering and visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research results from this project can be easily integrated into and significantly improve the current computer vision course on 3D reconstruction. The associated technologies can be useful for a very wide range of commercial applications such as online or mobile visual search, visual guidance, navigation, or surveillance, virtual tourism, and augmented reality etc.</AbstractNarration>

We aim to develop a spectrum of new 3D reconstruction tools that are based on semi-global or global image regions that correspond to all types of structural regularities and invariants.     Autonomous vehicles (AVs), both ground and aerial, have been gaining tremendous recent attentions and R&amp;D investment from commercial companies and public research institutes.  Concurrently, an ever-increasing high demand of intelligent robots such as service robots has also been witnessed and projected lately.  The key enabling technologies commonly sought after hence are geometric localization, 3D environment mapping, and visual analytics and understanding for real-time mobile vision. This project has led to fundamental advances (supported by scientific publications in top-tier venues) in a number of areas; including robustly estimating a moving camera?s trajectory over long travel distance based on captured images, reconstructing modern cities through image sets containing highly challenging repetitive patterns, performing real-time motion analysis and tracking, and locating objects of interest in 3D for online robotic vision.    We believe that our newly developed algorithms and tools on visual correspondance and structure-from-motion have led to much simpler and more efficient 3D reconstruction systems such that anyone, not just highly trained and experienced research groups, can easily obtain high-quality 3D models of typical scenes.   The project has trained 6 graduate students in a technical area (3D reconstruction, modeling and analytics) that is of critical need.  The project resulted in 11 journal papers and 10 conferences papers at top peer-reviewed venues.          Last Modified: 03/20/2016       Submitted by: Minh N Do]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
