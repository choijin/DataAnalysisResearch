<AbstractNarration>The proposed project is devoted to deepen the connection of two seemingly different subfields of low dimensional topology, namely contact topology and Heegaard Floer homologies. The invariants of Legendrian knots in Heegaard Floer homology gave several first proofs of new phenomenons in knot theory. During this project the PI would like to understand relations between the already defined knot invariants for Legendrian knots, see how these invariants are related for concordant Legendrian knots and use these invariants together with other tools to distinguish and hopefully classify Legendrian representations of a wide class of knots. Contact geometry provided a tool for proving results in Heegaard Floer homology. As part of the proposed projects the PI would like to use tools from contact geometry to give a lower bound for the rank of Heegaard Floer homology for a manifold that contains an incompressible surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low dimensional topology describes our physical world; the space we live in is a 3-dimensional manifold while space-time is a 4-dimensional manifold. The proposed project is aimed to deepen the connection between two subfields of low dimensional topology that are inspired by physics in different ways. The first is the theory of contact manifolds, which arise quite naturally as phase spaces of moving objects. The other is Heegaard Floer homology which is obtained by associating to an object a configuration space of constrained functions and computing the space's algebro-topological invariants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I'm afraid, I have not been able to get in contact with the actual PI - Vera Vertesi.  From wikipedia:  In mathematics, contact geometry is the study of a geometric structure on smooth manifolds given by a hyperplane distribution in the tangent bundle and specified by a one-form, both of which satisfy a 'maximum non-degeneracy' condition called 'complete non-integrability'. From the Frobenius theorem, one recognizes the condition as the opposite of the condition that the distribution be determined by a codimension one foliation on the manifold ('complete integrability').  Contact geometry is in many ways an odd-dimensional counterpart of symplectic geometry, which belongs to the even-dimensional world. Both contact and symplectic geometry are motivated by the mathematical formalism of classical mechanics, where one can consider either the even-dimensional phase space of a mechanical system or the odd-dimensional extended phase space that includes the time variable.  Contact geometry has &mdash; as does symplectic geometry &mdash; broad applications in physics, e.g. geometrical optics, classical mechanics, thermodynamics, geometric quantization, and applied mathematics such as control theory. Contact geometry also has applications to low-dimensional topology; for example, it has been used by Kronheimer and Mrowka to prove the property P conjecture and by Yakov Eliashberg to derive a topological characterization of Stein manifolds.
