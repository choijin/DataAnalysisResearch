<AbstractNarration>Nuvuk, the northernmost archaeological site in the United States, is located at the tip of Point Barrow, Alaska. It is endangered by rapid coastal erosion. This summer, the final field season of the NSF-funded Nuvuk Archaeology project encountered additional Ipiutak material in the current erosion face, including part of a box hearth and adjacent living surface, the first such feature north of Point Hope. Artifacts included an Ipiutak point, a jet and ivory composite labret, decorated ivory fragments, and a wide variety of lithics. Faunal material included large amounts of fishbone, which is quite rare at Ipiutak. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field considerations did not permit excavation of the entire feature, and it will be eroded away by the first fall storm. This small RAPID award will provide the resources needed to conduct an excavation as soon as possible to record the structure and recover the archaeological data it contains prior to the arrival of the fall storm season and its potential loss.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Emergency Excavation of an Eroding Ipiutak Structure Project (E3ISP) did a 7 day salvage excavation of a partially eroded Ipiutak house, including part of the central box hearth and floor/bench area, discovered during fieldwork on another project.  It was exposed in the erosion face, and in imminent danger of eroding entirely with the next storm.  The floor/bench area contained very large numbers of tiny chert (flint) flakes and bone fragments, especially fish bones.  We did the excavation in the normal fashion,  recording artifact locations with an infrared theodolite.  It was impossible to get all the tiny flakes and bones in the field, since they were so small they were likely to blow away in the.  So, we bagged the floor by .25 m square, and took them back to the. There, each sample was dried, and screened through a large mesh to remove larger gravel.  This step also retained some of the fish bones, which were collected.  Larger artifacts would have been recovered at this stage as well if the excavators had missed any in the field.  The rest was then screened with a very fine mesh, which allowed sand and silt to pass through.  The remainder was then put into water, with very fine fabric used to collect the light material (wood, plant fragments, etc.) that floated to the top.  Larger plant samples were separated for further analysis, and wood fragments were counted.  The heavy material left behind was then dried and hand sorted. There already have been important results from the E3ISP.    The history of fishing in nearby Elson Lagoon is a current research topic for the local fisheries biologists, and we are partnering to identify the fish.  We will be preparing a proposal to do aDNA on many of the fish remains, as they are fragmented enough that species-level identification by means of morphology alone will prove difficult.  The information from the eroding Ipiutak structure will help us understand construction features of such structures.  The recovery of micro-debitage and other manufacturing debris, as well as small faunal material, should prove useful in understanding paleoeconomy and manufacturing processes at Nuvuk during Ipiutak times.  Analysis of the materials recovered through the E3ISP continues. A presentation on the results of this work was given at the SAA 2012 meeting.  Additional articles on various aspects of the research are in preparation. The project has involved six community volunteers, and seven undergraduates to date.  In addition, 2 high school students worked on the project.          Last Modified: 12/13/2012       Submitted by: Anne M Jensen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
