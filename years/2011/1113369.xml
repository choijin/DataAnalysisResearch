<AbstractNarration>Liquid water is essential to life, and the search for habitable planets within our solar system and elsewhere in the galaxy has come down to a search for planets on which liquid water can exist. Earth is a water planet, but how the Earth acquired its water is a subject of extensive debate, measurement, experiment, and theoretical calculation. We do not even have a solid constraint on how much water the Earth has, because the components of water, atoms of hydrogen and oxygen, are incorporated into the solid silicate minerals of the interior, and this water can be exchanged with the surface reservoir over the long stretch of geologic time. This is an experimental research project to measure the solubility of hydrogen in the solid, oxygen-based silicate minerals of the deep interior of the Earth in order to place some constraint on how much hydrogen the planet can harbor in this region which constitutes more than half the mass of the planet.  &lt;br/&gt;This is a project to synthesize and characterize hydrous magnesium silicate and oxide phases thought to be stable in the lower transition zone and lower mantle at depths of 600 to 2900 km. The work is to be conducted in collaboration with scientists principally in Germany, but also in other EU countries and Japan. Synthesized high pressure minerals will be analyzed for crystal structure, chemical composition and hydrogen content. Measurements of elasticity will be made in order to constrain the effect of hydration on seismic velocity. The data obtained should permit a greater understanding of the crucial role of hydrogen in mantle dynamics and further constrain the amounts of hydrogen that may be stored in planetary interiors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hydrogen in Lower Mantle Minerals: June, 2011 - May, 2015   Intellectual merit.  Understanding how the Earth and other terrestrial planets store and cycle hydrogen in their deep interiors will help us to understand the natural mechanisms for storage and cycling of water and may help to identify other water planets in our galaxy. This is a project to synthesize and characterize hydrous magnesium silicate and oxide mineral phases thought to be stable in the lower transition zone and lower mantle of the Earth.  Broader Impacts include the strong synergy between research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at the University of Colorado. New developments in research are included in all levels of the teaching and outreach endeavors of the PI and supported graduate students.  Outcomes: The mantle of the Earth is about two-thirds of the total planetary mass and is composed of solid rock made up of oxygen bearing minerals. The mineralogy changes with increasing pressure from the crust toward the metallic core. Most of these minerals can be synthesized and quenched to ambient conditions for study in the laboratory. The solubility of hydrogen as hydroxyl in these minerals varies greatly.
