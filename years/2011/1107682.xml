<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to study the relationship between supermassive black hole growth and galaxy evolution at the highest redshifts by carrying out detailed observations of the most distant quasars and their host galaxies using ALMA and new optical/near-IR facilities.  The program will obtain deep, high resolution submillimeter continuum and [CII]/CO line observations of a complete sample of SDSS quasars at redshifts around 6 during the ALMA early science phase. These observations will reach an order magnitude deeper than current limits, and will be used to measure star formation rate, size, and gas kinematics of the host galaxies, and provide estimates of the galaxy dynamical mass.  The program will also use new sensitive near-IR spectrographs on 6-10m telescopes, including Magellan, LBT and VLT, to measure supermassive black hole masses and chemical abundances in the environments of distant quasars.  The observations will map the accretion and growth history of quasar central black holes, and probe the star formation and galaxy assembly history of their host galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and pathfinding use of ALMA in early science mode.</AbstractNarration>

This four-year program produced significant results in the following areas:  - We discovered the first 10 billion solar mass black holes only 1 billion years after the big bang, residing in the most luminous quasars knonw in the early universe. This result posts significant challenge to the theory of black hole formation and came as a complete surprise, defying earlier model predictions.  - We obtained the first detailed maps of star formation and gas motion in the hosts of the earliest luminous quasars powered by black holes with ALMA. These new images show extremely intense level of star formation (1000 times that of the Milky Way) in those galaxies, and allowed us to measure the mass of these systems, providing insight to the connection between black hole formation and galaxy evolution.  - Our survey is mapping the evolution history of black hole population in the first two billion years of the cosmic history to much higher precision. They show that large black holes dominate early quasar population and reveal the impact of quasars in the heating and ionization of the intergalatic gas.  Our team published more than 40 papers supported by this grant, and have six graduate students and three postdoc fellows trained in our quasar/galaxy research described here,       Last Modified: 02/08/2016       Submitted by: Xiaohui Fan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
