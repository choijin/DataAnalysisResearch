<AbstractNarration>In this Capacity-Building Noyce Scholarship Program, STEM Teach VI, the University of the Virgin Islands is establishing the curricular framework and institutional collaborations to support training of STEM majors to become high-school science teachers.  The Virgin Islands has great need for such a program.  Student performance on tests of proficiency in science and mathematics shows that education in these areas lags behind many other regions of the United States.  In preparing to remedy that need, the University of the Virgin Islands is creating a new teacher preparation program.  Faculty in the School of Education, the College of Science and Mathematics and the College of Liberal Arts and Social Science have identified existing courses and established new ones to supplement the major studies of future teachers with the needed theoretical and practical education training.  Most interesting, STEM Teach VI proponents recognize that aspects of the program must relate to the cultural and contextual uniqueness of the Virgin Islands, so they are studying the site-specific factors that influence learning both for the high school students and future educators.  Noyce Scholars are recruited early in their academic careers not only from STEM majors but also from students strongly interested in STEM and education careers.   Not only does this project address a serious need for well prepared science and mathematics teachers, it also serves a population dramatically underrepresented in the STEM disciplines:  81% of the population is African American and 15% is Hispanic.  Once the two-year planning period is complete, the structures will be in place to support a dynamic and forward-looking program for STEM teacher preparation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The College of Science and Mathematics (CSM) and the School of Education (SOE) at the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI), in partnership with the VI Department of Education, have worked to address deficits in STEM Education in the territory through this Noyce Capacity Building Project.  The first of the two goals was to create a STEM teacher preparation program based on existing models, particularly the basics of the UTeach model, to create a program that is culturally relevant to the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). The second major goal was to conduct research on education in the USVI that will continue to inform the developed STEM teacher preparation program, as well as other education programs and university teaching.  To those ends, faculty from CSM and SOE have developed a STEM secondary education minor, adapted from the highly successful UTeach model, which emphasizes inquiry- and project-based instruction, as well as early field experiences that continue throughout the program.  The initial two courses have completed UVIÆs approval process and have been offered, while the remaining four new courses (Knowing and Learning, Classroom Interactions, Project Based Instruction, and Ethnomethodological Perspectives to Natural Scientific and Mathematical Inquiries) and the minor are still in development.  In addition, we are consulting with both the VI Board of Education and the VI Department of Education to ensure that the undergraduates in the program will be ready for certification upon graduation.  Underpinning this new STEM secondary teacher preparation program is the research on STEM Education in the VI.  In particular, we have endeavored to model what we refer to as a contextually situated, culturally resonant pedagogy where the curriculum and instruction are informed by the home and community backgrounds, knowledge, and experiences of the students of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Eight "Indicators of Culturally Responsive Practice" have been identified from research involving a pilot group of in-service mathematics teachers on St. Thomas. These Indicators describe the habits, skills, and dispositions of an effective mathematics educator and are sorted into four categories: Classroom relationships, Assessment practices, Curriculum, and Instructional practices. Three of the eight indicators are as follows:  &middot; Teacher demonstrates care in his/her interactions with students. &middot; Teacher confronts deficit notions of students and acknowledges that all students are able. &middot; Teacher plans lessons that are student-centered, inquiry-oriented, and connected to studentsÆ lived experiences.   These results were presented at the 2014 annual conference of the International Society of Educational Research (iSER) and at the 2015 annual conference of the American Educational Research Association (AERA). A manuscript that presents our findings is currently in revision at the Journal of Mathematics and Culture. The study is ongoing with a larger group of science and mathematics teachers on St. Thomas and St. Croix, many of whom participated in a STEM Institute at UVI during the summer of 2015 and shared their reflections on and provided confirmations of our findings. This knowledge is not only informing instruction in the minor and at the University overall, it is also being disseminated to in-service STEM teachers through professional development with University faculty as well as through a peer-to-peer model at their own schools.  Furthermore, both in support of the new minor and professional development in general, workshops and other training opportunities have been provided to in-service STEM teachers regarding inquiry- and project-based learning and culturally responsive practice.  These opportunities have been enthusiastically received by the STEM teachers. A solid core group of teachers have participated in multiple workshops, while others have joined in as schedules permit.  Overall, 111 teachers participated in summe...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
