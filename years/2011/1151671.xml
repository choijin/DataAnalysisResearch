<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will probe the connection between two classes of "homology-type" invariants of objects in low-dimensional topology: Khovanov homology, whose (algebraic) construction originates in the higher representation theory of quantum groups and Heegaard Floer homology, whose (geometric/analytic) construction arises from ideas in symplectic geometry and gauge theory. This project builds on, and seeks to re-explain from first principles, foundational work of Ozsvath-Szabo, who constructed a deformation of the (reduced) Khovanov homology of a link, thereby connecting it to the Heegaard Floer homology of its double-branched cover.  By understanding the relationship between "open" versions of the two theories, the P.I. will obtain applications to questions about braids and tangles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad aim of the present project is to improve our understanding of the topology of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, i.e., the properties of these spaces that remain unchanged under stretching and contracting (but not under tearing and gluing).  Topological ideas underpin the development of efficient computer chips and information networks.  The shapes of molecules and proteins determine their electrical properties and biological functions.  Basing quantum computing algorithms on large-scale features of a quantum system minimizes their susceptibility to random error.  Moreover, knot theory, the study of loops imbedded in 3-dimensional space, has become increasingly important in our understanding of how DNA behaves in cells.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    In "Connections between Algebraic and Geometric Invariants in Low-dimensional Topology", the principal investigator explored the connections between Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer homology, two collections of invariants that have revolutionized the study of 3- and 4- manifolds. A manifold is an abstract space that looks locally like Euclidean space but can have interesting global structure.  Manifolds of dimensions 3 and 4 have long posed a challenge to mathematicians, as they are too complicated to address by elementary means, yet lie out of reach of classical surgery theory, which translates many questions in high-dimensional topology to questions in algebraic topology.  Curiously enough, 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds are also the most physically interesting. After all, we live in a universe which appears to have 3 dimensions of space and 1 of time. Topological ideas underpin the development of efficient computer chips and information networks. The shapes of molecules and proteins determine their electrical properties and biological functions. Basing quantum computing algorithms on large-scale topological features of a quantum system minimizes their susceptibility to random error. Moreover, knot theory, the study of loops imbedded in 3- dimensional space, has become increasingly important in our understanding of how DNA behaves in cells.   Since interest in the physical universe has inspired interest in low-dimensional topology, it is fitting that Khovanov and Heegaard Floer homology have been inspired by physics, albeit in rather different ways. Heegaard Floer homology invariants are obtained by associating to an object a configuration space of constrained functions and computing the space's algebro-topological invariants. Khovanov homology, on the other hand, has its roots in quantum topology, producing invariants of knots by categorifying the state sums associated to certain quantum amplitudes, including those used in the theoretical topological quantum computers mentioned above. Although the constructions involved in the two theories are quite different, they share intriguing similarities.   Motivated by these similarities, the PI and her collaborators investigated the Khovanov and Heegaard Floer invariants associated to links in the three-sphere, focusing special attention on what more can be said when links are realized as closures of braids.  The most influential scientific outcomes of this project were: 1) a new combinatorial algorithm for detecting the trivial braid, 2) the development of Lie (super)algebra actions on the invariants, 3) a thorough investigation of the  relationship between these actions and four-dimensional aspects of knot theory.  As part of the project, the PI organized two summer graduate workshops that have greatly enhanced interaction between the categorified knot theory community and the larger community of low-dimensional topologists and representation theorists. One graduate student, who went on to be awarded an NSF postdoctoral fellowship in 2018, cited the first of the workshops as "highly influential [in my] research and career. Perhaps most importantly, it was where I first learned about braid foliation techniques, thanks to one of the mini-courses.
