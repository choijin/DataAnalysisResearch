<AbstractNarration>Virginia State University's Broadening Participation Research in STEM Education Project entitled - Improving Minority Student Mathematics Performance and Persistence in STEM Majors Through Cognitive Training - is a joint effort among investigators from the departments of Psychology, Biology, and Mathematics &amp; Computer Science. The overall goal of this research project is to develop and assess the efficacy of cognitive training interventions on working memory performance in minority STEM students which leads to improved mathematics performance. Specific aims include the following: institute and assess the impact of cognitive skills training on working memory and mathematics performance in minority STEM students; develop a model of the mediating and moderating effects of psychosocial and cognitive variables on treatment effects among these students; assess neural changes brought about by each of these interventions through pre- and post- f-MRI scans; and assess the sustainability of the gains through scans one and two years after the initial training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct training of cognitive skills such as attention, working memory, and processing speed, represents a unique method of developing the underlying cognitive architecture needed for success in STEM, and this research will both demonstrate the efficacy of these interventions, as well as allow for a more detailed mapping of the neural correlates of the training for mathematical performance. This project will provide the necessary data to facilitate the dissemination and implementation of these unique educational interventions, and will have an impact on increasing the number of minority students prepared to enter a STEM career. It will also allow for the training of a large number of minority undergraduate and graduate assistants, which will impact the number of minority students pursuing a research career in neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project assessed the impact of cognitive training on the mathematical performance of college students.  It also looked at psycho-social variables associated with academic performance that could be addressed in targeted interventions.  Overall the project found that intensive training can impact cognitive skills in a relatively short period of time, particularly working memory, and produce far transfer to matrix reasoning tasks, which are usually thought to be the best measure of general cognitive ability.  We also found that cognitive training increases connectivity in the brain compared to control activities.  We only found modest evidence of far transfer from cognitive training programs to mathematics performance directly, except in circumstances in which added content instruction in mathematics was combined with cognitive training.  This combination did produce better results than tutoring alone, and this finding is the basis of our future research in this area looking at enhanced pedagogy as well as cogntive training in a K-12 setting.  We also developed models of learning in African American students looking at non-cognitive factors affecting academic outcomes such as goal orientation, academic efficacy, and self-handicapping.  We also looked at the impact of math anxiety and stereotype threat in this student population.  We found that self-handicapping mediates the effects of most of these other variables, and therefore would be the most effective target for interventions designed to improve minority performance, particularly in the STEM areas.  The findings of this study have led to the development of interventions at the college level designed to improve performance and retention of minority STEM students.  It has also led to the development of a "K-16 Model" intervention to increase the flow of minority students into the STEM pipeline and out into the workforce.  This model uses the combination of cognitive training, the pedagogy and content developed by the Algebra Project, and enhanced techer preparation curricula.
