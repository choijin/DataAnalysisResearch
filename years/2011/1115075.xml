<AbstractNarration>This project will create InvertNet, an on-line virtual museum comprising &gt;50 million insect and related arthropod specimens housed at 22 Midwestern institutions, focusing on the research theme of effects of land use changes on the biota of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi River drainage basins.  These collections document 160 years of environmental change and are an invaluable and irreplaceable resource but, at present, are largely inaccessible to scientists and the general public.  Most previous efforts to capture and disseminate invertebrate collection data have focused on label data alone.  InvertNet will use advanced digitization and networking technologies to capture and display 2D and 3D images of specimens and labels, and incorporate them into a searchable database. These new techniques should reduce the cost of digitizing insect specimens substantially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By allowing users to find and view detailed images of specimens of particular species and their associated data labels, InvertNet will provide universal access to collections previously restricted to researchers.  It will include links to the popular BugGuide.net insect identification website and to other biodiversity data portals used by researchers, educators, and the general public.  This will facilitate and support many aspects of biological research and education, including species discovery and identification, pest management, ecology and biogeography.  InvertNet will serve as a model, applicable to other kinds of biological collections, for the use of efficient, computer-assisted procedures to increase the speed and accuracy of collection data capture. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span lang="EN">The ADBC program at NSF is charged with digitizing natural history collections in the United States and making the resulting images and associated data available to the general public and the broader scientific community. The current project at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CMNH) was initiated as part of the InvertNet Thematic Collections Network (TCN), which proposed digitizing whole insect drawers from fourteen university and institutional collections from throughout the Midwest. The Carnegie Museum insect collection is vast, with an estimated ten million plus pinned specimens. To this end, we imaged a total of 3,060 individual whole drawers from our collection. Specimens in these drawers included representatives from five major insect orders, including Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (flies), Hymenoptera (wasps and bees), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Orthoptera (grasshoppers and kin). The vast majority of the specimens imaged, however, were beetles from lesser known or poorly studied groups. <strong>Roughly one million specimens</strong> from these drawers were imaged as a result of the project and these fell into 163 different insect families. Almost 41,000 of these specimens have had their label data completely captured in database format and are ready for dissemination and use. The collection of images captured during this project are available online, as a virtual museum of sorts, and can be found at </span><a href="http://iz.carnegiemnh.org/DataEntry"><span lang="EN"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Calibri;">http://iz.carnegiemnh.org/DataEntry</span></span></a><span lang="EN">. Additional images will be added after they are post-processed. The image galleries on the site can be easily browsed by anyone with a modern web browser.</span></p> <p><span lang="EN">Another focus of our project was to begin imaging our glass slide collection of Siphonaptera (fleas). The fleas are a very important group of insects because they are vectors of disease which can and do adversely impact human health around the world. The 70,000 flea slides in the Carnegie collection (donated by R. Traub) represent one of the largest collection holdings of fleas worldwide. As a result of this project, we were able to 1) individually label the entire collection with unique barcodes, 2) begin imaging the slides and the associated notebooks, and 3) start capturing label data into an online searchable database. Since this is such an important group, we hope that the data and images from our collection might enable future taxonomic, biological or medical investigations of flea vectors and aid in research on flea-borne diseases.</span></p> <p><span lang="EN">This project also engaged a large number of work-study students from four local universities, including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University, and Chatham University. These students gained experience with museum studies by working hands-on with specimens in a large entomological collection and they received training in insect specimen care, preparation, curation, databasing, and digitization as they carried out project-related tasks. Museum visitors were engaged with the project in a variety of ways, such as through behind-the-scenes tours in the insect collection, various public programming events, and at the museum&rsquo;s Moriarty scientific lecture series, which is open to the public.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/28/2017<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;W&nbsp;Fetzner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1115075/1115075_10104282_1506607886552_DEA_Website-Home--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1115075/1115075_10104282_1506607886552_DEA_Website-Home--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1115075/1115075_10104282_1506607886552_DEA_Website-Home--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Home page of the CMNH Invertebrate Zoology Data Entry and Annotation website.</div> <div class="imageCredit">J.W.
