<AbstractNarration>Price/1142178&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to continue the measurements of chlorophyll (Chl) and tryptophan (trp) in WAIS Divide ice down to 3330 m, or deeper if drilling continues below 3330 m. A new type of live/dead stain for microbes will be used to see if the decrease is related to the death rate of microbes responsible for the slow decrease of intensity with depth. Previous work on GISP2 ice has shown that methane concentrations in deeper sections of the core were an order of magnitude higher than the variations due to climate change. The conclusion from the prior work suggested that the methane spikes were due to methanogens at those depths that were metabolizing while frozen in the ice. With the Berkeley Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (BFS) measurements will be made on WAIS Divide ice at the National Ice Core Laboratory (NICL) to look for unusually large spikes of Trp and Chl that will inform gas chemists of the exact depths to look for gas anomalies (i.e., concentration spikes that may not be related to climate). In fluorimetric scanning of GISP2 ice at NICL, increases in Trp were found at many depths, corresponding to depths with nitrous oxide (N2O) spikes.  Flow cytometry with excitation by a 405 nm laser will also be used to look for F420 autofluorescence emission at ~465 nm as a signature of methanogens. Previous measurements with the optical logger enabled many more volcanic ash layers to be found in the Dome C ice core than had been found with other methods. The recent discovery that logging of a freshly drilled borehole, to the bottom of WAIS Divide, resulted in a higher-resolution dust pattern and a far greater concentration of clearly resolvable volcanic ash layers than had been found in older boreholes is something that will be explored. Using these new ice core logging results, it will be possible to see if any ash layers coincide in time with volcanic ash layers that have been found at other sites and will strengthen existing evidence for a causal relationship between large volcanic eruptions and spikes in the dust log, indicative of abrupt climate changes.  The intellectual merit of the work is that the data will contribute to a better understanding of the processes that contribute to gaseous impurities in the ice and to developing a better understanding of the link between global volcanism and climate. Finally, 47 micro-inclinometers are installed in the ice at various depths and lateral positions in optical modules that are frozen into the IceCube array. They have been recording tilt for nearly a year. These data will be analyzed for an additional three years which will provide an unique opportunity to study the shear-strain rate of a huge volume of cold glacial ice as a function of shear stress. The broader impacts of the work include the possibility of applications to Mars exploration, studies of life in ancient ice, oceanography, limnology, meteorology, climate and volcanology. The project will contribute to the education and training of a broad range of undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs from the U. S. and other countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The       atmospheric dust preserved in the crystal       structure of glacial ice contains vital information about       climate, glacier flow history and future stability of ice sheets,       volcanism and extraterrestrial impacts.  Historically, high       resolution ice records have required painstaking       measurements on ice core samples, once those samples have been       retrieved to the surface to depressurize.  This time-intensive       process does not always preserve the properties of ice in its       glacial state and measurements cannot be made with traditional       instruments without destruction of a core.  We obtained and analyzed multiple       profiles of the WAIS Divide ice core borehole, taken with a laser       borehole dust logger in 2011-12 and an improved instrument in       2014-15.  We synchronized these WAIS Divide logging records of       dust, volcanic ash and climate change with ice core and logging       data from other Antarctic sites including South Pole, Dome C and       Siple Dome (see Figures).  We found evidence for dust correlated to ice fabric, similar to our discovery of the effect at the South Pole in the       IceCube neutrino observatory.  Our results were instrumental in the choice of South Pole as the site of the next deep American core, SPICE Core, which completed drilling in 2015-16.   Optical borehole dust logging has       become an essential part of  glaciology and is now more active than       ever, as ice drilling projects around the world are developing dust loggers of their  own.  Bacteria  preserved in glacial ice carry genomic information about the population  of bacteria in the oceans at the time the ice was deposited.  By  studying the microbes entombed in ice as a function of depth, and hence  age, we can study microbial evolution over hundreds of thousands to  millions of years.  We  detected chlorophyll fluorescence in intact ice cores taken from   Greenland and Antarctica, and we used flow cytometry to localize this fluorescence to particles &lt; 1 &mu;m in diameter.  Our genomic analysis of the meltwater revealed sequences similar to   modern strains of the picocyanobacterial genera Synechococcus and   Prochlorococcus, while some of these sequences were distinct from any   sequences known from modern oceans or glacial environments.  Our study   is a first proof-of-concept of the use of ice cores as records of   microbial evolution.  The       tools developed in this research program will be used in boreholes       created by the Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID).  RAID is a       multidisciplinary platform to rapidly drill the Antarctic ice sheet and access the ice sheet bed for       glaciology, subglacial biology, geophysics, and bedrock geology.        Among other science objectives, the chronological information       provided by our tools will underpin a rapid reconnaissance survey       for 1.5 million year old ice, a centerpiece objective of the       International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences (IPICS).  An       ultimate goal of the world ice coring community is to acquire a 1.5 million year ice core record of       greenhouse gases and climate, doubling the length of the current       ice core record.  Such a core will address the       questions surrounding the shift from regular 41,000 year glacial       cycles to irregular, ~100,000 year cycles, which occurred about a million years       ago.  These questions are vitally       important for understanding the workings of our climate system,       with implications for our future.  By       incorporating our detailed dust records and our discovery of       anisotropic dust scattering, we were able to significantly improve       performance of the IceCube observatory, which was awarded the 2013       Breakthrough of the Year by Physics World.   The       research and technology in this program impacts our understanding       of the Polar Regions, climate change, microbial evolution, and the future dir...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
