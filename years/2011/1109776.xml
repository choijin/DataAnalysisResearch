<AbstractNarration>If one were to arbitrarily put multiple planets in orbit around a star, one might find the system to be dynamically unstable: the orbits would deviate exponentially from their original paths on time scales of a few orbital periods. Real planetary systems, which have survived for at least millions of orbits, are not dynamically unstable. On these long time scales, a planet behaves as if its mass were spread around its orbit, like an elliptical ring around the star. These rings pull on each other gravitationally, causing slow changes in their shapes and orientations, which may lead to so-called secular instability or secular chaos. The Principal Investigator and collaborators on this project plan to develop a complete theory of secular instability, using analytic techniques as well as computer simulations of interacting elliptical rings and direct N-body simulations. Their goal is to determine whether secular instability and secular chaos can quantitatively explain and predict (1) the long-term orbital evolution of the Inner Planets, (2) the distribution of orbital properties and masses of "hot Jupiter" exoplanets, and (3) the properties of exoplanet systems in general. In particular, they aim to determine whether secular chaos is a viable alternative to disk-driven migration for the formation of hot Jupiters which may be able also to account for the wide distribution of orbital inclinations with respect to the stellar equator. They will make quantitative predictions for the eccentricities and spacings of extrasolar planets, and build an understanding of how observations of exoplanet systems can be used to constrain planet formation physics. The project will support and train one postdoctoral researcher and two undergraduate summer students, and the Principal Investigator will give public presentations on the results of the work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We investigated the  properties of planets and planetary systems, focusing primarily on planets around other stars ("exoplanets"). Our work led to 19 refereed articles on a variety of theoretical topics.  In the following, we briefly describe our work on two topics, which comprise some of our most significant findings.  (a) Hot Jupiter migration by "secular chaos":  The first extrasolar planets to be discovered were "hot Jupiters"--planets as big as Jupiter, but very close to their star.  The existence of these hot Jupiters was very puzzling, because it is nearly impossible for them to form in situ.  Instead, they must have formed far away from their star, similar to our own Jupiter, and then somehow migrated inwards.  In our earlier work, we had proposed a new mechanism for migrating these hot Jupiters, in which they formed far from the star, but then migrated inwards after chaotically interacting with neighboring planets.  For this project, we investigated a variety of consequences of this mechanism, and showed that these were broadly consistent with the observed properties of hot Jupiters.  For example, we showed that this mechanism could explain the orbital inclinations of the hot Jupiters, including the fact that some hot Jupiters are on "retrograde" orbits (i.e., they orbit backwards relative to the spin of the star).  (b) Masses and eccentricities of Kepler's planets: NASA's Kepler space telescope has discovered thousands of  exoplanets, most of which are smaller than Neptune. These discoveries have been extremely exciting because they vastly expand our knowledge of extrasolar planets. But although the periods and sizes of these planets were measured by the Kepler telescope, their masses and eccentricities were not. In order to further understand the composition of these planets, and to use these planets to help us understand how planetary systems form and evolve, it is important to know their masses and eccentricities.
