<AbstractNarration>SUNY College at Oswego is graduating more students with STEM degrees by increasing the retention of matriculated students during their first two years of study.  Their self-study on which the interventions are based, identified key reasons declared STEM majors were not retained between freshman and sophomore years or between sophomore and junior years.  The three principal reasons are students switching to non-STEM majors, becoming academically disqualified, or leaving the university while still in good academic standing.  Refinement of institutional data pinpointed problematic courses in Chemistry and Mathematics as particular key choke points contributing to the retention problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By implementing a five-point plan that draws on their own institutional data and informed by effective practices reported in the literature, SUNY Oswego is increasing their number of STEM graduates over a 5 year period by a net 20%.  The first component being implemented is the expansion of a successful, but small, summer bridge Math Camp for incoming STEM majors, and adding Chemistry content to the camp.  The second component is taking advantage of under-utilized time in Chemistry and Physics classes to add "Math in Context" problems and discussion.  The third component is enhancing tutoring services both for walk-in students and for targeted courses by utilizing embedded tutors.  The fourth component is systematizing peer mentoring by upperclassmen for freshman and sophomore STEM majors.  The final component is providing undergraduate research experiences for students during their first years on campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aspects of the multi-pronged program are capable of being implemented at other institutions of higher education since the investigators are optimizing resources that are already in place such as course laboratories and tutoring centers.  The summer bridge Math and Chemistry Camp is especially effective at enabling at-risk students to start their first semester in a strong position to succeed.  The Math in Context program is both mandatory and reaching a large number of students since it is implemented within large-enrollment courses taken by STEM majors that too-often are stumbling blocks to possible STEM graduates.  The small undergraduate research component is targeting students that could most benefit from an early immersion experience in the discipline.  The investigators are sharing their effective practices by organizing discussions and workshops for colleagues on campus and at nearby colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our increasingly technology driven world the relatively low rate of success for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) undergraduate students in finishing four year STEM degree programs at most public universities is concerning. The overall goal of the Oswego SMILES grant was to increase the number of STEM graduates at SUNY Oswego. Most students who leave college level STEM programs do so in the first year. Oswego SMILES introduced five programs aimed at increasing first year STEM student retention: expanded STEM subject tutoring, peer mentored first year science labs, a bridge camp for incoming freshman, early undergraduate career summer research grants, and math in context (embedding real world examples into science and math education). The grant nearly met its goals, over the period of the grant first year STEM student retention increased 7% (10% goal) and total numbers of STEM graduates roughly doubled (20% increase goal, STEM student enrollment also increased by 10% over this time period). The grant was also instrumental in establishing required math placement for incoming STEM majors using the online ALEKS math assessment program.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a tutoring program at SUNY Oswego, but coverage in the sciences was spotty (math tutoring was better established). Most tutoring was by appointment, one-on-one tutoring. The Oswego SMILES grant supported expansion of the number of science classes covered, the hiring of a math tutoring coordinator (who also coordinates the summer bridge camp), and introduced walk in, small group tutoring for math and science done in classrooms in the science building during the evening. Over six years the average retention for STEM students who received at least 3 hours of tutoring (we wanted to exclude students who had merely tried a little tutoring) was 9% higher than for students who received little or no tutoring. This program has proven successful and is now institutionalized.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The peer mentored labs program puts an upper class STEM student in most general chemistry labs, and some first year physics and geology labs. The peer mentors are tasked with getting to know the students in their lab sections and have weekly topics to discuss with the students (preparation for finals, summer research, and course selection are among the common topics). The peer mentors also help with the lab, but that is not their primary purpose. Their primary purpose is to increase the student?s comfort in and understanding of their degree programs. Over six years STEM students who have a peer mentored lab experience their first year are 15% more likely to be retained in STEM majors into their second year than STEM students without such an experience. This program is also institutionalized and will continue.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The summer bridge camp program evolved over the course of the grant. A previous grant had established a three week, mid-summer program that covered both math and chemistry for incoming STEM freshman. However, the program had trouble attracting students, served a modest number of students (about 40), and would have been very difficult to institutionalize. In year three we switched to a one week program offered the week before fall classes started (in the future it would be possible to establish a credit bearing course for the bridge camp which would allow federal student aid to help pay for attendance) which focused on math (as math is the most universal subject among the STEM disciplines) and college readiness (forming peer support networks and introduce support services like tutoring and internships). The camp was designed to accommodate up to 150 incoming STEM freshman (about 50% of the incoming class), actual attendance averaged about 115 STEM students.
