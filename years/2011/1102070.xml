<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this program is to develop nanostructured coatings, nanoparticles, and plasmonic architectures that will lead to the development of fluorescence-based biosensor platforms for point-of-care diagnostics. Through the use of engineered plasmonic structures and nanostructured high surface area coatings, optimal field coupling to sensing elements will be achieved. Thermodynamic interaction occurring within nanoparticle?polymer composite films and the substrate interface will be investigated to achieve a high degree of control over the evolved nanostructures. These structures will be integrated with various plasmonic architectures, and the long range and short range surface plasmon polaritons will be studied. These unique sensor architectures will be validated via the detection of Botulinum and thrombin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is that a scientific study on integrative nanostructured sensing architectures will advance research in the area of point-of-care sensing technologies. The ability to control the entropic-enthalpic interplay between nanoparticles and polymer systems will enable ?bottom-up? fabrication of complex nanostructures. Such custom engineered thin films will serve as unique substrates for biological assays as well as novel optical coatings for plasmonic nanostructures enabling the detection of extremely low level fluorescence signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts are the development of health-related diagnostic tools, in which the technology can be translated into diagnostics for national security, environment, energy, food safety, and manufacturing. The program includes an educational component involving recruitment of underrepresented students and hands-on learning opportunities in the field of plasmonics, nanostructure studies, and biosensing for secondary, undergraduates, and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

To overcome some of the barriers in sensing methodologies, an integrative approach of combining novel nanostructured coatings with plasmonics was pursued. The team pursued the development of optimally engineered plasmonic nanostructures and novel nanostructured high surface area coatings in order to achieve optimal field coupling to sensing elements without the need for complex optical set-up. The goal was to fabricate a customizable fluorescence based sensor platform with intrinsic signal amplification capability. Various biological agents were detected through the integration of biological sensing elements onto the nanostructured surfaces including cortisol and TB.  The first step required the development of porous silica coatings (NPO) that could be coupled to nanosized gratings.  The second step required the development of the nanosized gratings.  HD DVD or blue ray discs were used to fabricate the gratings along with a microcontact stamping process. Various processing parameters to achieve optimal thicknesses, porosities (refractive indices) and pore sizes were investigated and non-conventional patterning schemes were examined.  The gratings were coated with chromium, gold, and/or silver and optimized.  Next the sensing platforms were coupled to sensing elements and the biosensing applicability of the integrated platforms were investigated and optimized.   We have tested a number of biosensing elements.  A cortisol biosensor was developed and tested.  We developed a protocol to attach sensing elements (i.e. cortisol-specific antibodies) to the plasmonic gratings in order to achieve competitive binding, fluorescence-based sensing.  We performed a preliminary study on cortisol-spiked saliva samples, comparing our plasmonic nanosensor platform to a flat glass platform.  The plasmonic nanosensor demonstrated a clear response with increasing cortisol concentrations encompassing typical saliva cortisol levels for adults (0.5 &ndash; 5 ng/ml) and children (1.19 &ndash; 3 ng/ml).   A tuberculosis (TB) biosensor was also developed.  TB is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and remains as one of major health problems worldwide with an estimated 8.6 million new cases diagnosed in 2012.  We have developed a method of TB detection by using interferon-&gamma; (IFN&gamma;) assay and combining with plasmonic gratings as sensing platforms.  The results demonstrated a LOD (limit of detection) to be 500 fg/mL with p=0.05. Commercial ELISA assays have reported a 2 pg/mL LOD in 3 hours with the same antibody pair and other assays such as QuantiFERON&reg;-TB, has been reported to be 10 pg/mL or 0.35 IU/mL (roughly, 15pg/mL).  The expected LOD enhancement was 4&times; lower on the gratings due to the SPR based fluorescence enhancement.  We have performed a fundamental study on the formation and integration of novel nanostructured coatings with different plasmonic architectures for fluorescence based biosensing is proposed. These NPO films can increase the binding density of the sensor probes and serve as novel optical coatings for coupling of surface plasmon resonance field enhancement to dye labels enabling the detection of extremely low-level fluorescence signals. The collaborative, multi-disciplinary team has been actively engaged in the fabrication of novel optical coatings, synthesis and applications of metal nanoparticles and plasmonic nanostructures, and development of various biosensors.
