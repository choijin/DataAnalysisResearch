<AbstractNarration>The research focus of this project is the concept of  social identity threat, i.e., academically at-risk minority students are concerned that they could be negatively judged in light of stereotypes of others about their racial group's intellectual ability. Social identity threat has been shown to impair performance of minorities in STEM. The research hypothesizes that social identity triggers a physiological threat response, which involves hormonal and immune-system reactions to threatening situations which can undermine a student's ability to engage in higher level cognitive processing required for success in learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose studies over three years to: (1) examine the role of social psychological and neurobiological processes in understanding the racial achievement gap between White, Black and Latino college students in STEM educational attainment, (2) implement a social-psychological intervention approach to improve performance, (3) test a new theory-informed version of the intervention, (4) test an online intervention delivery system that could facilitate widespread national dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using psychological and neurophysiological levels of analysis, this research will test: (1) how the threat of confirming negative stereotypes "gets under the skin" to impair cognitive functioning for minority students in STEM, and (2) whether a well-validated values-affirmation intervention works because it reduces the physiological stress of identity threat &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate project goal is to provide a powerful, cost-effective, and easily-implemented intervention to reduce the effect of identity threat on minority college student academic functioning, thereby reducing the racial achievement gap in STEM fields and increasing and diversifying the pool of STEM workers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The focus of this research was to use a multi-method approach to understand the psychological and neurobiological process that lead to the effectiveness of a psychological intervention. The specific intervention studied &ndash; called values affirmation &ndash; has been shown to reduce achievement gaps in educational settings by helping members of negatively stereotyped racial/ethnic groups attain higher grades and standardized test scores, and increase their likelihood of taking more advanced courses. The goal of the research funded by this award was to understand more about <em>why</em> and <em>how </em>the intervention works. Three experiments were conducted. Analyses are ongoing, but so far several findings have emerged. In the first study, we tested to see if the intervention reduced physiological stress associated with academic testing. We specifically examined cortisol, a hormone that increases when people are experiencing stress from social evaluation. Results did not yield consistent evidence of condition differences in cortisol, either because the testing situation used in the study was not sufficiently stressful or because the intervention works another way. Consistent with the latter possibility, later results indicated that the intervention helped reduce gains in body mass, which can increase over time in response to stress. Thus, the intervention may still be having a stress-reducing effect, but perhaps not through the hormonal pathway that triggers cortisol. This conclusion is supported by results from part of the second study for this award, which found that people who received a values-affirmation intervention had lower levels of free circulating endothelial microparticles during an experimentally manipulated lab stressor task. The release of endothelial microparticles can be a sign of psychosocial stress and higher levels are a precursor to cardiovascular disease. Thus, these results suggest an alternative physiological stress pathway by which the affirmation intervention may be having an effect (Spicer et al., in press). Another outcome of Study 2 was the creation of a new version of a laboratory stressor task that may be useful in future research testing interventions to help people manage more effectively with evaluative situations. Work on the first two studies from this award contributed to two papers that synthesize the existing literature and expand theory related to values affirmations and psychological interventions (Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014; Cook, Purdie-Vaughns, Meyer, &amp; Busch, 2014). In the third and final study from this award, we examined psychological and physiological outcomes throughout the semester in an introductory college science course designed for students preparing to go to medical school. Results so far indicate that the affirmation intervention has long-term effects in part because it helps to change the way students interact with their environment. A social network analysis revealed that affirmed students were more likely to maintain the strength and quality of their friendship and study networks in the course than students in the control condition. This suggests that the intervention might help foster interpersonal relations that provide support and increased motivation to persist. These findings led us to consider how the intervention may change social environments. In a re-analysis of two previous studies, we found that even non-affirmed students and those from ethnic/racial majority groups performed better in classrooms where more ethnic/racial minority students had received the intervention. This suggests that psychological interventions can have effects that foster larger change in social environments (Powers, Cook, Purdie-Vaughns, Garcia, Apfel, &amp; Cohen, 2016), which helps explain their lasting effectiveness.
