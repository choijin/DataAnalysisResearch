<AbstractNarration>Most flowering plants produce complete flowers, with anthers and pistil located in close proximity.  This arrangement is conducive to self-pollination, which leads to inbreeding and consequent reduced fitness in progeny.  Many flowering plants have adopted self-incompatibility (SI) to circumvent the tendency for inbreeding.  This genetic trait allows the pistil to reject self-pollen but accept non-self pollen for fertilization.  The PI is using Petunia inflata as a model to study SI, with the ultimate goal of understanding how the pistil can distinguish self and non-self pollen, and how this recognition leads to specific rejection of self-pollen.  His group previously identified the S-RNase gene as responsible for the pistil's ability to recognize and reject self-pollen.  The PI's group, along with Dr. Seiji Takayama's group in Japan, found that pollen employs multiple S-locus F-box (SLF) genes in its SI function.  In this project, the PI will use molecular approaches to test the collaborative non-self-recognition model that explains how multiple SLF proteins interact with a single S-RNase to allow non-self pollen tubes, but not self pollen tubes, to escape its toxic effect.  The results obtained will lead to a better understanding of the interactions between these proteins that underlie this important inbreeding-preventing mechanism.  This proposed research has wider implications for the self/non-self recognition process, a fundamental process in biology, as well as for studying protein degradation, a key regulatory mechanism in many biological processes.  The SLF and S-RNase genes could be used to facilitate hybrid-seed production, and if accomplished, this will have tremendous agronomic benefits.  The PI will engage four graduate and five to six undergraduate students in this project to prepare them for future careers in research, and will continue to participate in an annual biology fair at Penn State to educate the public, particularly K-12, about plant reproductive biology and SI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The great majority of flowering plant species have both male and female reproductive organs located in close proximity in the same flower.  This arrangement would be conducive to self-fertilization (inbreeding), and as inbreeding decreases fitness in the progeny and genetic diversity in a species, many flowering plant families have evolved self-incompatibility (SI) to avoid self-fertilization.  This important reproductive trait is widespread in flowering plants, and is thought to be responsible for their explosive success.  Self/non-self recognition between pollen and pistil in the self-incompatible species of the Solanaceae family is controlled by a single polymorphic locus, named the S-locus.  For Petunia, more than 30 variants of the S-locus, referred to as S-haplotypes, have been reported, and they are designated as S1, S2, S3, etc.  The pistil recognizes pollen as self-pollen if the pollen S-haplotype is also present in the pistil, and as non-self pollen if the pollen S-haplotype is not present in the pistil.  The PI?s lab is using Petunia inflata as a model to investigate how pistils distinguish between self and non-self pollen to specifically reject self-pollen.  Prior to the start of this project, the S-locus had been shown to house the S-RNase gene that controls pistil specificity and at least three S-locus F-box (SLF) genes that together control pollen specificity.  A model, named collaborative non-self recognition, was proposed to explain the biochemical basis of SI.  This model predicts that, for a given S-haplotype, each SLF interacts with a subset of its non-self S-RNases (encoded by pistils of different S-haplotypes), and a complete suite of SLF proteins are required to recognize and detoxify all non-self S-RNases.  The major goals of this project are (1) to further examine the collaborative non-self recognition model, and (2) to address some of the questions raised from the unexpected finding that pollen specificity is regulated by multiple SLF genes.  The PI?s lab has (1) used pollen transcriptome analysis to identify 17 SLF genes (named SLF1 to SLF17) in both S2-haplotype and S3-haplotype; (2) used an in vivo functional approach to establish 105 interaction relationships between 17 SLF proteins of S2-haplotype and 11 S-RNases, and 30 interaction relationships between 6 SLF proteins of S3-haplotype and 7 of the 11 S-RNases; (3) used co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify pollen-specific PiSSK1 and PiCUL1-P as the Skp1 and Cullin1 components, respectively, of the SLF-containing SCF complex, and to show that all 17 SLF proteins of S2-haplotype and all 17 SLF proteins of S3-haplotype are assembled into similar SCF complexes; (4) used the approach of artificial microRNA to suppress the expression of S2-SLF1 in S2 pollen and showed this did not affect the ability of S2 pollen to detoxify S3-RNase, S7-RNase and S13-RNase, with all of which S2-SLF1 interacts; (5) discovered that SLF proteins themselves are subject to ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, and identified an 18-amino-acid sequence of S2-SLF1 that contains a degradation motif; (6) sequenced and assembled ~3.1 Mbp of the S-locus of S2-haplotype; (7) used CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing to knock out PiSSK1 and showed that pollen not producing a functional PiSSK1 is rejected by pistils carrying otherwise compatible S-haplotypes; (8) used a chimeric gene approach to identify two regions of S2-SLF1 that contain amino acids required for interactions with S3-RNase.
