<AbstractNarration>Building on an infrastructure of student support assembled with the help of an NSF grant to assist students with disabilities, the University of Southern Maine is testing the effectiveness of scholarships in improving educational opportunities for students of STEM disciplines.  The program awards scholarships to academically talented but financially needy incoming students, both first-year and transfer, to offset a large part of their unmet need.  The students are supported through an intensive summer bridge program, a living and learning community, faculty and peer mentors, advisors, and tutors, along with seminars to foster strong study habits and career awareness.  Opportunities for undergraduate research and co-operative internships further engage the students.  The model thus developed is non-intrusive but comprehensive, using recruitment, retention, and placement to maximize the success of students, many of whom are of non-traditional age, first in their family to attend college, or otherwise underrepresented in the STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>
