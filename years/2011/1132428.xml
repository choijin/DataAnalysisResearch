<AbstractNarration>The observation of neutrinoless double beta decay will help determine the masses of neutrinos, discover lepton number violation and reveal if two-component Majorana fermions exist in Nature. EXO, a multi-tonne neutrinoless double beta decay experiment employing xenon enriched to ~80% in the isotope Xenon-136, is now taking data at the WIPP underground site in New Mexico. However, the next generation of such experiments requires advanced background reduction methods to reach Majorana neutrino mass sensitivities below 0.01 eV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXO is developing a novel technique to tag the Barium (Ba) produced in the final state of the neutrinoless double beta decay using atomic spectroscopy. This technique has the promise of drastically reducing radioactive backgrounds, providing a clean and un-ambiguous measurement with unprecedented sensitivity.  Recent breakthroughs have been obtained in the Ba-tagging front. These groups have produced, for the first time, Ba transport and tagging efficiencies above 1%. The R&amp;D work funded with this award builds on such breakthroughs and aspires to provide the first demonstration of high efficiency tagging of individual Ba atoms in liquid xenon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: While the primary scientific goal of this proposal is in the field of neutrino physics, its broader impact is substantial. The techniques being developed span a range of topics, from nuclear and particle astrophysics, to AMO, surface physics and material science. This research, if successful, is likely to be applicable to other problems in science and technology, where the high efficiency transfer and identification of single atoms would be of interest. Examples include trace analysis for homeland security applications and the detection of rare phenomena. The team is also planning to continue the summer program integrating high school teachers into their labs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is a collaborative effort of Colorado State University (CSU) and Stanford University to develop a method of detecting and counting single 136Ba atoms produced by the double beta decay of 136Xe in a future tank containing on the order of five tons of liquid xenon.  Successful implementation of the proposed technique would make the double beta decay experiment significantly more sensitive and would enhance the prospects of a major discovery that would elucidate fundamental properties of neutrinos.  CSU and Stanford are exploring two complementary methods of single Ba atom "tagging", but interact closely towards the common goal.  This serves as a common Outcomes Report for the collaborative grant.  The final period of this grant was an extension funded primarily with funds remaining from the CSU and Stanford grants plus a modest supplement to CSU.  Nevertheless, significant advances were achieved, and these are summarized below.  The CSU Ba tagging method aims to capture decay daughters in solid xenon on a probe and detect and count them by imaging with lasers.  A significant breakthrough in the last period was imaging of Ba atoms in solid xenon down to the level of a single atom in the laser beam area.  Sapphire window etching and rastering of a laser beam have reduced the residual fluorescence from the window surface to that of a single Ba atom.  Thus the required conditions have been demonstrated for the next step of counting Ba atoms in the frozen solid xenon on the window surface.  This is the final step needed to verify the fundamental concept of this Ba tagging technique.  In addition, an apparatus to freeze solid xenon on a cryogenic probe in liquid xenon and to extract it to a Ba detection region has been completed.  Clear solid xenon deposits on the probe have been successfully formed and extracted to the desired position.  These two advances are key milestones in successful demonstration of this Ba tagging method.  The Stanford Ba tagging method aims to capture decay daughters on a conducting probe and then detect and count them by laser desorption and selective ionization.  The detection method has been studied extensively with substrates made out of several metals, silicon, silicon carbide and various samples of graphene.  Maps have been made of the surface contaminations of Ba on these substrates at the single-atom level, and no completely Ba-free surface has yet been found.  A major breakthrough in this period has been the installation of an argon ion sputtering system to clean substrates. Initial data indicates that sputter cleaning does indeed drastically reduce the surface backgrounds, at least from a copper substrate.   This is an important milestone towards successful demonstration of this method of Ba tagging.  Significant outcomes in training and professional development at both institutions in the last year include one completed Ph. D. thesis (Tim Walton at CSU), attainment of a faculty position by one postdoc (Thomas Brunner at Stanford) and major progress towards three Ph. D. degrees expected in 2017 (Scott Kravitz, Stanford, and Chris Chambers and Adam Craycraft, CSU).  Two important papers relating to Ba tagging have been published in leading journals in the last year or so with lead contributions from Stanford and CSU, one on the spectroscopy of Ba atoms in solid xenon and one on the fraction of daughters of alpha and beta decay in liquid xenon that are ionized.  The high ion fraction found in the latter paper is an important positive result for the potential efficiency of the Ba tagging methods.  The above personnel also have contributed to the operation of the EXO-200 double beta decay experiment and to the analysis of data from this experiment.  Four additional major papers have resulted from the analysis of EXO-200 data.  The results of this work have also been disseminated in many invited and contributed talks and major physics conferences by the Stanford and CSU personnel during this period.  An additional broader impact of the research in this period is the development of stronger interactions with chemists in both solid noble gas spectroscopy and in sensitive study of surfaces.  This broader collaboration has enhanced the Ba tagging efforts and is beginning to provide an impact outside the immediate area of interest.
