<AbstractNarration>Implantable devices for physiological monitoring are in common use in both clinical and research settings.  Even the most advanced current technologies, however, have limitations due to the need to connect a wire to the recording site.  For example, these systems have particular difficulty recording from moving or fragile structures (such as the spinal cord) because wire electrodes shred fragile nerves as the animal moves. Similarly, it has been difficult to record from freely behaving small animals, particularly those without strong skeletons (leeches, fish). We have developed a new technology that does not have these technical limitations.  This technology has been tested, and we are now moving it into working neuroscience laboratories. Consequently this project includes collaboration between researchers at the University of Minnesota (a major research university) and St. Olaf College (a liberal arts college) and will provide opportunities for development in graduate and undergraduate research and teaching.  Our probe devices can be built extremely cheaply, either hand-built individually by an undergraduate or built en-masse through integrated circuit production. The technology we have developed will be of extraordinary use both in research (due to the ability to record from novel preparations) and in teaching (due to its simplicity, reliability, and low cost).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A fundamental goal of both neuroethologists and system neuroscientists is to understand how neural circuits control the coordinated activation of muscles during different behaviors.  The major goals of this project were three-fold.      First, to determine the viability of a miniaturizable, implantable probe that could communicate information about neural signals to a "way-station" attached to the outside of the skull without requiring a wire connection or a battery.   Early data suggested that it would be possible to use galvanic coupling through neural tissue to accomplish this. Unfortunately, we determined that it would not be possible to miniaturize the probe without a powered amplifier.   However, our project was able to create a device capable of very low-power and inexpensive EMG recordings that could be used in classrooms.    Second, to work on the feasibility of using nanowires to record intracellularly from awake, behaving animals using extracellular recording amplifiers.   We were able to get good recordings from multiple cells that we could hold for multiple days.   We are still examining the data from those recordings.    Third, to determine whether either of these processes could be used to create low-cost undergraduate laboratories for neurophysiology.  As noted above, we were able to build inexpensive resources that worked well in undergraduate laboratories.            Last Modified: 06/16/2015       Submitted by: Aaron D Redish]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
