<AbstractNarration>This project will provide currently uncollectable&lt;br/&gt;temporal contamination measurements of hydrocarbons in response to the Deepwater&lt;br/&gt;Horizon oil spill. The US EPA measures an array of hydrocarbons, providing feedback&lt;br/&gt;to residents after a seven day delay. These compounds, known together as BTEX&lt;br/&gt;(benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and total xylenes), greatly increase the overall&lt;br/&gt;potency of petroleum, amplifying the effect of small contamination levels.</AbstractNarration>
