<AbstractNarration>The annual summer activities of the Center for Game Theory in Economics are designed to stimulate and disseminate new advances in research on game theory and its applications.  This award funds a series of research-oriented conferences and workshops combined with informal research activities and learning opportunities for scholars new to game theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer conference and workshops bring together a large and international group of researchers including many junior faculty and graduate students.  Their interests represent a diverse array of theoretical and applied game theory.  Specific topics include Predictive and Descriptive Game Theory, Auctions, Innovations, Adaptive Learning, Game Theoretic Approaches to Electoral Laws, Large Games,  Game Theory for Counterterrorism, Cooperative Game Theory, Macroeconomic Applications of Game Theory, Reputations, Correlated Equilibrium, and Game Theory in Computer Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include training graduate students in state-of-the-art approaches to game theory and facilitating the development of game theory concepts that are useful for a wide range of disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major outcome of the project was to promote intensive interaction between young and established researchers, from all over the world, in the field of Game Theory and its applications, especially to economics. Three International Conferences (more than 200 participants for each one of them), as well as 6 workshops were held during the entire life of the award. The major cutting edge results in game theory and its applications were presented and discussed. Many young researchers had an opportunity to present their work and get feedback from senior scholars.  The project contributed to the interaction between scholars, with emphasis on advanced graduate students, junior and senior researchers. It was to foster a better understanding of the most recent results in the area of Game Theory and its applications in the various fields like: auctions, bargaining, experimental economics, learning and evolution, industrial organization, matching (special focus on school choice, marriage and organ donation), mechanism design and game theory, strategic behavior and the financial crisis, applications of dynamic games and contracts in macroeconomics.  The project has a strong interdisciplinary orientation. Besides economics and mathematics, the conferences and workshops dealt with issues in evolutionary biology, computer science, political science, and experimental behavior.
