<AbstractNarration>This project is to provide 126 scholarships over a 5-year period for academically-talented, financially-needy students in Engineering, Computer Information Systems, Computer Aided Design and Drafting, and Robotics Technology at Baltimore City Community College (BCCC).  The project builds on strong existing student support services at BCCC and develops new interventions such as invited speakers, field trips, peer tutoring, innovative mathematics workshops, engineering/technology competition and family involvement. The project includes a strong evaluation process with feedback loops to ensure continuous improvement. The mathematics-centered advising and workshops should improve mathematics skills and overall program success. Professional development opportunities will also enhance the educational benefit to the students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has strong collaboration and support from local universities and industry, a commitment from industry for internships, and support from political leaders. Project partners include Morgan State University, Capitol College, Carnegie Mellon University, Lockheed Martin, Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric, Amtek Company, and Juxtopia LLC. The demographic data support the project's objective of increasing African American enrollment in the engineering technology related programs. The project's strong advising and mentoring programs and family involvement should contribute to retention and success. The project will contribute to broadening participation of underrepresented groups and producing a highly-qualified workforce in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

More than 50 students the project supported successfully completed prestigious STEM internships during the funding period. Some most recent highlights are as follows:  One BCCC ET Scholar successfully completed Johns Hopkins Research Experience for Undergraduates in Computational; Sensing and Medical Robotics 2018 Summer Internship Program. One BCCC ET Scholar successfully completed 2018 Summer Internship Program at Johns Hopkins University Talent Acquisition Department. One BCCC ET Scholar successfully completed the internship of 2018 NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program on Smart UAVs at Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama. Six (6) BCCC ET Scholars successfully completed NASA Goddard Space Flight Center 2018 Summer Internship.    The project team helped more than twenty (20) ET scholars find good full time engineering related jobs at various STEM companies through BCCC/Employer Partnership developed in the S-STEM project.  3. Community Outreach Effort includes BCCC STEM community Day, in-city recruitment activities, sponsoring BCPSS Robotics team, serving as STEM advisory board member at local community centers, etc.  4.      Faculty/Staff Professional Development  The project sponsored or help sponsored two professional development activities for BCCC faculty and staff.  5.
