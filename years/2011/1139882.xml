<AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to secure travel support for the seventh ACM/IEEE Symposium on&lt;br/&gt;Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), which will be held in Brooklyn, NY (Oct. 3-4, 2011). Specifically, the PI?s interest is in providing travel support to ANCS for students. The ANCS conference has been created to provide a top tier venue to bring together researchers from the areas of computer systems architecture and networking systems, in order to foster greater collaboration between these increasingly related research areas.&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to offer up to 15 NSF-sponsored student travel grants for a total budget of $15,250. Applications will be solicited via email mailing lists, personal contacts, and the conference web site. The selection process will consider the applicant?s level of participation in ANCS, followed by how closely the student?s research interests match areas covered by ANCS.</AbstractNarration>
