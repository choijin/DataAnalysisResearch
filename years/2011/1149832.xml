<AbstractNarration>The ability to communicate and readily access information helps make possible positive social and political change. The Internet's effects on developing nations' educational, economic, and governmental institutions have been well explored by social scientists and technical experts. However, in unfortunately many instances, undemocratic governments monitor and censor Internet communication to attempt to control their populations. Although there are a number of existing technologies that support private communication in the presence of a restricted adversary who controls only a fraction of the network and has limited resources, we currently lack solutions that enable anonymous communication when the network is fully controlled by a nation-state adversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops methods of providing unfiltered, anonymous, and high performance Internet access, even in the presence of strong nation-state adversaries. The project (i) investigates methods of improving connectivity in heavily regulated networks using novel hidden channels, (ii) improves the resilience of anonymity networks to denial-of-service attacks, (iii) introduces techniques for detecting suspicious behavior in anonymity networks, and (iv) enables high performance anonymous messaging through the development of novel anonymity protocols and algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's themes of privacy and security have been integrated into security courses developed for Georgetown's newly established Ph.D. program. More broadly, the project benefits society by improving the ability to privately access information, even in networks controlled by oppressive governments. The project will increase the participation of groups whose ability to communicate is currently muted, and will provide unfettered Internet access to regions in which free communication would otherwise be unavailable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The ability to communicate and readily access information helps make possible positive social and political change. The Internet?s effects on developing nations? educational, medical, economic, and governmental institutions have been well explored by social scientists and technical experts. However, in unfortunately many instances, undemocratic governments monitor and censor Internet communication to attempt to control their populations. This project developed methods of providing unfiltered, anonymous, and high performance Internet access in networks that are controlled by nation-state adversaries. In particular, this project constituted a multifaceted research program organized into three main research thrusts: (1) methods for achieving connectivity (i.e., Internet access) in areas that are subject to various degrees of blocking and/or censorship; (2) techniques to improve the resilience of anonymity networks to attacks from nation-state adversaries; and (3) methods for achieving high performance anonymous messaging.     Major research results, coinciding with the above three research thrusts, include: the development of techniques for measuring with provable security and privacy guarantees how users behave in anonymity system; quantification of the risks of network-level routing attacks against anonymity networks, and the construction of defenses that thwart such attacks; the development of privacy-preserving routing protocols to efficiently route messages on human-to-human (HumaNets) networks without relying on any centralized infrastructure; and improved scheduling algorithms to reduce congestion and increase the performance of anonymity networks.  Overall, the research results have contributed to more than 30 peer-review articles.    The project?s broader impacts include benefitting society by improving the ability to privately access information, even in networks controlled by oppressive governments. Results from this project increase the participation of groups whose ability to communicate is currently muted, and enhance the infrastructure for education by providing unfettered Internet access to regions in which free communication is otherwise unavailable.    The project also led to four PhD theses at Georgetown University, two of which have been defended and two of which are in preparation.    Peer-reviewed papers, free and open-source code, and code documentation for the various research activities developed as part of this project are available for download at https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/projects/.
