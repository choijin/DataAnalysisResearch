<AbstractNarration>Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, a Hispanic Serving Institution of approximately 5,300 students, is increasing the quantity, quality, and diversity of students successfully earning engineering baccalaureate degrees by augmenting progress from a prior STEP award.  The project is being initiated in civil and mechanical engineering departments and is expanding into the chemical and environmental engineering departments.   Specific objectives of this 5-year project are:  (i) infusing concepts of the design process across all four levels of the engineering undergraduate curriculum; (ii) increasing first-year, second-year, and third-year retention of engineering undergraduate students to 78%, 68%, and 62% respectively; and (iii) increasing the six-year engineering undergraduate graduation rate from 44% to 54%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first new endeavor is engaging students in design experiences throughout their undergraduate academic careers.  Freshman are experiencing the design process in a fundamental and structured way that is then aligned vertically to experiences in their sophomore and junior years.  The university's annual engineering design competition is expanding to include the work of lower division students.  To enhance student retention and persistence to graduation, the senior capstone design experiences are linked to the university's engineering innovation laboratory for access to authentic, real-world, industry projects.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second new endeavor is an innovative configuration of cascaded peer-mentoring, wherein undergraduate seniors are mentoring juniors, juniors are mentoring sophomores, and sophomores are mentoring freshmen.  These peer mentors, after being selected via a formal application process and participating in a training workshop, are engaging with students around the design projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, overseen by internal and external advisory boards, is advancing knowledge of effective practices on retention of Hispanic engineering students.  Faculty are more deliberately connecting undergraduate education and practice to relevant design experiences linked to industry problems or concerns, with particular attention to those of likely impact on the largely Hispanic public of the region and state of Texas.  The project is conducting a thorough assessment and is nationally disseminating their practices and findings.</AbstractNarration>

The CASCADE spanned over 12 semesters and infused concepts of the design process across all four levels of the undergraduate engineering curriculum, in four different disciplines that are Architectural Engineering, Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering.&nbsp; &nbsp;As part of the learning objectives, the design projects were integrated with 16 different courses and were offered up to 10 times in some of these courses.&nbsp; These repeated offerings provided an evolutionary frame for these design projects to mature in the classes integrated and for the faculty members to master conducting them.&nbsp; The results of the project showed that peer-to-peer mentoring was highly effective when carrying out design projects.&nbsp; Appreciable interest was also noticed among female students volunteering to carry out the mentoring processes and helping different student groups from the subsequent classes succeed in their engineering projects.&nbsp; Female students participating in the projects seemed to continue their studies with more consistency as they built the essential cohorts, which are proven to help students through the engineering degree.&nbsp; Students' knowledge and skills of the design process improved significantly, as reported through multiple measurement instruments.&nbsp; The project CASCADE helped in constituting an institutionalized frame that includes design projects in a cascaded arrangement across all-levels of the engineering curriculum.&nbsp; It also helped educate and train many faculty members on integrating experiential learning, particularly design projects, and manage it for optimal student benefit and an improved educational experience.&nbsp; Results of project CASCADE have also shown that the targeted retention rates for students who went through the CASCADE experience have met and exceeded the levels set out at the inception of the project.&nbsp; By the time the courses integrated the design projects as part of the educational process and the effect of these activities covered all levels, which matches four years after project CASCADE started, the retention rates reached 80%, 70%, and 65% for the first year, second year, and third-year students, respectively.&nbsp; Moreover, the 6-year graduation rate passed the 55% limit.&nbsp; Additionally, engineering students in the participating disciplines formulated essential cohorts, which helped them go through engineering and graduate with the same demographic composition that started each semester, not losing any of its components.&nbsp; Faculty thought that students developed and improved their soft skills like communication and teamwork while gaining knowledge and skills in the design process.&nbsp; At this time, the project CASCADE has instituted, as part of the culture, the idea of having design projects in every engineering level and has encouraged faculty who did not participate at the beginning to try this experience.&nbsp; Furthermore, the CASCADE experience motivated students to be mentors in the subsequent classes and develop leadership and management skills at different levels.&nbsp; Finally, the CASCADE experience is one of the few that investigated the effect of evidence-based educational interventions aiming at increasing retention and graduation rates in engineering vertically through eight years of execution.&nbsp; Assessing the results of this project includes many lessons to learn and ideas to improve.&nbsp; The overall conclusions will be presented in publications planned out of this project in the upcoming year.<br /><br /></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Selahattin&nbsp;Ozcelik</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1161291/1161291_10215487_1608473341802_ImageswithOutcomesreport-NSF_Page_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1161291/1161291_10215487_1608473341802_ImageswithOutcomesreport-NSF_Page_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CASCADE 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1161291/1161291_10215487_1608473341802_ImageswithOutcomesreport-NSF_Page_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CASCADE 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Included</div> <div class="imageCredit">Authors</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Selahattin&nbsp;Ozcelik</div> <div class="imageTitle">CASCADE 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1161291/1161291_10215487_1608473403705_ImageswithOutcomesreport-NSF_Page_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1161291/1161291_10215487_1608473403705_ImageswithOutcomesreport-NSF_Page_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CASCADE 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1161291/1161291_10215487_1608473403705_ImageswithOutcomesreport-NSF_Page_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CASCADE 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Included</div> <div class="imageCredit">Authors</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Selahattin&nbsp;Ozcelik</div> <div class="imageTitle">CASCADE 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1161291/1161291_10215487_1608473477720_ImageswithOutcomesreport-NSF_Page_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1161291/1161291_10215487_1608473477720_ImageswithOutcomesreport-NSF_Page_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CASCADE 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1161291/1161291_10215487_1608473477720_ImageswithOutcomesreport-NSF_Page_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CASCADE 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Included</div> <div class="imageCredit">Authors</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Selahattin&nbsp;Ozcelik</div> <div class="imageTitle">CASCADE 3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
