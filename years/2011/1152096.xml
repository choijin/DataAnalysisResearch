<AbstractNarration>Funds from this award will be used to support travel-related expenses for participants in a workshop on "Beyond the Standard Model in Nuclear Physics," to be held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, October 15-17, 2011.  The goal of the workshop is to initiate the development of a framework for interpreting low-energy tests of fundamental symmetries and studies of neutrino properties in nuclear physics in terms of possible physics beyond the Standard Model.  We anticipate that the workshop will lead to a journal publication as well as a website that provides updates to the interpretive framework.  Expected participation includes approximately 12-15 nonUW Madison researchers plus 8-10 UW Madison researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this workshop will be to enhance the visibility of the nuclear physics fundamental symmetries and neutrinos program in related fields of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology and to enhance the opportunities for training of junior researchers in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported a 3 day workshop held at U. Wisconsin-Madison in October 2011. The outcomes are     1. The participants are writing a series of review articles that will appear in a single issue of Progress in Nuclear and Particle Physics providing a framwork for the theoretical interpretation of nuclear physics studies of neutrinos and fundamental symmetries for physics beyond the Standard Model  2. The collaborators will develop a "living website" to update results reported in the review articles.  The topics include an introductory overview; studies of CP violation including electric dipole moments; neutral current studies; weak decays; tests of lepton flavor and number conservation; neutrino properties; neutrinos in cosmology; hadronic parity violation; and nuclear physics studies of dark matter.  Several new lines of research have also been initaited as a result of this effort.  The particular experimentals that will be addressed are searches for permanent electric dipole moments; parity violation in electron scattering and neutrino scattering studies; weak decays of nuclei, the neutron, pion, and leptons; neutrinoless double beta decay and searches for charged lepton flavor violation; neutrino mass and oscillation studies; results from astrophysical neutrino probes; studies of the strangeness conserving non-leptonic weak interaction with measurements of parity-violating hadronic reactions.
