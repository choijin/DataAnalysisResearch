<AbstractNarration>This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site provides a diverse group of promising students with a summer research experience in order to foster their intellectual growth as scientists and provide a stepping stone to a rewarding career at the intersection of social sciences and information technology, with a focus on incentive-centered design (ICD), an approach to designing systems in a way that aligns individual incentives with system goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will participate in research projects in several areas of ICD, including the design and implementation of trading agents for complex automated markets, behavioral experiments to understand the factors that motivate human behavior and test incentive mechanisms, the use of social motivators to promote healthy behaviors, and the analysis of strategic properties of all-pay auctions and crowdsourcing contests. REU students are fully integrated into a research group that matches their intellectual interests and work as independently as possible with faculty mentors who excel in supervising undergraduate research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This program aims to attract a diverse group of students to the newly emerging interdisciplinary field of incentive-centered design, thereby expanding the pool of students interested in research careers across multiple disciplines. The research work will be augmented by an extensive array of other educational and collegial activities that will allow students to view their research experience in a broader context, build a network of professional contacts, and develop professional skills in a scientific environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The School of Information at the University of Michigan is dedicated to furthering the goals of an REU site by creating an environment that fosters an excitement for research and interest in the field of information amongst undergraduates. Our intellectual focus is incentive-centered design (ICD), an approach to designing systems in a way that aligns individual incentives with the system goals.  The overall objective of the ICD REU program is to provide selected undergraduate students the opportunity to conduct summer research in some of the country?s leading information laboratories and groups.  The second goal is to provide an important building block for a rewarding long-term career in the fields of social sciences and information technology unified by the incentive-centered design approach.  A third goal is to attract a diverse group of students to the newly emerging interdisciplinary field of incentive-centered design. This in turn should encourage more students to apply for graduate work in a variety of scientific domains encompassed by this new field. This REU program gives special attention to attracting women and underrepresented minority students as well as students from institutions where research programs are limited. Partnerships with various UM organizations as well as our established relationship with Wayne State University, an inner-city university in the heart of Detroit, assisted us in this recruitment effort.
