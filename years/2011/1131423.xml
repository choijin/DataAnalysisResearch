<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to determine how elastic suspended loads affect the dynamic stability and energetic cost of locomotion using fundamental spring-mass models and an experimental robotic platform. The objective will be pursued by: investigating the effects of tuned elastically suspended loads by analyzing the dynamics of a double-sprung-mass vertical oscillator model, determining how a vertically elastically-suspended load affects the dynamic motion of a clock-torqued spring-mass model of locomotion, and determining how suspending loads affects the locomotion of a multi-legged robot. Dynamical systems modeling, analysis, and simulation will be the primary theoretical methods used throughout the project. Further, video capture and data acquisition of the power consumption in an experimental robot setup will be utilized. This work will focus on fundamental and general spring-mass models of locomotion along with a multi-legged hexapod (or quadruped) robot platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will enable advancement of robot, exoskeleton, and other load-carrying systems, and provide a greater understanding of the role elasticity plays in biology. Load-carrying systems, whether autonomous or directly attached to a human, can reduce the load for those conducting challenging or dangerous work. Example applications include load-carrying robots, exoskeletons, and devices to assist humans carrying load while walking or running. The results of this research will be disseminated and integrated with teaching through an interdisciplinary training course on biological and robotic locomotion and by including students in research activities. Demonstration of this research to K-12 students is expected to encourage greater participation in engineering, math, and science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Humans, animals, and some robots walk and run while carrying heavy loads.  This is a basic aspect of legged locomotion, where transport of the body and additional loads is a common activity.  Further, legged locomotion with heavy loads is associated with fatigue and injury risk.  This project focused on developing greater theory and understanding of legged locomotion, in order to more systematically explain previous experiments as well as provide predictive modeling frameworks for future research and development.  Intellectual Merit: Multiple intellectual contributions have been made spanning theory of legged locomotion, novel experiments, as well as development of mathematical models and experimental apparatus that may aid further research in this area.  More specifically, new theories and predictive models of legged locomotion with and without a suspended load have been developed and published.  This theoretical work provides the field with new understanding and predictive ability which can enable the development of testable hypotheses as well as new design concepts for assistive devices. Also, novel experiments have been conducted to test hypotheses of legged locomotion with and without suspended loads.   Broader Impacts: A concept for a handheld carrying suspension was inspired by the project and has gone on to be supported by an NSF I-Corps award.  Alos, a concept for a load carrying legged robot was developed and tested with potential application in the robotics industry.  To more broadly share knowledge, multiple talks have been given to share research to a range of audiences outside the field.
