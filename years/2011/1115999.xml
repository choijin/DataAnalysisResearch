<AbstractNarration>The Internet represents essential communication infrastructure that needs to be protected from malicious attacks. Many existing attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms have focused on the computers connected to the Internet rather than the network infrastructure itself. However, the network can also be attacked since modern network components use software and hardware components that can exhibit vulnerabilities that have not been previously studied. This project explores this new type of in-network attacks and develops a novel approach to providing fundamental security capabilities in networking hardware based on hardware monitoring techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this research are to significantly improve the understanding of emerging vulnerabilities in the Internet infrastructure and to develop a hardware monitoring system that can detect and stop an entire class of new attacks in order to maintain an operational Internet. This research on the design, implementation, and operation of protected router platforms is essential for the continued success of the Internet. In addition, this project integrates underrepresented minority and undergraduate students into research, develops instructional components, and contributes to workforce development through graduate student training.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Internet represents essential communication infrastructure that needs to be protected from malicious attacks. Many existing attacks (and corresponding defenses) focus on end-systems connected to the Internet. Our work we have shown that a new type of "in-network" attack may emerge by exploiting vulnerabilities in the packet processing systems of routers inside the network. This project designed, prototyped, and analyzed a novel approach to providing fundamental security capabilities in these packet processing systems that can defend against such attacks.  The main idea developed in our work was to expand packet processing systems to include monitoring subsystems that can verify correct operation. Since computer networks operate using well defined protocols, it is possible to define the "correct operation" of a system a priori. Using this information, a monitor can determine when a packet processor deviates from a sequence of operation that is considered to be correct or when a router deviates from its expected input/output behavior.  In this project, we designed such a monitoring system for a single-core processing system, for multi-core processing systems, and for use with multiple, dynamically-switched packet processing applications. We developed mechanisms for ensuring secure download of monitoring information. We have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the system on an FPGA-based prototype implementation.  As a result of this research, we have significantly improve our understanding of emerging vulnerabilities in the Internet infrastructure. The developed monitoring system presents an effective solution to defend against potential attacks and to maintain an operational network. The general research results and prototype implementation provide a basis for deploying secure packet processing system in next-generation networks.  Studying issues related to the design, implementation, and operation of protected router platforms is essential for the continued success of the Internet. Beyond the broad applicability of our research to the security of network infrastructure, this project has offered several undergraduate research projects and extensive graduate student training.
