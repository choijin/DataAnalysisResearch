<AbstractNarration>We are confronted with richer, more detailed and more forms of data than ever before. Eigen-analysis based techniques constitute a powerful class of algorithms for discovering statistical signatures in mountains of data. Such techniques are used widely for the detection, estimation and classification of weak signals in a variety of applications that span the breadth of science and engineering such as gene microarray analysis, and climate science among others. This research will uncover the fundamental limits of these techniques and develop new techniques that can tease out weaker signals from large, noisy datasets.  The results of this research will be disseminated broadly to advance relevant technology and clarify both advantages and limitations of eigen-analysis based dimensionality reduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eigen-analysis based dimensionality reduction techniques are ubiquitous in statistical signal processing and machine learning applications. Their popularity is due to a sound theoretical justification, near-optimal computational complexity and strong performance guarantees in regimes where the techniques are known to work well. This research will provide a deeper understanding of when eigen-analysis based dimensionality reduction techniques fail so that these limitations can be potentially overcome. The project focuses on high-dimensional, noisy settings and uses random matrix theory as an enabling mathematical tool in this endeavor. The informational limits developed will provide a principled way of comparing eigen-analysis based algorithms with other techniques, and allow for an objective quantification of any performance losses due to fast implementations, measured in terms of how weak the signal or statistical signature is that can be identified. The research is interdisciplinary - powerful, new tools from random matrix theory are used to prove theorems and establish sharp, asymptotic performance bounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Pattern discovery technologies are now widely used by scientists in many areas such as biological, social sciences and business analytics. Google's search engine is evidence that mathematically principled  algorithms can uncover patterns in mountains of dataset.       Eigen-analysis based dimensionality reduction techniques are ubiquitous in statistical signal processing and machine learning application for teasing out weak patterns in large, noisy datasets. Their popularity is due to a sound theoretical justification, near-optimal computational complexity and strong performance guarantees in regimes where the techniques are known to work well.  This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental limits of such eigen-analysis based techniques for detection, estimation, classification and inference.  By quantifying the limits of eigen-analysis based dimensionality reduction algorithms, our work can help prevent futile efforts and guide innovation toward the most significant challenges.  Specifically, the informational limits developed will provide a principled way of comparing eigen-analysis based algorithms with other techniques and allow for a objective quantification of any performance losses, measured in terms of how weak a signal or statistical signature can be identified, due to fast implementations.  By understanding when they fail, we get insights on how to improve their performance so they are able to tease weaker patterns from large, noisy datasets.  The new algorithms we have developed will facilitate the discovery of weaker signals than ever before. This will help reseachers in other ares discover weaker trends in Big Datasets and to use these to improve society (such as by developing better medical diagnostics)    The algorithms developed for increasing transmission of light through scattering media can enable the development of new optical diagnostic techniques for biological applications. The new algorithms for medical imaging can facilitate the development of better algorithms for lower-dose imaging.
