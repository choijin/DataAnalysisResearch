<AbstractNarration>This project is supporting two cohorts of outstanding mathematics and science teachers in the San Francisco Bay Area to become Master Teachers. The carefully organized structure of professional and leadership development activities is supporting a total of 30 teachers though a variety of experiences, including becoming a Teacher-in-Residence at UC Berkeley where the Master Teacher Fellows can take advanced courses in their discipline and engage in research on campus in mathematics, science or education. The project is building on the growing program that Cal Teach has created for teacher education of science, engineering and mathematics students at Berkeley, and on the strong partnerships that have been established with local school districts and with local research institutions. The Math for America-Berkeley (MfA-Berkeley) Program, along with Cal Teach, engages faculty from the STEM content areas as well as from the Graduate School of Education. This interdisciplinary approach to teacher preparation and professional support has been shown to be critical in the context of training secondary mathematics and science teachers for our nation's urban schools, where high quality teachers are severely lacking. The professional development, research, educational and leadership opportunities available within the program provide a unique avenue to develop a cadre of true Master Teachers who can lead the next generation of learning in the critical areas of mathematics and science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program has a focus on teaching in urban schools that are often under-served, and reinforces the beliefs that every student has (1) the capacity to learn both introductory and advanced mathematics and science, (2) the right to a quality education that supports their learning, and (3) the need for literacy in mathematics, science and technology so that they have access to every opportunity that society can provide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Launched in 2010, Math for America (MfA) Berkeley's 5-year structured professional development program directly supported 29 dedicated math and science teachers in California public urban schools to become Master Teachers and leaders within their schools and districts through the 2018-19 academic year. The program has provided a structured professional development environment within which promising STEM teachers strengthened their math and science teaching effectiveness and gained important leadership training and experience.  Program activities for each Master Teacher over the 5-year period began with a focus on research and individual practice, then evolved to a more outward looking stance in which teachers were provided opportunities to become effective mentors, coaches, professional development facilitators, and instructional leaders within their schools and districts. Master Teachers wrote annual proposals--guided and vetted by program leadership--that tailored individual professional development to meet their goals and the needs of their schools as they progressed through the program.  Program activities that focused on individual teacher development included (1) year-long teacher research projects or lesson study, in which teachers collected classroom data and systematically analyzed it to improve their own teaching practices, (2) regular meetings of small groups of teachers who shared and received feedback on ongoing successes and challenges of new classroom or leadership work they were doing, (3) National Board Certification, and (4) enrolling in subject area courses, engaging in STEM and science &amp; math educational research, and participating in math and science teacher training and certification at the University of California, Berkeley. Other program activities focused on leadership support for the entire MfA Berkeley Master Teacher Community, including periodic evening or weekend workshops with STEM education themes in which more experienced MfA fellows and graduates of the program were invited to be keynote speakers and break-out session facilitators focused on novel classroom or leadership ideas they had successfully implemented during the past academic year. Extensive program evaluation and research was done each year of the award by experienced external evaluators. Program data analyzed annually included MfA teacher interviews, focus groups, a final reflective report, and end-of-year surveys from participants and their administrators. Findings consistently suggested that the MfA Berkeley Master Teacher program was effective in achieving its goals: teachers reported that the variety of MfA-sponsored opportunities guided them to examine and shift their practices in significant and authentic ways that have had important implications for improving K-12 student learning, teacher quality and retention.  MfA Teachers themselves reported engaging in a variety of leadership activities as they advanced in the program, many of which were extensions or expansions of their previous year's work in the program.
