<AbstractNarration>This project team is collaborating with an urban school district to enable mathematics education majors to gain experiences teaching technology-rich mathematics lessons to inner-city students in a model classroom at the PI's institution. Existing mathematics methods courses are being restructured to emphasize applying the course content within the context of preparing and teaching lessons to students visiting from the local school district. The intellectual merit of the project rests on three components: 1) providing undergraduates early experiences in teaching diverse student populations; 2) linking mathematics education theory with practice; and 3) promoting effective use of technology to advance mathematical reasoning and sense making in students. In addition, the investigating team is examining the impact of the restructured courses and model technology classroom on: i) the beliefs of the undergraduate mathematics education students about teaching in an urban setting, ii) their knowledge of technology and implementation strategies, and iii) their ability to link educational theories and classroom practices. The publication and presentation of findings from this work are contributing to the project's broader impacts by informing other undergraduate education programs and providing a model for how to provide preservice teachers with early, authentic experiences teaching with technology. Moreover, the participating students in the Erie School District are benefitting from engaging mathematics lessons and opportunities to visit a college campus. Finally, collaborating teachers in the local school districts are gaining valuable in-service professional development through their exposure to effective examples of implementations of technology-enriched mathematics lessons.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report - NSF Grant #1140443  Integrating Technology-Rich Instruction of Urban Students into the Secondary-Education Mathematics Curriculum  09/01/2012-08/31/2016  Objectives  The primary goal of this project was to improve the level of preparation of new middle and high school math teachers for teaching in an urban setting.  A secondary goal was to provide professional development for experienced teachers aimed at providing rich learning experiences that promote a deep understanding of mathematics among students.  Accomplishments  Objective #1 - A model high school mathematics classroom was established on the campus of Penn State Behrend.  The classroom closely mirrors those found in local middle and high schools.  This provided a learning space for students studying to be middle and high school mathematics teachers.  A local urban school district brought a class of high school students to campus three times each semester for a total of four semesters to take part in lessons taught in the model classroom.  Undergraduate students in the Secondary Mathematics Education program prepared and taught the lessons as part of their coursework in two mathematics methods courses over two semesters.  Objective #2 - For each of two years, a cohort of local mathematics teachers participated in monthly evening professional development workshops aimed at helping teachers build lessons that foster a rich understanding of mathematical ideas.  The workshops featured a variety of speakers from the math education community.  A yearly conference was established as a means to provide an outlet for the teachers in this professional development to disseminate their own ideas for engaging students in the math classroom.  Evidence of Meeting Objectives  Objective #1  A model high school mathematics classroom was established on the campus of Penn State Behrend.  This classroom is set up to promote collaborative learning, is equipped with classroom technology and manipulatives, and has a classroom capture system for video recording lessons.  The mathematics methods curriculum was redesigned to incorporate the planning and teaching of three lessons each semester over two semesters.  Two cohorts completed the courses under the course redesign.  A total of twelve mathematics lessons were taught to visiting high school students over the course of the grant.  Each lesson was video recorded and was observed by a third-party observer who rated the lesson according to various criteria.  An Urban Seminar was designed to bring local K-12 teachers from an urban school district to campus for an evening seminar focused on helping undergraduate students majoring in education know what to expect from their experiences teaching in an urban school district.  A series of assignments completed by students over the course of their methods coursework is currently being analyzed to indicate the level of connectedness between the theory of their methods coursework and the practical application of teaching lessons to urban students in the model classroom.  A presentation on the curricular redesign and partnership with a local urban district was given at the AMTE Conference in February, 2015.  A second presentation on the outcomes of the research described above will be given at the AMTE Conference in February, 2017.  Two spring 2016 graduates of the Secondary Mathematics Education program have accepted full-time employment in the urban district with which the collaboration took place.  Objective #2  A total of 19 teachers completed the professional development workshops over the two-year period.  Each teacher designed a lesson aimed at engaging students in developing rich, conceptual understanding of mathematics.  The Best Practices in Teaching and Learning Mathematics conference has become and annual event bringing approximately 75 teachers to campus each year.  Keynote speakers have included Dan Meyer, Daniel Brahier, and Fran Arbaugh.  Broader Impact  Students from the local urban school district with which we collaborated benefit not only from engaging mathematics lessons, but from the opportunity to visit a college campus.  During their visits, we planned other engaging activities (e.g., campus tours, planetarium visits, etc.) and provided lunch at the college cafeteria.  Approximately 75 teachers attend the annual Best Practices in Teaching and Learning Mathematics Conference each year.  The 4th annual conference will be held in June 2017.  Students in the Elementary and Early Childhood Education program have also benefited from using the model classroom for their coursework and by participating in the Urban Seminar.
