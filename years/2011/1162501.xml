<AbstractNarration>This research characterizes the benefits of feedback in communication and develops techniques to achieve those benefits.  Today's communication systems seek to move information as rapidly as possible from transmitter to receiver.   This research involves using feedback (messages sent from the receiver back to the transmitter) to allow communication systems to approach the highest possible communication rate (the channel capacity) using less transmission time (latency) and lower-complexity decoding.  A key aspect of this research is the development of new error control codes and new techniques to use those codes to facilitate transmissions that approach capacity with much lower latency than systems that do not use feedback.  Broader impacts include training high school students through the UCLA Engineering (HSSEAS) High School Summer Research program and training undergraduates through the UCLA Engineering undergraduate research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional techniques approach capacity without feedback by using long block lengths and complex decoding.  However, information theory indicates that feedback permits capacity to be approached with shorter block lengths and simpler decoding.  This research employs a rate-compatible sphere-packing analysis to provide a quantitative analysis of the latency reduction possible with feedback.  This analysis provides decoding error trajectories that guide the development of rate-compatible code families needed to approach capacity with feedback.   Practical benefits of these rate-compatible code families with feedback will be characterized in the context of a typical wireless communication system operating in additive white Gaussian noise.  These techniques are extended to fading channels and higher-order modulations.  The overall goal of this research project is the development and promulgation of a fundamental understanding of how code families should be designed to work with feedback to achieve capacity with very short block lengths.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project explored how feedback can be used to improve the performance of communication systems. In the communication of information from a transmitter to a receiver (the forward channel), feedback is information sent from the receiver to the transmitter to aid in the reliability, efficiency, or performance of the forward channel communication.  A main outcome of this project is the development of theoretical analyses and practical tools that facilitate the use of feedback to allow communication on the forward channel at rates close to the theoretical limit of the Shannon capacity at short block lengths (fewer than 500 symbols). It is well known that without feedback much longer block lengths are required to approach the Shannon capacity.  Over the course of the project several schemes successfully demonstrated this ability to approach capacity at short block lengths.  Schemes involving rate-compatible convolutional and low-density parity-check codes (LDPC) were demonstrated in which an initial high-rate transmission is followed by subsequent transmissions of incremental redundancy until feedback indicates that the message has been successfully received.   Central to these approaches is the ability to determine the optimal length of the initial and subsequent transmissions.    A major outcome of this project is the development of the Sequential Differential Optimization (SDO) tool for determining these transmission lengths.  Another outcome of the project is the development of the reliability-output Viterbi algorithm (ROVA) that allows a receiver to determine whether a transmission is successful without the overhead of a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code.    The application of ROVA with tail-biting convolutional codes and transmission lengths designed using SDO achieved performance within 86% of the Shannon capacity of the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channel with an average block length of less than 150 symbols.  For receivers where the complexity of ROVA is prohibitive, the project developed a technique that designs the CRC code specifically for the target convolutional code to minimize the CRC overhead while still meeting the required reliability target.   Another outcome of the project was the development of a two-phase feedback scheme in which the receiver sends information back to the transmitter that is used by the transmitter to determine if the receiver has successfully decoded the message.   The two-phase scheme with tail-biting convolutional codes achieved 89% of the Shannon capacity of the BI-AWGN channel with an average block length less than 160 symbols.  Several important outcomes of this project provided specific codes that enabled the feedback systems to approach capacity.   This project introduced Protograph-based Raptor-like (PBRL) LDPC codes and demonstrated a family of rate-compatible PBRL codes that provided performance consistently close to Shannon capacity across a wide range of rates.   This project also provided a new family of rate-compatible non-binary LDPC codes in which the incremental redundancy used to achieve lower rates could is provided one bit at a time, with each such bit providing information about one of the original non-binary symbols.   This rate-compatible non-binary LDPC code along with transmission lengths designed using SDO performed within 93% of the Shannon capacity of the BI-AWGN channel  (0.65 dB from the Shannon limit) with an average block length of less than 500 symbols.  Another outcome of this project was the application of feedback to improve the performance of Flash memory systems. The read channel of a Flash memory cell degrades after repetitive program and erase (P/E) operations as a function of the cumulative effect of the charge written and erased from the cell.   Based on this model of degradation, the project used feedback to dynamically allocate voltage using lower-voltage write thresholds at the beginning of the device lifetime and increasing the thresholds as needed to maintain the mutual information of the read channel in the face of degradation.  The project introduced this technique in an idealized setting and then removed ideal assumptions about channel knowledge and available voltage resolution to conclude with a practical scheme with performance close to that of the idealized setting.  The project also explored the use of feedback in file synchronization, providing a practical protocol for synchronizing two files that differ in a potentially large number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions). Through a deft use of the carefully controlled feedback between the two file owners this protocol is able to synchronize the files with a communication cost that is order-optimal.  Use of properly designed feedback allows this protocol to consume the bandwidth that is only a fraction of what forward-channel-only methods such as rsync use.  Outcomes related to broader impacts include the mentoring of under-represented minority students though the RISE-UP engineering research program and a project team in the Introduction to Engineering Disciplines freshman seminar.  Additional broader impacts outcomes included a doctoral student exchange with a Mexican  university and several undergraduate research projects (two supported by an NSF REU).
