<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to generate a Uranium/Thorium (U/Th) dated record of rainfall in the southern tropical Pacific at sub-century (~50 year/sample) resolution for most of the glacial and Holocene periods using stalagmites from the island of Niue and from Tonga.  The speleothem from Niue dates to 83,000 years before the present.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the researchers will: 1) analyze the Niue specimen, as well as a Holocene-age stalagmite from Tonga, for Oxygen-18, Carbon-13, Magnesium/Calcium ratios, Strontium/Calcium ratios, and Barium/Calcium ratios; 2) generate a precise absolute-dated U/Th age model for the specimens; and 3) undertake drip-water sampling to validate paleoclimate interpretations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to examine the following hypotheses: a) at times of increased Thermohaline Circulation (THC), a northward shift of the Pacific Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) dominated over a westward shift in the Walker Cell resulting in decreased rainfall at Niue; and b) rainfall records at Niue will show rapid shifts in phase with Greenland ice-core records, but will also show additional changes characteristic of Antarctic temperature records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include the potential for a high-quality paleoclimate record from an important and under-studied region. In addition to the scientific importance and support of a graduate student, the researcher will conduct outreach through a NSF-sponsored program through which high-school students and teachers from New Jersey participate in workshops on marine and climate science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In an era of unprecedented global warming, it has never been more important to understand our climate system. Rapid change may trigger fundamental shifts in the climate behavior, so it is essential that we study how the ocean and atmosphere might respond. Unfortunately, instrumental records are too short, and mathematical climate models are too uncertain, to provide this insight. Scientists therefore look to the past for clues.  The climate of the glacial period (110,000-12,000 years ago) was fundamentally unstable, and thus provides a natural laboratory of investigation of rapid change. Greenland was 8 &deg;C colder than present, but this chill was punctuated by rapid warming events (æDansgaard-OeschgerÆ or D/O Events) that disrupted global climate for 100s-1000s of years.  Our team investigated the impact of D/O events on the tropical South Pacific, an area nearly devoid of glacial climate records, by measuring chemical changes in a stalagmite from a cave on the island of Niue.  Our stalagmite began growing 83,000 years ago, early in the last ice age, and is was over a meter tall when collected.  By measuring isotope ratios of oxygen and carbon, and the concentrations of magnesium and strontium in the calcium carbonate rock that composes the stalagmite, we can estimate changes in past rainfall. Each tiny rock sample (we drilled out thousands of them) represents about a decade.  Other scientists have produced similar types of records, but often in continental areas under the influence of monsoon rainfall patterns, and never before in this marine region.  Our findings were startling: the tropical South Pacific clearly experienced multiple episodes of rapid rainfall change. For one period 37-45 thousand years ago, these changes were remarkably similar in timing to D/O Events recorded in Greenland ice cores, capturing the æsawtoothÆ shape of rapid onset followed by a gradual return to normal glacial conditions.  This indicates a very clear connection between Arctic climate and the tropical South Pacific, half a world away, that has never before been observed.  But our results also contained an unexpected twist: theory suggests that Niue should have been drier when Greenland was warm, but our data suggest the opposite.  We believe that we are seeing a previously unrecognized shift in the huge belt of tropical rainfall that dominates the South Pacific. This oblong band of rain, called the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), may have resided north of Niue during most of the glacial, but rotated southwards (closer to its modern-day position) during the rapid Greenland warming, bringing rain to the island.  Our data analyses are continuing, but this important finding gives a unique and unprecedented window into South Pacific climate during the last glacial period.  In order to better interpret the connection between rainfall and the chemical composition of our stalagmite, we carried out a 2-year continuous monitoring study of the dripwater feeding our specimen and the atmosphere of the cave in which it grew.  Because the site is so remote, we had to custom design battery-powered automated sampling and sensing equipment.  Amazingly, this all worked very well, and we recently published our study outlining the mechanisms controlling the isotopic and elemental composition of the dripwater, and hence the stalagmite that precipitates layer by layer as these drops fall to the cave floor.  In a nutshell, the results tell us that the action happens above the cave: when rainfall slows, air pockets form in the cracks of the rocks overhead, allowing some calcium carbonate to deposit before reaching the stalagmite.  This alters the composition of the dripwater, leading to the chemical variations in each layer of our stalagmite.  Our island site also experiences some unique chemistry &ndash; unlike continental caves, seasalt transported by storm winds has a strong influence on the composition of the dripwater, and we must take this into accoun...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
