<AbstractNarration>This award by the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense's (DOD) "Awards to Stimulate and Support Undergraduate Research Experiences" (ASSURE) Program will support a 10-week summer research program in chemistry for eleven students. Each REU student will join an active research group and carry out a project that facilitates visualization and manipulation of processes at the molecular level, with research topics spanning all modern chemistry disciplines. In addition to the faculty advisor, each REU student will work closely with a designated graduate student mentor who will facilitate their integration into the research group and serve as a role model. Students' progress will be evaluated using quantitative formative/summative assessment and long-term data tracking. The proposed program will broadly impact a diverse range of students by exposing them to cutting edge chemical research and encouraging them to pursue a career in fields of science and engineering. It will place strong emphasis on mentoring underrepresented minorities and women, and will work closely with local Primarily Undergraduate Institutions to recruit minority participants. Achievements of the REU participants and the program will be advertised to the broader community via peer-reviewed publications, scientific meeting presentations, and other forums (e.g. USC Chemistry REU Facebook page). The NSF-funded REU program will also serve as the engine for leading a variety of research/educational programs for undergraduates and high-school students, such as an institutionally-supported international REU program, thus impacting undergraduate research and education both nationally and internationally. Overall, the program will contribute to the development of a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce.</AbstractNarration>
