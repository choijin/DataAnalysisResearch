<AbstractNarration>This project provides general and organic chemistry students with hands-on education using single crystal X-ray crystallography (SC-XRD) at Lewis and Clark College and a consortium of three other campuses - George Fox University, Willamette University and the University of Portland. Curricular materials using SC-XRD to analyze samples and determine accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, are designed, implemented, evaluated and diseminated. SC-XRD is an emerging topic in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum and this projects helps to fill a gap in available curricular materials. Faculty members from participating campuses participate in workshops where they both refine their skills using the instrumentation and develop the new teaching materials. Structural information is available to other institutions through online data sharing. Curricular materials and evaluation outcomes are disseminated through a sponsored regional meeting, project web site and publications. Evaluation of the technical component of developed materials is performed by an experienced crystallographer, while evaluation of the faculty professional development and the project's impact on student attitudes and learning outcomes, is performed by a faculty member from the Lewis and Clark Graduate School of Education and Counseling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Prior to this TUES award single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) was not part of the College curriculum even though this technique has played a crucial role in the biological and chemical sciences.  As such there were no hands-on experiments in SC-XRD in this College or in neighboring institutions.  This TUES award provided funds for the purchase of a benchtop SC-XRD and the development/piloting of new labs in general, organic and inorganic chemistry.  The unique feature of this award is the intentional targeting of first and second year courses for SC-XRD labs.  Most laboratory courses using SC-XRD target upper division students in their third and fourth year of college.  The broader impact of this reward is that it affects the high-enrollment lower division chemistry courses. Specifically, ~80-90 students take the second semester of general chemistry and the last four weeks of the term is devoted to group projects.  At any one time 25-30 general chemistry students elect to undertake an SC-XRD group project; now this technique is a mainstay of the general chemistry laboratory curriculum in the second semester.  The second-year organic chemistry lab has a pericyclic lab that yielded crystals for SC-XRD analysis.  In conjunction with our media services we printed 3-D models of molecules used for this particular reaction; 3-D printing is part of a teaching tool in the chemistry curriculum that was spurred by this award.  Third-year chemistry majors take a semester-long inorganic chemistry lab and now there are at least two synthetic projects that entail crystal growth followed by SC-XRD analysis.  The experiments in the third year course and the use of 3-D printing (i.e. select crystal structures were converted to 3-D models for lab instruction) go beyond the scope of the original proposal.  In connection with the broader impacts of this award, a collaboration with the math department was cultivated through this award.  Elements of SC-XRD have principles in linear algebra and vector calculus, and crystallographic data were used in several class and homework assignments in the college?s linear algebra and calculus III classes.  This effort was not part of the original TUES proposal and portions of it were funded from an internal college grant.  Another extension of this award was the incorporation of concept maps into the general chemistry lab curriculum.  This originated from one of the outside consultants for this award who is an expert in concept map pedagogy; he strongly advocated it as part of the project labs in the second semester of general chemistry lab and we are even using concept maps in the second year organic chemistry course.  Again, these broader impacts extended the scope of the original proposal  Finally several workshops were hosted that included a four-college consortium (U. Portland, Willamette University, George Fox and Lewis &amp; Clark College) dedicated towards sharing ideas and teaching labs for SC-XRD analysis.  One specific lab has been incorporated into the Willamette University (WU) general chemistry laboratory course; crystallographic analysis was carried out at Lewis &amp; Clark and results shared with the WU students.  In addition one upper division (3rd year lab course) SC-XRD laboratory exercise was shared with the chemistry department of Harvey Mudd College; this went beyond the original scope of the proposal.
