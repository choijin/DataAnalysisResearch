<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The cells of complex organisms contain a diverse array of discrete functional units called organelles.  These compartments carry out essential cell activities and are broadly conserved within and between species.  Lysosomes, one type of organelle found within nearly all plant and animal cells, function as major sites of degradation.  Interestingly, in many cell types, lysosome-related organelles (LROs) co-exist with conventional degradative lysosomes due to the activity of specific pathways mediating the formation of LROs.  However, most of the known factors that mediate LRO formation also function in the construction of lysosomes, raising the question of what controls the specific formation of LROs.  A family of homologous Rab proteins, which generally act as switches to regulate the processes involved in moving material between organelles, have been identified that function in the formation of LROs but not conventional lysosomes.  This project explores the hypothesis that these Rabs control LRO-specific formation processes by investigating the activity of the GLO-1 Rab protein that functions in the construction of an LRO called the gut granule.  Gut granules are found within the intestinal cells of the model genetic organism C. elegans and are analogous to organelles in mammals that function in the synthesis/storage of substances mediating pigmentation and blood clotting.  Briefly, the research will identify the cellular site of GLO-1 function, the regulators of GLO-1 activity, and the processes controlled by GLO-1.  As GLO-1 is highly conserved, this research will provide important insights into the mechanisms mediating the formation of LROs in a diverse array of cells and organisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The research will involve 30 undergraduates a year in collaborative, investigative, and original research.  Undergraduate students working in the PI's research laboratory and upper division Cell Biology course (enrollment 24) will design, implement, interpret, and present the results of their experiments investigating the function of GLO-1 in LRO formation.  The PI will participate in HHMI and Miller Foundation supported initiatives at Lewis &amp; Clark College to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in science by mentoring the studies of LRO formation by local high school and community college students in the research lab.  Ultimately, this work will provide hands on scientific training for a large and diverse array of students, many of whom will progress on to careers in research and education</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work, completed over the past four years, has provided new insights into the mechanism by which lysosome-related organelles (LROs) are constructed.  LROs are cellular compartments that play important roles in the function of animal cells, for example being sites of pigment formation and functioning in blood clotting and lung performance.  Our work has developed C. elegans gut granules, which act in fat metabolism, metal storage, and the regulation of aging, as a model LRO whose formation can be studied in a simple system.  Defects in LRO formation compromises their function, which can significantly impair organism activity.   Due to the conservation in their pathways of construction, understanding gut granule biogenesis gives key information into how LROs are assembled in other organisms.   Over the past the 4 years, NSF funding has enabled productive studies of C. elegans mutants disrupting gut granule biogenesis.  This work has led to discovery that: (1) shows how defects in LRO formation results in mistrafficking of LRO components to conventional degradative lysosomes, (2) shows for the first time that a protein complex, which is conserved from yeast to humans, functions in the transport of cargo to LROs, (3) an ABC transporter plays a novel role in promoting the activation of the conserved LRO-associated Rab GTPase GLO-1, (4) implicates an unexpected role for a RHO-GEF in LRO biogenesis, and (5) a novel mechanism activates GLO-1 to promote LRO biogenesis.  All of the factors that we have been studying in C. elegans are conserved in multicellular animals, where they are likely to have similar functions.  Our work provides a deeper understanding of the genetic underpinnings that modulate the poorly understood, but highly conserved, pathway delivering cargo to LROs.    NSF funding has supported many talented students who are advancing their careers in science.  The outcomes of our work are described in 3 research manuscripts that were published with 14 different undergraduate co-authors.  In addition, 11 undergraduates presented their studies of LRO biogenesis at international research conferences.
