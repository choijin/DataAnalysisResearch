<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to increase the quantity and quality of American Indian students pursuing careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics by: 1) Developing and sustaining new STEM degree programs; 2) improving STEM instructional and research methods; and 3) building student capacity. The methods for accomplishing this objective will include: 1) Expanding curriculum, strengthening the Natural Science degree program, and developing an Associate in Science degree program in Natural Resources; 2) providing professional development opportunities for STEM faculty through workshops, conferences, and classes; and 3) increasing opportunities for student research, internships, workforce placement, and increased global awareness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaach Lake Tribal College will develop capacity to transform the way math and science is viewed on the reservation by promoting the integration of hands-on research activities and culturally infused STEM education that will greatly contribute to increasing the number of STEM graduates needed to meet local and national workforce demands.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to the creation and maintenance of an Environmental Awareness Website (Gidakiim.com) which includes global, national, regional and local examples of major environmental issues, an outdoor Lab was created in an area on campus which was planted in native grasses and fruiting shrubs.  Academic enhancements this grant period included the development of the Basic Computer Applications I (ITECH 100) course and integration of the use of the 3D printer successfully into curriculum, a hybrid General Biology I course, the redesign of Woodland Plants (FOR 110) based on faculties professional experience working with agency forest ecologists, the redesign of Wildlife Biology (BIO 130) and Survey and Measurement (FOR 240) prompted by input from DNR hiring managers and their identification of the need for a greater emphasis on "forest inventory techniques" by potential hires, and revived Computer Programming (ITECH 210) and Web Page Design (ITECH 270) classes.

During the grant period our institution experience great growth in our course offerings, research outcomes and internship opportunities. We currently have 31 students still enrolled within their degreed STEM program and have identified (and are addressing within this proposal) significant barriers that impact our students and the outcomes of their educational experience.
