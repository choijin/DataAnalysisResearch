<AbstractNarration>The Carroll University STEP Initiative (CUSI) addresses the shortage of engineers in Waukesha County, Wisconsin. A partnership between area high schools, universities, and industry, the project aims to increase student interest in STEM careers, particularly engineering, with a focus on attracting female students. CUSI strengthens existing programs involving recruitment, retention, and transition of graduates to engineering careers.  Recruitment is enhanced by way of partnerships, career guidance and job placement.  Retention is strengthened via learning communities, mentoring, and a program that provides hands-on learning opportunities and leadership development for pre-engineering students. Transition involves improved connections with local industry designed to increase graduates in the local workforce who are equipped with the necessary skills for continued success.  Evaluation of the project is largely based on successful increase in enrollment and graduates of the engineering program, as well as alumni activity beyond graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is to serve as a model for other small, private, liberal arts institutions to partner with area high schools and local industry to expand and strengthen STEM pathways, to encourage more students to pursue engineering careers, and to address local workforce shortages and the Nation's need for more STEM graduates.  Broader impacts include:  broadening participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields, enhancing collaborative infrastructure for education, and advancing discovery while promoting teaching and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination activities include presenting student projects to the broader community through annual engineering education exhibitions, and sharing project data and information via journals/publications and state/national conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF STEP DUE-1161204   Carroll University STEP Initiative - Engineering in Waukesha County  Project Outcomes  The heart of the Carroll University NSF STEP project involved hosting multiple "engineering camps" in summer.  Each camp involved having a group of about 18 Waukesha-area high school students (juniors and seniors) participate in activities that spanned a week, where these activities consisted of two primary experiences:  (1) participants visited area companies, meeting engineers and observing manufacture of product and/or design, and (2) in teams of size 3 or 4, worked on an engineering design projects, culminating in presenting developed design concepts to fellow participants and interested at-large community members.  The engineering teams were mentored by Carroll pre-engineering and applied physics students, with ultimate oversite being conducted by Carroll engineering and physics faculty.  In all, 182 unique students participated in the engineering projects and camps, with participant response (high school and Carroll) overwhelmingly positive.  Participants reported enhanced commitment to or increased interest in engineering as a profession.   Leading to stronger connections and support external to Carroll, the project has greatly improved standing of the university in the broader community.  In total, 17 different Waukesha-area companies donated to the project, and students from 10 different area high schools participated.  The project has helped multiply donations and internship opportunities from area companies, and has fostered synergistic activities between Carroll and area high schools (for example, faculty support to area PLTW programs).   Initially, the engineering experiences were semester-long, but we learned that high school students were too busy during a semester to commit to something that time consuming.  We thus moved to shorter experiences in summer, broadening impact.  In total, 11 summer engineering camps ran, with 149 total participants.
