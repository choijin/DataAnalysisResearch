<AbstractNarration>The digital age with its widespread availability of cheap computing power has transformed the way we search for information, distribute content and even navigate cities.  Computation has also transformed the way we design shapes.  Whereas in the past engineers and artists often sculpted objects from clay, today most shapes are designed virtually with computers.  Computer-aided design of curves, surfaces and volumetric functions has applications in diverse fields such as industrial design, the entertainment industry and even architectural design.  However, in all of these applications the designer is limited by the capabilities of the representations employed.  The quality and geometric properties of parametric surface representations such as NURBS and subdivision surfaces are strongly dependent on their parameterization.  Yet this is a degree of freedom that few designers use or understand.  Furthermore, the connection between parameterization and the geometric properties of these shapes is not well understood.  We currently have only rudimentary tools for controlling the parameterization of higher dimensional shapes such as surfaces or volumes.  The inability to control this parameterization leads to poor quality shapes and more effort on the part of designers to alleviate these artifacts.  In this project, the PI will explore new representations of surfaces and volumes that allow for more geometric freedom in creating the underlying shapes.   He will investigate the fundamental connection between parameterization and surface shape/quality for parametric curves, surfaces and volumes.  He will expand upon the concept of non-uniform parameterization of surfaces to show that knot spacing (edge lengths) is not sufficient to completely control the parameterization of surfaces or volumes.  And he will design new representations that allow the user to control or automatically adapt the parameterization of these shapes during the design process, and incorporate methods of non-uniform parameterization that are currently not possible.  As part of this process, he will develop new higher order barycentric coordinates specifically adapted to this problem.  Finally, he will investigate the effect and manipulation of parameterization for the purposes of tessellation and rendering of these parametric surfaces, and develop high quality GPU tessellation algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   Project outcomes will significantly advance the state of the art not only in computer graphics and geometric modeling, but also in other areas of applied mathematics and computer science where the representation and precise control of smooth freeform shapes play a key role.  Approximation theory, architectural design, the entertainment industry and industrial manufacturing will all benefit from the results of this research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported a wide variety of projects and explored geometric properties of curves and surfaces as well as their parameterizations.  We have developed new approaches to surface denoising from applications such as geometry cleaning from 3D scanning devices as well as new methods to help artists create 3D shapes that solve problems with existing tools that have lasted for decades. In addition, we have developed new optimization algorithms for building parameterizations of 3D shapes that are specialized to the problem and produce significant performance increases allowing for nearly realtime computation of complex bijective maps.  Our work on new geometric curve representations produced an intuitive representation for curves that avoids problems with loops and cusps that have plagued such curves for nearly four decades.  This work produces such intuitive control over these shapes that Adobe implemented the technique as part of their Illustrator and Photoshop software projects.  Initial usage data indicates that the new "curvature tool" has shown rapid and significant adoption over the traditional "pen tool" available in these products.  In addition, our work on filtering for graphics applications produced a software rasterizer of higher quality and several times faster than commerical methods commonly used in mapping software or even pdf viewers.  Our work with GPU filtering showed that it was possible to increase the quality of 3D images rendered by GPUs, which could lead to sharper images or faster 3D graphics through decreased image resolution required to maintain the same quality as graphics today.
