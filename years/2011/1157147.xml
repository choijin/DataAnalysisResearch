<AbstractNarration>The 46th Annual Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will be hosted by Rhodes College and la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). The conference will be held from Thursday March 22 to Saturday March 24, 2012 at UNAM university facilities in downtown Mexico City. Special sessions will be offered in Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory/Geometric Topology, Low-dimensional Topology  and Set-theoretic Topology, as well as six plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks covering the breadth of the special sessions. The conference is organized by the special session organizing committees, the conference steering committee, local organizers and the investigators on the grant. The grant provides funds to support travel for graduate students and young researchers, in addition to the invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The series of conferences is one of the longest running in mathematics. In the spring of 1967, the first conference was held at Arizona State University, and it was primarily a conference on general topology and continuum theory. In the past 45 years, the conference has grown in size and scope. It has continued to be the most important conference of the year in set-theoretic topology and continuum theory, while expanding to include the areas of dynamical systems, geometric group theory, and geometric topology. Over the years, the conference has made special efforts to broaden participation by women, underrepresented groups, graduate students, and young researchers, while expanding to cover a broader section of topology. Many of the most famous results of the last 45 years have been first announced at this conference. The conference proceedings will be published in the refereed journal Topology Proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website: http://www.matem.unam.mx/STDC2012/</AbstractNarration>
