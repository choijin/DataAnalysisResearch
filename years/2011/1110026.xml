<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division supports Professor Bruce S. Ault at the University of Cincinnati for studies of the reactions of organometallic precursors with ozone. This project is an experimental and theoretical study to enhance the overall understanding of the reaction mechanisms of ozone with a wide range of volatile organometallic precursors. These will include metal alkyls, metallocenes, metal carbonyls and metal acetylacetonate complexes. Thermal reactions will be used to generate initial intermediates, which will be trapped at low temperature by matrix isolation and characterized by spectroscopic and theoretical techniques. By employing several deposition techniques, the reaction time and thermal energy provided to the initial reactants will be varied in a systematic way. This provides a means to 'stop' the reaction at varying times after initiation, and will permit the trapping of different intermediates in the reactions. The identification of a sequence of intermediates will permit the development of a reaction mechanism. Since, very little is known about these reactions, an increased understanding will allow the development of routes to the oxidation of the metal-carbon bonds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reaction of ozone with volatile organometallic precursors has been used in recent years for the formation of metal oxide thin films on a variety of substrates. These thin films have applications ranging from solar energy conversion to the microelectronics industry. Understanding of the reaction mechanisms should enable the development of more effective thin film formation processes. A number of younger scientists, from early undergraduate research students through doctoral students will be engaged in this project where they can gain exposure to the excitement of research in chemistry. In addition, a strong linkage to the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program at the University of Cincinnati is in place, and will continue to assist in the development of female scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The reaction of ozone with volatile organometallic compounds has been used increasingly often in recent years for the formation of metal oxide thin films.  These thin films have important applications ranging from solar energy conversion to the microelectronics industry.  Surprisingly, very little was known about how these reactions occur, i.e. the mechanism of the reaction. Thus, a primary goal of this project was to enhance the overall understanding of the reaction mechanisms of ozone, O3, with a wide range of volatile organometallic species.  During the grant period, the Ault research group investigated the reaction of ozone with a number of organometallic compounds and found a greatly varying degree of reactivity.  Ultralow temperature techniques were employed, allowing the reaction to be stopped at different times prior to final product formation.  During the course of the funding period we learned the following:   The reaction of ozone with metal alkyls, particularly trimethyl metals, showed direct reactivity in the gas phase and led to the observation of several intermediate species.  The extent of reactivity (how fast and how much reaction) varied with the different metal centers.  Here, the pattern of variation was unexpected:  Ga &gt;  Al, In  and Cd &gt; Zn.     Metallocenes are "sandwich" compounds with a metal center sandwiched by two organic ring systems.  The gas phase reactivities of ferrocene (iron center) and ruthenocene (ruthenium center) with ozone were nearly zero, much lower than expected.  However, in the presence of any metal surface, reaction was very rapid and complete.  This indicates that the metal surface acts as a catalyst initially, and then as a substrate for the formation of the metal oxide material.     While the extent of gas phase reaction was very low, the systems ferrocene/ozone, ruthenocene/ozone and n-butylferrocene/ozone show extensive reaction upon exposure to low energy red light.  Spectroscopic evidence indicates that ozone forms a weak complex with the metallocene, activating the red absorption band of ozone.  Red light then releases an oxygen atom which attacks  the organic ring the metallocene, not the metal center.     The reaction of ozone with additional organometallic precursors, including metal acetylacetonate and metal amino species, unexpectedly led to no detectable reaction within the timescale of the experiment.    A second major goal of the project was to engage a range of undergraduate and graduate students, particularly from underrepresented groups in chemistry, in research and to inspire them to continue with careers in science.  To that end, five graduate students contributed in different ways to the project, four of whom are female (underrepresented in chemistry).  One has received her Ph.D., one has nearly completed her Ph.D. and one has received her M.S. degree.  Further, six undergraduate research students worked on aspects of the overall project, three of whom are female.  Several of these undergraduate students have continued on to graduate studies in chemistry.  Thus, the second major goal was achieved to a significant extent.
