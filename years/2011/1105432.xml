<AbstractNarration>Contact structures play a central role in 3- and 4-dimensional topology, in no small part due to its relationship with the various Floer homology theories - contact homology, Heegaard Floer homology, embedded contact homology, and Seiberg-Witten Floer homology - all of which have had spectacular applications over the last decade. The main goal of the PI's research program is to understand what happens to these Floer homology theories when we glue contact 3-manifolds with boundary. The cut-and-paste theory of contact structures in dimension three - developed by numerous authors including the PI - is expected to play  an important role.   As part of the program, the PI plans to study a certain category, called the contact category and constructed from contact structures, which is the "categorical glue" for gluing contact manifolds with boundary.  The PI, in joint work with Colin and Ghiggini, also plans to establish the equivalence of two of the Floer homology theories - Heegaard Floer homology and embedded contact homology - using the framework of open book decompositions due to Giroux; this can be interpreted as a gluing result for relative embedded contact homology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes a study of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces using a probe called a contact structure. The 3- and 4-dimensional spaces we study will locally be similar to the standard (Euclidean) 3- and 4-dimensional spaces. These objects may be very complicated globally, but a local observer cannot tell the difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a flat plane or a very large sphere. A more thorough mathematical understanding of contact structures should contribute significantly towards our understanding of 3- and 4-dimensional shapes, from the knotting of DNA at the microscopic level to the shape of the universe at the macroscopic level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The PI and his collaborators furthered the understanding of knots and 3- and 4-dimensional spaces which are  locally modeled on the standard (Euclidean) 3- and 4-dimensional spaces. These spaces can be very complicated globally, even though a local observer cannot tell the difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a flat plane or a very large sphere.   There are several well-known and very powerful invariants of knots and 3- and 4-dimensional spaces (i.e., certain numbers which can distinguish certain knots  etc. from one another): Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, Heegaard Floer homology, and embedded contact homology.  These invariants have been extremely effective at distinguishing knots, etc.  Heegaard Floer homology is the most combinatorial (i.e., can be calculated on the computer), embedded contact homology is related to dynamical systems, which is the study of trajectories of particles, and Seiberg-Witten Floer homology is most related to geometry, which is the study of shapes.   In the work just completed under the NSF grant, the PI and his collaborators established the equivalence of the three Floer homology theories.  More precisely, two out of the three (Seiberg-Witten Floer homology and embedded contact homology) had already been shown to be the same and our group showed the equivalence of Heegaard Floer homology and embedded contact homology. (There was another group which obtained the same result, using completely different methods.)   The PI has taken an active role mentoring students; in particular he has supervised a total of nine Ph.D. students during the award period.
