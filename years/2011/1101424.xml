<AbstractNarration>I propose to study the monodromy of Galois representations arising from cohomology, both to prove that it is generally as large as possible, and to use it to attack the inverse Galois problem for l-adic Lie groups. Such inverse problems are connected with deformation theory of Galois representations, and I propose also to investigate analogous problems in the deformation theory of representations of discrete 1-relator groups. Such representations are parametrized by the identity fiber of the word map associated to a given relation, and I propose further to study the geometry of such word maps more broadly, with applications to group theory.  In a different direction, I intend to study the inverse Galois problem for Mordell-Weil groups and related questions in field arithmetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are the possible types of symmetry in pure and applied mathematics.  In nature, groups very often arise in the study of "monodromy".  The idea of monodromy gives one a common framework for considering a wide range of apparently quite different questions.  For example: what happens to the solutions of a differential equation as they are followed around singular points back to their starting points? What are the possible symmetries of the number systems generated by coordinates of special points on curves?  What are the possible states of a quantum computer obtainable by a sequence of machine operations?  I propose to study groups, both to better understand their internal structure and, in the case of monodromy groups, to gain insight into the geometries and number systems which give rise to them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to better understand the interplay between group theory (the study of symmetry), and algebraic number theory (the study of number fields, that is, number systems generalizing the usual system of fractions). Forn number fields, there are two basic operations, addition and multiplication, from which we can define two additional operations, subtraction and division.  For groups (which are abstract symmetry types), there is one basic operation, composition of symmetries, from which we can deduce a second operation, inversion.    There is way of attaching a group, the absolute Galois group, to any number field K; it is the group of symmetries of all algebraic numbers which leave untouched the elements of K.  These groups are , incredibly complicated and are among the most mysterious objects in mathematics.  We try to probe them by finding geometric objects, algebraic varieties, on which they act.  But these actions are also incredibly complicated, so we linearize (look at the simplest part of) the problem by considering the action of Galois groups on the cohomology of the varieties, which somehow captures their large-scale geometry.  This program might seem very abstruse, but in fact it has been one of the major efforts in number theory over the last half century, attracting the attention of leading mathematicians, such as the Fields Medalists J-P.
