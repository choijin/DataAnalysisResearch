<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to quantify deformation across oceanic transform faults, which are places where two tectonic plates slide past each other. Because oceanic plates are difficult to study directly, the research portion of this proposal focuses on three field sites in New Caledonia, Cyprus, and Iceland where oceanic transforms are exposed on land. These sites were chosen because they also record transform deformation from different levels (mantle, mid-crust, and upper crust) of oceanic plates. Two techniques will be used to study each transform system: the collection of detailed field measurements and the development of quantitative models based on the field data. Both are common ways to examine transform fault deformation, although they are rarely used in tandem. Comparing field data to model results will be a feedback process, to refine model set-ups and explore which kinds of parameters are important for matching field observations. Ultimately, the results from all three sites will be synthesized to better understand the plate-scale patterns of transform fault deformation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research objectives of this study, the educational components of this CAREER project involve two age groups of students: college students from Carleton College and 13-to 15-year old girls from Northfield, Minnesota. The Carleton undergraduate students will be involved directly in research projects, forming interdisciplinary science teams for the structural analysis and modeling of each field site. The geology majors will complete field-based projects for senior theses, and other STEM students will be recruited for summer research experiences involving computational and modeling projects. A desired outcome of the project will be that STEM students will recognize geoscience as a possible career path following college. The middle-school students will participate in a summer program that will examine, among other topics, a local example of a transform fault that is part of the Midcontinent Rift system. Although the fault cannot be observed directly, it can be imaged using geophysical methods. The objective of this summer program is to increase the interest of young girls in the geosciences, and more broadly, in science in general. Overall, the project supports the research and educational program of an early career scientist, and contributes to the research infrastructure of undergraduate institution. Research results will be broadly disseminated in the peer reviewed scientific and education literature and by presentations at professional society meetings.</AbstractNarration>
