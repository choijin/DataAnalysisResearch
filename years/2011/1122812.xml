<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project is creating case-based, web-enabled educational hydrology modules that encapsulate real-world hydrologic systems. This project expands on the results of a Type I CCLI pilot study and grounds the learning experiences using three large-scale natural hydrologic systems (Coastal Louisiana, the Florida Everglades, and the Great Salt Lake Basin in Utah).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project leverages recent research advances on monitoring and modeling of complex natural systems and synthesizes them to develop a suite of flexible, adaptable web-based modules. The selected natural systems, each presenting some unique concepts and physical settings, contribute to redefining the teaching of hydrology by focusing on the dynamics of fundamental hydrologic processes and their connections to climate drivers, ecosystems' response, and water resources operational constraints.  An extensive set of interactive learning modules is being built into the system and is supported by an instructional interface, an instructor's guide, and a set of implementation and adaptation procedures. The project adopts an improvement-focused evaluation model with an iterative design process which includes multiple iterations of design, implementation, evaluation, and redesign. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: To facilitate wide dissemination and adaptability, the system is being implemented using open source geospatial web technologies and community-based tools for data publication and analysis. The architecture of the system supports the addition of future hydrologic applications developed by other members of the hydrologic educational community.  The participating institutions include a primarily African American institution, a college for women, a primarily Hispanic institution, and a minority high school. Through a design-based research approach, the project is identifying and implementing successful strategies so that the innovations can be scaled and adapted in diverse settings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the development of a website (http://hydroviz.org/Lessons/Index/UT) that provides a learning environment for students to learn the hydrology of flash flood proection in the Rocky Mountains of the USA.  Students learn better when actively engaged in the subject matter, and this website guides students through problem based learning exercises to help them learn the essential hydrology knowledge and skills required for the hydrologic design of flash flood protection.  The website developed as part of this project was one of several in the HydroViz learning system.  It uses the Logan Dry Canyon Detention basin as a real world case study.  Students are lead through activities to help them learn about: (1) Watershed properties; (2) Precipitation and surface water input; (3) Runoff generation; and (4) Design of a flood protection system.  Each of these are covered in a section in the module which includes the presentation of information and detailed steps to guide students through the associated learning activity.   The module leads students through the hydrologic engineering design process, introducing key concepts along the way. It begins by introducing students to the concept of a watershed and methods for determining watershed properties and precipitation inputs from US government sources. Then soil properties and the concepts involved in infiltration and runoff generation are introduced in support of methods for evaluating the design flood hydrograph. It concludes by introducing the use of computer models to examine alternative designs for the detention basin. Each section of the module uses active learning through hands-on activities that build the hydrologic knowledge needed to address the problem of flood protection.   Over the course of the project the module was used and evaluated in classes at Utah State University and the University of Louisiana.  Feedback from this use helped us make the final module better.    Figure 1 shows the initial web page on the website we developed, illustrating the use of Google map imagery to give students a sense of place and help with the context of their learning. Figure 2 is a snapshot of one of the website learning activity pages showing some of the elements included to promote active learning, including "check your understanding" pages, and video and other learning resources.
