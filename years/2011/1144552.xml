<AbstractNarration>The next generation of wireless sensor networks will monitor critical infrastructure, collect vital signs from patients, and disseminate medical and planning information during emergency responses. In contrast to earlier wireless sensor networks for which best-effort services were sufficient, such systems require predictable performance and high reliability. Failure to meet these requirements may have significant adverse effects. This project aims at the development of an engineering methodology for predictable wireless sensor networks. A predictable wireless sensor network is a system for which it is possible to check that its requirements are met under reasonable assumptions regarding its workload and network properties. This project enables the development of predictable wireless sensor networks by providing developers with analytical tools to characterize and optimize the performance of sensor network systems. The intllectual merit of the project includes: (i) Statistical methods for assessing the properties of wireless sensor networks and for provisioning resources to achieve robustness in spite of node failures or temporal variations; (ii) Novel transmission scheduling techniques that ensure a system meets its reliability and real-time requirements; (iii) A new schedulability analysis that bounds network capacity and message latencies under realistic interference models; and (iv) A wireless architecture that instantiates proposed transmission scheduling techniques and the schedulability analysis. In terms of broader impacts, this project will help advance our national capability to develop performance-critical wireless systems. The PIs will teach the developed design and analytical techniques as part of wireless sensor network curriculum and share them with the research community through tutorials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project invented new software and algorithms to achieve predictable and resilient wireless sensor networks.  The technical contributions include real-time scheduling theory and algorithms for wireless sensor networks, network protocols for low-power wireless communication in noisy residential environments, and software architecture that intelligently switches communication protocols based on application requirements and wireless conditions.    Furthermore, we developed predictable wireless sensor networks for real-world applications including a wireless vital sign monitoring system piloted in the Barnes-Jewish Hospital over a 14-month clinical trial involving 97 patients.  The system demonstrated for the first time large-scale clinical monitoring using wireless sensor networks.  We also studied wireless structural control systems to protect civil infrastructure in the event of earthquakes and other disasters.  Using the wireless cyber-physical simulator (WCPS) developed in this project, we studied wireless structural control for a multi-story building and a large bridge under realistic settings.  The case studies led to a new wireless control design that substantially improves structural control performance over wireless sensor networks.  The predictable wireless sensor network technology produced in this project will impact a broad range of emerging applications such as smart homes, smart health care and smart civil infrastructure that rely on wireless sensor networks.  The wireless cyber-physical simulator and the structural control case study have been released as open source, and the latter is used by the civil engineering community as benchmark problems for studying wireless structural control.  Reflecting the increasing attention on smart infrastructure, PI Chenyang Lu was interviewed in an IEEE Spectrum podcast entitled smart bridges, raising awareness of cyber-physical systems and wireless sensor network technology in the public.
