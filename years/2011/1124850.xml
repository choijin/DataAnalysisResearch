<AbstractNarration>This project is awarded under the Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond competition, with support by multiple Directorates and Divisions at the National Science Foundation as well as by the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative of the Semiconductor Research Corporation. This work is motivated by the vision of future computer chips with millions of cores, where each core has a complexity similar to early microprocessors. Furthermore, it is envisioned that computation in such systems might be done in an entirely new way, more akin to wave propagation in a brain-like network of processing elements. This work will identify wave-like non-Boolean computational primitives based on the spatial-temporal characteristics of such processor networks, and inspiration will be gained from known wave behavior in physics and applications derived from these. In addition, nanoelectronic systems will be explored where such wave-type excitations might find a natural implementation.  This research will identify, on the physical level, computational building blocks based on nanoelectronic structures with spatial-temporal wave-like dynamics, and on the computer science level, ways to perform computation with such non-Boolean primitives.  This interdisciplinary research, which spans the whole range from nanostructures to new paradigms for computing, will require a team with expertise that spans the whole range from physics to computer science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will lay the groundwork for a radically different approach to information processing, which is based on physics-inspired and brain-like wave behavior in large-scale arrays of nanoelectronic processing elements.  Specifically, our research will identify computational building blocks of future computing systems, along with the inherent state variables, where each computational task directly maps onto the underlying physical structure.  This project will also identify which information-processing tasks will find their natural implementation in such architectures. This proposed research is planned in synergy with the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRI) Nanoelectronics Research Initiative (NRI) and activities at the SRC-NRI Midwest Institute for Nanoelectronics Discovery (MIND).   In particular, this research will partner with Dr. George Bourianoff at Intel, who leads a study group on Ultra Low Power Application Specific Non-Boolean Systems, which is closely related to the research proposed here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work would impact the way information processing is done in future information-processing systems. This work will not merely lead to incremental improvements in information processing systems, but open the door to an entirely new approach to computer architecture.  Computation no longer will be based on elementary Boolean logic functions, but on physics-inspired and brain-like wave activity. This will necessitate a complete re-thinking of how computation is being done. As part of this research, graduate students will be educated and trained in this new way of thinking about how computation is done in a more brain-like fashion.  Building upon active REU and RET programs, undergraduates and teachers will participate in this work.  It is a stated goal to perform this research in an environment of maximum inclusivity of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we studied interactions of patterned magnetic media and established formal design methodologies for realizing circuits where information is processed (from device-to-device) via wave and field-based interactions.  Moreover, we have considered suitable architectures as well as alternative data/information representations in such systems such that energy-efficient information processing is possible within the constraints of a spin-based device architecture.  Specifically, our work focused on two main directions of spin-based information processing, namely (1) optically-inspired spin-wave computing, and (2) spin-based implementations of stochastic computing.   Regarding optically-inspired spin-wave-based computing, we performed an exploratory study on wave-based, interference-based and holographic computing algorithms. Using algorithmic concepts known from optical computing, we devised computing schemes based on coupled oscillators, electronic circuit blocks and spin waves, which could perform special-purpose computing tasks (such as image processing tasks) in a massively parallel way.  Spin waves emerged as the most promising wave propagation medium, as enabled by their short wavelength, low-power wave propagation, and did not require power hungry electronic components in the propagation media itself.  Studying the properties of spin waves and spin-wave-based processors led us to the recognition that a possible killer application for wave-based computing devices could be microwave signal processing. High-speed, real-time signal processing is doable by CMOS circuitry, but even few-transistor circuits consumes power in the several milliwatts range. We proposed a spin-wave-based microwave spectrum analyzer, which could possibly be orders of magnitude more power efficient. In the second phase of the NEB project microwave signal processing applications by spin waves became the focus of the work.  Regarding spin-based stochastic (SC) computing, we believe that SC systems are well-suited to different spin-based processing schemes. In SC systems, binary data is encoded into digitized probabilities as a means to reduce computation complexity and increase robustness. These stochastic numbers are then serially streamed through ordinary logic gates. As a result, complex operations such as multiplication can be reduced to a single logic gate (e.g., an AND gate). A stochastic representation of data has significant advantages in terms of error tolerance. When bit flips occur, the result is a mere fluctuation in the statistics of the stream, not a catastrophic error. Furthermore, the SC architecture could be pipelineable by nature &ndash; the first few bits from a module output provide a coarse estimate of the value; the next module can begin computing with these values immediately. As bit stream length increases, the precision of the value represented by it also increases. This allows a system to tradeoff precision with computation time.  When considering spin-based SC systems: (1) higher error rates in spin-based devices can be tolerated by SC architectures; (2) spin-based devices offer inherent pipelining and thus facilitate more efficient execution of SC architectures; (3) complex functions can be implemented in simple logic in SC architectures, while spin-based devices produce compact and energy efficient implementations of logic gates and shift registers; (4) spin-based devices can be particularly useful for realizing hardware functionality that is essential for an SC system (e.g., a random number generator).  Indeed, using nanomagnetic logic (NML) as an example, all fundamental compute kernels for an SC system (stochastic number generators (SNGs), counters for stochastic-to-digital conversion, adders and multipliers for stochastic hardware) were designed and tested (via simulation), and benchmarked against deterministic spin logic, as well as stochastic and deterministic CMOS logic for the same computational task.  (Not only did our benchmarking efforts suggest 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement versus other approaches in an area-energy-delay product benchmark, but this effort also seeded future benchmarking efforts where the impact of technology was considered in a unified, application-level context, and benchmarked against different algorithms/architectures.)  Additionally, we developed design flows to generate spin-based circuits.  Our machine learning-inspired approach leverages linear regression analysis to find functional/optimized layouts much more quickly than "trial and error" simulation methodologies that were typically employed to design spin-based logic, and enabled more systematic design efforts.  The Intellectual Merit of our work lies in creating the foundation of spin-based approaches to information processing and computing, both for optically-inspired spin-wave processing and spin-based stochastic computing.  The Broader Impacts of our work derive from the new technological possibilities presented by spin-wave-based computing and information processing. In particular, microwave systems would benefit from spin-wave implementations, where rather bulky microwave components could be replaced by chip-scale devices. In addition, both graduate and undergraduate students were trained in these new technologies.          Last Modified: 12/04/2017       Submitted by: Wolfgang Porod]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
