<AbstractNarration>OISE 11-57598&lt;br/&gt;David McNelis&lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides support for the PI and four colleagues to travel to Moscow and Arkhangelsk, Russia for research planning. The team will spend two days in Moscow meeting with colleagues at the Higher School of Economics (a State funded collaborator in this project). They will then proceed to Arkhangelsk for five days where they will meet with the Administration and Department Heads of the Northern Arctic Federal University (NArFU) to initiate the planning and logistics for long-term collaborative research programs in energy efficiency, biomass, and land-atmosphere methane exchange. These meetings will lay the foundation for follow-on interdisciplinary collaborative research proposals to be submitted to appropriate NSF disciplinary programs. The US team will also evaluate the feasibility of establishing a capstone program and field site at NArFU. The US team will examine laboratory facilities, field research sites, demonstration project facilities, appropriate mentors, and academic curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;NArFU in the Northern Arctic provides researchers from North Carolina access to resources that can significantly enhance an already strong research and educational program. This project will facilitate expansion of the program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from their existing well-established research program built around the climate in lower level latitudes to the climates of the far northern latitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a synergistic project that will provide the researchers and students from North Carolina a unique and worthwhile basis to expand their work on sustainability and the impacts of climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Arkhangelsk Oblast is a large research and industrial region in the arctic north-west of Russia that encompasses water and land areas about the size of France.  Due to its proximity to the Arctic Circle, the Oblast is experiencing earlier and more dramatic effects of climate change.  The retreating sea ice is opening new gateways into their rich natural resources (forestry, fishing, oil and gas reserves) leading to economic prosperity that could jeopardize the environment.  The increasing temperatures are also thawing the permafrost and breaking down its plant content .  This could potentially release methane gas at a rate that could significantly worsen the greenhouse gas balance on a global scale.  This dynamic setting presents a unique opportunity to study the impacts of climate change and to further sustainable energy and environmental research.    The Northern Arctic Federal University (NArFU) is the leading University in Arkhangelsk and has been designated by the Russian President as the "hub" for education and research on the Arctic. While NArFU's research is focused on the Russian Arctic, the energy and environmental topics are relevant to many regions in the United States given that the accelerated rate of environmental impacts presently unfolding in the Oblast will eventually be contextualized in other regions.  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) has developed a holistic roadmapping technique for its energy and environmental research which integrates technology, economics, and policy.   The invaluable Arctic climate change data and expertise at NArFU will complement and strengthen UNC's research approach.  Under NSF Grant No. 1157598, five researchers from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC)  traveled to Russia from September 8th to 18th, 2012 to collaborate with NArFU in the research areas of energy efficiency, biofuels, and monitoring methane release from thawing permafrost.  The UNC research team, led by Dr. David McNelis, met with representatives of Russia's Ministry of Natural Resources, Ministry of Energy, the Russian Academy of Science, and the Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Moscow to assess the quantity and availability of existing data, and  the expertise that will support the proposed research.  Although these entities are involved with various environmental projects, HSE' s advanced roadmapping experience and their working knowledge of the energy and economic policies of the Russian Federation is a direct correlation to UNC's research.  The team then traveled to the City of Arkhanglesk to meet with NArFU's heads of institutes, faculty, and researchers.  A series of meetings and mini symposia were conducted.  Each subsequent meeting was strategically designed to further refine the research areas, and to ultimately identify specific researchers/coordinators from each University who will partner to work out the logistics and be responsible for the development of follow-on proposals. The team also visited NArFU's campus, their ARKTIKA laboratory, and their Centre of Arctic Remote Sensing facility. Included was a tour of a privately owned sawmill where wastes from their woodworking operations were made into biofuels in the form of wood pellets and shipped to Europe.  An Energy Efficiency Center on the campus of NArFU has opened since the September visit.  This Center will provide much needed regional energy data that researchers from both Universities can use to better understand how climate change will affect energy and energy efficiency.    The Forestry Department of NArFU and their Remote Sensing Facility together will provide the operational and forestry inventory data to better assess the potential for various biofuel development scenarios.  Possible locations to monitor methane gas releases from permafrost degradation were identified by NArFU's Oil and Gas Institute.
