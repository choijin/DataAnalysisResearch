<AbstractNarration>The project addresses a variety of mathematical problems at the borderline of probability theory and statistical mechanics. The common feature of these is a relatively simple formulation, intriguing underlying phenomena and deep connections to physical disciplines. The first round of problems pertains to the Random Conductance Model. These include derivation of scaling limits of random walks in disordered media, study of spectral properties of random Laplacians, analysis of fluctuations of effective conductivity, detailed control of heat-kernel decay, etc. The second area proposed to investigate is that of Gradient Fields. These problems are ubiquitous in physical and applied sciences but their mathematical understanding is currently stalled because of the inability to overcome non-convexity of the underlying interaction. We offer specific methods and approaches how this obstacle may technically be overcome. The third class of problems addresses the area of Disordered Systems. The specific subjects of interest are random-field spin models and the dynamics governed by the parabolic Anderson model. Precise mathematical approaches are outlined that could lead to significant improvements in the mathematical understanding of these problems. A good many of listed problems are devised with the intention to provide training, and inclusion in research, of graduate students and postdocs who have interest in Probability Theory and Mathematical Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tremendous success of hard sciences in accurate description, modeling and even forecasting complex natural phenomena derives, in large part, from their foundation in rigorous mathematics. In the context of solid-state physics and material sciences, the mathematical methods most commonly used are those of probability and/or statistics. This comes as no surprise as these disciplines have been designed precisely to deal with systems involving large numbers of individual constituents. The present project studies three specific classes of problems in probability theory of large systems whose origin is rooted in physics of materials. The most pertinent general question we ask is how the structural details of materials, and their various inherent irregularities, exactly express themselves in their macroscopic properties. As a rule, we seek an enveloping principle, or a "physical law", that extracts, in quantitative or qualitative form, the essential features from the specifics. It is hoped that developing the theoretical foundations of such systems will eventually lead to significant advances in engineering applications. There is also an immediate impact for mathematics itself: analysis of complex phenomena inevitably involves a number of separate sub-disciplines of mathematics and will thus lead to fruitful exchange of ideas among them. The project naturally offers an opportunity to include graduate students and postdocs into the research environment at a top research US university.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is a fact of Nature that what appears smooth and regular to the eye of a human is often tremendously varied and very close to random at a molecular scale. An important goal for scientists is thus to develop a good understanding of how the erratic microscopic nature of materials integrates out into phenomena observed at the human scale. Probability theory has long had methods for dealing with such situations; these come in the form of precisely delineated limit theorems. The present project is another push in specific directions of this research; the central concept here is that of a scaling limit.  As is standard in mathematics and scientific modeling in general, our take on the problem is by way of a detailed analysis of very specific models. These are admittedly caricatures of what one would encounter in Nature, but hopefully ones that are still good enough to capture many relevant aspects of the problem at hand. Each specific model comes either directly from applied science or as processed via mathematics, after it has been identified as the next challenge to tackle by the experts in the field. In each of the problems we address, a precise mathematical question is formulated and a solution is presented in the form of a proof of a mathematical theorem.  The findings made under the auspices of this award include a precise description of asymptotic limit law for extreme values of highly correlated random fields, limit theory for spectra of random operators, scaling limits for random walks in random media, etc. The project thus advances the knowledge of general probability theory and, particularly, its aspects related to applied sciences.
