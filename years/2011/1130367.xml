<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB)  began explicitly including undergraduate research in their national meetings, with an undergraduate poster competition over fourteen years ago. Four years ago, with previous funding from NSF, this program was expanded to include an undergraduate and Primary Undergraduate Institution (PUI) faculty oral session. In the past three years, instead of an exclusive undergraduate research session, undergraduate students and faculty from PUIs have been integrated into the main scientific sessions, which have resulted in broader exposure of their work to a much larger audience. The goal of this proposal is for the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology to increase the visibility of high quality, outcome-oriented undergraduate research in the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology.  To do this, the Education and Professional Development Committee (EPD) of ASBMB, in collaboration with the Undergraduate Affiliates Network Committee (UAN) will organize the following at their national meeting in each of the next two years:&lt;br/&gt;* Select six faculty members+ per year, from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), to present their research in platform sessions at the annual national ASBMB meeting.&lt;br/&gt;* Select three undergraduates per year to present their research in platform sessions at the national ASBMB meeting and facilitation of maximal scientific understanding by undergraduates of sessions they attend.&lt;br/&gt;The location of the two events will be San Diego, CA for April 21-25, 2012 and Boston, MA in April 20-24, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The award will contribute to the professional development of the PUI faculty involved by providing them the opportunity to keep current with cutting edge science and allowing them to present their research and obtain feedback. The meeting will also enhance the science education of the undergraduates involved by increasing their knowledge and enhancing their oral communication skills. In addition, ASBMB will work to have a balance of underrepresented students and faculty represented at the two meetings. The ASBMB's track record in this area is strong with 54-71% of those invited, within the years 2007-2010, being women or underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
