<AbstractNarration>The combined effects of habitat disturbance and associated invasive species are perhaps the most important and pervasive threat to terrestrial biodiversity. Invasive animal species are typically associated with habitat disturbance, but the causes of this association are poorly understood. The experiments funded by this grant will use both the invasive fire ant and native U.S. ants as a model to dissect and identify the particular features of ant life history, such as habitat selection, that appear to adapt invasive ants to human-modified habitats and native ants to natural habitats. The experiments will thus determine how habitat disturbance favors the fire ant but not native ants. Because a large proportion of invasive species are favored by ecological disturbance, results will have great relevance to understanding invasive animals, will provide data necessary to model invasion dynamics, and may contribute to strategies for mitigating the negative effects of many invasive species.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has a significant educational component as it is ideally suited to training both undergraduate and graduate students in organismal biology and ecology.  Two graduate students from underrepresented groups and numerous undergraduates will be trained and actively involved in the research.  Results will also be used to increase local public awareness of the issue of invasive species and habitat disturbance, emphasizing the role, prevalence, and importance of ecological disturbance in our southeastern coastal plains forest, a national treasure of biodiversity. 'Research weekends' will be offered to middle and high school students in which they will learn about Florida longleaf pine forest ecology and engage in the research project. An interactive exhibit will also be installed in a local natural history museum.</AbstractNarration>

The grant required that Dr. King:  1) Conduct experiments that deepen our understanding of the factors shaping community assembly and whether those factors differ between exotic, invasive species and native species.  2) Publish the results of the field experiments (queen habitat selection and colony performance) and develop models that incorporate dispersal patterns (at the landscape scale) into to better understand the spead of fire ants in the context of landscape features.  3) Train undergraduates from under-represented groups in field, laboratory, and analytical approaches commonly used in the ecological sciences.  These objectives were accomplished.  Results were disseminated in 7 articles published in peer-review papers showing:  1) Queen ants obviously select habitat. Open sand habitat seems to be a popular site choice for most exotic species and some native species. Queens appear to distinguish favorable sites at scales as small as 1 meter by 1 meter.   2) Roadsides and mildly disturbed natural habitats may be functioning as an ecological trap for many native species, where queens disperse to these habitats but colonies fail.  3) Fire ant queens show strong preference for roadsides and open sand (devoid of vegetation).  4) Fire ants select open (devoid of vegetation) habitats because almost all colonies that are started under any conditions of shading or an intact native ant community, fail. Thus, abiotic (warm soil temperatures) and biotic (ant community composition) factors have likely selected for habitat selection behavior by queens.  5) Anthropogenic disturbance (clearing habitat of vegetation and simultaneously reducing or locally driving extinct native ant communities) and habitat selection behavior by queens likely work in combination to favor dominance of exotic species and failure of native species in anthropogenic habitats.  These results are the basis for transforming our understanding the ecological and conservation implications of the dispersal behavior of both native and exotic insect species with that have had widespread negative impacts on native species, human economic interests, and human health.

Understanding the spread and success of exotic species, particularly species like the fire ant that interact negatively with the general public (stinging) and agriculture (impacts on equipment, crops, livestock) is an outcome that has impacts beyond academia.

The potential technology transfer (non-toxic control of fire ants) has numerous applications in agriculture and in public spaces, thus positively impacting agricultural interests and the interest, health, and safety of the general public.  The project has provided laboratory and field training to 1 high school student, 13 undergraduates, 2 non-thesis MA students, 1 MA student , and training and support for 1 laboratory technician. Training included the design and execution of large-scale field projects, the natural history and ecology of ants (tracking mating flights and capturing and maintaining queens and colonies in the laboratory), data analysis, and write-up and presentation of results.  The high school student is now enrolled as a biology major undergraduate, 2 of the undergraduates are currently pursuing graduate degrees in ecology/entomology, the remainder of the undergraduates are either employed or enrolled in professional schools, 2 of the MA students are employed, and the third MA student is pursuing a PhD in disease ecology.  In sum, the support provided by this grant primarily provided a variety of learning and training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students, including students from underrepresented groups in ecological sciences. The training provided to some of these students resulted in their retention in science as evidenced by their continued enrollment in graduate school or employment as educators or in non-academic science careers.
