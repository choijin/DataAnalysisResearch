<AbstractNarration>This program is addressing the necessity of attracting under-represented students to the geosciences in order to maintain a robust national workforce for the future. Through collaboration between Tarrant County College District (TCCD), a community college, and the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), a research university, 20 under-represented students are being recruited and prepared for successful transition from a community college to a research university in order to complete a B.S. degree in the Geosciences. The students are being placed in a mentoring program with faculty and peer mentors who meet with the students regularly to review progress. Students are expected to successfully take introductory courses in geology, chemistry, biology, math and physics during their first two years, and take part in a summer program that consists of a field trip experience at the end of their first year and research experience with UTA faculty at the end of their second year. A course in Professional Development and Critical Thinking is included as part of the research experience. The project is being overseen by a PI-chaired Executive Committee that consists of faculty mentors, the Co-PI's, and representatives from the professional geoscience community in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Project evaluation is based on: 1) the ability to recruit at least 20 under-represented students, 2) the percentage retained while taking demanding courses, 3) the percentage at TCCD receiving an Associates of Science Degree, and 4) the percentage of students transferring to a research university in a geoscience B.S. program. If shown to be successful, this partnership can serve as a model for collaborating community colleges and research universities in other urban areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A workforce gap in the Geosciences between the supply of new university graduates and the job market demand has been recognized for a number of years, althought the supply and demand are more balanced in 2016 due to a temporary downsizing in the petroleum industry.
