<AbstractNarration>Sponges dramatically alter ecosystem water quality through the combination of extraordinary pumping rates and rapid, dynamic biogeochemical transformations. Sponge communities are ubiquitous in marine environments and can inhabit over 40% of the benthic area in tropical ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a research team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and the University of Washington will continue their ongoing investigations of the importance of sponge nitrogen (N) transformations and fluxes in coastal environments through quantifying their role in the N cycle of Florida Bay, specifically the importance of these dominant benthic organisms in meeting the N demands of primary producers throughout the Bay.  The team's previous research demonstrated that sponge dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) flux to overlying waters at Conch Reef, Florida Keys, was larger than any other benthic nitrogen (N) source.  In choosing Florida Bay as their study area, the team will benefit from the wealth of available data concerning N sources and recycling, including estimated values for new N inputs, and quantitative sponge benthic biomass. By performing in situ sponge N flux measurements they expect be able to contribute information about a potentially important recycled N source that has not previously been quantified in N budgets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this research is to establish the importance of sponge-mediated N cycling processes in Florida Bay where sponges are abundant, their biomass has been quantified at hundreds of stations and their key role in water filtration has been established, by quantifying rates and mechanisms of transformations of both dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen to DIN and N2 (nitrogen gas) by key sponge species, and elucidating controls on N2 production by natural factors such as sponge tissue dissolved oxygen concentrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Sponges play a crucial role in the nutrient balance of coastal environments because they are abundant in tropical, temperate and polar habitats, they process tremendous volumes of water, and many common species host abundant and active microbial populations. Their impact on biogeochemical cycling in most environments, however, remains largely unknown. During this study, graduate and undergraduate students and a postdoctoral fellow will learn in both laboratory and field settings a spectrum of state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation firsthand and, when the results are ultimately synthesized for publication, they will benefit from participation in the exchange of ideas with established researchers from diverse fields.</AbstractNarration>

The  quantification of these processes across environmental gradients further  suggests that sponges should play a significant role in most coastal  ecosystems, particularly where their populations dominate.  The proven  role of sponges in nitrogen cycling suggests that their contributions to  nutrient cycles should be incorporated into biogeochemical models for  sponge-rich ecosystems throughout the Caribbean and many other coastal  systems.  Our results are critical for ecosystem managers with the  Everglades National Park, where a  furthered understanding of internal estuarine processes is essential to  predicting the trajectory of ecosystem change, particularly in response  to anthropogenic disturbance.  The response of Mystery Basin to a harmful algal bloom during our project allowed us to determine how sponge-rich areas within  Florida Bay may respond to and possibly modulate recurring bloom  phenomena.  These results have implications for the management of the  now frequent occurrence of blooms in sponge-rich areas as the presence  of these organisms may not only apply top-down pressure regulating  cyanobacterial populations through normal filtration but their mortality under bloom conditions  may fuel explosive expansion of those populations.
