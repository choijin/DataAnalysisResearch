<AbstractNarration>Dr. Oka and his team study the properties of warm, diffuse gas in the Galactic center by measuring (H3)+ and CO infrared absorption towards the Central Molecular Zone. Protonated molecular hydrogen, (H3)+, is a tracer of the density, temperature, ionization rate, and volume filling factor of the large regions containing this molecular ion. It is also a tracer for other polyatomic molecules that are difficult to measure in the diffuse interstellar medium. The (H3)+ discovery and observations along 14 sight lines showed that warm diffuse gas (T about 250 K, density of 100-1000 particles per cubic centimeter) indicates the presence of a warm, diffuse component to the longer known components of dense-molecular, hot-ionized, and ultra-hot plasma. The researchers found that the volume filling factor of this gas appears to be very high, and the ionization rate for the warm diffuse gas an order of magnitude higher values for these sight lines near the Galactic Center than expected for these regions. The present work investigates more sight lines towards the Galactic center using new background stars that are selected from the Spitzer GLIMPSE (Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire) database and CO observations. The data are compared with new Herschel observations of (H2O)+ and radio and infrared spectra of CO to fully characterize the physical properties of the warm diffuse gas and the other components in the complex and dynamical regions at the Galactic center. This project trains a post-doctoral fellow in observational infrared astronomy and molecular astrophysics.</AbstractNarration>

In spite of violent high energy activities, the central 300 pc (~ 1000 light years) called The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) contains 1/10 of the entire molecular mass of the Milky Way in its scant 10-5 of the volume. This has allowed radio-astronomers to study the region in detail and extensively by molecular emissions. Recently we introduced a very powerful probe, the 4 &mu;m infrared spectrum of H3+ for studying the region.     99.9 % of elements in the Universe are H or He. Heavier elements like C, N, O, and others which make chemistry and biology so rich together constitute only 1/1000. Interstellar chemistry is hydrogen dominated chemistry. It is now known that more than half of H are molecular H2. H3+, in which a proton is attached to H2 in an equilateral triangle shape, is the third hydrogenic probe. It is produced from cosmic-ray ionization of H2 to H2+ and the reaction H2+H2+&rarr;H3++H. Cosmic rays being ubiquitous, H3+ exist everywhere H2 abound and act as the universal proton donor (acid), via the reaction H3++X&rarr;H2+HX+ initiating chains of reactions opening the way to many larger molecules which are essential for star formation.  In 1975 I decided to detect interstellar H3+ and discovered the laboratory infrared spectrum necessary for this purpose in 1980. After a long search we discovered interstellar H3+ in 1996. Soon after we uncovered a huge amount of H3+ in the GC and this initiated our long ranged studies of the CMZ. Starting from the 4m UKIRT and using four 8m telescopes we studied the brightest star GCS 3-2, and GCIRS 3 close to Sgr A*. The observations revealed a vast amount of previously unknown warm (T ~ 250 K) and diffuse gas (n &lt; 100 cm-3). We then observed 6 more stars from Sgr A* to 30 pc east and that exhausted previously known stars.  In 2008, we launched a project of finding bright stars with smooth continuum suitable for spectroscopy of H3+ to extend the range of observation 10 times from the central 30 pc to 300 pc.

Since then H3+ has been observed toward over 30 stars covering central 300 pc of the GC. The enormous amount of data thus obtained are being analyzed and summarized in two comprehensive papers. Preliminary results have been published in a review.     Our observations have radically changed the concept of the gas and conditions of the CMZ.  (1) Predominance of warm and diffuse gas. The revelation of a vast amount of warm and diffuse gas all through the central 300 pc has demonstrated that this new category of gas has the highest volume filling factor. This negates the picture held by some X-ray observers that the CMZ is dominated by ultra-hot (107 &ndash; 108 K) X-ray emitting plasma gas. This picture resulted from low spatial resolution of earlier X-ray telescopes and was resolved into many point sources by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. On another front, our observations indicates that the volume filling factor f = 0.1 of dense gas (n &ge; 104 cm-3) is a gross overestimate at least on the front side of the CMZ.     (2) High cosmic ray ionization rate. Unlike most molecules used in radioastronomy, H3+ is charged and its simple chemistry allows us to measure the cosmic ray ionization rate of H2. The rate thus obtained &zeta; &gt; 3  &times; 10-15 s-1 is more than 100 times higher than the c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
