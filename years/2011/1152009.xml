<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Terry Gullion of West Virginia University and his undergraduate and graduate student researchers will be supported to develop new solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods for measuring dipolar coupling between nuclei with spin = 1/2 and quadrupolar nuclei.  Careful measurement of the coupling between nuclei can yield accurate information on the distance between atoms in chemical materials.  Professor Gullion will do this through development of novel sample spinning methods in conjunction with the design and construction of new kinds of probes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an important physicochemical method that gives precise chemical and structural information.  The methods that Prof. Gullion and his student researchers will develop will enable scientists to measure inter-nuclear distances between nuclei that are difficult to deal with, experimentally.  The work has the potential to open up new vistas in biological and materials science where the kind of information that can be obtained from these types of experiments is critical in order to relate structure with function.  The undergraduate and graduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in building hardware for NMR experiments.  As part of this work, Prof. Gullion will also conduct workshops on NMR hardware (transmission line probe) construction for members of the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a powerful tool for chemical analysis and for determining molecular structures, and it is widely used in chemistry, structural biology, and materials science.  Nearly all of the atoms in the periodic table have nuclei with magnetic dipole moments, which makes them available for NMR experiments.  Two or more NMR active nuclei close together experience a dipole-dipole interaction that is strongly dependent on the distance between the nuclei.  Hence, measurement of the dipole-dipole interaction by NMR provides the molecular structure.  Development of NMR experiments and NMR hardware to measure dipole-dipole interactions involving quadrupolar nuclei in solids was the primary focus of this award.  Over the course of this award we developed dipolar recoupling experiments designed to measure distances between nuclei with a focus on measuring internuclear distances between 1H-2H, 1H-27Al, 6Li-7Li, and 27Al-27Al spin pairs.  These experiments will find use in determining the structure of peptides and proteins, characterization of battery materials, and catalytic systems.  We also demonstrated an experiment that not only measures the distance between nuclei but also determines the orientation of the spin pair relative to the molecular framework thereby providing much more detailed structural information.  The experiments developed during this work will have wide applicability such as our application of the NMR experiments to determine the structure of two reverse sequence peptides on gold nanoparticles.  We showed that the ordering of the amino acid sequence has a strong influence on the structure, with one peptide forming a monolayer on gold and the other forming a two-layered structure on gold.  The development of NMR hardware is necessary to ensure accurate measurement of distances.  We showed that adding a lens to the tachometer that measures the spinning speed of the sample reduces jitter and allows the spinning speed to be measured and controlled more accurately.  This is important since the dipolar recoupling methods require synchronization of the NMR pulse train with the sample rotation in magic-angle spinning experiments.              Three undergraduate students participated in the research.  Each of them is a co-author on peer-reviewed papers.  Two of them have continued their education by attending graduate school and the third plans to attend graduate school.  One graduate student received the Ph.D. degree and then pursued postdoctoral studies.  The award also provided training for a postdoctoral research fellow.  During the last summer of the award a visiting graduate student from Columbia worked in the laboratory to receive training in dipolar recoupling methods.  Outreach to the community was provided by our annual Children?s Chemistry Show.  Approximately 250 people attended the show each year.  The show consists of a set of demonstrations to show the excitement of chemistry and is followed by hands-on activities for children.  As part of educating the community on our department, a tour of the chemistry facilities is provided to teenagers and adults after the show.
