<AbstractNarration>Working memory is the ability to store and manipulate information that is not currently present in the environment, but exists in the mind. Working memory is important to understand, because it is the foundation for reasoning, mathematics, learning a language, and other cognitive processes that involve the integration and manipulation of information stored in memory.  With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Susan Ravizza of the Michigan State University is investigating how people are able to keep important information active in their mind and not deplete limited memory capacity in storing unimportant information.  The project focuses on two abilities that could help to determine which information gets stored in working memory.  One ability directs attention to salient information in the environment, and Dr. Ravizza and her laboratory are investigating if brain activity in a region called the "temporal parietal junction" signals to orient attention to this information. Another ability gates information, and the researchers are investigating if brain activity in the basal ganglia "opens the gate" to allow important information into working memory or "closes the gate," so that irrelevant information is excluded from working memory.  How these two brain components, attention and gating, work together so that working memory capacity is used effectively is being investigated as well.  These studies are using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activity while people are in the process of storing and recalling information.  In addition to studying healthy participants, analyses of individuals with Parkinson's disease, who have basal ganglia dysfunction, are providing further insight into the basic mechanisms of working memory performance.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This project is investigating a brain model of how information gains access to working memory through specific brain mechanisms. The research is helping to explain why unexciting information is more likely to be forgotten, and how attention to distracting information reduces memory performance. Understanding the mechanisms by which task-relevant information is stored in the presence of distracting information has increased in importance. Given that distracting information is becoming more common in environments such as the workplace, the car, and the classroom, the broader impacts of this research are likely to be significant. For example, social networking (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) during class could interfere with working memory abilities that are needed to learn in the classroom.  The results of this research could suggest, for example, that strategies to improve memory should target the ability to ignore distracting information rather than trying to increase absolute storage capacity. This knowledge has potential to impact education by promoting awareness of the detrimental effects of distraction and could serve as the basis for informed policies regarding social networking in the classroom or workplace.  In addition, the studies of patients with Parkinson's provide basic knowledge about the type of memory impairments experienced with basal ganglia damage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project investigated how people are able to keep important information active in their mind (working memory), and not use their limited memory capacity for storing unimportant information.  One way to prioritize information is through attention.  Attention can be moved voluntarily in a top-down fashion or it can be captured involuntarily by information in the environment.   The research funded by this proposal demonstrates that while voluntary attention always results in better memory, involuntary attention benefits memory only in some situations (Ravizza &amp; Hazeltine, 2013; Ravizza, Uitvlugt, &amp; Hazeltine, 2016).  For example, voluntarily attending an item in a busy display is just as beneficial as when the item is presented alone.  Involuntary attention, however, is only beneficial when there is competition for what to attend; that is, when items are presented alone there is no benefit.  When information enhances memory because of its attention-grabbing features, brain regions involved in voluntary attention rather than involuntary attention are engaged (Hakun &amp; Ravizza, 2016; Wills et al., 2017).  These results progress our understanding of how attention benefits memory.  It implies that capturing attention through flashing lights or loud noises will not necessarily result in better recall of that information.  These findings have implications for when and when not to use these techniques to improve learning and recall of information.    This work also provides new insight into the neural systems involved in allowing relevant information to enter working memory while excluding irrelevant information.  A dorsal and a ventral pathway connect the prefrontal cortex to the striatum and these pathways cooperate to determine which information enters memory.   Based on our results, we suggest that the ventral pathway assigns value to information whereas the dorsal pathway signals when to update working memory (Ravizza, Uitvlugt, &amp; Pleskac, 2016). This work informs neural models of memory by providing insight into how these systems allow limited memory capacity to be used effectively.  It also suggests the type of working memory deficits that will accompany abnormal functioning of these pathways, for example, in Parkinson?s disease.  The ability to focus on important information and ignore distraction has real-world implications for classroom learning.  Portable devices such as laptops and smart phones are increasingly prevalent in the classroom.  While these devices could be used to strengthen educational goals, they can also be a source of distraction that may reduce learning and comprehension of classroom material. In three studies, we demonstrated that greater use of portable devices for off-task activities predicted lower exam scores (Ravizza, Hambrick, &amp; Fenn, 2014; Ravizza, Uitvlugt, &amp; Fenn, 2016).  On the other hand, higher exam scores were related to using a laptop to view class lecture slides (Day, Fenn, &amp; Ravizza, 2018).  Importantly, class-related laptop use did not predict the extent to which students? engaged in off-task activities; this suggests that turning on a laptop will not necessarily distract students who are focused on class-related use.  These results have important implications for educational policy and suggest that it may be premature to ban laptops from the classroom.   This proposal provided support for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in experimental design and programming, fMRI/EEG analyses, and scientific presentation skills.  All these skills are relevant to STEM initiatives.  It also supported the creation and upkeep of the lab?s Facebook and Twitter sites designed to convey scientific findings in an informal way to the general public.
