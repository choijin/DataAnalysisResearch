<AbstractNarration>This Proposal # 1138615 titles " Workshop on Navigating and Leading Change" is a continuation of the development of a community within the American Society of Mechanical Engineers that supports and mentors researchers from underrepresented groups. The previous workshop conducted through ASME focused on networking and teaching negotiation skills, in addition to facilitating the formation of networks during the workshop itself. &lt;br/&gt;The workshop is designed to provide graduate students, post-doc and faculty members with professional development activities and to give them the opportunity to make connections with an international network of supportive researchers in their field. This conference attracts up to 1100 attendees from all over the world. The proportion of majority-to-minority and male-to-female attendees at the conference reflects the overall low representation of women and minorities in the mechanical engineering profession. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will continue the efforts of the Broadening Participation committee of the ASME to provide professional development opportunities to members from underrepresented groups. The goal of the Broadening Participation committee is to develop, implement and oversee new and existing activities aimed at broadening the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in the activities of Design Engineering Division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The workshop will introduce the Lifecycle model of understanding self and change. The participants will leave with an appreciation of this systems' approach to understanding and affecting change, and applying what they learn in different situations of their career.</AbstractNarration>

Funds were used to support travel expenses for women and minority graduate students and post doctoral researchers to attend professional development workshops sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) Design Engineering Division (DED). These workshops were held in conjunction with the annual ASME International Design Technical Conferences (IDETC). Professional speakers and workshop organizers led each workshop. Over the last five years, topics have included: (2011) Navigating and Leading Change; (2012)&nbsp;<span>Engineering Effective Messages: A Hands-On Workshop for Creating Clear, Concise, Compelling Communications; (2013) Overcoming the Imposter Syndrome; (2014)&nbsp;Mutual Mentoring:&nbsp; Moving Beyond One-Size-Fits-All Mentoring; and (2015)&nbsp;<span>Managing Your Academic Career Like an Entrepreneur. Most of the workshops were half-day long. The result of this grant was the increased involvement of women and &nbsp;minorities in the ASME DED community. Several of the young women have stepped into leadership roles on this committee and other technical committees within ASME. A community of women and minorities has been established at the ASME IDETC. The result is less alienation and a sense of belonging for minorities who attend this conference. In addition, valuable professional development training has been supported by this grant.</span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Judy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Vance</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
