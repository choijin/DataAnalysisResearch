<AbstractNarration>It has become increasingly feasible to deploy wireless devices, systems, and networks at low cost for diverse applications such as data communications, sensing, and inference. Given the variety of complex wireless systems with different purposes operating over randomly fading channels, the question of how to compare the performance of these systems arises. System analysis and design can benefit from a unified approach to comparisons of such systems. This research uses the notion of stochastic ordering to provide such an approach. The results aid in performance analysis, and design of wireless systems across a wide range of random propagation conditions. The educational component of this research involves design of educational software modules to illustrate basic concepts in probability and communications using performance comparison of sensing systems through stochastic orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unifying performance metrics also enables comparisons of complex wireless systems operating over fading channels. This enables performance comparisons of a vast range of systems on the basis of the analytical properties of the performance metric such as monotonicity, convexity, or complete monotonicity. When systems are combined, we can determine the conditions under which ordering of the constituent parts preserves the ordering of overall system performance. Specific topics of application include stochastic ordering of generalized relay networks, introduction of new stochastic orders induced by performance metrics of wireless systems, applying the theory of stochastic ordering of point processes to order wireless sensor network performance, and stochastic ordering of systems with multiple (possibly correlated) random channel coefficients such as MIMO systems, or systems operating over frequency-selective channels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It has become increasingly feasible to deploy wireless devices, systems, and networks at low cost for diverse applications such as data communications, sensing, and inference. Data communications for  such applications is subject to several impairments including random decreases in the power of the received signal, and additive noise. The random decreases of the received power is termed signal "fading", which is a major bottleneck in wireless communications.  Given the vast number of complex wireless systems with different purposes operating over randomly fading channels, the question of how to decide whether one set of communication channels is preferable to another arises. In comparing two systems, even when the channel distributions are identical, one might be interested in ordering performance for different receivers, or comparing actions at the transmitter side. The reasons for this include finding bounds on bit error probability, comparing performance metrics for different applications, and studying how ordering of complex systems are inherited from ordering of constituent parts, especially in cases where closed-form mathematical expressions for average performance is not available.  The theory of stochastic orders (or dominance) is an area of probability theory that provides a comprehensive framework to compare two random variables, vectors, or matrices with a range of applications in diverse areas such as economics, actuarial sciences, statistics, queuing theory, and stochastic processes. Until the start of this project, this fundamental tool has not found many applications in the performance analysis of wireless systems, where comparisons of random quantities are ubiquitous.  In our main results, we illustrate the power of several stochastic orders never yet used in communication/information theory.  One such finding is the unification between different metrics in wireless communication theory.  We also highlight applications to performance analysis of wireless sensor networks subject to interference from many users in random locations. The thrust of this research is to utilize the rich theory of stochastic orders to conceive the performance analysis of a wide variety of wireless systems in a completely new light with emphasis on the following problems:  Comparing performances of relay networks, where devices cooperatively aid a source device trying to communication to a destination device; Introduction of new ways to compare wireless system performance. Also, comparing the performance of systems that suffer from interference from randomly distributed devices in space.  Comparing the probability distributions of the number of users in "cognitive" sytems that are designed to have limited interference to licensed users.    This research enables comparisons of complex wireless systems operating over fading channels, by unifying performance metrics. This is a transformative approach to comparing performance of a vast range of systems on the basis of the analytical properties of the performance metric such as, convexity.
