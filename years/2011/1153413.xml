<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit.  Most pro- and eukaryote genomes encode hundreds of enzymes of unknown function; finding what they do is a critical task for post-genomic biology. Mounting evidence implicates many of these enzymes of unknown function in "metabolite repair", i.e. in reversing damage done to metabolites by unwanted enzymatic side-reactions or chemical degradation. Because metabolites are under constant chemical attack (e.g. by oxidation or hydrolysis) and enzymes make wasteful and toxic catalytic errors, it follows that efficient functioning of meta¬bolic networks demands a support system dedicated to meta¬bolite repair. This system has been glimpsed by classical biochemistry, genetics, and metabolomics but most of it remains hidden. This project will therefore dissect the metabolite repair system by combining chemical biology, comparative genomics, and metabolomics using bacterial models and plants. Specific aims are to: (a) identify 30-50 target metabolites that are highly prone to chemical or enzymatic damage (i.e. that need repair) by cheminformatics, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, and data mining; (b) predict genes encoding conserved repair enzymes for target metabolites using comparative genomics, and predict chemistries for the repair reactions; (c) test 20 repair predictions by knocking out the repair gene in a model organism, analyzing metabolomic profiles in normal and stress conditions, and identifying structures by cheminformatics; (d) validate repair reactions by mass spectrometric authentication of structures, by biochemical assays of recombinant proteins, and by functional complementation of bacterial or plant mutants; and (e) incorporate validated repair functions in next-generation genome-scale metabolic models. &lt;br/&gt; This project integrates modeling in two ways. First, it makes innovative use of modeling to predict a priori the metabolites most likely to need repair. Second, adding validated repair functions to genome-scale bacterial models sets up a virtuous cycle of prediction 'experiment' further prediction to drive discovery in metabolite repair. It also pioneers an essential modeling development: Models that capture the cost of uncontrolled formation and degradation of unwanted metabolites.&lt;br/&gt; Research in the emerging field of metabolite repair has the potential to displace a current paradigm of metabolic routes operating with perfect precision by one where the illusion of a flawless system is maintained by a battery of unobtrusive but critical repair functions. Moreover, metabolite repair is almost surely crucial to stress adaptation, to aging, and to metabolic engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  This project will provide interdisciplinary training in comparative genomics, metabolomics, chemical biology, and integrative modeling to two PhD students and three postdoctorals who will spend time away from their own institution each year at another collaborating institution. Un-dergraduates will participate. In addition, there will be a training outreach component with three facets: (a) Eight two-day hands-on workshops (2 per year) at different universities to train PhD students, post¬doctorals, and faculty in comparative genomics using SEED databases and tools. At least three work¬shops will be at minority-serving institutions. Each workshop will train 10-12 people. (b) Development of a web page in which the instructional content of the workshop will be available for distance learning. (c) Instruction of project postdoctorals and students in how to organize and present workshops, culminating first in their acting as teaching assistants, and ultimately in them teaching themselves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The project had the following outcomes, summarized below under headings that correspond to the five original project objectives.  Objective 1: Identify 30-50 target metabolites that are prone to chemical or enzymatic damage. We developed the MINE data&shy;&shy;base http://minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov/ that uses reaction rules based on well-known enzyme reactions to predict enzymatic damage products of meta&shy;bol&shy;ites. We also defined a Top 30 list of damage-prone metabolites &ndash; i.e. the ?worst offenders? &ndash; to help set research priorities.  Objective 2: Predict genes that code for damage-control en&shy;zymes using com&shy;par&shy;at&shy;ive genom&shy;ics, and predict chemistries for the damage-control reactions. Because damage-control genes are often fused to enzymes that are sources of damage, we devel&shy;op&shy;ed new gene fus&shy;ion-detection algorithms and used them, plus other bioinformatics tools, to pre&shy;dict damage and damage-control reactions.  Objective 3: Test 20 predictions in model organisms using genetics, metabolomics and bio&shy;chemistry. Of &gt;20 predictions tested, twelve damage-related reactions were validated:  -   Damage pre-emption in riboflavin synthesis by COG3236 proteins, formerly of unknown funct&shy;ion.  -   Damage pre-emption in pantetheine pathways by DUF89 proteins, formerly of unknown funct&shy;ion.  -   Damage pre-emption in thiamin metabolism by a unique and widespread Nudix enzyme.  -   Repair of racemized S-adenosylmethionine by homocysteine methyltransferases, and evolutionary repurposing of such enzymes to metabolize the plant product S-methyl&shy;methion&shy;ine.  -   Pre-emption of imine damage to plastidial isoleucine biosynthesis by plant RidA proteins.  -   Pre-emption of damage in amine and carbamoyl phosphate metabolism by microbial RidAs.  -   Salvage/pre-emption in thiamin metabolism by TenA_E proteins, formerly of unknown function.  -   A folate-cleaving side-activity of the pantothenate synthesis enzyme PanB.  -   Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) homeostasis by COG0325 proteins.  -   Closure of the salvage/repair pathway for the S-adenosylmethionine damage product methylthio&shy;adenosine via the tandem action of glutamine transaminase and omega-amidase.  Objective 4: Further validate reactions by MS authentication of structures. Targeted LC-MS meth&shy;ods were established for damage products and showed for the first time that NAD(P)H damage products occur in vivo. We also developed MS2Analyzer http://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/projects/ms2analyzer   software to ex&shy;pl&shy;oit structural infor&shy;m&shy;ation in accurate tandem mass spectra to help identify unknown compounds, and explored structure eluc&shy;id&shy;ation approaches, particularly multi-stage mass spectrometry ion trees.  Objective 5: Integrate damage and damage-control reactions into metabolic models. We system&shy;at&shy;ically used chem&shy;informatics/modeling to test damage/damage-control hypotheses in silico.  Publications Summary: The project produced 28 peer-reviewed publications, including two major reviews, 17 research papers, plus 5 educational articles on comparative genomics and metabolic reconstruction (which are also contributions to Broader Im&shy;pacts). Besides these 24 core articles, we contributed to 4 damage or enzyme promiscuity studies led by other groups.  Research Products: The MINEs data&shy;bases and MS2Analyzer; both are web-available (see above).  Broader Impacts  Comparative genomics workshops. Between 2012 and 2015 Hanson, de Cr&eacute;cy, and project postdoctorals taught a two-day, hands-on comparative genomics work&shy;shop to faculty, postdoctorals, and PhD students at eight uni&shy;versities. Three of the universities were Minority Serving Institutions (Howard Univ., Cali&shy;f&shy;ornia State Univ. Fullerton, Florida International Univ.).

Workshop resources, including video lectures, are at http://www.hos.ufl.edu/meteng/1Cpage1.html  Postdoctoral and PhD student training and mentoring. Univ. Florida?s award contributed to training 5 fe&shy;m&shy;ale and 4 male postdoctorals; 2 have now moved to permanent positions. Postdoctorals learned cross-dis&shy;cip&shy;lin&shy;ary com&shy;m&shy;unic&shy;ation and collaborat&shy;ion, and were train&shy;ed and mentored in teaching (i) by preparing and giving lect&shy;ures, and tutoring, in under&shy;graduate or grad&shy;uate cour&shy;s&shy;es, and (ii) by instructing in workshops, on all of which they received feedback.

Integration of research and teaching. Each year, students in PI Hanson?s graduate course module were given research projects in which they predicted damage-control genes using com&shy;&shy;par&shy;ative gen&shy;om&shy;ics. Two such projects contributed to publications where the stud&shy;ents were authors. In addition, we hosted a total of ~24 (Fiehn lab) and 4 (de Cr&eacute;cy lab) undergraduate interns who worked with postdoctorals or PhD students. Two of de Cr&eacute;cy?s undergraduates have joined PhD programs and three were authors on a paper from this project.
