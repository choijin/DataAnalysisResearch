<AbstractNarration>The REU program in the Department of Chemistry at Georgia Institute of Technology will bring 10 students to campus for ten weeks each summer to participate in a diverse array of projects in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, physical, and polymer chemistry. A primary focus of the proposed NSF REU program is to target the enrollment of substantial numbers of women and underrepresented minority students and to provide them with skills and motivation to embark on graduate studies in the sciences. Each participant will work with an individual faculty member who has an active research group in an area of interest to the student. Other components of the program include team-building activities, regular group meetings, a seminar/workshop series (topics include ethics, presentation skills, graduate opportunities, and research frontiers), research symposia, and field trips to industrial and/or government laboratories. These serve to acquaint participants with a broad array of projects, provide them with the opportunity to enhance their presentation skills, and provide a perspective of chemical research in a scholarly, entrepreneurial, economic, and ethical framework. The program includes extensive joint activities with other summer research programs on campus. It is expected that the REU program will continue to attract the high level of participation of underrepresented groups similar to the most recent programs that included 54% women, 55% underrepresented minorities with most participants (84%) coming from schools that lacked a Ph.D. program in chemistry. This goal will be facilitated by both existing and new outreach activities with Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) and other Principally Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and a new partnership with a local two-year college.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (NSF-REU) program in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) hosted 35 full-time undergraduate students in chemical research activities under the supervision of members of the faculty for ten weeks in the summers of 2012-2015.  Participants conducted research in an area of mutual interest to the student and faculty member.  Participants included US citizens and permanent residents of the US who are pursuing a bachelorÃ†s degree in the chemical sciences but who have limited prior research experience.    In addition to conducting research, students participated in team-building, a seminar/workshop series (ethics, presentation skills, graduate opportunities, research frontiers), research symposia, and field trips to industrial and government laboratories. These professional development activities acquainted participants with a broad array of projects, provided them with the opportunity to enhance their presentation skills, and provided a perspective of chemical research in a scholarly, entrepreneurial, economic, and ethical framework.  The School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Tech has a strong record of educating a diverse cadre of students.  This NSF-REU program hosted significant numbers of female (49%) and underrepresented minority (34%) students as well as &gt;80% of students from primarily undergraduate institutions (non-PhD granting institutions).  Students completed a technical report and oral presentation upon completion of the program. This REU program supported the research initiatives of the School which attracts funding from federal agencies and industry and results in publications in the scientific literature (many with undergraduate researchers, as co-authors).  The program was designed to encourage undergraduate students to pursue graduate education in the chemical sciences.  Approximately 80% of participants expressed an interest in pursuing graduate education in science upon completion of the program. The NSF-REU program provided a breadth of chemical training for a new generation of scientists which supports the future well-being (health, wealth, and security) of the US and its people.
