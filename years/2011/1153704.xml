<AbstractNarration>This award will support the participation of ~10 students and postdoctoral researchers in a workshop focusing on developing strategies to achieve better understanding of the history of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The workshop will be held in the fall of 2011 in Corvallis, OR, and will include international representation in the fields of glaciology, paleoceanography, marine geology, and climate modeling. Funding provides the opportunity for young scientists to get involved with and contribute to an interdisciplinary effort that may eventually lead to a large-scale drilling program through the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. The opportunity for participation will be advertised in widely available newsletters and through disciplinary email listservs. Participant support will be based on applicants' statements of purpose and will target under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
