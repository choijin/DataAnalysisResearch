<AbstractNarration>1136944&lt;br/&gt;Zhong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike PCs, mobile devices such as smart-phones and tablets are likely to be used under various viewing conditions. Many contextual factors including viewing angle, ambient light, and a shaking hand will introduce significant distortion in the perceived image quality, challenging the use of mobile devices to view medical images. On February 4, 2011, the US FDA cleared the first diagnostic radiology application that allows the physicians to view CT, MR, and PET images on the iPhone and iPad mobile devices when there is no access to a workstation. While this ruling enables physicians to view images and make diagnoses under recommended lighting conditions, it mandates that the cleared application include labeling and safety features to mitigate the risk of adverse viewing conditions. The challenge from the contextual factors remains unaddressed: the physicians are responsible to operate a mobile display in a proper viewing environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research project is to address the challenge to mobile image quality from contextual factors with a computational and sensing approach. The key point is that efficient sensing and computational power of mobile devices can be leveraged to extract information about the viewing context to compensate for image distortions in mobile display. The proposed research will heavily draw upon the modern understanding of the human visual system. It will not only offer solutions that are applicable to all kinds of mobile displays but also will provide technology-specific solutions for existing and emerging mobile display technologies, from liquid-crystal display (LCD) to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) to auto-stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are intended for usage under demanding physical conditions. As a result, their displays face two unique challenges. First, contextual factors, including the viewing angle, ambient lighting, and unwanted shaking of the device, tend to distort the perceived display content. Moreover, the display is known to be among the largest power consumers on a state-of-the-art mobile device. These issues are particularly important as there is a strong desire by healthcare professionals to use mobile devices to view medical records, including images.   This project supported three Rice graduate students to spend time at the FDA imaging and devices laboratory, not only learning about photometrics and display performance charaacterization but also helping the laboratory set up new measurement systems to characterize the performance of displays on mobile devices under various contexts.   The knowledge learned by the studenets was instrumental in their research at Rice Univeristy about software optimization in order to improve the energy efficiency and usability of mobile displays, especially under challenging viewing contexts, which produced multiple publications and conference demonstrations. The measurement systems they helped build at FDA were later useful in FDA's evaluation of mobile displays for viewing medical images, including published results.
