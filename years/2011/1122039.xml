<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Replication is the central step in the infectious cycles of RNA viruses, which cause many devastating diseases in plants, animals and humans. These viruses replicate inside the infected cells by co-opting an unknown number of host proteins and reprogramming several cellular pathways. In spite of the significance of host proteins in viral pathogenesis, our current knowledge about host factors subverted for virus replication is incomplete. This project is aimed at addressing the role of the multifunctional host-coded translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), which is a permanent resident in the viral replicase complex and plays a key role in Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replication. The research will unravel the functions of eEF1A using innovative approaches including yeast and plant assays developed for tombusviruses, as well as the powerful cell-free TBSV replication assay in yeast extracts. This research will likely lead to major new insights into virus replication and viral pathogenesis and will have a considerable impact on our understanding of the mechanism that transforms the host cells into "viral factories". Since eEF1A likely affects replication of a large number of plant and animal viruses, major progress with tombusviruses would be highly advantageous to study of other viruses as well. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: High school and undergraduate students will actively participate in the research. Students will be exposed to highly innovative research, thus providing them an invaluable learning experience. This research will promote interdisciplinary (plant pathology, biochemistry, cell biology, genetics) learning. The research also includes mentoring for postdoctoral researchers and preparing them for a scientific career in academia or industry. Pioneering research on tombusvirus replication will immensely help other scientists working with less tractable, but devastating viral pathogens for which similar studies are currently not yet feasible. Dissection of the role of eEF1A in viral pathogenesis and disease development will facilitate future antiviral approaches and treatments to reduce the effect of viral diseases in agriculture.</AbstractNarration>

This is significant because co-opted eEF1A affects replication of a large number of plant, animal and human viruses. The PIÆs lab has developed novel approaches, based on in vitro, yeast and plants that were useful to dissect the role of the essential eEF1A in tombusvirus replication. Both the developed approaches and the obtained results are pioneering in the field of virus-host interactions.   The following our the major outcomes:   The PIÆs lab has discovered that eEF1A is a host-derived key component of tombusvirus replicase complex.     The PIÆs lab has found that the methylation status (a posttranslational protein modification) of eEF1A affects the ability of eEF1A to support tombusvirus replication.     The PIÆs lab has identified the EFM4 (See1) methyltransferase, which is the key enzyme in methylation of eEF1A, is required for functions co-opted by tombusviruses and unrelated insect viruses.     The PIÆs lab has also demonstrated the plant homolog of EFM4 gene is important to support tombusvirus replication in plants.     Based on proteomics approach, the PIÆs lab has obtained evidence that eEF1A affects the molecular composition of the tombusvirus replicase complex.     The PIÆs lab has demonstrated that eEF1A facilitates the co-option of additional RNA-binding host proteins, which are co-opted and critical for tombusvirus replication.     The PIÆs lab has shown that eEF1A is also important in tombusvirus recombination, which is a major driving force of emergence of new viruses and virus evolution.     Broader impacts: The award provided unique training environment for postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students in the Nagy lab due to the complexity of the system and diverse approaches employed, promoting interdisciplinary training at a whole new level to tackle scientific questions that are not yet feasible in other systems. Undergraduate and graduate students, visiting students and scientists and postdoctoral scientists were actively engaged in the PIÆs program, contributing to major fashion to research papers. Broader impact on other areas: Most of the already identified host factors are from conserved genes, suggesting that (+)RNA viruses might selectively target conserved host functions as opposed to species-specific factors. Thus, the results obtained with tombusviruses will have a great impact on human and veterinary medicine, agriculture and plant pathology. Also, healthy plants are vital for food and increasingly as bioenergy sources as well as for recreation.       Last Modified: 03/31/2016       Submitted by: Peter D Nagy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
