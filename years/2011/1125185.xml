<AbstractNarration>This project will create a new paradigm, VolcanoSRI (Volcano Seismic Realtime Imaging), for imaging 4D (four-dimensional) tomography of an active volcano in real-time. VolcanoSRI is a large-scale sensor network of low-cost geophysical stations that analyzes seismic signals and computes real-time, full-scale, three-dimensional fluid dynamics of the volcano conduit system within the active network. The computed 4D tomography model will illuminate complex, time-varying dynamics of an erupting volcano, providing a deeper scientific understanding of volcanic processes, as well as a basis for rapid detection of volcanic hazards. VolcanoSRI will potentially make the fictional holographic projector known as Virgil in the film "Supervolcano" a reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realizing the VolcanoSRI system requires a transformative study on the science of complex volcano systems and the design of large-scale sensor networks. Our approach integrates innovations on distributed tomographic algorithms, collaborative signal processing, and situation-aware networking technology for large-scale real-time sensor systems. The distributed tomography algorithm disperses the computational burden to the sensor nodes and performs real-time tomographic inversion within the network. Such an approach has never been attempted before and represents a major achievement for both earth and computer science. The team is composed of computer and earth scientists including early pioneers of wireless sensor networks as applied to volcano monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VolcanoSRI holds vast potential for real-time risk monitoring and development of early-warning systems for volcanoes and other earth hazards. The new approach taken in VolcanoSRI is general, and can be implemented as a new network paradigm for other sensor-network applications, including oil-field exploration and structural and biomedical-health monitoring. The educational activities of this project include enhancing undergraduate and graduate curriculum and research programs at the three collaborating universities. Through this project, we plan to broaden access to these course materials by providing the course lectures, all readings, and assignments online to the public. This project provides many opportunities for collaborations of students across earth and computer science, increasing involvement of women and minorities, at the three collaborating universities.</AbstractNarration>

Technological development involved designing and coordinating instrumentation to the specifications that would accomplish the geophysical requirements for imaging and seismic analysis. The intended goal was to create an interconnected wireless system that could operate autonomously during volcano unrest.  Signal detection, earthquake location and tomographic inversion for subsurface structure were accomplished by distributed analysis.  Spacing between stations was limited by line of sight restrictions to approximately 200 meters.  Testing was done in Atlanta, GA, Buffalo, NY, as well as Tungurahua, Ecuador, to show that the system would work.  A final deployment was tested on a 4 month field expedition at Llaima Volcano, in southern Chile (see figure).  Two small patches of 20 instruments each were deployed along with a 26 station broadband network.  The lack of earthquakes precluded a definitive test of the wireless systems, although the broadband instrumentation successfully recorded remote earthquakes that were used to develop an attenuation model of the volcanic structure.  Tomographic analysis of volcanic structures on Sierra Negra, Galapagos, were developed to reveal shallow, internal structure of the active caldera.  This initial study will serve as the basis for future project targeting this important site. Following the development of the instrumentation, the technology is being extended for potential application on airborne acoustic arrays where small, lightweight stations are critical for exploring the stratosphere.  This application is new and early experimentation has involved several NASA based launches to test instrumentation in situ as well as ground arrays deployed along turbulent river junctions where dense arrays are used to investigate the relationship of river dynamics, wave shape and acoustic emission.   Figure 1 shows results of the inversion for structure below Llaima, Volcano, in Chile.  The vertical slice indicates region of anomalous velocity structure based on the analysis of remote earthquakes arriving at stations deployed on the volcano.  Figure 2 shows vertical structure on Sierra Negra Volcano, Galapagos, Ecuador.  Grey shades show variations of attenuation of seismic waves below the surface.  These variations indicate the possible presence of magma accumulation in the shallow layers of the caldera.  Numerous students worked on this project, including undergraduates, Masters and Doctoral candidates.  Students were trained on field methods in seismology and acoustics, as well as analytical methodologies.  All student participation on this project led to publication in peer reviewed journals.  Collaboration with research scientists in Ecuador and Chile expanded the broader impacts of this research be transferring technology to these countries and training investigators on these new technologies.
