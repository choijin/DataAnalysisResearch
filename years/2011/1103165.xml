<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "Conference on Recent Developments in L-Infinity Variational Problems and the Associated Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations" that will be held from May 12-15, 2011, on the campus of the University of Kentucky. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on a variety of topics in the theory of partial differential equations, with the overarching theme stemming from a specific subarea of the calculus of variations, namely, from so-called L-infinity variational problems. All of the topic areas cited in the proposal are central to analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.</AbstractNarration>
