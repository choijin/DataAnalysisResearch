<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop new plasmonic structures and devices for manipulating light and enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanoscale through the excitation of subwavelength plasmonic modes for device applications in sensing, switching, and photovoltaics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to greatly advance the state of the art of nanoplasmonics by exploring nanoscale plasmonic structures and devices for enhancement of nonlinear optical effects, all-optical absorption switches, ultra-compact sensors, and plasmon-enhanced thin-film photovoltaic solar cells. The proposed research is potentially transformative, since the results of the program may lead to new opportunities for device applications, which will represent important breakthroughs in integrated optics, optical information processing, and renewable energy sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are fundamental breakthroughs in photonics science and engineering, a field which profoundly influences the quality of human life. This program will also provide excellent training opportunities for two graduate students. In addition, as part of the efforts on outreach and education, a new course on nanophotonics will be introduced in which numerical codes will be used to deepen the students? understanding of the basic physics of nanophotonic devices. Special focus will also be placed on incorporating undergraduate students into the research program, as well as on outreach to the local communities, and on recruiting minority graduate students to work on this program.</AbstractNarration>
