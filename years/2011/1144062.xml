<AbstractNarration>Most studies of the magnetosphere have been carried out by considering primarily the north-south (Bz) component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and most of those have considered intervals with southward IMF (Bz&lt;0). Recent discoveries have revealed anomalous thermospheric neutral density signatures caused by intense deposition of Poynting flux delivered over very localized regions under conditions that are normally considered benign. These studies have shown that relatively modest IMF By-driven localized heating at storm-onset generates neutral thermospheric disturbances that had not previously been explained. In addition studies using data from DMSP satellites demonstrated large yet localized dayside energy input. MHD simulation results for one case suggest that the localized enhanced Poynting fluxes in the southern hemisphere map to a flank magnetopause reconnection region. Most of these events are associated with dominant in-the-ecliptic interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) values, often, but not exclusively, while the IMF Bz is northward (Bz&gt;0). The objectives of this proposal are to verify the source region (magnetopause merging versus bow shock) of the Poynting flux-related dayside field-aligned currents (FACs), determine their ionospheric distribution, and examine the relative local and global impact of the Poynting flux energy input on the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. The influences of solar ejecta and high-speed streams will be distinguished and investigated for seasonal and hemispheric differences. The study will employ both data analysis from multiple satellites, ground based observations from radar and the AMIE technique and tie all the observations together with global magnetohydrodynamic simulations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research potentially transforms the way the space science community views the effects of non-southward IMF on the geospace environment.  It is at the forefront of system science in exploring the influence of non-southward IMF on the field-aligned currents that deliver focused energy to dayside regions. This is an understudied area of space physics. It also has practical application to problems related to satellite drag.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit  The objectives of this project were to study high latitude electrodynamics including field aligned currents (FACs), and to determine their ionospheric distribution, and examine the effects of energy input on the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. The tools employed in the study are the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) and the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIMEGCM), along with various data sets.  ASTRA?s role in this collaborative project is to lead the analysis and interpretation of the AMIE assimilations and TIMEGCM simulations. Significant results include: discovery regarding how particle precipitation drives changes in thermospheric density in the cusp region; discovery how Kzz at the lower boundary drives seasonal composition changes; prototype demonstration of an ensemble assimilation model for thermospheric density and satellite drag; demonstration that body mounted magnetometer on a CubeSat can adequately measure magnetic field perturbations to yield FACs; new results on the climatology of FACs under different IMF conditions; use of AMIE to show how Ground Induced Currents (GICs) are generated during rapid changes in the ionospheric electrodynamics; comparison of AMIE outputs with FACS both from MHD models and the AMPERE satellite suggested improvements are needed to the MHD models in order to capture much of the structure obtained from AMIE and AMPERE; demonstration of using AMIE to understand formation of Storm Enhanced Density (SED) feature.  Eight (8) papers and a book chapter have been published related to this effort (with another 5 papers in progress), and we have made 35 conference presentations related to the work.
