<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to provide partial support for the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee (IOOC) support office hosted at the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL). The IOOC Support Office will continue to provide project management by drafting updates to the SOST, drafting responses to SOST taskings, tracking interagency progress related to IOOC projects, developing reports, and coordinating IOOC actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interagency collaboration is essential to achieve ocean science and technology priorities and, in particular, for planning and coordination of an ocean observation system. The IOOC support office provides administrative assistance the federal agencies on all of the IOOS planning activities. An IOOC that is able to effectively support these goals will make meaningful contributions to broader societal goals related to climate, maritime operations, natural hazards, national security, public health, ecosystems, and natural resources.</AbstractNarration>
