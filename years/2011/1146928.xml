<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Photosynthesis, which harvests solar energy and assimilates atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), represents the "engine" of life. Constraints on photosynthesis and plant growth can occur in most land plants where access to CO2 becomes limiting under environmental stress (drought, high temperature, saline soils).  Some plants evolved a metabolic pump (called C4) which actively accumulates CO2, conferring an advantage, especially under extreme environments. Prior to the 2001 discovery of species which perform C4 in individual photosynthetic cells, the paradigm for C4 plants was a requirement for cooperative function of two cell types.  In contrast, the single-cell C4 species, which have a unique form of carbon acquisition, contain photosynthetic cells with two types of chloroplasts in separate compartments, one supporting the capture of atmospheric CO2, the other functioning in its assimilation into organic matter. Problems to be investigated in this project are identification and characterization of genes and proteins required for the development and function of single-cell C4 photosynthesis.  This involves identification of differences in protein composition of the two types of chloroplasts, the nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes responsible for their synthesis, and the genetic control of chloroplast differentiation. The approach will include use of molecular and microscopic techniques to analyze and identify the products of gene expression leading to development of this form of C4.  This project is expected to gain insights into an exceptional mechanism of photosynthesis, and into regulation of biochemical differentiation in cell biology. The research project will also involve an international collaboration with Dr. S. Offermann of Hannover University in Germany, which is sponsored by the International Office of Science and Engineering. This collaboration will provide an international learning experience for the graduate students and will extend the expertise of the US lab. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research is expected to contribute new insights that will impact education, future research on photosynthesis, and mechanisms of adaptations in plants.  There are potential applications for solving growing global limitations on bio-resources.  The single-cell mechanism is an attractive model for developing crops, e.g. rice, with improved productivity, especially under environmental stress.</AbstractNarration>

Generally, they immediately relate to that. What I, and often they, find interesting and surprising about the process is that there are differences among plants in the way they capture CO2 and the way this affects their ability to perform photosynthesis in stressful environments. A few plants actually capture the atmospheric CO2 and concentrate it in the leaf, under conditions where it would otherwise be limiting, which makes their carbon assimilation by photosynthesis and growth much more effective. In warm climates, leaf temperatures rise, lowering the solubility of CO2, and under water stress, plants close down the stomata on the surface of leaves, restricting CO2 entry. When CO2 is captured by this metabolic pump, the first product is a four carbon acid, hence they are called C4 plants (plants lacking this ability are called C3 plants where the first product is a three carbon acid). Most crop plants are C3, and thus they lack this mechanism, for instance wheat, rice, and legumes.  Notable exceptions among important crops are maize (corn) and sorghum, both C4.  Yet, C4 plants have evolved multiple times from plants which lack this mechanism (more than 60 times, across 19 plant families).  C4 photosynthesis was initially discovered in the 1960s in studies with maize and sugarcane.  For many years, all C4 plants were recognized as having a distinct anatomy consisting of two types of photosynthetic cells which function cooperatively, where the atmospheric CO2 is captured in one cell, and concentrated for assimilation in the other. However, more recently two forms of C4 plants were discovered among land plants where the process functions within individual photosynthetic cells (termed single-cell C4), which was the topic of this project.  These species occur within the Chenopodiaceae family which, along with the grasses, has the most known forms of C4 anatomy, as well as species which lack the CO2 pump (like spinach and sugar beet). These single-cell C4 species grow in semi-arid deserts in Central Asia and around the Persian Gulf. They function by separation of processes between two areas (called domains) within the cell with one having chloroplasts specialized for capturing atmospheric CO2 and the other concentrating it.  The objectives were to determine how the photosynthetic cells develop, and the pathway of metabolism between the two domains.  Mature leaves have fully developed single-cell C4, while we found that in young leaves there are continual structural and biochemical transitions in development of C4 from the base to the tip of the leaf.  Similar to plants which lack C4, the basal region of the leaf has chloroplasts in one domain and it lacks the biochemistry for C4 photosynthesis; the mid-region has developed the two domains with chloroplasts in each; while towards the tip of leaves the chloroplasts in the two domains have become specialized structurally and biochemically for C4 function.  The enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, which catalyzes the capture of atmospheric CO2 to form C4 acids, is located in one domain, while in the domain where CO2 is concentrated it is assimilated into organic matter via the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase. The well-defined transition in steps towards developing C4 in this study provides a means for determining regulatory factors which control the structural and biochemical changes for C4 development.  Various proteins are required to support C4 photosynthesis, including enzymes for catalysis and proteins which facilitate transport across membranes. A large proteomics study was conducted to identify the proteins involved, in which the photosynthetic cells were isolated, and their subcellular compartmentation analyzed, including the two types of chloroplasts.  This resulted in defining all the metabolic steps and their localization within the cell for capturing the atmospheric CO2 and concentrating it for carbon assimilation, including proteins associated with specialization of function of the two chloroplasts. It is not only surprising that these plants can accomplish C4 within individual cells; these are the only plants where two types of chloroplasts are known to be formed within photosynthetic cells through expression of a combination of nuclear and chloroplast genes. There is interest in genetically modifying C3 crops to perform C4 photosynthesis, which would enable them to perform better in adverse climates (high temperature, and drought).  Currently, there is ongoing research with this objective in rice and some other C3 species.  The single-cell C4 system offers an alternative strategy for introducing C4 traits within the existing leaf anatomy of rice and other crops without requiring the development of two photosynthetic cells which function cooperatively.
