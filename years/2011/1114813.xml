<AbstractNarration>The 7th triennial IUPAP meeting, International Conference on Biological Physics (ICBP 2011) will take place June 19-24, 2011 at the University of California, San Diego. A quantitative description of Biology is rapidly emerging as a major new frontier for science in the 21st century. This field involves the cross-fertilization of ideas and methods from biology and biochemistry on the one hand and the physics of complex systems on the other. The theoretical and experimental collaboration needed for continued expansion of this field has been established, and this conference provides one of a few venues to facilitate cross-fertilization between the disciplines of mathematics, biology, physics, and chemistry. The ICBP2011 meeting is the only meeting of its genre that focuses specifically on facilitating interactions between "biological physics" researchers from both developing and industrialized nations, with an additional emphasis on the involvement of junior researchers (graduate students and post-doctoral scholars). The 2011 meeting will engage 500-600 junior and senior researchers from over 40 different countries.</AbstractNarration>

A quantitative description of Biology is rapidly emerging as a major new frontier for science in the 21st century.

The International Conference on Biological Physics (ICBP) is a triennial conference of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP).

The conference was attended by over 400 researchers (registered and last-minute attendees from many local institutions) from 31 countries;     40% faculty   14% postdoctoral scholars   33% graduate students   10% undergraduate students    10% of all attendees were from developing countries  33% of all attendees were women  25% of all invited speakers were women   It is important to note that although "faculty" represented 40% of the total participants (by total head count) at the conference, almost 50% of the faculty were invited speakers, session chairs and/or organizers. If we exclude the "faculty presenters", junior researchers (postdoctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students) accounted for almost 80% of all attendees.      Over 90% of the attendees from developing countries and over 50% of the junior researchers (post-doctoral scholars, graduate students and undergraduate students) received some kind financial assistance (full/partial travel awards, registration/housing waivers, etc.) from the conference.   Conference Program Summary. The conference was preceded by two workshops: an intensive hands-on training workshop ("Computational Molecular Biophysics") and a student-centered mini-conference ("The Physics of Living Systems").   Over two dozen graduate students and postdoctoral scholars received leading-edge practical training in molecular dynamics techniques and coarse-grained simulations with biophysical applications in the computational molecular biophysics workshop organized by Prof. Andy McCammon (UCSD) and Robert Konecny (CTBP/NBCR, UCSD).   The Physics of Living Systems (PoLS) mini-conference was the collaborative effort of faculty and graduate students at UCSD, the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Y...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
