<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to create a new class of Si-based electroabsorption modulators (EAM) that operate at an unprecedented bandwidth of 80Gb/s.  The approach is to use 3D wafer bonding technology to vertically couple light into a nanowire high-index contrast silicon waveguide.  A graded base SiGe heterojunction transistor is the baseline electric structure of the modulator, while the free carrier plasma effect is used to generate optical absorption modulation. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits: For high capacity fiber-optic systems, a Si-based, monolithically integrated fast EAM is an appealing alternative technology to commercial III-V compound semiconductor based modulators. The proposed research will explore the carrier transport phenomena and its corresponding optical attenuation effect in a SiGe heterojuction transistor, as well as various design trade-offs among modulation depth, signal dispersion, operation speed, power consumption, and local heating effects. The proposed work will design a fully integrated modulator driver circuit using unmodified, silicon fabrication processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: An 80Gbps, low-power, and small footprint Si based EAM will be a breakthrough technology in advancing the development of the next generation of broadband fiber-optic networking and lightwave circuits for high-speed computing. There is a strong, synergistic educational and mentoring component for students at all levels. Outreach efforts will broaden participation of under-represented groups and undergraduate students in research programs at both institutions. K-12 outreach activities will be in collaboration with New York New Vision program at RPI, and through the Center for Engineering Educational Outreach (CEEO) at Tufts.</AbstractNarration>

The increasing popularity and availability in rich multimedia content and services such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and the delivery of triple-play services (TV, telephony, and high-speed Internet) at &gt;100 Mbps bandwidths has placed a demand for higher per-fiber transport capacities, and at the same time, lower costs per end-to-end transmitted information bit. This research project has made several important contributions towards advancing the development of next generation broadband fiber-optic communication systems.  The breakthroughs realized through this project are centered on the unique integration of high performance semiconductor materials, such as silicon-germanium (SiGe), and devices with optical substrates.  The goal is to design a new class of fast, compact, and low power electro-optic modulator devices to supply fast optical switch speeds for data transmission.   An Electro-Absorption Modulator (EAM), offering unprecedented operation speed and utmost low-cost solution, is a crucial fiber-optic component in readying the fiber-optic community for the next generation of fiber technology.     In this project, the utility of a SixGe1-x  heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT) for an EAM modulator in combination with an optical substrate inspires a drastically novel approach to optical component design.  A comprehensive study to validate the suitability of using commercial SiGe process technologies for EAM die fabrication has been performed.  To the best of knowledge, it is the first attempt to extend a commercial SiGe HBT device to the area of fiber-optical component application. Design trade-offs among modulation depth, footprint, operation speed, power consumption, local heating effects and microwave circuit complexity were evaluated and published, providing needed intellectual contributions to both RF SiGe HBT (based on IBM 7HP/8HP technology) and fiber-optical component communities. In addition, the research effort in wafer-level integration of optical substrates and HBT dies has made valuable contributions to the field of 3D die-to-wafer bonding.      Monolithic integration of photonic devices and advanced electronic signal processing circuitry on a single die is a key enabling technology for cost-effective and robust optical system solutions.  In this research project, several novel transmitter driver architectures have been designed and realized to enable monolithic integration with the HBT-based EAM device.  A 10Gbps monolithic optical transmitter module integrating the driver circuit architecture was design, fabricated in a 130nm BiCMOS process, and tested. For high power efficiency, a 6Gbps ultra-low power driver IC implemented in a 130nm BiCMOS process was fabricated and tested.  The driver IC incorporates an integrated 27-1 pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) generator for reliable high-speed testing, and a driver circuit featuring digitally-tuned pre-emphasis signal strength for fast switching speeds. With outstanding drive capability, the driver module can be applied to a wide range of carrier injection modulators and light-emitting diodes (LED) with drive voltage requirements below 1.5V.  Measurement results show the bandwidth of a red LED-based optical link is enhanced by 70% by using the pre-emphasis driver module. A traveling wave electrode (TWE) modulator structure was designed and simulated, including a novel design methodology to address process limitations imposed by a commercial silicon fabrication technology.  Results from 3D full wave EM simulation demonstrate the application of the design methodology to achieve specifications, including phase velocity matching, insertion loss, and impedance matching.  Results show the HBT-based TWE-EAM system has the bandwidth higher than 60GHz.     The invention of a high-spe...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
