<AbstractNarration>New York City College of Technology (City Tech) in collaboration with Polytechnic High School of Engineering, Architecture and Technology (City Poly) and industry partners are implementing an initiative titled Fuse Lab in an effort to transform the AEC (architecture, engineering and construction) curriculum and develop faculty expertise.  This initiative provides a model for other undergraduate AEC programs around the country.  In order to produce students who can take advantage of and continuously adapt to the fields' rapidly evolving computational, construction and sustainable technologies, Fuse lab is 1) developing and implementing an articulated career pathway (3+2+2) that serves a diverse population of students and leads to the associate and baccalaureate degree while offering students multiple exit points that were integrated with industry certification; 2) creating curriculum units and faculty development opportunities that reflect the technology integration and interdisciplinary team work that have transformed industry practice; and 3) situating these activities in a larger advanced technology loop by creating sustainable mechanisms for industry participation across the career pathway and by joining existing feedback loops with ATE centers and related projects.  The broader impact of the project includes addressing future needs of AEC technicians, increasing participation of underrepresented populations and producing a new AEC curriculum that can serve as a national model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ New York City College of Technology (City Tech) plays a critical role in educating the cityÆs technical workforce. As a national top producer of underrepresented minority STEM associate degree graduates, the collegeÆs historic mission is to provide educational advancement regardless of financial circumstances or prior academic preparation.  The Fuse Lab was an Advanced Technology Education project for program improvement and faculty development in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) programs at City Tech.  Due to the current AEC industryÆs heavy reliance on 3D modeling and simulations in developing designs for modern day buildings, AEC workflows have converged&mdash;builders, engineers, and architects work together closely on 3D digital representations from a projectÆs outset. The digital growth in the AEC industry is accelerating at an exponential rate as there are many benefits, both for firms and project stakeholders. Such fundamental change required a transformation in preparing students for the workplace, and it is this profound change that the Fuse Lab addressed.  The project focused on three key technology areas in today's construction industry: building information modeling (BIM), building performance (green/sustainable technologies), and advanced computation and digital fabrication.  Fuse Lab supported institutionalized CURRICULUM change, transformed FACULTY skills and attitudes, revolutionized STUDENT access to technology, and advanced INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS.  ACCOMPLISHMENT HIGHLIGHTS  Enhanced an existing High School to Associate Degree articulation program with engineering problem-based modules and a summer bridge program Developed a certification sequence in Fabrication &amp; Computation Implemented an innovative, reproducible "DIGITAL SPINE" model that integrates digital skills across the curriculum, including: 1) a new technology-intensive course sequence, demonstrating improved student success in the critical Associate-level studios, while also implementing higher pass standards and more rigorous curriculum; 2) a robust series of workshops, PDF primers, and video tutorials to support acquisition of critical skills; and 3) sixteen additional new or revised courses, including three capstone courses Launched INTERSECTIONS, an annual symposium attracting international speakers and local professionals, focused on technology applications and collaboration in practice and pedagogy Supported nearly 100 separate faculty development opportunities&mdash;off-site and on-site conferences and trainings, changing the conversation about what can and should be taught     RESULTS  Student engagement is demonstrated by full enrollments in Fuse Lab elective capstones and sequences, and in student-driven extra-curricular activities. In the second year of the project, students initiated two new student clubs dedicated to two of the Fuse Lab focus areas&mdash;fabrication and sustainability. In the third year of the project, the sustainability club fielded a team that was one of 20 selected nationwide to compete in the 2015 U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon, a competition to design, construct, and exhibit a prototype for a modest scale, low-energy home. The Solar Decathlon was the ultimate culminating experience for the Fuse Lab, allowing for application of the three technology focus areas in a hand-on experience that mirrored collaborative, multi-disciplinary practice of todayÆs AEC field. Although ours was the only all undergraduate team and a first-time competitor, City Tech placed 5th in both the Engineering and the Energy Balance contests. This accomplishment would not have been possible prior to the technology foundations provided by the Fuse Lab curriculum. The Solar Decathlon had a significant impact on the 100+ participating students, and built institutional capacity for full-scale prototyping and inter-departmental collaboration that will be evident for years to come.  City TechÆs program is attrac...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
