<AbstractNarration>This three-year project provides astrometry of water masers in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), the large companion spiral galaxy to the Milky Way in the Local Group of galaxies. The proper motion of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, and SMC) and M33 are already known with more or less adequate accuracy, but the proper motion of M31 and its many dwarf companions and stellar streams is the missing piece in the puzzle. The proper motion measurement of M31 is necessary to get a better understanding of the dark matter distribution and kinematics of the Local Group. The measurements can be expected to have a larger impact on galactic research because they constrain models of the formation and history, but also future evolution, of the Local Group of galaxies. The observations use new capabilities of the Very Long Baseline Array, Expanded Very Large Array, and High Sensitivity Array. The broader impacts of this work further include training new observers to use NSF-supported facilities. The PI integrates results from his research into the classroom and works on tools and techniques aimed to transform astronomy courses at all levels of instruction. This program will transform three courses spanning the range of instruction level from traditional lectures into question-discussion-tutorial sessions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project began with the discovery of water masers in the Andromeda Galaxy (also known as M31) using the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Green Bank Telescope operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).  Water masers are naturally occurring "space lasers" produced by water vapor in space.  They are called masers because unlike lasers that work in visible light (red, green, blue), masers occur in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Water masers had never before been detected in M31, but they have been observed in our galaxy, the Milky Way, and in other galaxies, both near and distant.  Water masers are extremely valuable tools for astronomers:  just like lasers, they are very effective at pinpointing specific locations with bright monochromatic light.  In the case of M31, they allow us to monitor their positions and motions very precisely and enable us to answer a big question:  are the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way going to collide?  If so, how long will this take?  The answer to this question will also indicate how much dark matter is present in the Local Group, the group of galaxies formed by the Milky Way, Andromeda, and their satellite galaxies.  The project itself involved mapping the masers using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array followed by repeated observations using the High Sensitivity Network and the Very Long Baseline Array.  We also conducted a large survey for additional masers using the Green Bank Telescope (all of these telescopes are operated by the NRAO and funded by the NSF).  The ultimate goal is to measure the motions of the masers over years.  Maser motions will allow measurement of the 3-D motion of M31, enabling us to predict whether or not (and if so, when) M31 will collide with the Milky Way Galaxy.  We also conducted a detailed pan-chromatic study of the regions in M31 that produce masers in order to understand the physical conditions that favor water masers and to predict where additional water masers might be discovered.  Finally, we searched for ammonia and hydrogen in the star-forming regions of M31, but did not detect either.  This project employed and trained undergraduates, a graduate student, and a postdoctoral researcher.  Most of the participants in this project have taken the next step in their careers, both in and outside of academia.  This project has also supported members of traditionally under-represented groups in astrophysics.            Last Modified: 10/23/2016       Submitted by: Jeremiah K Darling]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
