<AbstractNarration>In this SFS Capacity Building project, the Center for Information and Systems Assurance (CISA) at Kansas State University, which is a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research (CAE-R), is collaborating with the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC) and Manhattan Area Technical College (MATC) to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity/information assurance curriculum appropriate for the different student bodies at the three institutions. Kansas State University is a public land-grant university with a high level of research activity. CGSC's mission is to educate military officers to support the Army's operational requirements. MATC is a two-year public institution of higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four courses constitute the overall curriculum being developed: Introduction to Information Assurance and Cybersecurity, Emerging Threats in Cyberspace, Advanced Cyber-Offense and -Defense Technologies, and Cyber-Warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected outcomes of the project are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* a comprehensive cybersecurity curriculum that addresses the challenge of educating and providing hands-on training to students of broad academic backgrounds;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* courses with innovative modules and lesson plans based on lab exercises, warfare, and cyber-threat scenarios that can seamlessly integrate security education content throughout different parts of existing information technology curricula;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* detailed instructional manuals to accompany each course module; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* enhancement of faculty expertise in cybersecurity at the partnering institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Course materials are being created, piloted, and evaluated at the three institutions, and are being made available to a wider audience via the Web. The investigators are also using connections with other regional colleges and leveraging other initiatives at Kansas State -- e.g., Research Experiences for Teachers (RET), GK-12 STEM Fellows, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), and Girls Researching Our World (GROW) -- to extend the reach of the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this SFS Capacity Building project, the Center for Information and Systems Assurance (CISA) at Kansas State University collaborated with the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC) to develop a cybersecurity/information assurance curriculum appropriate for the different student bodies at institutions with varied and diverse student populations. Curriculum modules were created, evaluated, incorporated into the broader CGSC information assurance curriculum, and co-taught by guest instructors visiting CGSC from Kansas State University. Student feedback was broadly enthusiastic and very positive.  A number of course modules were developed targeting student bodies at both Kansas State University and CGSC. The independent modules developed included basic knowledge about Intenet, common attacks on personal and public Internet gateways, targeted and broad attacks on people, such as phishing and malware, mobile phone security and privacy considerations, and industry standard defense technologies like firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection and prevention systems.    The accomplished goals include a set of educational modules that integrate into existing curricula and address the challenges of educating and providing hands-on training to students of broad academic backgrounds; detailed instructional manuals to accompany each course module; and improved faculty expertise in cybersecurity at the partnering institution. As part of the outcome from the project, Kansas State University established a student organization Cyber Defense Club (CDC) to allow students pursue more advanced cybersecurity technologies in a peer-learning environment.
