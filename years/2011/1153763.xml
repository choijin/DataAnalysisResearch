<AbstractNarration>The S-STEM Scholarship Program at EDP College of Puerto Rico supports 27 eligible, under-represented, low-income, and talented students at the undergraduate level on its two campuses and 7 graduate students on its main campus.  Scholarships for Information System students amount to $5,000   per year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives are:   1) Increase the number of recipients who complete their academic degree providing STEM scholarships and support services by at least 5% per year; 2) Increase retention rate to degree achievement throughout the project duration by at least 5% annually 3) Increase job placement rate of recipients by at least 10% every year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is modeled after the successful institutional retention approach known as VIDA, which has focused on first year students since 2009.  The VIDA student support services component is continued and strengthened throughout the S-STEM Project. It also provides an opportunity for talented students to enroll in programmatic bridges that allow moving from baccalaureate to the masters level through a fixed curriculum for this purpose. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Project enhances student support services at EDP College by broadening the participation of Hispanics in STEM fields.  These student support services and retention strategies can serve as a model to other Hispanic Serving Institutions. Disseminating the project outcomes advances the understanding of successful recruiting and retaining strategies, ensuring academic success for under-represented groups in technology careers, thus contributing to the economy and the professional resources within our society.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project "Promoting the Success of Hispanic Students in the Computer and Information Science Fields" awarded to EDP University of Puerto Rico had the following goals and objectves:</p> <p>1. Improved educational opportunities for students: Increase by at least 5% per year the number of recipients who complete their academic degree, by providing 31 students (6 Associate, 18 Baccalaurate, and 7 Master degree students) with STEM scholarships and support services.</p> <p>2. Increased retention rate&nbsp;of students to degree achievement by at least 5% annually throughout the project duration by offering coordinated, structured and sustained academic and administrative support services.</p> <p>3. Increase the numbers of well-educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national need: Increase the job placement rate of STEM scholarship recipients by at least 10% every year by providing coordinated, structured and sustained job placement services.</p> <p>4. Improved student support programas at institutions of higher education: Disseminate project practices, outcomes and success on retention practices via the Internet, printed media and at local and national professional conferences.</p> <p>In relation to goal 1, the project achieved a completion rate of 28.1% af the end of the first year, 22.2% after the second year, 30.7% after the third year, and 53.8% after the fourth year. In summary, the degree completion rate decreased initally by&nbsp;5.9%&nbsp;but by the end of the project it increased by 23.2%, resulting in a net increase of 17.27%,more than&nbsp;three times&nbsp;the expected rate of 5%.</p> <p>In reference to goal 2, there was a retention rate of 90.6% during the first year, 90.3% after the second year, 86.7% after the third year, and 92.3%&nbsp; by the end of the fourth year. Although there was an initial decrease in the&nbsp;retention rate of 3.6%, it&nbsp;increased by 5.6%&nbsp;by the end of the fourth year,&nbsp;resulting in a net increase of 2%. It is important to point out that the retention rate remained high, an average of 90% during the duration of the project.</p> <p>Wtih respect to goal 3,&nbsp;a 44.4% &nbsp;of project participants were employed in an information systems or computer technology related field after the first year, 75%&nbsp;after the second year, 65.2% after the third year, and 61.9% by the end of the fouth year. In&nbsp;conclusion, there was a great&nbsp;increase of 30.6% in the employmetn rate during the second year, a&nbsp;decrease of 9.8% in the third year, and another decrease of&nbsp;3.3% by the end of the last term, which results in a net increase of 17.46% for the four year period.</p> <p>In relation to goal 4,&nbsp;disemination of project practices, outcomes and success on retention practices were accomplished through the publication of a fifteen pages informational booklet, containing a summary of project activities,&nbsp;graphic images, statistical analysis of project data, and disclosure of project outcomes and results. A total of 3,700 copies of the booklet are being distributed among all of the campuses of EDP University in the cities of San Juan, San Sebastian, Manati, and Humacao. Distribution is also taking place at professional meetings and conferences. In addition, a web publication and presentation&nbsp;was created&nbsp;which can be accessed through EDP University's&nbsp;web portal (http://www.edpuniversity.edu/beca-s-stem).&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual Merit</p> <p>The project demonstrates how the retention and employment of Puerto Rican and Hispanic students can be achieved through structured and coordinated academic support services, mentoring and career counseling provided by other Puerto Rican professionals who serve as role models. In addition, it can provide&nbsp;new elements&nbsp;for comparison with similar approaches but under different contexts in the promotion of success of Hispanic students in STEM realted fields.</p> <p>Broader Impact</p> <p>The project serves as a model on the use of a&nbsp;mentoring approach, where the mentor provides advise, shares knowledge and experience, and instructs using a relaxed method of self-discovery to Puerto Rican and other Hispanic students pursuing a professional career int information systems and computer technology field. It contributes to the research and knowledge on the importance of having Puerto Rican and Hispanic professionals who serve as mentors and role models for the retention, academic success, and profesional development of these students.</p> <p>The dissemination of project activities and outcomes can contribute to better educational prarctices and strategies for the success of Puerto Rican students at other institutions of higher education. Finally,&nbsp;it can contribute to the professional development of IT professors and of other higher education professionals serving this population.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/22/2016<br>      Modified by: Miguel&nbsp;A&nbsp;Drouyn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479835287743_LogoProyectoS-STEm2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479835287743_LogoProyectoS-STEm2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="S-STEM Logo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479835287743_LogoProyectoS-STEm2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="S-STEM Logo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Logo of Project S-STEM of EDP University of Puerto Rico</div> <div class="imageCredit">Miguel Drouyn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Miguel&nbsp;A&nbsp;Drouyn</div> <div class="imageTitle">S-STEM Logo</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479835803957_image_ms1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479835803957_image_ms1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field trip to Microsoft"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479835803957_image_ms1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Field trip to Microsoft"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Field trip to Microsoft Operations in Puerto Rico by Project S-STEM of EDP University</div> <div class="imageCredit">Miguel Drouyn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Miguel&nbsp;A&nbsp;Drouyn</div> <div class="imageTitle">Field trip to Microsoft</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479836159282_2014-03-0618.37.16--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479836159282_2014-03-0618.37.16--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Conference to participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479836159282_2014-03-0618.37.16--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Conference to participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Conference on careers and certifications in the IT Field</div> <div class="imageCredit">Miguel Drouyn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Miguel&nbsp;A&nbsp;Drouyn</div> <div class="imageTitle">Conference to participants</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479836342577_fotovideoconferencia2SBA--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479836342577_fotovideoconferencia2SBA--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Video Conference"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1153763/1153763_10214809_1479836342577_fotovideoconferencia2SBA--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Video Conference"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Conference on development of own business at Videoconference room.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Miguel Drouyn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Miguel&nbsp;A&nbsp;Drouyn</div> <div class="imageTitle">Video Conference</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
