<AbstractNarration>1160854&lt;br/&gt;Smirnov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant supports acquisition of a 2G Enterprises 4K-755 high-resolution superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) with a small access bore (6 mm) at Michigan Technological University.  The small bore SRM allows for paleomagnetic directional and paleointensity analysis of single crystals of ancient (Precambrian) silicates hosting magnetic and paramagnetic fine grained mineral inclusions.  These igneous phase single crystals are likely to hold the most pristine record of Earth?s early magnetic field and yet to date very few reliable paleointensity measurements from Precambrian rocks have been made.  The analytical sensitivity now available with a small bore SRM makes proposed measurements possible.  The PI is in possession of numerous plagioclase separates from Precambrian dikes sampled around the word (e.g., the ~2.45 Ga Burakovka dikes (Russia), the ~2.9 Ga Munni-Munni intrusion and the ~2.42 Ga Widgiemooltha dikes (Western Australia), the ~2.37 Ga Bangalore dikes and the ~2.2 Ga Mahhubnagar dikes (India), and the ~1.1 Ga Portage Lake basalts (USA)) from previous NSF/EAR research support.  The PI is well poised to immediately make use of the requested small bore SRM for NSF/EAR funded research on the nature of Earth?s early magnetic field with implications for Precambrian tectonics and the generation and early behavior of the geodynamo; the magnetic field which shields the Earth surface from the highly energized solar wind and allowed for the evolution of Earth?s biota.  This instrument will be only the second of its kind in a U.S. academic laboratory.  The infrastructural impacts of this acquisition are very significant for the U.S. paleomagnetic research community.  The instrument will complement existing paleomagnetic analysis equipment in the PI?s lab and serve an active student research group including an active PI-undergraduate mentoring program at MTU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
