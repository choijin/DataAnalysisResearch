<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ion beam interactions with the bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) and the impacts of ion implantation on the surface bioactivity of BMGs. The research will (i) identify the key processes and variables for ion implantation towards bioactive BMGs, (ii) investigate the effects of ion implantation on both surface and electrochemical properties of BMGs, and (iii) study the biological activity of ion implanted BMGs, with a special focus relevant to the orthopedic applications of BMGs. These efforts will not only further our understanding of BMG-ion beam interactions, but also propel the advancement of BMGs as biomedical materials to address some of the unmet challenges in the orthopedic field, such as the bone tissue integration of implants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide an opportunity to create new functional and bioactive materials that are capable of forming direct biological bonding with cells through surface interactions. The results will be disseminated to enhance the scientific and technological understanding of BMGs, and to broaden BMG applications into biocompatible materials, which could potentially impact human health. The research will provide a unique opportunity for the PIs to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students in multidisciplinary areas of research, science, and engineering. Planned outreach activities include summer research program for teachers and pre-collegiate students to gain first-hand laboratory experience, and showcase of research endeavors at the interface of materials and biology in regional schools and local science museum.</AbstractNarration>
