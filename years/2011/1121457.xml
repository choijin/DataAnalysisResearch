<AbstractNarration>Preservation of biological tissues by freezing has application in fields ranging from reproductive technology to conservation of endangered species.  However, while scientists can successfully cryopreserve small living structures like eggs and embryos, application of those strategies to larger structures remains challenging.   The natural world can provide insights into overcoming those challenges.  Many "cold-blooded" animals encounter sub-freezing temperatures in their natural environment and, among the vertebrates, a few species have evolved physiological and biochemical strategies to survive freezing.  This project will study one of those species, Cope?s gray treefrog.  Freezing imposes daunting challenges for an animal, including potential physical damage from ice, fluctuating tissue oxygenation as the blood freezes and thaws, and disruption of molecular and cellular structures as liquid water freezes and body fluid concentrations change.  A key to surviving these challenges is regulation of the distribution of water and dissolved solutes.  Ice formation must be restricted to fluids outside of cells, and so water must be able to leave cells rapidly when freezing begins.  In addition, some solutes, such as glycerol are cryoprotective and help to preserve molecular and physiological integrity during freezing. Gray treefrogs present a natural model for unraveling the mechanisms behind these capabilities. During the cooling autumn months they accumulate glycerol.  They also regulate the expression of proteins ("aquaporins") that facilitate movement of water and glycerol across cell membranes.  This project will evaluate how these molecular mechanisms are regulated, what is the resulting impact on cellular properties, and how this contributes to freeze tolerance of the whole animal.  This integrative approach provides an excellent framework for training students from high school through PhD level in methods and ideas of molecular physiological regulation, and it will yield novel insights into the challenge of keeping tissues frozen alive.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ectothermic ("cold-blooded") animals have body temperatures that track environmental temperature.  Thus, when environmental temperatures drop to sub-freezing, ectotherms potentially risk freezing.  While most ectothermic animals that survive winter avoid that risk by migrating or seeking thermal refuges such as underground burrows, some actually tolerate being frozen.  Only a few ectothermic vertebrates, including several species of amphibians and reptiles, fall within this group.  Freezing imposes numerous challenges to physiological homeostasis.  Among these are cessation of oxygen delivery to tissues, metabolic suppression, physical damage from ice, and changing concentrations of body fluids as ice removes liquid water, leaving other solutes more concentrated.   For animals that survive freezing, a protective mechanism involves the accumulation of cryoprotective compounds.  These compounds help to reduce the freezing temperature, they may protect the structures of cellular biomolecules, and they may contribute to the ability of cells to regulate their volumes.  In the species we study&mdash;gray treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis (Fig. 1)&mdash;the compound glycerol accumulates during the cool months preceding sub-freezing winter.  That glycerol is likely synthesized by the liver and distributed to other tissues for uptake; in both cases (release and uptake), glycerol must cross cell membranes to exit or enter cells.  That transport is primarily accomplished in vertebrates by way of a family of proteins known as aquaporins, and particularly by a subfamily of aquaporins called glyceroporins (Fig. 2). Thus, gray treefrogs seasonally regulate the synthesis and transport of glycerol.  That phenomenon is the basis for our research:  What are the proteins in gray treefrogs that transport glycerol?  How is their cellular expression and function regulated?  How do changes in expression and function of those proteins contribute to the development of freeze tolerance (which is a characteristic of cold-acclimated treefrogs but not of warm-acclimated animals)?  To answer these questions, we have identified several aquaporin proteins in gray treefrogs, have characterized the function of those proteins and their expression in tissues of frogs from warm, cold, and frozen conditions, and have evaluated the function of cells expressing these proteins at different levels.  Treefrogs possess aquaporin proteins similar to mammals, including variants that facilitate transport of water and glycerol to varying degrees.  During transitions from warm to cold conditions, as glycerol accumulates and moves into cells as a cryoprotectant, expression of aquaporin proteins changes at both the RNA level and the protein level.  The specific signals that stimulate those changes remain undefined, but substantial changes in cell physiology, including movement of aquaporin proteins into the cell membrane (Fig. 3, 4) where they are functional, occur even while the frogs are at low body temperature.  Notably, the thermally-related pattern of expression of these proteins in the liver differs from other tissues, suggesting that liver has a unique role in glycerol metabolism.  We suspect that that role may change with conditions, for example, serving as a source of glycerol for distribution during cold acclimation (Fig. 5) but then taking glycerol back up during thawing, as the animal seeks to reestablish "normal" physiology or prepare for additional bouts of freezing.  Our results suggest that glyceroporins are regulated as a critical part of the development of freeze tolerance.  Our research has involved a diverse group of students, ranging from high school interns to doctoral candidates, and a high school teacher developed a teaching module for high school biology based on her time working on this project in our laboratories.  Students find natural fascination in the topic of freeze tolerance, including the possible applications to biomedical science, and we believe that the time spent on this project has catalyzed a lasting interest in science and research.
