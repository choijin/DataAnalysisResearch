<AbstractNarration>Symposium support for the meeting "Towards a Digital Society through Advanced Connectivity Infrastructure symposium" to be held in Santiago, Chile, May 3, 2011&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chile is the host country for numerous astronomical facilities, some of which are fully operational while others are under development and/or being planned.  Many of these observatories are funded, in whole or in part, by NSF. Recent technological increases in telescope and instrumental capabilities are enabling a rapid and very significant increase in the quality and quantity of digital astronomical data delivered by the observatories.  In recognition of this and the impact that the resultant data flow will have on Chile's broadband network infrastructure, a symposium is being held in Santiago, Chile where national and international experts along with representatives of Chilean government agencies will help develop the ideas for an advanced connectivity infrastructure that will serve not only NSF's investments but Chilean society as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  NSF Award: AST-1137176  "Towards a Digital Society through Advanced Connectivity Infrastructure" Symposium Project Outcomes Report  The "Towards a Digital Society through Advanced Connectivity Infrastructure" symposium aimed to present and discuss the elements behind a national broadband program and the drivers that make it feasible. The installation of the worldÆs largest astronomical investment in Chile, having 70% of the biggest optical telescopes by 2018, provides the scientific backdrop for major infrastructural development. Additional developments such as the major growth of retail and exports to regional countries, the spectacular growth of ChileÆs mining sector and its intensive automation, the imminent introduction of digital TV to Chile, and the evident progress coming from its insertion into education, provide an especially favorable environment for such an ambitious initiative. Hence, this international conference sought to address some of the scientific and technological requirements, such as high performance computing and business models that accompany these processes. National and international experts helped develop the ideas and set a foundation for the deployment of an advanced connectivity infrastructure, a cornerstone that will enable ChileÆs construction of a digital society.  The symposium successfully brought leaders in Chilean government, business, academia, and networking together with international experts in broadband development and the positive impacts that broadband can have in education, industry, and society in general.  The intellectual merit of the symposium was realized through the presentations and the ensuing discussions, documenting the positive impacts that broadband has provided in the US and Australia, and demonstrating the interest of the Chilean government and industry in participating in the development of similar initiatives in Chile.  The discussions held at the symposium, and the follow up meetings and continued contacts, including renewed interest through the return of Dr. H.E. Seidel, Assistant Director of NSF for Mathematical and Physical Sciences to Chile in January 2012, have the potential for revolutionary broader impact, supporting the development of a "digital society" in Chile through the development and deployment of advanced network connectivity throughout Chile.  The ideas presented were captured in the symposium website,  http://www.fundacionchile.com/cursos-y-seminarios/activa-chile-2011-conectividad-avanzada-para-una-sociedad-digital/  and these presentations can be referred to as the foundations for further discussions and development of ideas for investments in advanced connectivity infrastructure in Chile.
