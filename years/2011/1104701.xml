<AbstractNarration>Underlying the global economy is the ability to process information quickly and cheaply. The field of quantum information processing, which harnesses the unusual features of quantum physics, offers a novel approach to rapid encoding and manipulation of information. In this project, researchers from Middlebury College, Harvard, and University of Copenhagen create and investigate quantum bits (qubits) "the fundamental building blocks of quantum computation" formed from carbon nanotubes. The team of researchers exploits the unique properties of carbon nanotubes to manipulate and interrogate the qubits, with the goal of demonstrating coherent control of the fragile quantum states. The key properties of nanotubes that make them well suited for quantum information processing are themselves newly understood, and are a forefront area of fundamental physics. Those properties include spin-orbit coupling associated with circumferential motion around the nanotube, electron-nuclear coupling and the ability to control dephasing of electron spin. The project is a good balance between future potential applications in the exciting area of quantum information, and condensed matter physics in nanoscale electronics, as fundamental physics. Students involved in the project particularly appreciate the connection between fundamental and applied components of the activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of the project "quantum information processing" is inherently revolutionary. In addition, the project is designed to build on the exceptional strengths of liberal arts colleges and research universities in educating students and conducting research. Undergraduates perform a significant portion of the research, providing invaluable training for careers in physics. Research conducted at Harvard during the summer feeds directly into the curriculum at the PI's institution, Middlebury College, as students work in parallel on credit-bearing projects and senior theses and interact with their peers at Harvard. The aim is to foster a critical mass of students who are deeply engaged in all aspects of research, from collecting and analyzing data to presenting results, and who have the training and expertise necessary to excel in physics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Nature has given us a Periodic Table&rsquo;s worth of atoms with unique properties governed by the principles of quantum mechanics. Starting in the 1980s, humans have developed clever techniques for mimicking the properties of atoms by creating so-called artificial atoms. These are essentially designer materials in which charge can be confined in all three dimensions, just like an atom, but on length scales one-thousand to one-hundred-thousand times larger than a typical atom, making them easier to alter and probe using standard electronic equipment and circuit techniques. Artificial atoms create a window into the realm of quantum mechanics, one of the foundational theories of physics, making research in this field inherently fundamental. At the same time, research on artificial atoms is extremely practical in that tailor-made atoms can serve as the building blocks for an endless array of circuits that exploit the extraordinary properties of quantum mechanics. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Among the most important goals in this field is to design a quantum computer &ndash; a type of computer in which basic computations exploit the properties of quantum mechanics in order to drastically speed up calculations. Problems which are inconceivable to solve with a standard computer, including certain types of code-breaking, become feasible with a quantum computer. Of the many pathways currently being pursued to design and build a quantum computer, one of the most promising uses artificial atoms and related structures as the fundamental computational building blocks. These building blocks are known as quantum bits, or qubits. Projects supported by this grant are aimed at improving the detection of qubit states and at exploring the underlying physics that is essential to understand as we design the next generation of qubits.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the layout of the first type of artificial atom measured in this study. The artificial atom is created within a carbon nanotube &ndash; a narrow tube-like structure formed entirely from carbon atoms (the carbon nanotube is not shown in the figures). Given the geometry of a tube, charge is inherently restricted to move along a single dimension. To mimic the behavior of an atom, the charge must be further restricted along the length of the nanotube so that it is confined in all three dimensions. &nbsp;The gold regions radiating outward in Fig. 1 are metal leads used for confining charge along the nanotube and for allowing charge to move on and off of the tube. Figure 2 shows a magnified view of the innermost region of the artificial atom structure (the scale bar, 1 um, equals one-millionth of a meter). After the structure is created and a carbon nanotube is grown on top of the striped region in Fig. 2, we couple the structure to neighboring circuit elements that allow us to detect the quantum state of the artificial atom and tune the detection circuit to increase the sensitivity of the measurements. This project has allowed us to develop sensitive techniques for measuring the quantum states of artificial atoms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the layout of the second type of artificial atom measured in this study. For these devices, the starting material is a semiconducting InGaAs/InAs heterostructure &ndash; a type of material that confines the motion of the charge to a two-dimensional plane when the material is cooled to low temperature. To mimic the behavior of an atom, charge must be further confined to a restricted area, known as a quantum dot, corresponding to the oval-shaped, central grey region in Fig. 3. The confinement of charge is brought about by applying voltages to metallic gates G1 &ndash; G8 which are situated above the two-dimensional plane of charge. Charge is able to move on and off of the quantum dot via normal charge reservoirs marked &lsquo;N&rsquo; in the figure. Charge is also able move on and off of the quantum dot via special charge reservoirs marked &lsquo;S&rsquo; in which the charge exists in a unique quantum state known as a superconductor. In Fig. 4a we show the conductance, G, as a function of magnetic field applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane of charge &ndash; a quantity related to the ease with which charge can move on and off of the quantum dot. Figure 4b shows deviations from average values. Measurements like these allow us to probe the subtle interplay between different quantum states of matter.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Undergraduate physics majors at Middlebury College have been involved in all aspects of the project, including the development of a sophisticated lab exercise (Fig. 5) that will introduce future generations of physics majors to experimental techniques used in top research labs throughout the world. Projects like these give students the training they need in order to pursue advanced degrees in physics and careers in industry.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/26/2017<br>      Modified by: Susan&nbsp;K&nbsp;Watson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1104701/1104701_10122315_1510430565562_CNTDevice_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1104701/1104701_10122315_1510430565562_CNTDevice_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CNT Device_Fig1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1104701/1104701_10122315_1510430565562_CNTDevice_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CNT Device_Fig1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1  Optical image of device for creating artificial atom from carbon nanotube.
