<AbstractNarration>This award supports the United States delegation to the Fourth International Conference of Women in Physics in Stellenbosch, South Africa in April 2011.   The purpose of the Stellenbosch conference (ICWIP 2011) is three-fold: (i) to provide an opportunity to view and analyze the current status of and progress in promoting women in physics in each country and internationally; (ii) to provide an arena for women in physics to share their scientific accomplishments and create international scientific collaborations; and (iii) to build capacity in each participating country to design and implement changes that improve the participation and advancement of women in physics. In collaboration with conference organizer Dr. Igle Gledhill at the Center for Science and Industry Research in Pretoria, South Africa, the U.S. delegation will provide support for the conference as well as continue the advancement of women and girls in the U.S. physics enterprise.   The series of international conferences on women in physics is proving to be an effective mechanism for sharing best practices internationally, empowering action in numerous countries and regions including the US, nucleating networking in research, strengthening accountability through the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics(IUPAP), and increasing the numbers and advancement of women in the field.  The U.S. delegates will be able learn about and take advantage of successful initiatives piloted in ~70 other countries.  This award is co-funded by the Division of Physics, the Division of Astronomical Sciences, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
