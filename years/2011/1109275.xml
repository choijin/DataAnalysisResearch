<AbstractNarration>AST-1109180/1109275/1108790&lt;br/&gt;Kahniashvili/Ratra/Kosowsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations show that galaxies have magnetic fields with a component that is coherent over a large fraction of the galaxy, with defined field strength and coherence scale.  Understanding the origin of these fields is one of the more challenging questions of modern astrophysics.  There are currently two pictures: a bottom-up (astrophysical) one, generating the seed field on smaller scales, and a top-down (cosmological) version, generating the seed field prior to galaxy formation on scales that are now large.  This project aims to answer several relevant questions: (i) How and when was the magnetic field generated? (ii) How does it evolve during the expansion of the universe? (iii) Can the amplitude and statistical properties of this seed magnetic field explain the properties of the observed magnetic fields in large-scale structures? (iv) Is the seed magnetic field detectable through cosmological observations? And if so, (v) what are the observational constraints on such a primordial magnetic field?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary project divides into the following related parts: (1) determining intergalactic magnetic field limits from currently available data; (2) studying cosmological large-scale correlated magnetic field generation mechanisms; (3) numerically studying the evolution of the magnetic field during the expansion of the universe; (4) numerically studying seed magnetic field amplification and dynamics during galaxy formation; and (5) predicting observable signatures of a cosmological seed magnetic field.  This unique team of experts will significantly improve the current understanding of the origin, evolution, observational limits, and predicted signatures, of a cosmic magnetic field.  The research includes important work in high energy physics, data analysis and interpretation, numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic processes, and galaxy and early structure formation.  Perhaps most importantly, there is a chance to establish that observations demand a cosmological magnetic field that cannot be generated by any mechanism operating within the confines of the Standard Model of particle physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational aspects include the training of undergraduate and graduate students.  A vigorous education and public outreach program involves the North Central Kansas Astronomical Society, the KSU Center for the Understanding of Origins, Theodore Roosevelt Elementary School (Manhattan, Kansas), Allegheny Observatory at the University of Pittsburgh, the Stanford University 'Splash!' events for high school students, and Pittsburg State University outreach events.  And, as part of an international collaboration, the primary PI will conduct cosmology education sessions for undergraduate students at Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory, Georgia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the course of this project we have studied cosmological models of dark energy and magnetic fields and have used observational measurements to constrain them. In particular we have used observational data to measure the values of various physical parameters that characterize these models, as well as other cosmological parameters.   Perhaps our most striking result comes from a compilation of 28 independent measurements of the Hubble parameter between redshifts 0.07 &le; z &le; 2.3. These measurements by themselves require a currently accelerating cosmological expansion at better than 3&sigma; confidence. They also allow us to measure the redshift of the cosmological deceleration-acceleration transition, z da = 0.74 &plusmn; 0.05, in good agreement with what is expected in the standard dark energy cosmological model.  Other signifiacnt findings include: (i) The discovery that a lower value of the Hubble constant removes the need for a dark radiation component; (ii) In the presence of spatially curved hypersurfaces current observational data can be consistent with a dark energy density that slowly varies in time and space; and, (iii) Even accounting for the observed non-Gaussianity of the 7Li abundance measurements (which we pointed out), these measurements differ from what is expected on the basis of standard big bang nucleosynthesis.
