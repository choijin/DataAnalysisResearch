<AbstractNarration>This proposal establishes the Four College Biomathematics Consortium: a collaboration among four undergraduate institutions (Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, Amherst College, and Hampshire College) with a long tradition of excellence and a commitment to research-centered education. Two of these institutions are women?s colleges. All four have a demonstrated commitment to expanding opportunities for women, underrepresented groups and first-generation students in scientific fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Consortium will help train the next generation of biomathematicians. A two-year research-intensive program will be developed, building on a strong existing infrastructure for cross-campus collaborations, in which student teams move through a series of curricular offerings and mentored research opportunities.  The emphasis throughout is on: a) a succession of developmentally appropriate courses and research opportunities; b) a team-centered approach that unites student teams and mentoring teams in several multi-year research collaborations; and c) the creation of a multi-layered cohort of biomathematics students at various stages of training.  Led by mentoring teams composed of both life scientists and mathematicians, the students will explore problems at all scales of biological organization, ranging from the intricacies of protein folding to the complexities of water and material flows in forest ecosystems.  These projects share a unifying theme,the consideration of potential and realized shape spaces, and emphasize geometric approaches to the exploration of biological problems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program advances the national STEM agenda by training 50 undergraduates in biomathematics and by generating online pedagogical materials (curricula, exercises and training modules) that can be exploited by the broader community. The program will also serve as a potential exportable model for multi-institutional collaboration in the training of undergraduates in biomathematics and other emerging scientific fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The explosion of knowledge and data in the life sciences -- produced at all scales of biological organization, from the molecular to the global-- is one of the leading phenomena of 21st century biological science. Extracting meaning from these complex systems, and turning them into useful descriptions (of, for example, the fine structure of protein active sites or the climate impacts of changes in seasonal patterns) demands mathematical thinking, mathematical modeling and new mathematical tools.  A new field is emerging at the interface of the life sciences and the quantitative sciences, but real progress in that field will not come from simply bringing traditionally trained mathematicians together with traditionally trained scientists. Instead, we need a new cohort of biomathematicians, explicitly trained at that interface.     To build that cohort, the Four College Biomathematics Consortium (4CBC), supported by the NSF Undergraduate Biomathematics training grant, together with the Five Colleges, Inc., created an active biomath community across four campuses: Smith College, Amherst College, Mount Holyoke College and Hampshire College.  During the grant period, the consortium developed 38 research projects involving collaboration between faculty and students across mathematical and life sciences. 67 NSF UBM research students participated over the six years of the grant and their work resulted in over 17 peer-reviewed publications and 40 honors theses. Over 30 students participated in the biomath research projects but did not make the fellowship commitment or were ineligible for funding through this grant. Projects spanned the range of biological scales from molecular level studies (examples include the kinetics of protein folding and modeling dynein motor protein transport dynamics), to GIS based modeling of infectious disease transmission, to the geometry of an ecological arms race. So far 17 of the 36 graduated program fellows are pursuing PhD or MD/PhD programs and 4 have pursued Master?s degrees in biomath related fields.     The 4CBC institutionalized the Biomathematical Sciences in the Five Colleges (the previous four colleges and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst) by creating the Five College Biomathematical Sciences Certificate Program.  Students in the certificate program complement their major field of focus (life sciences or quantitative sciences) through coursework in the reciprocal field.  They also engage in research projects that bridge life sciences and quantitative sciences, culminating in a capstone project that integrates their coursework and experiential learning. This program includes the gateway Frontiers in Biomathematics course, developed through the grant collaborations. The course introduces students to modeling software (Matlab or R) during a 4-week bootcamp.  This is followed by three-week modules that introduce students to two biomath research questions to which they can apply the modeling tools they have learned during the bootcamp.  These modules often include data collection and lab work and serve to recruit students to longer term participation in the research projects. The certificate program together with the Frontiers program are maintained by the biomath community created through the 4CBC grant.
