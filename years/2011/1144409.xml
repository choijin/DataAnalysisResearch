<AbstractNarration>One of the unique features of neurons that make learning and memory possible is their ability to alter their shape to make contact with other neurons.  The ability of neurons to alter their shape to form these contacts is dependent on the regulation of the cytoskeleton ? a highly dynamic network of intracellular filaments that provide a function analogous to bones in the human body.  Because of its role in regulating neuronal shape, the cytoskeleton is believed to play a critical role in several nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer?s disease.  In spite of the importance of the cytoskeleton in neurons, it is unclear whether all of the cytoskeletal filaments in neurons have been identified.  The PI has conducted a genome wide-screen for novel filament-forming proteins.  This screen identified one protein that forms filaments in the cellular extensions called axons that connect neurons to each other suggesting that this protein has a cytoskeletal function.  Surprisingly, this filament-forming protein, CTP synthase, is also responsible for synthesizing nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, arguing that CTP synthase is an unusual protein with two distinct functions.  The goal of this proposal is to use powerful genetic approaches to identify mutant forms of CTP synthase that are selectively defective in the ability to form filaments.  These mutants will be used to determine if the ability of CTP synthase to form filaments is necessary for neurons to form functional connections.  The identification of a novel component of the neuronal cytoskeleton will have broad implications for our understanding of how neuronal connections are formed and will open a new area for cell biological research.  Furthermore, graduate and undergraduate researchers will be integrated into all aspects of the project providing an opportunity to train the next generation of scientists in a cutting-edge area of neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  An essential feature of neuronal function is the ability to form functionally distinct cellular processes &ndash; axons and dendrites.  While the cytoskeleton is known to play a critical role in specifying both axons and dendrites, there have been no systematic screens for novel cytoskeletal elements that contribute to neuronal differentiation and function.  As part of a genome wide screen for novel filament forming proteins, the PI has identified one protein whose ability to form filaments is conserved from bacteria to humans.  Surprisingly, this protein is the enzyme CTP synthase - the sole enzyme responsible for CTP synthesis.  The fact that a metabolic enzyme is capable of forming large intracellular polymers suggests that this protein might have dual functions in both nucleotide metabolism and the cytoskeleton.  Consistent with this, CTP synthase filament formation is restricted to axons in rat hippocampal neurons and bacterial CTP synthase filaments play a role in regulating the bacterial cell shape (Figure 1).      Our initial goal was to use a genetic screening strategy in yeast to identify mutations that alter CTP synthase polymerization and/or enzyme activity.  We identified 15 regulatory mutations that had a range of effects on the ability of CTP synthase to form filaments.  This set of mutations now provides a novel toolkit for manipulating the extend of filament formation in nneurons and other cell types to determine if CTP synthase filaments have acquired additional cytosksletal functions.  Furthermore, our studies revealed that mutations that disrupted the ability of CTP synthase to form active tetramers strongly promoted filament formation arguing that the filaments are comprised of inactive dimers.  These results have been published allowing other investigators to utilize this reagent set for further studies of CTP synthase.   Since our screen did not identify any mutations that cleanly separated enzyme activity from polymerization, we examined whether there were additional metabolic enzymes that might form novel filament structures in neurons.  This work led us to the discovery of a novel nuclear structure comprised of a metabolic enzyme.  Assembly of this enzyme is highly regulated in neurons and other cell types. This discovery significantly broadens the possible roles of metabolic filaments in neurons and other cell types.
