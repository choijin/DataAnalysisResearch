<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaborative effort with scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to develop a real-time model for specifying and forecasting the state of Earth's radiation belt.  The project will utilize data assimilation methods in conjunction with physical models and modern machine learning techniques to examine the acceleration, transport and loss processes for energetic electrons in the radiation belt.  The resulting model will include confidence limits on the system-wide forecasts, making the results useful for operational space weather predicitions.  The project will benefit society by making improved radiation-belt predictions at reduced operational costs and the forecasts will be made freely available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a strong educational and teaching component through the participation of graduate students at the University of Colorado.  In addition the research will be integrated with the Los Alalmos Space Science Outreach (LASSO) program, which offers teacher training to underrepresented groups and individuals with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>

We have learned and used a Kalman filter to describe the dynamic behavoir of the relativistic electrons trapped in the Earth's magnetosphere, to identify and quantify the acceleration mechanisms and their relative contributions to the enhancmenet of the energetic electrons, which also have significant space weather application because these energetic electrons have harmful effects on satellite subsystems and also on the astronauts when they perform extra vehicluar activity.   Specifically, for example, we used a Kalman filter with inputs of 1) energetic electron phase space density (PSD) for constant first and second adiabatic invariants from a five satellite data set (three LANL-GEO, one GPS, and Polar), and 2) a one-dimensional radial diffusion model with loss and source terms included.

We analyzed five storm periods spanning from July 30th to October 24th of 2002, and each periodÃ†s unique solution in the location-width parameter space was assimilated with the Kalman filter for a continuous reanalysis of the full 87 day period.

The source was found to peak in the recovery phases of the storms where the rate was sufficient to repopulate the radiation belt in approximately one day, suggesting that local heating was a major contributor to the electron radiation belts during the recovery phase.  The above is just part of the research results, which have been published in peer-reviewed journals.       Last Modified: 07/06/2016       Submitted by: Xinlin Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
