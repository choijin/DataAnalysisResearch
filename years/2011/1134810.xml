<AbstractNarration>Full Proposal for an I/UCRC for Energy Efficient Electronic Systems &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1134867 SUNY at Binghamton; Baghat Sammakia &lt;br/&gt;1134810 Villanova University; Alfonso Ortega &lt;br/&gt;1134821 University of Texas-Arlington; Dereje Agonafer &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Energy Efficient Electronic Systems will focus on optimizing energy utilization in electronic systems. SUNY at Binghamton, Villanova University and the University of Texas at Arlington are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with SUNY at Binghamton as the lead institution &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will focus on the development of systematic methodologies for operating electronic systems, including data centers, as dynamic self sensing and regulating systems that are predictive and verified in real time. Algorithms will be developed to control cooling resources and to assist expert system schedulers to schedule and/or migrate workload to achieve optimal energy consumption. Thermal management resources will also be allocated dynamically in response to system needs. Problem-oriented research related to Thermal Management Protocols, Software Systems, Control Systems, and Implementation and Assessment, will be addressed during the Center's first five year program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will enable a significant reduction in energy consumption in electronic systems, including data centers, thereby potentially reducing electrical power consumption across the nation. This will, in turn, reduce the nations consumption of carbon-based fuels and related emissions. The center will attract a diverse group of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, by providing industrially-relevant training required by graduates entering the workforce. The proposed center is committed to attracting talented and motivated students from all groups, and will integrate a variety of mechanisms across the partners, including enhancement of existing minority pipeline programs to exceed participation by women and under-represented students. The center also intends to leverage existing programming on its campuses to engage K-12 students in conversation on energy conservation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded the NSF Center for Energy Smart Electronic Systems (ES2) at Villanova University.  ES2 is a collaborative university/industry research center in which universities and companies work together to solve the energy efficiency issues facing the data center market.  Villanova is one of four university sites in the center, and brings five industrial members to the center.  Over the duration of the five-year grant, the Villanova faculty team and their industry partners have worked on several activities that are impactful to data center design.  These include the development of a software tool which can analyze the energy inefficiencies in a data center.  This software (VTAS) has been of great interest to the industry members and Villanova is looking into commercialization opportunities.  Thus, this software development has been of significant intellectual merit.  Other research done by ES2 faculty and students has included the creation of thermodynamic models which predict how changes in operating conditions affect the energy efficiency of data center equipment and how the equipment can be improved to increase efficiency.  Additionally, the team has investigated how the heat coming of the servers can be captured and reused elsewhere in the system to reduce energy needs and improve overall system efficiency.  This research has led to numerous scientific insights with significant intellectual merit. Some of these include:  The team found that the use of liquid cooling for direct heat removal from computer chips outperforms close-coupled air cooling technologies (e.g. in-door heat exchangers, overhead heat exchangers, and rear door heat exchangers), which in turn outperform the more traditional cooling approach where the cooling equipment is located far away from the racks (e.g. computer room air handlers &ndash; CRAHs).  The development of a simple analytical model which can accurately capture the response of air-water cross-flow heat exchangers to changes in inlet fluid temperatures.  The model was fully validated using experimental data and can be used to predict system performance over a wide range of operating conditions.  A thermoeconomic analysis of the many different possible waste heat recovery systems which can be applied in data centers showed the he most economical solutions are power creation using an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and chilled water creation using absorption refrigeration. Waste heat recovery is found to be more beneficial when liquid cooling is used compared to traditional air cooling. The team has built a lab scale ORC and is validating the previous analysis. The use of warm water cooling systems in which there is no chiller in the system is proven to exhibit high efficiencies. A tradeoff exists between the system efficiency and computer chip temperature, which can be shown to be minimized by using thermal storage.    The broader impacts of the Villanova ES2 center research fall into many different areas. First, the research results have been widely shared through numerous journal and conference publications and presentations. The team is in the middle of filing two ideas through either patent or software copyright  protection, and is investigating the commercialization of the software with member companies.

Three more PhD graduations are expected in the near future. Third, the work has enabled development of one-of-a-kind experimental test equipment that can enable further research in data center cooling system evaluation. Finally, the center enabled Villanova to hold a Data Center Day in 2016, where the university hosted several data center industry representatives to discuss their work with each other and with Villanova students.  Villanova obtained several Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) supplements to enable eight undergraduate researchers, some from underrepresented groups, to learn and contribute to data center research.
