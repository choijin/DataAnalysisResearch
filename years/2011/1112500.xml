<AbstractNarration>Daniel Neuhauser of UCLA is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program for work to develop a theoretical methodology to explore molecular nanopolaritonics with a large number of molecules. Molecular Nanopolaritonics intends to unify the treatment of radiation and matter on the nano scale.  A previous award on this subject has introduced the concept of a unified treatment of matter and radiation on the nanoscale with arbitrary geometries and predicted that molecules will have large designed responses which can manipulate at will the transport of radiation in plasmon carrying structures.  The present research unifies molecular and electromagnetic treatments on a larger scale through the development of theories that handle multitude of molecules with explicit time-dependent treatments and study the interaction with, and effects of, molecules and electromagnetic plasmons.  The proposal tackles the difficult problem of embedding molecules directly on top of plasmon carrying structures, necessitating the development of multi-scale approaches that employ a detailed time-dependent orbital or density-matrix treatments in an inner region, supplemented by orbital-free or Maxwell studies on outer scales.  The approaches use a time-dependent analogue of complex-Poisson descriptions, thereby significantly increasing the time-step of FDTD and making it commensurate with that of electronic dynamics.  Further, new embedding techniques allow for designed orbital-free descriptions of plasmonics structures with the correct frequency response, thereby allowing large-scale embedding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two disparate phenomena associated with radiation on the small scale.  Metal structures support propagating plasmons, and molecules, whether few separate ones or large clusters, interact by dipole-induced fields.  Nanopolaritonics is a recent name for the field which aims to unify the treatment.  A well known direction is the effect on the molecules due to the interaction with the strong fields generated by the metal plasmons (which can be magnified by orders of magnitude in specific geometries, especially involving corners).  However, Nanopolaritonics also includes the equally important and little-explored other direction, whereby molecules influence the propagation of plasmon waves.  The PI with his group have shown in simulations  that the effects are strong in both directions.  At present they develop embedding approaches whereby adsorbed molecules are described quantum mechanically as well as the underlying adsorbing structure. Bigger regions are described by more approximate methods, such as orbital-free methods or Maxwell treatments, modified to concentrate on small scales.  Applications of the methodology will be plenty: gating of plasmonics transport, sensing of individual molecules individually and through their effects on plasmons, non-linear phenomena and their effects on localized radiation transfer and absorption by adsorbed molecules.  The most important feature is that this research unifies the two disparate fields of radiation and electronic dynamics, which taken together with realistic treatments, can exhibit novel physical features beyond perturbative or model-type treatments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Grant 1112500 was used to develop SQC, together with the groups of Roi Baer (Jerusalem) and Eran Rabani (UC Berkeley).  SQC is a new paradigm for electronic structure and dynamics, which yields results of traditional quantum chemistry methods at mostly linear scaling.  The key is to replace the full list of the molecular orbitals (where pairs of electrons reside) by a few stochastic functions, each of which is a combination of all the relevant molecular orbitals, without even determining the latter!  For example, in stochastic-DFT (sDFT) the electron density is obtained by averaging the densities from the stochastic orbitals; the number of stochastic sampling does not increase, and is even reduced, for bigger systems due to self-averaging, so that a 10-times bigger system requires at most 10 times more effort and often less.  In addition to stochastic DFT, the SQC paradigm led to the development of a general set of stochastic techniques for correlated methods:  Stochastic-TDDFT leads to efficient and linear-scaling calculation of  absorption envelopes of molecules for very large systems.    Stochastic-G0W: The G0W approach is considered the best practically achievable method for electron affinities and ionization energies.  The method, in essence, starts from any DFT approximation and corrects the energies by looking at how an energy level propagation is modified by the overall response of the electron sea.  SQC recasts GW in a simple stochastic language, where all the quantities are evaluated simultaneously stochastically, and achieves accuracies which are as good as in the literature for very large systems, including 3000 electrons at present (and more later).    Stochastic Bethe-Salpeter:  Just like G0W is highly accurate for ionization, the Bethe-Salpeter approach is the golden standard for the optical spectra, i.e., the detailed color response of molecules and materials.  As part of the grant, a simple but accurate stochastic Bethe Salpeter approach was developed.  The approach as written handles well systems with up to 10K electrons, much bigger than previous methods.  Stochastic Exact exchange: Further, SQC solves long-term deficiency of DFT for large systems by giving a practical way to include exact exchange (whereby the artificial interaction of an electron with itself is removed).  Specifically, it is well established that to get accurate chemical results one needs to include exact exchange in DFT.  But exact exchange is, however, very expensive so that large scale simulations (especially of excitations) are generally restricted to the simplest and least accurate DFT methods.  In SQC the challenge is solved by a stochastic formulation which replaces both the molecular orbitals and their interaction by a (stochastic) set of cheap separable interactions.  The approach is not much costlier than a local method which does not have exchange,  yet it provides a much more accurate description of the energies needed in removing or adding an electron to a molecule.  This was illustrated for dense silicon clusters exceeding 3000 electrons.  In conclusion, in the short few years since the development of SQC within the CHE-1112500 grant, it was demonstrated that several electronic structure methods which were previously sought impractical for large systems are already, or could quickly become, quite achievable.  The new stochastic paradigm is expected to influence the whole of electronic structure methodology over the next decade due to its improved scaling which makes it relatively even more favorable as computing power increases.  The broad impact of this development are clear.  The methods developed will yield better description of materials and molecules, under real-life conditions such as small clusters, dislocations, and not just for perfect crystlas of small molecules, thus making it possible to invent new materials with desired technological and physical properties.
