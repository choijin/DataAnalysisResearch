<AbstractNarration>In pursuit of improving our understanding of the universe by studying the constituents of dark matter, the research objective of this award is to increase the current detection sensitivity of dark matter-nucleon scattering by a factor of about 100 in order to measure the cross-section between Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and nucleons or to severely restrict theoretically favorable parameter space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve this objective, the SuperCDMS experiment must maintain a background environment of less than one event. This group will advance analysis techniques to discriminate electromagnetic backgrounds from dark matter signals using the new interleaved Z-sensitive Ionization and Phonon (iZIP) detectors which are scheduled to be deployed at Soudan. In addition, they are performing calculations and developing simulations to estimate the irreducible internal background from alpha-n and fission interactions in materials immediately surrounding the SuperCDMS detectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The award will also fund an outreach program that will increase the public's appreciation for science. In pursuit of this goal, the educational objective is to use SuperCDMS to support secondary teachers through the QuarkNet program and create research opportunities for undergraduates at SMU. Students and postdoctoral scholars working on this project will receive strong scientific and educational preparation in the techniques of low temperature physics, high energy physics and astrophysics and the analysis of data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Results from this research have been driving dark matter limits to increasingly unprecedented territory.  This research when combined with the null results from the LHC has resulted in the exclusion of numerous favored SUSY dark matter particle candidates.  As a result, we are  now in a situation where theorists are challenging some of their long preconceptions about dark matter.    We were involved in the publication of 19 articles.  Publications that members of our group took lead roles in efforts to demonstrate through analyses the discrimination power of the new iZIP detectors, the analysis of the first low mass WIMP search from SuperCDMS, results from the CDMSlite detectors and the SuperCDMS SNOLAB sensitivity paper.  We also published a study characterizing radon-plate out onto polyethylene and copper.  Our group developed algorithms to characterize backgrounds that were difficult to distinguish from dark matter.    We also progressed the SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment and lead the first analysis to use a profile likelihood to analyze SuperCDMS data to search for high mass WIMPs.  The faculty, postdocs and students working on this analysis were involved in and took lead roles the optimization of the design of the SuperCDMS SNOLAB shield and the background characterization and material selection program for the SuperCDMS SNOLAB project.  Over the course of this grant, we trained 4 graduate students (2 completed, 2 continuing), 7 undergraduate students and 3 high school teachers.  Our group welcomes diversity.  Of our students, 1 graduate student was female, 3 undergraduates were female and one of our teachers was female.  Taking all of our students into account, one of the undergraduate students identified as Mexican.  We also supported 2 postdocs over the course of this grant, one of whom was female.
