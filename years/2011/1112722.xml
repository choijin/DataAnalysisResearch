<AbstractNarration>The academic community is addressing science questions as described, for example, in the 1996 Future of Marine Geology and Geophysics (FUMAGES) report, that require short- and long-term deployments of large numbers of ocean-bottom seismometers and/or ocean-bottom hydrophones. In addition to supporting research funded through the NSF Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) Marine Geology &amp; Geophysics Core Program, there is increasing use of ocean bottom seismometers by the EarthScope, Continental Dynamics, Ocean Drilling Program, and GeoPRISMS Programs. To provide the large number of instruments needed to support these programs, maintain the necessary technical capability, and provide access to Ocean-Bottom Seismic Instruments for a broad user community, the Ocean-Bottom Seismic Instrument Pools (OBSIP) were established in 1999. In light of the continuing demand for ocean bottom seismometers, the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program of OCE invited proposals to establish a Management Office for OBSIP (OMO). The OMO will provide essential improvements in oversight and management for OBSIP. Broader impacts of the OMO include its inherent contribution to the U.S. science infrastructure, support for the broad scientific objectives of the Marine Geology &amp; Geophysics Program, and its specific contribution to scientific objectives that have particularly high societal relevance, such as earthquake hazards in the Cascadia region  Washington, Oregon and Northern California.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><h1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</h1> <p>The Ocean Bottom Seismograph Instrument Pool (OBSIP) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) instrument facility first formed in 1999 to provide ocean bottom seismometers for research in marine geology, seismology, and geodynamics. The OBSIP facility enabled more researchers to access this specialized seismic instrumentation. The instruments are built, maintained, and deployed by three institutional instrument contributors (IICs): the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). In 2012, the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) was awarded the management responsibilities for OBSIP to develop subaward agreements with each IIC, monitor scientific, technical, and fiscal performance for each subaward, improve community governance, transparency, and efficiency, and to further democratize the use of ocean bottom seismometers. Broadening the marine seismic research community helps achieve the ultimate goal of OBSIP: exceptional scientific results.</p> <h1>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intellectual Merit</h1> <p>Many of the frontier research goals of the seismology community involve crossing coasts and reaching into the oceans. Marine seismic work is challenging, and the reward for such work is ground breaking and impactful science that provides greater understanding of earthquake and faulting behavior and Earth&rsquo;s structure and dynamics, particularly in areas of significant societal impact such as the Cascadia subduction zone. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The IRIS OMO worked closely with a number of stakeholders to facilitate research using the OBSIP instruments in support of marine seismic science. Instrument requests from the research community were handled by the OMO to produce preliminary budgets. When experiments were funded by NSF, the OMO handled scheduling amongst the IICs based on instrument availability, required capabilities, ship availability, and work load. Finally, the OMO worked with the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) to schedule the necessary ship-time for instrument deployment and recovery, as well as air-gun surveys when those were required.</p> <p>The OBSIP OMO provided an effective interface to the research community to address data issues. This involved coordinating with scientists, the IICs, and the IRIS Data Management Center (DMC) where all OBSIP data are archived. To support the mission of OBSIP, data uploads needed to be timely, accurate, and in accessible formats. The OMO provided an independent review of uploaded datasets, which resulted in improved data quality. Limited errors were corrected prior to release, any issues found post-upload were documented and investigated, and multiple methods were used to inform the community of data issues and changes. Data products like azimuthal orientations of the horizontal sensors and noise analysis to inform instrument deployment and development were produced and distributed. The OMO also engaged with the research community by attending and presenting at scientific meetings and conferences &ndash; covering topics such as facility status and data quality.</p> <p>The OBSIP OMO enabled technical exchange between instrument groups among the IICs and IRIS. Engineers at the three IICs participated in teleconferences and the Technical Interchange Meetings organized by IRIS in 2015 and 2016. Presentations and discussions on common issues of power, timing, sensors, data storage, and other seismic engineering topics were fruitful in distributing knowledge and expertise among groups in marine, portable, and global seismology as well as magnetotellurics. Engineering projects at IICs were developed, reviewed, and undertaken to advance the reliability and resilience of instrumentation, improve data quality and timing, allow for safer deployment of instruments, and to extend duration of deployments in order to collect more data with less ship time.</p> <h1>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broader Impacts</h1> <p>IRIS leveraged its strong history and practice of community governance by modeling the OBSIP Oversight Committee on existing IRIS governance committees. This governance model ensured the involvement of scientific researchers in instrument development, scientific targets of community interest, broadening the user base, and other directives.</p> <p>The IRIS OMO organized a science symposium in each of 2013, 2015, and 2017 to promote the science using ocean bottom seismometers and discuss community needs. &nbsp;Members of the OBSIP Oversight Committee developed robust scientific programs with cutting-edge research representing a range of geoscience topics. The symposiums drew more than 100 people, with strong early career and international participation.</p> <p>In addition to presentations at the symposia, student and early career researchers were invited to participate on cruises and community planning workshops. The OBSIP user community has grown significantly, in part due to successful community experiments like the Cascadia Initiative and the ongoing Alaska Amphibious Array. Freely available community datasets have made it easier to access and use OBS data, thus engaging researchers who previously only used seismic data collected on land.</p> <p>The OBSIP OMO was operated by IRIS from February 2012 to September 2019. Over seven years, the OBSIP supported or was involved in 21 experiments, 55 cruises, and 1200 deployments of individual sensors resulting in numerous scientific publications. To achieve the OBSIP mission, IRIS took advantage of its resources in community governance, technical interchange, and public engagement. A final OBSIP report is available at: www.iris.edu/hq/publications/proposals_and_reviews.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/07/2019<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;L&nbsp;Woodward</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043495384_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043495384_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2017 OBS Symposium"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043495384_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2017 OBS Symposium"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Researchers discussing results during the poster session at the 2017 OBS Symposium in Portland, Maine.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kasey Aderhold</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robert&nbsp;L&nbsp;Woodward</div> <div class="imageTitle">2017 OBS Symposium</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043571535_Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043571535_Image2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="R/V Oceanus"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043571535_Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="R/V Oceanus"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Two WHOI engineers prepare an OBS on the deck of R/V Oceanus.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daniel Zietlow</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robert&nbsp;L&nbsp;Woodward</div> <div class="imageTitle">R/V Oceanus</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043664981_Image3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043664981_Image3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Final Cascadia Initiative recovery cruise"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043664981_Image3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Final Cascadia Initiative recovery cruise"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Two apply-to-sail students assist two LDEO engineers in the deconstruction of an OBS during the final Cascadia Initiative recovery cruise.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Erik Fredrickson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robert&nbsp;L&nbsp;Woodward</div> <div class="imageTitle">Final Cascadia Initiative recovery cruise</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043738347_Image4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043738347_Image4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2016 AGU Fall Meeting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043738347_Image4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2016 AGU Fall Meeting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Attendees of the OBSIP hosted International OBS Town Hall hosted at the 2016 AGU Fall Meeting.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kasey Aderhold</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robert&nbsp;L&nbsp;Woodward</div> <div class="imageTitle">2016 AGU Fall Meeting</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043818662_Image5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043818662_Image5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bubblephone"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1112722/1112722_10151308_1573043818662_Image5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bubblephone"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">WHOI engineer Tim Kane tests the ?bubblephone?
