<AbstractNarration>Using an investigative learning model, this project is engaging undergraduate students (and a limited number of high school students) in a series of student-led research activities on biomass renewable energy. Students design and implement their own research plans based upon available biomass resources.  The adoption of a student-led investigative approach is a potentially transformative model in biomass renewable energy education.  Students  identify biomass sources, test heat value and moisture content of the biomass, process the biomass into a useful form, gasify the biomass to produce combustible syngas, use the syngas to drive an internal combustion engine and an electrical generator, charge a bank of batteries, and invert to provide 110 VAC power output. Through the experience of participating in design and implermentation of a complete cycle of renewable energy generation and utilization, undergraduate students develop a real passion, knowledge and skill for using renewable energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Exemplary learning materials are being developed to enable other higher education institutions to transfer the methodology into their respective curricula.  With a systematic assessment, the project adds to our knowledge of how students learn biomass renewable energy through a series of student-led research activities.  The project contributes to the national effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to maintain a sustainable social, economic and environmental system for many generations to come.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project proves the effectiveness of student-led research for undergraduate STEM education.  It was observed that students were highly motivated and engaged if they were given leadership role in designing and implementing their research plans or ideas.   The experimented methodology has had a significant impact on the undergraduate education.  Undergraduate students in four (4) courses for Applied Engineering and Technology (AET) major were actively leading varying stages of research on biomass renewable energy.  Students across various STEM and non-STEM disciplines were inspired to be engaged in research on biomass renewable energy.  Those student-led research activities provided students with opportunities to design and implement their own ideas driven by their intrinsic desire and passion, other than out-of-touch "professors."    The project also sets an example of recruiting young students from high school to STEM fields, including summer camps and Renewable Energy Research Mentorship programs continuingly offered at the Center for Clean Energy Research and Education.    To stimulate early interests in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by young generations, a Renewable Energy Research Mentorship Program has been established at the Center for Clean Energy Research and Education of the university.  The program was first formally launched in Fall 2013 in collaboration with local school district leaders and high school faculty.  Throughout the semester, a high school science teacher  and three (3) high school students participated in the program.  They interacted on regular (weekly) basis with faculty, undergraduate and graduate students who are conducting various facets of renewable energy research including solar, wind, and bio-renewable energy.
