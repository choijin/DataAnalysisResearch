<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Wecoma, a 185? general purpose research vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation. The request includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) GPS Based Network Time Server&lt;br/&gt;2) Multicorer Refurbishment&lt;br/&gt;3) Acoustic Testing on R/V WECOMA&lt;br/&gt;4) Double-Rate Pingers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researcher.</AbstractNarration>

Upgrades to the capabilities of the ship and equipment pool naturally enhance the opportunities for new discoveries and greater understanding of oceanic processes across disciplines.  In addition, continuous upgrade programs ensure that the most modern and effective tools are available to new investigators and graduate and undergraduate students.  Providing modern tools and the best data possible is critical for the training of the next generation of ocean scientists.
