<AbstractNarration>This Connecticut College project:  S-STEM Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics is a continuation of an existing and effective four year "Science Leaders" program which targets traditionally underrepresented students in science. The project builds on that success and expects to increase even more underrepresented students majoring in science by adding two new features: a summer bridge program prior to the freshman year and a study group program.</AbstractNarration>
