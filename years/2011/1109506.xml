<AbstractNarration>This project develops a novel class of analytical and computational methods based on spectral analysis to solve first passage and optimal stopping problems for a class of Markov processes. The objective of an optimal stopping problem is to determine optimal decision timing to maximize reward in the face of uncertainty modeled by a stochastic process. The objective of a first passage problem is to determine the probability distribution of the first time a stochastic process passes through a boundary. These mathematical problems arise in a wide variety of applications in financial mathematics, including modeling credit risk (the risk of default of a borrower on its debt, such as a corporate bond), evaluating financial contracts with early exercise rights, such as American-style options and callable and convertible bonds, and real options. The class of Markov processes under study are jump-diffusion processes that can be constructed by stochastic time changes of one-dimensional diffusions. The methods developed in this project are based on representing conditional expectation operators associated with Markov processes by eigenfunction expansions. Efficient computational algorithms will be developed for Markov processes whose eigenfunctions are expressed in terms of orthogonal polynomials.  Many of the most important stochastic processes in financial mathematics belong to this category, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and constant elasticity of variance (CEV) diffusions, as well as pure jump and jump-diffusion processes arising from time changing these diffusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel analytical methods and computational algorithms developed in this project will be applied to a range of problems in financial mathematics in the areas of modeling credit risk and evaluating financial contracts with early exercise rights in a variety of markets, including bond markets, equity markets, commodities and energy markets, and to real options and irreversible investment decisions. The mathematical methods developed in this project will help financial institutions to accurately evaluate and manage the risk of a variety of financial transactions. They will also help non-financial firms make better managerial decisions by facilitating applications of real options analysis. The project is expected to have a broader mathematical impact on research on optimal stopping and first passage problems. The project will also have an impact on education and human resources development. It is part of the long-term effort at Northwestern in financial mathematics and engineering, including the Ph.D. concentration in this area.  It will train highly qualified researchers for academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary. The project focused on the development of analytical and computational methods to solve optimal stopping and first passage / boundary crossing problems for Markov processes via applications of the spectral theory, and applications of these mathematical methods to problems arising in financial mathematics. Optimal stopping problems are concerned with the optimal timing of making a decision (such as exercising a financial option) when faced with uncertainty (modeled by a Markov process in the context of this project). First passage problems are concerned with the timing of when a stochastic process crosses a given boundary for the first time (such as when the price of an asset drops below some pre-specified level).  Intellectual merit of project outcomes. 1) PI and his collaborators and students formulated analytical methods for both finite- and infinite-horizon optimal stopping and first passage problems for a class of Markov processes based on the spectral resolution of the semigroup of the Markov process.  2) When eigenfunctions of the transition semigroup are expressed in terms of orthogonal polynomials, our analytical methods yielded computationally efficient implementations by recursively applying the eigenfunction expansion for the Markov transition operator between the stopping points / barrier checking points and computing the expansion coefficients efficiently using recursions for orthogonal polynomials.  3) Fortunately, many Markov processes important in applications in financial mathematics are in this class, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) diffusion, the Feller / Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) diffusion, as well as jump-diffusion and pure jump processes obtained by time changing these diffusions with Levy subordinators. Thus, our results yielded computational methods to solve first passage and finite and infinite horizon optimal stopping problems for these processes.  The project outcomes are the analytical framework and the computational methods for finite and infinite horizon optimal stopping problems and first passage problems for Markov processes based on spectral theory, and their applications to problems arising in financial mathematics, in particular in commodity, interest rate and credit markets.  Broader impact. The project has provided opportunities for training and professional development to four PhD students in the financial engineering major within the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences at Northwestern University. Two PhD students successfully defended their dissertations and graduated. Two PhD students are continuing in the PhD program.
