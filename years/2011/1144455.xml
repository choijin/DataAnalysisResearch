<AbstractNarration>To better understand volcanic activity, it is fundamental to get an accurate representation of magma generation zones and storage regions in the Earth?s crust and upper mantle. Illuminating the architecture of the plumbing system beneath volcanoes will allow scientists to determine (1) at which depths and conditions magmas are generated, and (2) the shapes and sizes of pathways and reservoirs along which magma travels towards the surface. Such knowledge will allow scientists to make more informed predictions on the durations of volcanic crises and on the total volume of erupted material during eruptive episodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the Mount St. Helens volcanic edifice, (WA, USA), whose explosive eruption in 1980 attracted world?s attention, and was the first volcano to be thoroughly monitored with modern instruments. Mount St. Helens provides an ideal setting to apply state-of-the-art geophysical and geochemical techniques to image its subterranean roots: It is active, easily accessible, and has a well recorded past history. The project will use several different methods (active and passive source seismic tomography and scattered wave imaging, magnetotelluric imaging, petrology and geochemistry), involving a large collaborative team, to image the volcano?s plumbing system with unprecedented resolution from the subducting plate to the surface. The results will be informative for many other volcanoes around the world, particularly those located along the infamous Pacific Ring of Fire.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Imaging Magma Under St. Helens (iMUSH) Active Seismic Experiment:  The Principal Investigator, Alan Levander, and two postdoctoral researchers, Eric Kiser and Imma Palomeras, all from Rice University, organized and executed an active source seismic investigation of the crust and uppermost mantle under Mount St. Helens.  The goals of the experiment were to make seismic images of the magmatic plumbing system under the most active volcano in the contiguous US.  The seismic images are analgous to medical CAT-scan and ultrasound images but on a much larger scales, kilometers to 10s of kilometers rather than centimeres to 10s of centimeters.  Working with a group of specialists from the University of Texas at El Paso, the University of New Mexico and more than 75 volunteers from schools, colleges, and universities across the US as well as a number of European universities, we installed more than 6000 seismograph stations around Mount St Helens in July and August 2014.  The seismographs recorded the signals from 23 buried explosions, as well as additional signals from earthquakes (Figure 1).  The experiment generated a great deal of interest in both the local and national press, leading to articles in several Washington state newspapers, Science, Nature, Scientific American, Smithsonian and Wired magazines, and mentions in a number of online news sources in the US and Europe.   The principal findings of our study have been identification of melt pathways (i.e. magma migration routes) within the crust.  These extend from the deepest part of the crust to the shallowest magma chamber  that lies about 1 mile below the MSH crater.  We discovered and have now detailed the 3D shape of a magma storage zone extending from ~7-14 km depth (4-9 miles) beneath the MSH crater.  We believe that magma is stored at this level and gradually charges the shallower chamber, leading to eruptions. Earthquake locations from the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network have helped us identify the path that melt takes from base of the crust (~25 milles) where it enters from the mantle, to this magma storage zone (Figure 2).  We also identified another possible magma storage zone under the Indian Heaven volcanic field, to the east of Mount St. Helens, although details of this zone are less clear at present (Kiser et al., 2016, Geology).  This and other results have been published in a series of scientific papers.  We have now interpreted about 50% of the data, and intend to continue data analysis for several more years.  This project is part of the larger iMUSH project to investigate Mount St Helens that includes geological, electromagnetic, and other seismological investigations.  The iMUSH team includes researchers at the University of Washington, Oregon State University, Cornell University, the University of New Mexico, the University of Arizona, the US Geological Survey, and the ETH, Zurich.  Eric Kiser is now a professor at the University of Arizona. Imma Palomeras is a research scientist at the University of Salamanca, Spain.
