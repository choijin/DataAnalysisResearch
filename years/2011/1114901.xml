<AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is the mathematical development, computational &lt;br/&gt;implementation, testing and evaluation of procedures for inverting the soft x-ray &lt;br/&gt;transform, which has arisen recently from experimental cellular biology, but has &lt;br/&gt;not previously been subjected to a rigorous treatment from the computational &lt;br/&gt;mathematics point of view. The soft x-ray transform is the appropriate mathematical &lt;br/&gt;model for the physical process by which two-dimensional projections are &lt;br/&gt;acquired in soft x-ray microscopy (SXM), which has the unique capability of &lt;br/&gt;imaging whole cells in their native environment with high resolution. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;novel computational methods for inverting this accurate image formation &lt;br/&gt;model for SXM are designed to improve the resolution in the reconstructions of the &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional (3D) structures from their SXM projections.  It is conjectured &lt;br/&gt;that such a treatment will result in improved accuracy and usefulness as &lt;br/&gt;compared to the currently used heuristic procedures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many areas of biology, the understanding of a 3D structure provides a way &lt;br/&gt;of understanding its function. Many structures, such as single molecules, &lt;br/&gt;viruses, cells, etc., are too small to be viewed with the naked eye. &lt;br/&gt;Microscopy has been providing images with information about&lt;br/&gt;details of these structures. However, unprocessed microscopic images &lt;br/&gt;present structures that are superimposed over each other, making&lt;br/&gt;them hard to interpret. Combining multiple images from different directions &lt;br/&gt;of the same structure by techniques of 3D reconstruction allows accurate &lt;br/&gt;visualization of such structures. The understanding of 3D shapes of &lt;br/&gt;structures is important in many biomedical areas, for example, in drug &lt;br/&gt;design. Of the many approaches to unraveling 3D biological structures, &lt;br/&gt;soft X-ray microscopy (SXM) has the unique capability of providing &lt;br/&gt;high-resolution details of subcellular 3D structures in their native environment, &lt;br/&gt;i.e., the whole cell. Such currently-unavailable structural information will be &lt;br/&gt;important for understanding many biological processes. An example is &lt;br/&gt;mitochondrial dysfunction as it occurs in human diseases, understanding &lt;br/&gt;of which is important for assessing cardiovascular and nervous &lt;br/&gt;system function in mitochondrial disorders.</AbstractNarration>
