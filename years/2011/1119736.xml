<AbstractNarration>The print version of Foundation Science, a comprehensive high school science curriculum, has been extensively field tested and shown to be effective in increasing student learning and changing teacher practice.  Carolina Biological Supply is scheduled to publish a digital version of Biology and Chemistry portions of Foundation Science that goes well beyond the conversion of print text to digital delivery by September 2012.  Many digital enhancements have been developed and tested in the biology unit of Foundation Science, which was used as a model to develop a system to incorporate Universal Design for learning features in materials development and in on-line professional development for cross-over teachers.  Some of the digital resources include a digital book reader; a notebook in which notes can take various forms such as text, drawing, voice recording; separate unscored assessments; an interactive glossary; graphing capabilities and an online research tool.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus this project provides a model of how existing, tested digital enhancements can increase student learning.  Increasing the quality of science education requires careful coupling of effective, research-based curricula with innovative digital features that deepen and enhance science learning and teaching.  This RAPID is to ensure that the content and pedagogical expertise is present during the development of the digital version of Foundation science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the project Taking Foundation Science to Scale &ndash; Digitally Transforming a Print Curriculum into an Innovative Learning Tool for Commercial Distribution were to:  Create an innovative online science learning environment that is effective for science learning within and beyond the classroom Develop a process whereby curriculum originally developed as print materials could be redesigned for the digital environment Build a successful developer-publisher partnership that is a model for developing online science curricula    Consensus exists in the education communities that technology must play a major role in moving classrooms and instructional materials into the 21st century.

Over the past three decades NSF has funded many innovative, research based curricula, most of which were developed for print.

The Foundation Science curricula are academically rigorous, scientifically accurate, providing a coherent, core curriculum in each discipline.

The goal of the partnership between Carolina Biological Supply Company (publisher) and EDC was to redesign Foundation Science: Biology and Chemistry print curricula into innovative online curricula that take advantage of digital features that extend and enhance the instructional materials while retaining the pedagogical and conceptual features of a high quality curriculum.    The primary goal of this project has been achieved. Foundation Science: Biology and Chemistry &ndash; now entitled Concepts and Practices: Biology and Concepts and Practices: Chemistry &ndash; are in the final stages of production for the Fall, 2014 market.  Many challenges were addressed during the course of this work and, by necessity, compromises made. The choice of a platform that could reach the most students with current technology was the first decision.  Ideally the platform would provide multi-device flexibility.  After careful study, Carolina elected for a web-based platform that would optimize student access and offer greater flexibility in feature design.  They determined that this choice would reach the most biology and chemistry students and enable ongoing upgrade of the digital features. The next challenge was that writing for the digital page is very different than writing for the print page. The amount of text on a screen must be limited which can impact the level and depth of the content. In many cases this can be resolved by "layering" the content....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
