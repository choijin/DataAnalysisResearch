<AbstractNarration>This project partners Austin Peay State University (APSU) with Columbia State Community College, Volunteer State Community College, Nashville State Community College, and the APSU Center located on the Fort Campbell Military Base (in Fort Campbell, KY) in order to increase the number and graduation rates of students transferring from regional community colleges and from military service to four-year STEM degrees at APSU.  The scholarship program offers 15-30 scholarships per year, with students receiving support for one to three years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives of the scholarship program are to:&lt;br/&gt;     -  improve the graduation rate of students that transfer to APSU after completing an Associate of Science degree at a community college;&lt;br/&gt;     -  increase the number of community college students seeking a B.S. in a STEM discipline;&lt;br/&gt;     -  increase the number of Active Duty Military Personnel, Veterans and Dependents enrolling and completing a B.S. in a STEM Discipline; and&lt;br/&gt;     -  work with students to identify career paths early and help them successfully transition to either a job or graduate school immediately upon completing their B.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores the effect that providing financial, academic, career and social support to community college and military students has on the number of students entering four-year STEM programs and their success rate in these programs.  Core support structures used to increase success for transfer students and students with military backgrounds include: a Summer Bridge Program; S-STEM students living together in a wing of a new dormitory: monthly meetings with an assigned faculty mentor; encouragement of scholarship students to become peer mentors; including partner community colleges in APSU STEM events; and seminars by individuals in STEM disciplines/industry/careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the geographic area served by APSU and the partner institutions, there are insufficient college students in STEM disciplines to meet the projected needs of the region.  A particular need is due to the recent opening by Hemlock Semiconductor of a $1.2 billion facility in Clarksville TN (the home of APSU).  It is anticipated that the opening of this large polysilicon producing facility will attract other high tech industry to the region that will require additional STEM graduates in the future.</AbstractNarration>

APSU is in Clarksville, Tennessee, the state's fifth largest and youngest city. The school is named after former Tennessee Governor Austin Peay, a Clarksville native. Austin Peay is a four-year public, masters level university offering more than 56 majors and 63 different concentrations. The College of Science and Mathematics provides study for students in the areas of agriculture, astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, geosciences, mathematics, medical technology, radiologic technology, and physics. Our outstanding, discipline-based programs are student-centered and designed to prepare students for responsible positions at all levels of research, industry, education, medicine, and government. We emphasize degree programs relevant to regional economic and market trends, designed to enable graduates to compete in the global economy and foster lifelong learning skills.</p> <p>To reach our goal in this project we proposed four objectives: (1) Improve the graduation rate of students that transfer to APSU after completing an Associate of Science degree at a community college, (2) &nbsp;Increase the number of community college students seeking a B.S. in a STEM discipline, (3) &nbsp;Increase the number of Active Duty Military Personnel, Veterans and Dependents enrolling and completing a B.S. in a STEM Discipline, and (4) Work with students to identify career paths early and help them successfully transition to either a job or graduate school immediately upon completing their B.S.</p> <p>Overall for the life of the grant, we supported 70 students with a total of $526,204 in scholarship monies.

Overall for the life of the grant, we supported 70 students with a total of $526,204 in scholarship monies. Of these 70 students, 43 or 61% of the students have graduated, 19 or 27% are still matriculating at APSU and eight or 11% left the program for a variety of reasons.  A total of 43 S-STEM students graduated with a B.S. degree with a STEM major.  Fourteen of these graduating students were community college transfer students.   Six (43%) of the community college transfers have secured job positions in a STEM field.  Two (14%) of those eight are also attending graduate school in a STEM field.  The remaining six (43%) community college transfer graduates have secured jobs in non-STEM fields, matriculated to a non-STEM graduate program or are taking a hiatus from the job market and/or graduate school.  In summary, eight (57%) of the community college transfer graduates are either working and/or going to school in a STEM area.   Twenty-nine of these graduating students were affiliated with the military.  Military affiliations include: Active Duty, Veteran, and Dependent.  Twelve (41%) of the military affiliates have secured job positions in a STEM field and four (14%) are attending graduate school in a STEM field (one of those students is also working in a STEM field). The remaining 14 (48%) military affiliates graduates have secured jobs in non-STEM fields, matriculated to a non-STEM graduate program or are taking a hiatus from the job market and/or graduate school.  In summary, 16 (55%) of the military affiliate S-STEM graduates are either working and/or going to school in a STEM area.  Many of the APSU NSF S-STEM scholarship students were involved in undergraduate research projects and presented locally and nationally with some even winning awards. We provided opportunities for the students to meet with faculty for coaching as it related to research, graduate school opportunities and STEM related job placement.  Our S-STEM scholarship students have matriculated to STEM graduate programs at Austin Peay State University, Cornell University, Case Western Reserve University, University of Tennessee-Knoxville, and Western Kentucky.  Additionally, we have students working in a variety of STEM related positions in public school systems, major hospitals, armed forces, government agencies and private corporations.
