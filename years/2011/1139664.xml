<AbstractNarration>WestEd and the University of California-Berkeley are improving student learning and workforce preparation in science as well as information and communication technology by embedding the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program into curricula of selected high school-level green energy career academies in California. Embedding GLOBE within California's green energy academies will pave the way for broader GLOBE implementation in California and other states.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GLOBE California Academy Program (CAP) is engaging students, particularly at-risk students, in research related to climate science and renewable energy technologies, providing professional development and support for academy teachers, connecting scientists and industry to academy classrooms, and linking students to GLOBE's international student community. GLOBE's data collection and analysis activities will become an integral and sustainable part of a rigorous inquiry-based approach to science education that prepares students for postsecondary education and science careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating GLOBE into CAP will produce a replicable model program that improves high school students' preparation for postsecondary education and careers in science and technology fields. Outcomes for students include improved science/technology knowledge and skills, higher grades, increased interest in pursuing postsecondary education and science/technology careers, and development of 21st century workforce skills. Outcomes for teachers include increased facility with GLOBE and scientific practice.</AbstractNarration>

The GLOBE California Academy Program (CAP) engaged students in data collection and research related to the environment and climate change and supported the academy teachers with professional development and ongoing technical assistance. The fusion of GLOBE and CAP was designed to produce a sustainable and replicable model to improve high school studentsÆ preparation for postsecondary education and careers in STEM fields.  The program sought to build skills and motivate students over their three year academy participation, with the first year focused on data collection, the second year on data visualization and interpretation, and the third year on application of learning in a community-based project.  Throughout, students were exposed to STEM careers.  The program partnered with the Berkeley Atmospheric Science Center at UC Berkeley, whose director and graduate students engaged systematically with GLOBE CAP students, sharing information about their projects, presenting "real world" guidance about science practices such as the importance of precision and accuracy, assisting with GLOBE data collection, and discussing their education and careers as scientists.

GLOBE is an example. Project-based learning also can be part of a multi-disciplinary strategy to engage students and prepare them for college and careers. Career academies often implement projects that link academic and career-technical courses within their career themes.  In California there has been a surge in the number of academies focused on careers in "green" occupations, including the renewable energy and clean technology sector. The demand for both scientists and technicians in this sector is growing in California and nationally due to regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Across the career spectrum, these occupations require significant STEM- and ICT-related knowledge and skills. The expansion of green academies in ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
