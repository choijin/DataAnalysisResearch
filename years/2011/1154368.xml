<AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships to able and financially needy upper-division students majoring in all STEM fields.  The project emphasizes supporting students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines.  A primary goal is to ensure such students graduate in five years with a minimum of student debt. This is done through a combination of individual counseling, tutoring, group seminars, internships, and research experiences. All this takes place within strong cohorts of students with similar experiences and goals. Additional goals include improving student placement after graduation and increasing the number of students going to graduate school in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are academic support activities.  The project emphasizes placing students within local industry and in retaining contact with these students. These goals are pursued though a combination of industry presentations, internships, seminars on applying to graduate programs, and comprehensive, convenient exit surveys. The S-STEM project has considerable support within local industry.  It also exploits the natural cohorts that have been formed under the aegis of the MemphiSTEP program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The project is increasing the number and diversity of students who complete a STEM major and go on to work in the field or to further education.  It specifically targets students from populations underrepresented in science and first-generation college students.  The project emphasizes employing local talent that serves to enrich both the individual students and the local community.</AbstractNarration>
