<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the research of Professor Olivucci of the Bowling Green State University. With the help of Dr. Xu, a microbiologist working in the same institution, Dr. Olivucci intends to study the mechanism of double-bond photoisomerization in protein mutants by combining quantum chemistry and genetic techniques. The research focuses on a photochromic sensory rhodopsin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena (ASR) as a reference lab model. The investigators will construct, starting from known crystallographic data, computer models of the ASR wild-type and of a series of its mutants and study the changes in their photoisomerization dynamics via excited state trajectory computations. A sub-set of these mutants will be constructed in the laboratory for validation purposes. The investigators seek to analyze the information derived by the study of multiple series of mutants, and in so doing gain an understanding of how specific amino acid replacements can tune/control the photoisomerization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impact of this project emerges from the possibility to use computation in predicting and ultimately designing the photochemical properties of chromophore-containing proteins.  The project stimulates collaboration across distant disciplines: computational quantum chemistry and molecular biology. Accordingly, the graduate students will receive a multidisciplinary training. The results will be disseminated not only through the conventional media but also through the on-line publication of a Protein Model Database. The results will also help to improve the quality of undergraduate/graduate courses at BGSU and thought via long-distance learning technologies. Professor Olivucci supports the undergraduate BGSU program Building Ohio's Sustainable Energy Future by teaching how to use computers and computational chemistry tools to characterize the absorption spectra of organic compounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through the first three years of the project and, consistently, during the final fourth year, the PI objective has been the design and implementation of a new computational technology for carrying out systematic studies of the dynamics and mechanism of light-induced double-bond isomerization in proteins. The project objective have been reached through three substantially sequential phases: (a) the design, implementation and benchmarking of an automatic computational protocol for the construction of QM/MM rhodopsin and rhodopsin mutant models, (b) the application of such protocol to the generation and investigation of ASR mutants so wide to make their experimental screening impossible and (c) the extraction from the obtained pull of data of "rules" useful for the engineering rhodopsins with desired spectral and reactivity properties. The results of the research have been documented, overal, in 22 published papers (all acknowledge the NSF funding) including two reports in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA addressing the problem of consistently simulating non-homologous retinal proteins such as vertebrate, invertebrate and microbial pigments, and one paper in Nature?s Scientific Reports focused on the ecology of freshwater fish visual rhodopsins. These publications include a tutorial published in Chemical Society Review which discusses how to use computational photochemistry to design biomimetic materials. The tutorial was selected to be one of the top referee-recommended article of the month (http://blogs.rsc.org/cs/2014/07/22/hot-chem-soc-rev-articles-for-july/).
