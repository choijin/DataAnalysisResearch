<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will investigate the merits and&lt;br/&gt;feasibility of an Adaptive Compact Fuel Reformer (ACFR) using an Ultra-Fine Homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;Atomizer based on an autothermal process. Diesel reformer is the key to provide syngas (H2+CO) for&lt;br/&gt;fuel cell auxiliary power unit (APU) which can significantly reduce engine idling fuel cost. Hydrogen&lt;br/&gt;rich syngas with EGR is effective for simultaneously reducing engine NOx and PM emissions.&lt;br/&gt;However, most diesel reformers face challenges of auto-ignition control, coking and fuel slip, size&lt;br/&gt;and weight reduction, and durability issues, etc. The key innovation of the adaptive compact fuel&lt;br/&gt;reformer is an ultra-fine atomizer, which has an innovative micro-circular orifice coupling ultra-thin&lt;br/&gt;layer of fuel spray, steam and air flow simultaneously. The atomizer can produce very small fuel&lt;br/&gt;droplets (~10 micron) and homogenous mixture, which can be quickly vaporized and converted into&lt;br/&gt;syngas in a small space without auto-ignition, coking and slip. The Phase I work will complete the&lt;br/&gt;key design work for the fuel reformer and conduct lab bench scale testing for key components.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are significant potential benefits for US&lt;br/&gt;energy security and environment protection. The potential customers include engine OEMs and auto&lt;br/&gt;makers. The industry-university collaborated research will help graduate students carry on&lt;br/&gt;fundamental research while providing deeper understanding of diesel fuel reformation for commercial&lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>
