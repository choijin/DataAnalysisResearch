<AbstractNarration>This project is motivated by successful deployment of eScience applications&lt;br/&gt;on clouds: how to deploy HPC analytics applications on the cloud? Both eScience applications&lt;br/&gt;and HPC analytics applications manipulate with tera-scale or peta-scale data and require &lt;br/&gt;access to expensive computing resources. However, HPC analytics applications bear several &lt;br/&gt;distinct characteristics such as complex data access patterns and interest locality, which &lt;br/&gt;pose new challenges to its adoption in clouds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a data semantics &lt;br/&gt;aware framework to enable HPC analytics at clouds. Such a framework is composed of three components; &lt;br/&gt;1) a MapReduce API with data semantics awareness used to develop high-performance&lt;br/&gt;analysis applications, 2) a translation layer equipped with data-semantics aware HPC interfaces, &lt;br/&gt;and 3) a data-affinity-aware data placement scheme. It is anticipated that high productivity on the&lt;br/&gt;economic impact is significantly improved through the cost-effective scientific data processing.&lt;br/&gt;Delivering an open source software to the community speeds up the 21st century scientific &lt;br/&gt;discovery process in any HPC analytics areas such as cosmology, astrophysics, chromodynamics, &lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics, etc. Numerous educational benefits are expected to be generated from collaborative &lt;br/&gt;effort with several UCF educational projects and external collaboration and community ties &lt;br/&gt;through the integration into the FutureGrid, and scientific computing cloud at Department of Energy.</AbstractNarration>
