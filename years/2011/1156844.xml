<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Plymouth State University, in cooperation with the Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, to provide undergraduate research training to 8 students over a 10-week summer period for the summers of 2013-2015. This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program provides students interested in ecology and environmental science a rigorous research experience at the internationally recognized Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The program emphasizes the societal relevance of research on ecology and the changing environment through research overseen by teams of scientist-mentors and science communication activities overseen by outreach mentors. Students choose from projects distributed among four research themes (animal ecology, biogeochemistry, hydrology and soils, and forest vegetation and carbon cycling) that are representative of, and integrated within, the ecosystem science of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study (HBES). Each student also participates in a weekly science communication workshop that emphasizes the interface between ecological research and the broader society through the use of case studies in citizen science, outreach and science ethics; interactions with professionals working with non-profits, management agencies, and educational institutions; and writing and speaking activities designed to emphasize the skills necessary for communicating to broad audiences. This program places training in science communication alongside a core of mentor-guided independent research.  The 10-week program culminates with presentations at a site-wide annual undergraduate research conference.  The REU on-line evaluation tool will be used to evaluate student learning gains in scientific inquiry and research execution, personal growth and in communicating science to the public. The program is open to undergraduate freshmen, sophomores, juniors or first semester seniors who are US citizens or permanent residents and will actively recruit a diverse group of students from cultural and ethnic groups that are traditionally underrepresented in scientific careers. REU program participants receive a stipend, travel and research allowances, and housing for the duration of the program.  These students will live cooperatively among a dynamic mix of undergraduates, graduate students, and other young researchers active in summer research at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.   More information is available at www.hubbardbrookreu.org, or by contacting program coordinator Geoff Wilson (gwilson@hbresearchfoundation.org) or project PI Michele Pruyn (mlpruyn@plymouth.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2013-2016 Hubbard Brook/Plymouth State REU program, "Investigating and Communicating Change in Ecosystems" hosted undergraduate students from around the country for a 10-week mentored research experience at the world-renowned Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.   Student projects were distributed around major aspects of ecosystem science, including:  hydrology, soils, nutrient cycling, forest ecology, animal ecology, and ecosystem services.  Within these major groups, research mentors and their students designed a research project which each student conducted over the course of the 10-week summer program.  Research results were presented at an annual summer undergraduate research conference in early August, and in most cases student work on the projects continued into the following school year as independent studies, senior theses, or preparation for presentations at professional conferences.   Examples of projects which went on to present at national conferences are listed below (with undergraduate authors in bold):   Campbell, T,  S.W. Bailey, and D. Buso. (2013). Characterizing Groundwater Seeps in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. Council on Undergraduate Research REU Symposium. Washington, D.C. Becerra, Briana, and N.L.  Cleavitt (2014). Comparison of Seedling Regeneration and Light Availability in an Experimental Clearcut and Reference Forest Stand in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH.  2014 SACNAS National Conference.

Washington D.C.    Spina, Paloma,  G.M. Lovett, C.B. Fuss, C.L. Goodale, A. Lang, and T.J. Fahey. (2015). Do Forest Age and Soil Depth Affect Carbon and Nitrogen Adsorption in Mineral Horizons?  Abstract B33D-0748 presented at 2015 Fall Meeting, AGU, San Francisco, CA. 14-18 Dec.   While the research projects varied across the sub-disciplines of ecosystem science, the program was united by an emphasis on the communication of science to broad audiences.  This was accomplished through weekly science communication workshops, where scientists and communication professionals active at Hubbard Brook dined with the students and then gave presentations on their experiences communicating their science to audiences other than the research community.  These workshops were informal and allowed for much dialog between the students and guests.  In addition, each summer cohort of students created a blog in order to practice explaining their work to others(see: http://hbreublog.blogspot.com/ for the 2015 blog), and held periodic, short updates with each other in order to practice succinctly explaining their work.   Our REU program recruited from populations with limited access to research opportunities.  Seventy two percent (72%) of our program participants came from schools with little on-campus research, 36% came from populations underrepresented in ecological research, and 36% of the students were the first generation of their family to attend college.   Currently, of the 25 students supported by this award, 11 are in or have completed graduate school, 6 are working as research technicians, 3 are working in education, 2 are still in school, and 3 are unknown.
