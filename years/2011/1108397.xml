<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1108397, Principal Investigator: Garrett Alston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirror symmetry is an exciting branch of mathematics that is concerned with duality between the symplectic and algebraic geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds. There are two complementary conjectures that purport to explain this duality-Kontsevich's Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture (HMS) and the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture (SYZ). The principal investigator aims to study mirror symmetry in the context of these conjectures by studying explicit examples. First, an investigation of the manifold mirror to the quintic threefold will be undertaken. The PI will search for objects on the mirror manifold that exhibit behavior similar to a certain class of Lagrangian submanifolds on the quintic. This will provide a direct and concrete illustration of HMS. In conjunction with this work, a study of Floer cohomology of Lagrangians in K3 surfaces will be undertaken. This work will exploit explicit Lagrangian torus fibration constructions of Gross, Castano-Bernard, Matessi and others, which in turn are inspired by the SYZ conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry are deep and important fields  whose origins go back hundreds of years. The questions and ideas arising  from these fields have inspired many mathematicians and physicists and led  to great scientific advances. Mirror symmetry promises to add to this  legacy. Mirror symmetry has its roots in string theory and today is an  important branch of physics. To mathematicians, mirror symmetry is an  exciting and tantalizing subject because it hints at a link between  algebraic and symplectic geometry. It is often these types of links-links  between different subjects-that lead to breakthroughs. The goal of this  project is to discover links between algebraic and sympletic geometry by  applying newly developed theory and techniques to certain examples that  are of central importance to mirror symmetry.</AbstractNarration>
