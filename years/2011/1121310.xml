<AbstractNarration>During the development of vertebrates large numbers of cells migrate to new locations in the body.  Cell migration is driven by complex mechanical forces and is under precise molecular regulation.  This proposal focuses on the molecular regulation of cellular contractility driven my actin and myosin.  This constrictive power is one of the primary driving forces of cell movement.  To understand how cells regulate their contractility it is necessary to study live cells in a living organism.  Zebrafish provide an ideal and cost-effective experimental model system for the study of cell movement and much of what we learn in zebrafish can be translated to understanding human biology. Unlike mammals zebrafish embryos are fertilized externally and are optically transparent during early development.  One can directly observe cell movement and behavior using standard microscopy without any invasive procedures.  This project uses a combination of biochemical, genetic, cell biological and developmental approaches to examine the role of the myosin phosphatase complex in controlling cell movement.  The outcomes of this proposal are expected to shed new light on how cells regulate their movement in complex environments.  This project involves the training of undergraduate and master?s students. These students will gain valuable experience in hands on data collection and experimental design which assistant them in their future careers in research or medical fields.  In addition this project will synergize with advanced undergraduate coursework at University of the Pacific such as cell biology and molecular biology, allowing students to use zebrafish as part of there in class research projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Insight into the mechanisms of cell movement is fundamental to any understanding of basic animal development.  The primary goal of this grant was to develop a cost effective and experimentally tractable model of 3D cell motility, focusing on the control of actomyosin contractility by the myosin phosphatase.  Zebrafish are highly amenable to microscopic observation and individual cells can be directly observed in the context of a living animal.  In addition, gain-of-function and loss-of-function genetic experiments are standard in the zebrafish model system.  Thus, zebrafish will provide the ideal system to study the role of vertebrate specific regulatory mechanisms that control the myosin phosphatase.  In our preliminary studies we found that the myosin phosphatase is a crucial integrator of multiple signaling pathways controlling actin and myosin.   In three aims we set out to better understand how the myosin phosphatase is regulated.  In aim I we set out to characterize the role of Zip kinase in controlling cell movement and shape during zebrafish gastrulation.  We used a combination of biochemical evaluations, microscopic observations and developmental genetic experiments to elucidate the function of this critical myosin phosphatase regulator.  In aim II we examined the role of the two isoforms of PP1 beta in assembly of the zebrafish myosin phosphatase.  Zebrafish have two highly homologous forms of PP1 beta.   We utilized a combination of biochemical and reverse genetic approaches to determine that both homologs of PP1 can assemble the myosin phosphatase.  Finally in aim III we elucidated the role of the phosphatase inhibitory proteins Cpi-17 and Phi-1 in controlling myosin phosphatase during early development.  We made considerable progress toward each aim and have published papers meeting most of the goals of aim I and aim II, and papers in preparation cover the goals of aim III and another paper that developed from aim I.  Over the course of this funding opportunity we have published a peer reviewed methods paper and three peer reviewed journal articles focusing on answering basic cell biological questions in a developmental biology context and two more manuscripts are in preparation.   Exposing students to cutting edge research has been central to the goals of this funding opportunity and this funding opportunity has supported the research of M.S. and undergraduate students.  Not only have numerous students gotten hands on experiments with lab science, but students have presented their research at major conferences such as the International Conference on Zebrafish Genetics and Development as well as presenting at local meetings such as the Pacific Undergraduate Research and Creativity Conference. Additionally, this research program has enhanced the infrastructure for research and education by allowing for more advanced molecular techniques to be used in lab-intensive courses for undergraduates and M.S. students at University of the Pacific.
