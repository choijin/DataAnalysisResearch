<AbstractNarration>An understanding of the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in the surface ocean is necessary for many reasons, including understanding the impacts of marine and other environmental changes in a changing climate. Much of the research focus has been on inorganic forms of carbon and nitrogen and, in particular, little is known about the cycling of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) compounds in the surface ocean and their impact. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin will investigate peptides and proteins, one class or organic nitrogen compounds released from marine biota. These compounds can be taken up and incorporated if they have sufficiently small molecular weight and/or recycled back to inorganic nitrogen by bacteria, potentially supporting primary production. Conversion, primarily by extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis, produces small peptides or free amino acids that can be assimilated by microbes. The proposed research will investigate the mechanisms of peptide hydrolysis, their importance in the overall breakdown and/or preservation of DON in ocean waters, and the role of chemical structure in influencing the reaction pathways. The study will use novel and innovative techniques which are a substantial advancement over currently used approaches, to examine these processes. These approaches include the use of isotopically labeled compounds as well as specific compounds (peptides and related compounds) manufactured in the laboratory. The study should provide significant advancements in our understanding of DON dynamics in the marine nitrogen cycle. The project will involve students at the graduate, undergraduate and high school level and will have a significant outreach component. Interactions will include summer undergraduate programs, public seminars and related activities and Science and the Sea, a syndicated radio program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding nitrogen cycling in the oean is one of the key goals for oceanographers, and transformation of labile organic nitrogen to inorganic forms is an essential step in marine nitrogen cycling. While past efforts on labile organic nitrogen have mainly focused on either proteins or amino acids, few studies have investigated biogeochemical behaviors of small peptides (molecular weights smaller than 600 Dalton), key immediate products from proteins to inorganic nitrogen in marine environments.  The research supported by this award has advanced our basic understanding of small peptides, such as their hydrolysis and decomposition in coastal environments including hypoxic zones, building a foundation for this research area which was essentially a blank before this project while opening many promising research avenues.   We developed a new method to measure low concentrations of small peptides, using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS).  This technique reduces the detection limit of small peptides by two orders of magnitude relative to the common ultraviolet (UV) detection (in picomole levels).  Peptides amended in seawater can be injected directly to the HPLC-MS without desalting pretreatment owing to the automatic value we designed.  This analytical method broadens our capability to examine the biogeochemical behavior of small peptides, including hydrolysis, decomposition, and other possible transformation processes of these compounds in aquatic environments.  For the first time, we directly examined the effect of fluorogenic tag on the hydrolysis of peptide analogs, which have been the major technique that has been used to obtain extracellular hydrolysis rates in aquatic environments; our results showed that the tag does not affect the hydrolysis rate of tetrapeptides, but does so for dipeptides.  Along the plume of Mississippi River in northern Gulf of Mexico, peptide hydrolysis rates were much higher in the low-salinity stations (18-19 ppt) than those in high salinity stations (36 ppt), which may be related to the bacterial community structure among other biogeochemical factors.    Our results showed that in addition to free-living bacteria, microorganisms in the large-size fractions (5-20 &micro;m or &gt;20 &micro;m), such as particle-attached bacteria and/or some osmotrophic protists, may be important in decomposing labile organic compounds directly and thus enhancing DOM degradation and nutrient cycles in the coastal environment. This bottom-up osmotrophic nutrition strategy of protists needs to be considered in biogeochemical C and N cycles, emphasizing the link between organic matter and protists in the classical microbial loop. However, more coastal systems and other types of DOM substrates need to be examined to further understand the link between DOM and different-sized microorganisms.  We discovered that decomposition rates of small peptides were twice as high in the bottom water as in the surface water in hypoxic zone in northern Gulf of Mexico, and the pathways of peptide decomposition differed.  In surface waters, the small peptides were hydrolyzed into individual amino acids extracellularly by aminopeptidase, based on the analysis of hydrolyzed fragments; hydrolysis rates remained constant throughout the incubation period.  In contrast, in bottom waters the amended peptides were metabolized rapidly into ammonium by bacteria through either direct uptake or tight coupling of extracellular hydrolysis and subsequent uptake after an initial adaptation period (~22 h). The high efficiency of peptide decomposition in bottom waters corresponded to the rapid growth of several genera of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. We further discovered that a high level of phosphate is crucial in stimulating the growth of bacterial strains with high RNA contents and thus faster organic matter decomposition in marine environments. This high decomposition potential of organic matter in subs...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
