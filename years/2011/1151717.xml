<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education on new states of matter in cold-atom systems. Recent advances in the cooling and trapping of atomic gases have led to observations of correlated states of matter. Cold-atom experiments, in addition to being impurity-free, are remarkably controllable, so that quantities such as the particle number, the shape of an external potential and atomic interactions can be tuned. This level of control enables the study of a wide parameter space of interacting cold-atom systems. The PI will focus on research areas that are pertinent to current and future cold-atom experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will compute signatures of predicted p-wave superfluid phases of three-dimensional imbalanced Fermi gases and study phase transitions to other ordered states of matter. To address recent experiments on imbalanced gases in a quasi-one-dimensional trap, the PI will predict the dynamical evolution of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state after the gas has been released from the trap, to see how such experiments can detect the elusive Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing. Additional calculations will examine imbalanced gases in two dimensions to stimulate future experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will compute the properties of cold bosonic atoms in a periodic optical lattice across a broad range of lattice amplitudes, including the low amplitude regime where the conventional Hubbard model breaks down. Another exciting area of research is inspired by the recent achievement of an artificial spin-orbit coupling for cold atoms. The PI will analyze how spin-orbit coupling modifies states of matter, such as states of bosons in optical lattices and the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state of fermions, and study the question of how spin-orbit coupling can be used to create cold-atom analogues of topological insulating phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education component includes course development for undergraduate students that will incorporate novel teching methods. This will include making courses communication intensive. This award also supports aspects of an outreach project to the public and high school and middle school students. An in-school demonstration program is aimed to increase the interest of minority students in science and careers in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education on how atoms organize themselves at very low temperature when they are trapped in beams of laser light. The atoms in these "crystals of light" are like the electrons in materials, except that it is easier to control the interactions among the electrons and learn about the states of electronic matter.  While it is unclear whether and how some states of matter that may occur in gases of cold atoms can be realized by electrons in cystals, their discovery would still provide insight into electronic states in materials.  The PI will explore whether a superconducting state that has been predicted to exist but has been difficult to observe in materials can be observed in trapped gases of cold atoms. Superconducting states are quantum mechanical states that are able to transport electricity without dissipation. The PI will aslo seek whether a recently proposed novel insulating state, a topological insulator, can be observed in "crystals of light". Topological insulators do not conduct electricity through the bulk of the material, but have metallic surface states with unusual properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research contributes to the intellectual foundations that underlie possible future device technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education component includes course development for undergraduate students that will incorporate novel teching methods. This will include making courses communication intensive. This award also supports aspects of an outreach project to the public and high school and middle school students. An in-school demonstration program is aimed to increase the interest of minority students in science and careers in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research at LSU involved undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers addressing pressing theoretical physics questions in the fields of atomic and condensed-matter physics.  Our aim was to understand recent experiments in these areas and develop new mathematical techniques to explain the experimental observations and make predictions for future experiments.   One example system that we studied was graphene, a one-atom thick sheet of carbon with unique electronic properties.  Our work clarified why graphene is nearly perfectly optically transparent and helped understand how electron-electron interactions modify observable properties of this material.    Another system we studied was ultracold gases of atoms, which can exhibit superfluid states of matter in which the atoms flow perfectly, with no viscosity.  A crucial question that we addressed in our work was explaining recent experiments that found an unusual cloud shape for gases of atoms confined to two dimensions.  Our explanation of the data showed that interaction effects could explain the observed atom density, and took advantage of a deep quantum mechanical symmetry in this system.    A third interesting outcome of our work was a study of the behavior of a recently-studied type of material called a topological insulator. While metals are characterized by their ability to conduct electricity, and insulators do not conduct electricity, topological insulators have features in common with both systems: They are insulating in their interior, but metallic on their surfaces.  Our work clarified the nature of these surface states, describing how they may be impacted by effects such as disorder and the presence of other nearby materials.    A fourth question that we investigated was the behavior of superfluidity of ultracold gases of lithium atoms, which can achieve a state of matter that is analogous to superconductivity in a metal.  Our work clarified how various types of superconducting states would be revealed in the measured atom density, and developed new quantum mechanical wavefunctions for describing these states.
