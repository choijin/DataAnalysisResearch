<AbstractNarration>Contemporary problems in science, engineering and technology increasingly demand the analysis of highly complex systems that feature both high-dimensional random dynamics or interactions and a large amount of observed data. In order to obtain reliable predictions in such systems, it is essential to exploit large-scale stochastic models and observed data in an integrated fashion.  The goal of this proposal is to initiate a systematic study of how conditioning on observed data affects the properties of large-scale stochastic models such as interacting particle systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and Markov random fields.  Research will focus on developing the foundations of a conditional ergodic theory for infinite-dimensional Markov processes and of conditional infinite Gibbs measures; on the investigation of probabilistic phenomena such as conditional phase transitions; on developing connections with problems in measure theory, statistical mechanics, and high-dimensional probability; and on potential applications to the design and analysis of Monte Carlo algorithms for filtering and prediction in high-dimensional systems, where classical methods are known to fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large-scale forecasting problems arise in a myriad of important applications such as weather forecasting, geophysical and oceanographic data assimilation, image analysis, traffic forecasting, and prediction in networks.  Such problems have a direct impact on our daily lives, and arise in crucial areas of our society such as national security, energy resource management, climate prediction, and medical imaging.  The broad goal of this project is to develop a systematic understanding of the interplay between complex models, randomness, and observed data that lies at the heart of any forecasting problem.  By focusing on the fundamental structures that are common to a diverse range of applications, mathematicians can provide unique insights and new directions to complex problems and provide an impetus for developing interdisciplinary connections.  At the same time, a strong workforce in the mathematical sciences is of crucial importance to the future of technological innovation and education. An integral part of this project is formed by a range of educational, mentoring and outreach activities aimed at increasing student interest and diversity in the mathematical sciences across pre-college, undergraduate and graduate student levels, and at training the next generation of researchers and educators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broadly speaking, the aim of this project is to introduce new mathematical methods for the study of complex and high-dimensional random phenomena. High-dimensional structures are everywhere around us: in large data sets, in complex forecasting problems, in huge networks, etc. The role mathematicians play in the analysis and design of these important features of the modern world is to provide the fundamental ideas and tools that may be used by scientists and engineers to address specific problems. Conversely, advances in mathematics lead to a substantially deeper understanding of the world around us, enabling future discoveries and inventions that would otherwise be impossible.     The main focus of this project is on developments in pure mathematics, with a smaller applied mathematical component. The results have proved to be of crucial importance, however, for further progress in contemporary applications, including complex filtering and tracking problems, statistical inference and learning in complex structures, and the design of efficient algorithms.     The main outcomes of this project have resulted in a series of significant advances in several directions. Some major themes of this project sand selected outcomes are briefly described below.  1. Conditional distributions in high dimension  The study of conditional distributions is concerned, roughly speaking, with drawing inferences and predictions of uncertain systems from partial data. This is particularly challenging when the system and observations are very high-dimensional. A typical everyday example is the problem of weather forecasting. There are fundamental mathematical obstructions to doing this in a principled manner, and state-of-the-art technology is based mostly on ad-hoc methods.  This project has identified new mathematical structures that make it possible to surmount key obstructions to high-dimensional forecasting. Particularly important are space-time ergodic properties of conditional distributions, which were identified and proved here for the first time. This enabled the development of the first filtering algorithm that can beat the curse of dimensionality.  2. Structured random matrices     Random matrices are ubiquitous in pure and applied mathematics. Best understood are the properties of matrices whose entries are pure noise. But in applications in statistics, computer science, etc., as well as in pure mathematics, one often encounters matrices that have some signal under the noise. Understanding such structured matrices is therefore of crucial importance.  This project resulted in a breakthrough in this area: we now have a complete understanding of the spectral norms of Gaussian (and other) random matrices with independent entries but arbitrary mean and variance pattern. These results drastically improve what was known prior to this work, and are now frequently used by researchers in applied mathematics and statistics as a basic tool for studying practical problems.     3. Extremes of random processes        Extreme values play a major role in various areas. For example, understanding the maxima of empirical processes lies at the heart of statistics: it allows one to select the best estimator of some underlying data. Extremes also arise naturally in the study of catastrophic events.  A basic mathematical tool is the idea of "chaining", which is used widely in many applications. In many situations, however, it is not known how to implement chaining optimally. This project developed new techniques that make it possible to implement chaining more efficiently in various situation.  4. Convexity and geometry     Perhaps the most basic idea in probability theory is that the average of many independent random variables is highly predictable (law of large numbers). But the same phenomenon turns out to occur in much greater generality: any sufficiently smooth function of independent variables is predictable (concentration of measure). This is of great importance in many applications.  It was recently realized by the PI and others that new concentration phenomena can arise under structural assumptions other than smoothness, such as convexity. The mathematical principles that underpin these insights are certain fundamental convexity properties, such as the Ehrhard inequality for Gaussian measures. The work under this project has led to a significantly deeper understanding of such phenomena.  The continuation of this work led to the surprising realization that ideas from probability theory can give rise to new insights in a completely different area: we were able to settle a nearly 120-year old problem in convex geometry, resulting in remarkable new phenomena that characterize the shapes of exotic "soap bubbles". These ideas turn out to create fascinating connections between several different areas of mathematics.  5. Further work     This project has supported work in several further directions not described above, including functional inequalities, information theory, and point processes.  6. Education and mentoring  The educational component was an integral part of this project. The PI has been actively engaged in the mentoring of undergraduates, Ph.D. students, and postdocs; organization of conferences that bring together junior and senior researchers; organization of mathematics festivals for middle school students; and creation of novel freely available teaching materials that are being widely used.
