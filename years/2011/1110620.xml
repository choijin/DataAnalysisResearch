<AbstractNarration>Bacteriovorax are unique predatory bacteria with potential roles and benefits as antibacterial agents to mitigate certain bacterial diseases in plants and animals, controlling bacterial populations and recycling nutrients in the environment. These bacteria may also be an important unexploited source of new novel therapeutic compounds. To realize the full potential of Bacteriovorax, it is necessary to better understand their genome structure and to bring order to the system of classifying and naming them. The purpose of this study is to use whole-genomic sequences to identify the best-performing genes in order to advance the classification and systematics of Bacteriovorax bacteria. The construction of a more accurate phylogenetic tree of Bacteriovorax will provide a framework to define novel isolates in future studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This information and resulting classification scheme will be disseminated to the scientific community through publications, sequence databases and a website. Florida A&amp;M is a historically black college and university with few applicants submitting DDIG proposals. The student Co-PI will share her experiences in planning and writing the proposal through presentations to inspire others and thus potentially increasing future numbers of proposals from minority students.</AbstractNarration>

Based on their small size, about 1/5th that of a typical bacterium cell, BALOs have been called "the worldÆs smallest hunters". Despite the uniqueness, and increasing understanding, of the potential of these organisms in various applications, their taxonomy, classification and phylogeny are ill-defined.

The principal objective was to fill major gaps in knowledge on the systematics of BALOs using genomic approaches, which will increase the capacity to investigate the predator activities including gene function and products of specific BALO strains.   Bacteriovorax is a special group of BALOs found exclusively in salt-water environments. Until recently, little was known about the classification and taxonomy of the Bacteriovorax and how to define and distinguish one isolate from another.

The approach used whole genomic sequences as a guide to identify functional genes to further classify Bacteriovorax.  The major outcomes of this project was that Huan Chen and other members of the project team successfully assembled, annotated and analyzed 454 pyrosequencing reads and Illumina reads of four Bacteriovorax strains isolated from diverse salt water environments.  By comparing their genome sequences with Bdellovbiro bacteriovorus HD100 and other delta-proteobacteiroa, 594 genes were identified that may be responsible for the predatorsÆ predatory life style.
