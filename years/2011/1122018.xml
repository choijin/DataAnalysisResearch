<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  Eukaryotic organisms simultaneously maintain two genomes, the diploid nuclear genome and the mitochondrial genome, which consists of small circular DNA, packaged in protein-containing structures called nucleoids and distributed throughout the mitochondrial network, with hundreds to thousands of copies per cell. Although the mitochondrion is responsible for efficient energy generation, its genome encodes only 13 proteins, each intimately involved in electron transport that is required for ATP production. All other proteins required for mitochondrial function are encoded on the nuclear genome and imported into the mitochondria. Epigenetic modification of cytosine residues to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in the nuclear genome is critical for regulation of gene expression and, at least in higher eukaryotes, is essential for normal development and survival. Until recently, a role for cytosine methylation in the mitochondrial genome had not been found.  However, identification of a mitochondrial form of the mammalian enzyme responsible for conversion of cytosine to 5mC, DNA methyltransferase 1 (mtDNMT1) has revealed the presence of both 5mC and 5hmC in the mitochondrial genome. Moreover, changing the level of this mitochondrial enzyme impacts mitochondrial transcription in a gene-specific fashion. The current project follows on these observations by seeking to uncover the mechanisms generating these modifications on mtDNA cytosine residues, their role in mitochondrial function, and the evolutionary significance of epigenetic modification of the mitochondrial genome. Successful completion of this project is likely to provide a paradigm shift in the current understanding of mechanisms controlling gene transcription within this organelle. This research is expected to uncover the biochemistry involved in mitochondrial cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation and whether the process differs significantly from that operating in the nucleus. The conservation of epigenetic modification of mitochondrial DNA will allow an understanding of whether this process affords a metabolic advantage to the organisms in which it operates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will offer a unique opportunity to both undergraduate and graduate students to participate in the process of discovery of new and exciting biological knowledge. The project will provide students with experience in critical thinking, data analysis, teamwork, oral and written presentation of research results, and participation in a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving in the laboratory environment. The inclusion of undergraduate students in the project will offer mentoring experience to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, which is essential to their development as active participants in scientific discovery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the course of this project we identified the enzymes responsible for modification of cytosine residues in the mitochondrial genome and determined that the mechanisms ensuring these modifications is conserved across mammalian species. Using a combination of biochemical, genetic and molecular methods, we demonstrated that increasing mitochondrial DNA methylation impacts transcription from this genome in a strand- and gene-specific manner that is quite different from that in the nucleus.  This transcriptional effect operates through increasing the affinity of the primary transcription factor for its promoter sequences and, as a result, increasing the rate of promoter firing.  The individual proteins that collaborate to form the complexes responsible for production of energy are contributed by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and this is likely a coordinated effort between the two genomes.  Our data indicates that inappropriate or unbalanced production of mitochondrial components through increased DNA modification substantially reduces mitochondrial energy output.  Aging, as well as in many disease states associated with aging, is accompanied by changes in DNA methylation in the nucleus, and reduced or inappropriate mitochondrial energy output is often a hallmark of these disease states. We have identified mechanisms for preferential upregulation of mitochondrial DNA methyltransferases, most notably through genes frequently lost or mutated in cancer, such as the tumor suppressor, p53.  We are therefore exploring the possibility that DNA methylation and demethylation in both nucleus and mitochondria acts as a communication mechanism between the two genomes, ensuring balanced production of the components required, within this vital cellular compartment, for energy homeostasis.  The work completed under this NSF project has resulted in one published article with an additional 4 manuscripts under revision or in preparation.  In addition, three new projects have been developed as a result of studies performed herein, and each of these has been submitted to other funding agencies for consideration.  Broader impacts of this project were to generate projects suitable for engagement of undergraduate students, in order to foster the likelihood of pursuing a scientific career among these students, and among underrepresented groups with in this population.  Mentoring of undergraduate and high school students during the design and implimentation of bench science projects increases awareness of scientific rigor and principle and generates qualified individuals for the work place in science and technology.
