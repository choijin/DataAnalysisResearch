<AbstractNarration>This objective of this research is to develop a dynamic econometric model that accounts for the evolving characteristics of the products offered by the automobile industry and consumers? expectations of future vehicle quality. The timing of consumers? purchases is formalized as an optimal stopping problem where the agent (consumer) must decide on the optimal time of purchase. The modeling framework is further enriched by explicitly considering the consumer?s choice from a set of different types of vehicles whose quality changes stochastically over time. The consideration of heterogeneity in parameters and the possibility of repeated purchases are part of the proposed dynamic model. The project also intends to solve the difficulties encountered when dealing with the estimation of complex econometric models. In particular, concepts derived from stocastic programming and advanced optimization techniques based on trust regions will be adopted to formalize and solve this dynamic problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will contribute to the major challenges facing society when attempting to meet its increasing mobility needs while striving to minimize energy consumption and reduce environmental and economic impacts. More energy efficient and environmentally friendly highway transportation technologies are under development and could be available on the market in the near future; they could ensure the freedom of mobility and energy security, while lowering costs and reducing the impact on the environment. Estimation techniques for analyzing the impact of technological improvements and rapid changes in energy costs are necessary to understand the mobility of tomorrow and adapt the products of our car industry.Students will be actively involved in collaboration with four international centers recognized for their excellence in education and research. The creation of an integrative, inter-disciplinary curriculum at the University of Maryland is expected to raise the awareness and the interests of both undergraduate and graduate students in transportation and related disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

Energy efficient and environmentally friendly highway transportation technologies are under development and are expected to be on the market in the near future; estimation techniques for analyzing the impact of technological improvements and rapid changes in energy costs are necessary to understand the mobility of tomorrow and to adopt the products of our car industry.  Intellectual Merit  In this project, econometric methods for analyzing the impact of technological changes on the dynamic of consumer demand have been developed. The proposed dynamic formulation models market evolution, and accounts for consumers' expectations of future product characteristics. The timing of consumers' decisions is formulated as a regenerative optimal stopping problem where the agent must decide on the optimal time of purchase. The modeling framework is further enriched by explicitly considering the consumer's choice from a set of different types of vehicles whose quality changes stochastically over time.  To explore marketplace influences, this project proposed to use a novel stated preference survey design to analyze vehicle purchasing behavior in a dynamically changing marketplace through the use of dynamic attributes and multi-year hypothetical time window. The designs correspond to changing vehicle technology, fueling options, and taxation policy. Between scenarios, the vehicle, fuel, and policy attributes dynamically change to mimic marketplace conditions. Data collected showed that respondents responded in behaviorally realistically ways and that the survey design allowed for estimation of important parameters in vehicle choice.  Respondents were able to depreciate their vehicles over the hypothetical period and place tradeoffs on the features of vehicles and fuel types.   The modeling framework has been intensively tested using simulated and real data. In both cases, results show that dynamic models are superior to static models based on multinomial logit; in particular, they are able to recover peaks in the demand evolution over time, while static models fail to detect dramatic changes due to the rapid mutation of external conditions.
