<AbstractNarration>Many studies on humans and rodents have aimed at understanding how maternal care influences the behavior and health of offspring.  Because it is hard to separate the effects of maternal behavior itself from effects of the environment, many fundamental questions remain unanswered:  To what extent can maternal care itself directly affect the long-term behavior and physiology of offspring?  Can maternal care completely or partially overcome environmental stressors?  Does maternal care trigger genetic changes in offspring that mediate long-term effects?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toth and Jeanne will use a new behavioral system to address these questions.  Mother paper wasps (Polistes) feed and care for larvae throughout their development.  In the process, maternal wasps physically vibrate their larvae by striking their antennae on nest cells.  This behavior, which can be simulated using a piezoelectric device, has profound effects on offspring.  Vibrated larvae become workers, whereas un-vibrated wasps become queens.  This unique system can be used to experimentally dissect how maternal behavior affects offspring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use state-of-the art DNA sequencing methods to characterize what types of genetic changes (e.g. gene activation or chemical DNA modifications) are induced in offspring in response to the interactions of an environmental factor (nutritional stress) and a maternal behavior (vibrations).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide new information on the extent to which maternal behavior can affect the fate of offspring, how these effects may be modulated by stressors in the environment, and the genetic mechanisms underlying this process.  The project will involve the training of a postdoctoral researcher, several undergraduates, and a high school teacher.  The results will be disseminated to the scientific community and new insights shared at school and community outreach events.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which mothers can shape the developmental fate of their offspring.  To do this, we used social paper wasps, Polistes fuscatus, excellent models for studying maternal and social behavior.  These wasps make small colonies initiated by founding queens, devoted mothers who spend weeks defending and feeding their offspring.  Interestingly, not all offspring are equal; those produced early in the season are all female and become workers, who are typically sterile, short-lived, and toil for the colony.  On the other hand, offspring produced later in the season are destined to reproduce rather than work&mdash;either as males, or as "gynes"&mdash; long-lived wasp princesses who will become the next generation of queens.     How do wasps produce such unequal daughters? We used the striking variation in P. fuscatus female developmental fate into different castes (workers or gynes) to study the role of maternal interactions in shaping offspring traits.  We found that there are thousands of genes showing different activity between developing workers and gynes, setting them up for possessing vastly different adult physiology and behavior. Further experiments revealed queen mom?s behavior toward her developing larvae has a profound effect in two important ways.  First, there is food.  Early season larvae are underfed by mom and typically become workers.  We found that restricted feeding alone can lead to the suppression of gyne-related genes, sending larvae on a developmental track to become workers.  Second, how mom interacts with larvae is also key.  Intriguingly, founding queens target vibrational signals at their larvae, called "antennal drumming".  Previous work suggested these maternal signals lead daughters to become leaner, a worker-like trait.  We designed small "piezoelectric devices" that vibrate nests at mom?s frequency, and attached them to wasp nests in the field.  We found that these vibrations can also influence gene activity during development.  Some gyne-related genes are also shut down by vibrations, while others were influenced by the combination of low food and vibrations.  Thus, both nutritional and tactile maternal influences, and their interaction, work together to influence the caste fate of offspring.     These data provide new insights into how the maternal social environment can influence gene activity in developing offspring.  Importantly, these differences in gene activity have the potential to set up different life trajectories for offspring, leading to adults with vastly different physiology and behavior.
