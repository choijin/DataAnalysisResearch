<AbstractNarration>The CrAVES project seeks to lay down intellectual foundations for credible autocoding of embedded systems, by which graphical control system specifications that satisfy given open-loop and closed-loop properties are automatically transformed into source code guaranteed to satisfy the same properties. The goal is that the correctness of these codes can be easily and independently verified by dedicated proof checking systems. During the autocoding process, the properties of control system specifications are transformed into proven assertions explicitly written in the resulting source code. Thus CrAVES aims at transforming the extensive safety and reliability analyses conducted by control system engineers, such as those based on Lyapunov theory, into rigorous, embedded analyses of the corresponding software implementations. CrAVES comes as a useful complement to current static software analysis methods, which it leverages to develop independent verification systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computers and computer programs used to manage documents and spreadsheets. They now also interact with physical artifacts (airplanes, power plants, automobile brakes and robotic surgeons), to create Cyber-Physical Systems. Software means complexity and bugs - bugs which can cause real tragedy, far beyond the frozen screens we associate with system crashes on our current PCs. Software autocoding is becoming the de facto recommended practice for many safety-critical applications. CrAVES aims to evolve this towards higher standards of quality and reduced design times and costs. Rigorous, mathematical arguments supporting safety-critical functionalities are the cornerstone of CrAVES. Collaborative programs involving high-school teachers will encourage the transmission of this message to STEM education in high-schools through university programs designed for that purpose.</AbstractNarration>

CrAVES comes as a useful complement to current static software analysis methods, which it leverages to develop independent verification systems. Figure 1 summarizes the final outcome achieved in this project:     Credible Compilation: We have developed a toolchain targeting embedded systems developed in Simulink/Stateflow. In a first stage, the toolchain takes as input Simulink models enriched with safety requirements and control semantics such as stability proofs and compiles them either directly to C or to Lustre programs with formal annotations.  Automated safety properties analysis: At the Lustre level, we perform SMT-based model checking to validate the specified safety requirements. Static and dynamic verification: At the C level, we perform two complementary analysis: (i) static verification to validate stability proofs via interactive theorem proving in PVS; (ii) dynamic verification by performing runtime assertion checking.   The developed toolchain has been applied successfully used in three industrial case studies: (i) an Engine FADEC (ii) a Fault Tolerant Quanser 3-DOF helicopter and (iii) the Transport Class Model (TCM).     The CrAVES project is also related to an associated French ANR project CAFEIN ANR-INSE-2012-007 (Combination of Formal Analyses for the Study of Numerical Invariants) with seven partners gathering academics, industrial users (Rockwell Collins) and tool providers (Prover Technology). The collaboration between the two projects has been sustained by visits, exchange of students and six coauthored publications (NSF-ANR) including the best paper award at FMICS?13.
