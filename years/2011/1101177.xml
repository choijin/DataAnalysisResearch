<AbstractNarration>The mathematical community shows expanding interest in the deformations Shepler and Witherspoon study, for example, in graded Hecke algebras and symplectic reflection algebras. These algebras pervade mathematics, appearing in algebra, geometry, number  theory, combinatorics, topology, statistics, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, and the theory of special functions (for example, they appear in the Langlands program, the theory of quantum groups, knot theory, and conformal field theory).  Shepler and Witherspoon work towards a theory of skew group algebras and Hochschild cohomology that connects work by various prominent mathematicians working in different mathematical fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their  research leads to international talks and collaborations and results in publications in selective international journals.  Shepler and Witherspoon dynamically engage the wider community by collaborating with international experts,organizing conferences and workshops, delivering invited talks in various countries, and working with outreach programs. They actively prepare junior colleagues and students (at all stages) for engaging careers which use mathematics. Their work supports research of several graduate students and summer research experiences for undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project resulted in several new mathematical theories describing deformations of algebras.  These theories connect homological conditions to Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt properties and can be used to study algebras over arbitrary fields, not just the real or complex numbers.  The project developed applications to quantum polynomial rings and coding theory.  In addition, the project made possible new collaborations exploring applications to number theory and combinatorics.  The project supported two summer programs providing research experiences to undergraduate mathematics students at the University of North Texas.  Students researched quotients of quiver algebras and used geometry to implement computer coding algorithms.  The project also supported graduate students acting as research assistants and mentors for the summer programs.  Graduate students also worked on research questions that arose as part of the project.  Two graduate students finished masters degrees, one on skew Clifford algebras and another on subgroup decoding.  Three more students are finishing PhD degrees in mathematics on research related to the project, namely topology of infinite reflection groups, quantum Drifeld Hecke algebras, and deformation theory for quivers.  Other outcomes include publication of several research papers in international journals and delivary of invited talks at conferences and workshops.  Some of these conferences were organized by the Principal Investigator and her graduate students to promote research collaboration among institutions in Texas and Oklahoma.
