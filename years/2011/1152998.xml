<AbstractNarration>In this collaborative GOALI award, co-funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering and the Chemical and Biological Separations Programs of the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transports Systems Division, Professor Joern Siepmann of the University of Minnesota, Prof. Jake Rafferty of North Hennepin Community College and their undergraduate and graduate student researchers will work collaboratively with scientists from the Dow Chemical company to model the molecular processes taking place in a variety of analytical and separations experiments, including:  reversed-phase liquid chromatography, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatrography, ion chromatography, and the analyte distribution in self-assembled monolayers used for surface-enhanced Raman scattering.  The computational approaches that Profs. Siepmann, Rafferty and their students are developing will be combined with experimental data measured by Dr. Mark Schure and collaborators at Dow Chemical to better understand the process taking place in these experimental systems.  The ultimate goal of these kinds of experiments is to improve these processes for science and engineering applications.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The ability to cleanly and efficiently separate complex chemical mixtures into their separate components is of critical importance to a number of important industries, including the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc.  The separation and purification steps in the production of these commodities is also one that can use significant quantities of materials and produce significant amount of waste. By developing better methods for separations, Siepmann, Rafferty and others hope to improve the selectivity and efficiency of these important processes.  The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in academic and industrial settings, which will help prepare them well for a wide variety of careers in science and technology.  This project will also involve the participation of high school and community college students in this research, which will help to excite and engage the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With support from this NSF award, researchers at the University of Minnesota and industrial collaborators using molecular modeling and simulation approaches to investigate retention in various chromatographic systems.  Chromatography is commonly used for the analysis and separation of organic molecules, drug compounds, and polymers.  In a chromatographic system, analyte molecules are separated based on their differential affinity for interacting with the stationary versus the mobile phase. However, a molecular-level understanding of the chromatographic retention mechanism is not available for many important applications.  By supplementing empirical knowledge, the molecular simulation studies by this research team provides molecular-level insights that have the potential to transform the manner how existing chromatographic processes are selected/optimized for specific applications and how novel chromatographic separation technologies and chemosensors are developed.  The team developed a rapid computational screening alorithm that allows the selection of optimal column pairs for comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography, a technique that allows to improve the number of resolved analyte.  Using the Snyder-Dolan hydrophobic subtraction model, the researchers computed retention data for 100000 analytes, 4 different operating conditions, and 320000 column pairs (in total more than 1011 peaks were generated, see primary image).  This extensive computational screening indicates that use of an embedded polar (mixed mode) stationary phase in the second dimension is advantageous for comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography.  The research team also developed a webpage (http://chem-siepmann.oit.umn.edu/siepmann/HPLC/2dhsm.html) that allows retrieval of the column pair rankings obtained in this project.  The team also investigated the retention order of copolymers in liquid chromatography at the critical condition (LCCC).  LCCC is a technique for the analysis of copolymers that is based on adjusting temperature or solvent strength so that one type of repeat unit becomes chromatographically "invisible" by balancing entropic and enthalpic factors.  The computational research demonstrates that retention order of copolymers composed of equal numbers of two different repeat units is significantly influenced by the sequence (see image) and architecture of the copolymers.  Using microscopic-level information gleaned from the simulations, the researchers developed a sequence-dependent calibration curve that allows for much more reliable determination of the molecular weight of the visible block.  In other work, the researchers investigated the phase behavior of mixed-ligand coated nanoparticles.  These nanoparticles are of interest as sensors for sterically constrained molecules (e.g., anabolic steroids and polychlorinated biphenyls). Using advanced computational algorithms, the team found that differences in the chain lengths of the ligands can lead to segragation on the surface of the nanoparticles (see image).  This award provided the primary support for the training of three graduate students (one completed her PhD in 2016 and started a postdoctoral position at a national lab; another plans to complete her PhD in spring 2017; and a new graduate student started her PhD program in fall 2015).  In addition, two other graduate students were partially supported by this award.  All of the graduate students have been extensively mentored to learn about the research enterprise and to achieve their career goals.  In addition, a UMN undergraduate student (now working for a government agency) and a high school student (now an undergraduate at Yale University) participated in this project; both learned aspects of computational research and analytical/physical chemistry that are not covered in undergraduate courses.  Siepmann (the principal investigator) has also contributed to science outreach. He developed, organized, and presented together with Lindsey and Struk (two graduate students) an introduction to computer modeling of chemical systems as part of the University of Minnesota's "Exploring Careers in Engineering and Physical Sciences" (ECEPS) summer camps.
