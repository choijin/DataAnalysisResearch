<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop a scheme based on&lt;br/&gt;a novel dual-membrane-structure (DMS) configuration to &lt;br/&gt;mitigate mechanical shocks for MEMS sensors and actuators,&lt;br/&gt;which constitutes an outstanding problem in MEMS research. For &lt;br/&gt;example, in order to maximize the sensitivity of an existing MEMS&lt;br/&gt;microphone, the distance between the diaphragm and backplate needs&lt;br/&gt;to be small and the membrane should be thin, rendering the device&lt;br/&gt;particularly vulnerable to external shocks. The DMS configuration &lt;br/&gt;represents an intrinsic, self-sustained, practically implementable &lt;br/&gt;control scheme to counter mechanical shocks. A comprehensive &lt;br/&gt;theoretical/computational/experimental paradigm based on MEMS&lt;br/&gt;physics, nonlinear and synchronization analyses will be established&lt;br/&gt;to validate the proposed approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is that the strongly interdisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;research will result in novel impact-protected MEMS devices with &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear control. The research will lead to a new class of &lt;br/&gt;MEMS sensors and actuators with ultra-reliable performances.&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical/computational/experimental paradigm required to &lt;br/&gt;realize the proposed research is transformative to developing&lt;br/&gt;MEMS devices in biomedical, industrial, defense and homeland-security   &lt;br/&gt;applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are (1) to advance significantly understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the fundamental dynamics of small-scale systems, (2) to enable &lt;br/&gt;high-performance applications of robust MEMS devices in a broad &lt;br/&gt;range of fields, and (3) to create an exciting environment for graduate &lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate students in terms of interdisciplinary awareness and &lt;br/&gt;skills.</AbstractNarration>
