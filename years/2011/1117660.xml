<AbstractNarration>Designing analog integrated circuits is more of an art than a science.  Their continuous nature makes them difficult to both verify to be correct before fabrication as well as difficult to test to be free of faults after fabrication.  This fact leads to design errors forcing costly re-spins (repetitions of the design and fabrication process) and even worse faulty parts being shipped to customers.  In an attempt to address this problem, engineers are exploring the use of digitally-intensive analog circuits.  In these circuits, designers use the simpler 0-1 binary digital assumption for the majority of the implementation, and they only use analog components when absolutely essentially.  While this has some advantages, it creates new challenges as traditional verification and test methodologies for digital and analog design are extremely different.  The project is attempting to address these challenges.  In particular, the project is exploring the integration of both design-time verification as well as new built-in self-test and tuning techniques. This integration will allow not only joint enhancement of design correctness and robustness, hence a holistic guarantee of design quality, but also verification of self healing analog systems with built-in digitally-assisted test and tuning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work is that it will enable the design of nanoscale robust computing systems vital to a wide range of applications.  Also, interdisciplinary explorations will provide new opportunities for solving research problems of practical significance and offer educational opportunities to make students well grounded in both theory and application. The PIs will promote the research participation from undergraduate students and students from underrepresented groups. The research outcomes of this work will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate curriculum and widely disseminated in the research community.  The developed software computer-aided design tools will be released in the public domain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CMOS technology scaling has created a set of new challenges and opportunities for the realization of analog &amp; mixed-signal (AMS) and radio frequency (RF) circuits. The size and complexity of AMS/RF circuits are growing as the designer strives to deliver higher performance and more functionality.  At the same time, analog components have been increasingly integrated with digital processors under the context of mixed-signal systems-on-a-chips. Nevertheless, developing analog functionalities in highly scaled CMOS technologies is hampered by worsening analog device characteristics such as deteriorating output impedance, reduced supply level and headroom, growing device mismatch, and higher susceptibility to noise and process variation. In the meantime, the notion of digitally-intensive or digitally-assisted analog design methodology has emerged, which leverages the abundance of digital processing offered by modern CMOS technologies to assist the development of AMS and RF systems.  As a result, there has been an increasing need in developing efficient methodologies for verifying, testing and tuning of AMS systems including digitally-intensive analog circuits. To achieve this goal, throughout this project, the two collaborating teams at Texas A&amp;M University and University of Utah have made a number of contributions including:     A user friendly property language for describing attributes that a correct AMS circuit must have; A means to create accurate, formal models from simulation data; SMT-based formal techniques for verifying static properties of AMS circuits; Efficient and sound reachability analysis for formal verification of dynamic properties of AMS circuits; Methods for diagnosis of out-of-specification failures of AMS circuits using pre-silicon data; A machine-learning based performance modeling, verification, and built-in-self-test (BIST) of AMS circuits; and A methodology for functional testing of AMS circuits.      Along the above lines, a coherent set of technical contributions have been made as summarized in a book chapter, two journal papers, ten conference papers, and five workshop presentations published under this project.  Broadly, this project addresses the urgent need for developing methodologies and tools for developing highly robust analog/mixed-signal and RF integrated circuits which are key to a broad range of applications in communication, signal processing, and computing.
