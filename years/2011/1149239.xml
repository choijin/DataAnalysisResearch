<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to identify the sources, fluxes, and spatial/temporal distribution of atmospheric trace elements affecting the glaciers of the Himalayan and the Tibetan Plateau (the so-called "Third Pole") from the pre-industrial era (~1500 AD) to present time. An existing set of unique ice cores retrieved from Guliya (Western Tibetan plateau), Naimona'nyi and Dasuopu (Central Himalaya), Puruogangri and Dunde (Central and Northern Tibetean plateau, respectively) will be analyzed for a suite of trace elements, including Ag, Al, As, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, In, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sb, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, U, V, and Zn, using inductively-coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry.  These data will allow quantification of trace element fluxes and discrimination, with an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, of their natural background (e.g. crustal and volcanic constituents) components from the anthropogenic components (e.g. fossil fuel combustion and non-ferrous metal production).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assessment of atmospheric trace elements deposition is of great interest to modelers attempting to trace their sources, transport, and fluxes.  The spatial and temporal characterization of atmospheric pollution at high elevations in the Third Pole region is needed because recent studies suggest that atmospheric "brown clouds" deposition to the Himalayan glaciers may affect their energy balance, resulting in an acceleration of ablation.  Knowledge of the initial quality of the meltwater, resulting from the ongoing shrinking of the glaciers in the Himalaya, is also important for planning the availability of water resources for millions of people who live downstream from these glaciers.  Ultimately all these studies serve as a source of fundamental information for policy makers trying to mitigate the impact of trace metals in the environment.  This project will be developed in the framework of the Third Pole Environment (TPE) initiative and will reinforce the collaboration between the Byrd Polar Research Center at The Ohio State University and the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research in Beijing (China). The project will support the full involvement of a post-doctoral scholar and a master's degree student in the analysis and study of the ice cores.  In addition, a specific outreach program will be developed at the Byrd Polar Research Center: three selected high school teachers and their classes will become familiar with the research activities.  They will have an opportunity to participate through videoconferencing which will be recorded and posted online for others to view.  Teachers and students everywhere will benefit from this outreach program by having access to educational materials developed in this framework, which will be submitted to the National Science Digital Library and the Ohio Resource Center.</AbstractNarration>
