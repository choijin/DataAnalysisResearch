<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Wei Cheng at University of Michigan and his group will develop an ultrasensitive technique that allows manipulation and visualization of a biochemical reaction, one molecule at a time.  They will use this technique to study how ATP is consumed for base pair unzipping in a helicase-catalyzed reaction.  2% of the eukaryotic genome encodes helicase proteins.  These proteins are ubiquitous and use ATP to unzip DNA or RNA so that genetic information is accessible for further processing.  However, the mechanism of how these enzymes use ATP for bp unzipping remains poorly understood.  This project focuses on the development of a single-molecule technique to simultaneously manipulate and visualize the reaction of hepatitis C virus NS3 protein, a model helicase.  The success of this technique can lead to fundamental knowledge in our understanding of helicase mechanism, and allows quantitative measurement of a broad range of biochemical reactions in exquisite detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project involve research and teaching activities that aim to emphasize the importance of technical innovation in advancement of science, particularly to students with interests in biochemistry and biophysics.  Professor Cheng proposes to teach biochemistry classes with emphasis on technical innovation that enabled important scientific discoveries.  Moreover, he plans to establish an annual single-molecule showcase in his lab, which will be open to local high school and college students.  Through simple demonstration experiments and hands-on experience, he hopes to inspire the students' interest in basic science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this NSF-funded project, we aim to develop an optical tweezers and two-photon fluorescence microscope that allows us to simultaneously manipulate and also observe the biological system under study.  We aim to apply this technique to the study of RNA helicases to understand the mechanisms of ATP coupling to base pair unzipping in the helicase-catalyzed biochemical reaction.  Helicase proteins are ubiquitous and broadly represented in the genomes of various organisms.  It has been estimated that 2% of the eukaryotic genome encodes helicase proteins.  These proteins play indispensable roles in almost every aspect of nucleic acid metabolic processes such as DNA replication, recombination, repair, and various RNA processes inside the cell.  The fundamental activity of these proteins is to use the binding and hydrolysis of ATP to unzip base pairs in double-stranded nucleic acids.  This activity provides the intermediate single-stranded nucleic acids that are needed by the cell to cope with the daily life around DNA and RNA.  Although there have been extensive studies on this broad class of proteins, one of the fundamental questions remains as to how exactly these proteins couple the binding and hydrolysis of ATP to the mechanical activity of nucleic acid unzipping.  To address this question, the capability to monitor and observe individual helicase-catalyzed reaction with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution is strongly desired.     The ability to observe individual molecules in real time as they undergo chemical or physical transformations has revolutionized our ways to probe and understand the microscopic world.  The unique advantage of single-molecule techniques is that they allow direct observation of intermediate states that are often hidden in ensemble measurements.  Because the detection of these intermediate states can offer crucial mechanistic information regarding the underlined molecular processes, it is thus highly desirable to develop single-molecule measurement capabilities that can provide information of this kind.     Through this funded project, we were able to construct the first of its kind, an optical tweezers and two-photon fluorescence microscope.  This instrument offers single-molecule fluorescence sensitivity, and meanwhile we have subnanometer spatial resolution on a second time scale, which allows us to measure nucleic acid unwinding activity by individual helicases with single base pair resolution.  By focusing on the hepatitis C virus NS3 RNA helicase, one of the prototype RNA helicases examined to date, we provided evidence that NS3 helicase displays nucleic acids unwinding activity as a monomeric protein, and we provided the first evidence that monomeric NS3 proteins uses a single ATP to unzip a single base pair of double-stranded RNA.  Analysis of the real time unwinding traces by individual NS3 helicase allowed us to reveal unprecedented details of this enzymatic process.  The helicase first binds ATP, catalyzes the opening of the base pair, but the newly generated single-stranded RNA can be held by the helicase until a later time point for release.  This process recapitulates certain mechanistic aspects of RNA polymerases and these results have broad implications on the mechanisms and functionalities of nucleic acid motor proteins.     The construction of such an optical tweezers and two-photon fluorescence microscope also gives us a unique opportunity to showcase the highly quantitative single-molecule science to the burgeoning new generation of high school and college-level students.  Through our annual single-molecule showcase to demonstrate our instrument, we have reached out to these students in the state of Michigan who aspire basic and quantitative science.  We have offered them live examples of how the development of new tools for scientific discovery will allow people like us to address questions and discover science in ways that are not possible before.
