<AbstractNarration>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Testing hypotheses for Late Devonian biotic and climatic events via high-precision CA-TIMS U-Pb zircon dating and quantitative correlation tools&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mark Schmitz, EAR-1124488&lt;br/&gt;Boise State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D. Jeffrey Over, EAR-1124275&lt;br/&gt;SUNY Geneseo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt; The Late Devonian period hosts a series of global biological extinction events of such magnitude as to be counted among the major mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. Yet no consensus has yet been reached regarding the causative mechanisms of extinction and associated changes in marine sedimentation, biogeochemical cycling, sea level and climate. Testing of competing hypotheses for Late Devonian extinctions?which include sea-level fluctuations and regression, climatic cooling, ocean anoxia, bolide impact, and/or massive volcanism?is currently hampered by a lack of sufficient temporal resolution in paleobiological, tectonic and proxy climate records.&lt;br/&gt;In this study, a multi-disciplinary research team of paleontologists, biostratigraphers and isotope geochemists will combine high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology on interstratified volcanic ash beds in key stratigraphic successions with quantitative biostratigraphy applied to a global Late Devonian multi-taxa database compiled from the literature and new high-resolution sampling.  The U-Pb geochronology will utilize the chemical abrasion and EARTHTIME quadruple spike isotope dilution methods to measure ca 0.1 Ma resolution ages, which will calibrate the construction of the first highly resolved composite standard for the Late Devonian via constrained optimization. With this high resolution age model the research team will interrogate several fundamental questions relating to the abruptness of the late Devonian biotic events, their global synchrony, and process drivers.  Specific hypotheses to be addressed include the synchrony and causality between extraterrestrial impacts or massive volcanism and biotic crises, whether the rates of associated eustatic rise and fall and fluctuations in proxy records of carbon cycling and temperature are consistent with Milankovich-band orbital forcing, and if feedbacks between climate, glacioeustasy, ocean anoxia, and the carbon cycle caused the Late Devonian biotic crises.&lt;br/&gt;This research will impact STEM human resource development via participation of undergraduate students in a multi-disciplinary international science team; develop international scientific collaborations; support the science mission of the EARTHTIME geochronology initiative, and its associated inreach and outreach programs; provide fundamentally improved chronologies for numerous other Paleozoic climate studies; and improve our understanding of deep time climate state transitions potentially analogous to those leading to our current icehouse. The scientific process and content of the proposed research will be captured by a parallel NSF-funded STEM education initiative developing a series of web-based learning objects to teach the science of geochronology and Earth history.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  This award from the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology Program provided funds to develop a quantitative biostratigraphic and radioisotopically calibration time scale for the Upper Devonian, a period of unique paleoclimatic evolution and instability which transitioned the Earth from global hothouse to icehouse conditions through a series of ocean anoxia and black shale deposition interval. Our study established the timing and tempo of these events with ca 100 thousand year resolution across several globally correlated basins, with the primary goal of testing the orbital forcing hypothesis for changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry and circulation, concommitant feedback mechanisms of biological productivity and organic carbon burial, and consequent perturbations to the biosphere including mass extinctions.  Major intellectual outcomes of the project include:  The calibration and integration of radioisotopic geochronology and quantitative biostratigraphy support the synchrony of the Hangenberg and Kellwasser events across the basins of North America, Europe, and China, and thus confirm the global nature of these climatic and biological changes. The calibration and integration analysis quantifies the rapid and short duration of the end-Devonian Hangenberg event on the global scale, consistent with our hypothesized orbital forcing driver. Our work on the Hangenberg event of the end-Devonian has stabilized the numerical calibration of the base of the Carboniferous Period of the global geologic time scale. New collaborations with cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology have been developed for testing and refining a continuous Upper Devonian geologic time scale. Geochronology in the Exshaw and overlying lower Banff Formation of southern Canada have significantly compressed the amount of time over which we now understand these high-organic carbon source rocks were deposited, which has implications for correlation of these strata throughout North America and exploration strategies for hydrocarbon extraction including shale gas and conventional petroleum resources.   The broader impacts of the project include:  Support for seven undergraduate researchers (including five women), six of whom have continued into graduate programs, and one graduate student. Radioisotopic calibration of the Devonian global geological time scale, which will impact scientists across geoscience disciplines. Launch of the "ZirChron App", an on-line Javascript and HTML-based application that allows students to explore real LA-ICPMS and ID-TIMS U-Pb zircon data sets (http://earth.boisestate.edu/isotope/education-and-outreach/zirchron-virtual-zircon-analysis-app/). The application and associated curriculum is part of the On the Cutting Edge Exemplary Teaching Collection.        Last Modified: 01/03/2016       Submitted by: Mark D Schmitz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
