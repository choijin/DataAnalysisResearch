<AbstractNarration>Documenting indigenous languages contributes to the understanding of both linguistic diversity and the human potential to subconsciously organize knowledge in a variety of ways. This RAPID proposal documents the last fluent native speaker who has knowledge of the Mojave Bird Song cycle. To date, there is no permanent, high-quality documentation of these songs or of the cultural contexts in which they are performed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project entails community-based training and involvement in the in-depth recording, transcription, analysis and archiving of the Mojave language as used in the song and of the song cycle itself. The outcome will be a standing record, carefully documented, which will benefit members of the community who are interested in maintaining this tradition in its authentic form and will be of interest to researchers of Ethnomusicology, Linguistics and Cultural Anthropology.</AbstractNarration>

In the context of recording bird songs, also recorded were rare traditional Mojave songs that express the history, place names, and geographical features of Mojave Country. The songs convey stories that constitute a rich linguistic and cultural database. In addition, through video and audio recordings and ethnographic field observations, the project documented Mr. McCord&rsquo;s English-Mojave explanations of song meanings and related cultural and historical content on Mojave people and lands. Importantly, this database is accessible to the community, and audio CDs have been locally distributed. The project also established a template for recording, transcribing, and archiving songs so that community members may study them in relation to Mojave language, stories, and history.

According to Natalie Diaz, director of the Fort Mojave Language Recovery Program that partnered in the study, this language documentation process served as a form of community empowerment, particularly for youth: &ldquo;When young people learn place names in Mojave, it gives them a different connection to those places and makes them feel it is a part of them, and they want to protect it.
