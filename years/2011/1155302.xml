<AbstractNarration>This NSF award funds new research analyzing how  networks affect economic behavior.  The researchers collect a unique dataset that includes detailed network and demographic data on individuals in 75 villages in South India.  Forty-three of these villages participated in a microlending project, and the data includes information on the social networks in all of the villages before and after the introduction of microlending.  The research team uses the data to test hypotheses about whether and how a social network changes when the participants do not need to rely on informal social borrowing/lending relationships because formal microloans are available.  The team will also conduct three other studies.  They will trace the information and diffusion of advice across the network, they will study how the social network affects the success of a program designed to use peer influence to encourage saving, and they want to study the role of peer networks in decisions to default on formal loans.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the creation of a unique data set that is useful for researchers across the social sciences who are interested in how to model and analyze social networks.  Graduate students and undergraduates are involved in the project.  Finally, microfinance has been lauded as a new solution to problems facing poor people in developing countries.    However, recent evidence makes it clear that social networks play a key role in the success or failure of microlending programs.  Understanding this role is key for the design of new microlending policies and products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The various projects under this grant provide new models of how human behavior is influenced by, and influences, social network structure. They also provide new empirical findings on these interactions. They also provide new insights into borrowing and lending behavior, favor exchange, advice networks, and other behaviors. We have also provided new models for analyzing social and economic networks.    In addition, we have provided a new and extremely rich data set publicly available (properly anonymized). It includes detailed information on social networks, demographics, and behaviors from 75 rural villages in southern India.     In particular, we have examined learning and diffusion in communities via word-of-mouth, both theoretically and via the collection of data and field experiments.  The original data that we collected regarded networks and the participation in microfinance in 43 rural villages in the state of Karnataka in southern India.  Anticipating the introduction of services in these villages by a microfinance institution, Bharatha Swamukti Samsthe (BSS), we mapped the social networks among villagers through detailed surveys of households in each of these 43 villages.  The networks are constructed from the answers to questions on 12 interactions, such as from whom they borrow kerosene or rice, from whom they would seek help in a medical emergency, etc.  We have also analyzed how well people are able to identify central people in their own networks.  We have provided both models and empirical tests showing that people can be quite good at identifying the central people in their networks according to new centrality measures that we have developed.  In our latest wave of work we have also collected new network data seeing how networks have changed in response to the introduction of microfinance. Does the fact that some people now have access to formal loans disrupt the patterns of interaction within a community and create new patterns? Who is advantaged/disadvantaged by the introduction of new sources of borrowing? How does this affect other relationships (e.g., exchange of other sorts of favors)?  Our analysis shows that the advice and sharing networks are significantly disrupted by exposure to microfinance.
