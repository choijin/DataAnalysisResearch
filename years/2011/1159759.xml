<AbstractNarration>1159398/1159759 &lt;br/&gt;Cirino/Tang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyketides are an important class of bioactive natural products. The complexity of these compounds demands that their synthesis be conducted by dedicated enzymes with exquisite catalytic properties. Directed evolution of natural product pathway enzymes is limited by the lack of general high-throughput screens for the complex target compounds, as well as the genetic intractability of most organisms expressing these pathways. The proposed research addresses this technology gap through the engineering of synthetic genetic networks that can respond to a desired polyketide compound. Many bacterial regulatory proteins naturally control gene expression in response to a specific "effector" molecule.  We will screen mutant libraries of regulatory proteins to isolate variants that activate expression of a reporter gene in response to polyketide compounds of interest. Then, using E. coli outfitted with the synthetic regulatory circuit, the aromatic polyketide biosynthetic pathway will be engineered towards enhanced production of bioactive metabolites and biosynthesis of new, "unnatural" compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is cofunded by the Biotehchnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering Program, Chemical, Bioengineerng, Environmental and Transport Systems Division, Engineering Directorate, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division of MPS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: Natural products discovered from nature have been an indispensable part of human arsenal towards combatting infectious disease, cancer and other conditions. Our abilities to find new natural products have become limited as the discovery rates have significantly decreased in recent years.  Therefore, using modern bioengineering techniques, such as protein evolution, to manipulate the biosynthetic pathways of natural products towards structural diversification is an attractive approach.  One limitation in applying protein evolution to natural product engineering is that the output cannot be easily related to a phenotype that can be subjected to high throughput screening, which is a vital part of the laboratory evolution approaches.  This proposal aims to bridge this gap by establishing the production of a natural product in genetically amendable hosts such as E. coli or yeast, followed by pathway evolution using a metabolite-sensing synthetic circuit.  We targeted bacterial aromatic polyketides as proof of concept due to their abilities to be recognized by bacterial repressors and activators, leading to modulation of transcription of reporter genes.  In our half of the collaborative proposal, we are tasked with establishing an entire pathway of a polyketide in model hosts.  We chose tetracycline because this molecule has been used extensive in small-molecular regulated gene expression.  The Tet(on) and the Tet(off) systems rely on the binding of tetracycline to the TetR protein to control expression.  Hence if one can establish tetracycline production, then individual components of the biosynthetic pathway can be manipulated, leading to output that can be detected, quantified and screened.  We accomplished so identifying the missing genes in the tetracycline pathway. In particular, two critical steps were investigated and enzymes responsible for them were discovered.  The first enzyme is the one that catalyzes cyclization of the four ring structure in tetracyclines, while the second enzyme is a unusual reductase that completes the conversion from anhydrotetracycline to tetracycline.  Our genetic and biochemical studies unequivocally confirmed the roles of these enzymes in the pathway, identified their substrates and products, and dissected their catalytic mechanisms.  Our work, therefore, completely mapped the biosynthetic pathway of tetracycline and sets up the evolution stages of the work.     Broader Impact:  Our work represents the first complete elucidation of the tetracycline biosynthetic pathway.  The knowledge learned here not only led to increased understanding of enzymes involved in aromatic polyketide biosynthesis, but also enables synthetic biology approaches towards heterologous production and pathway engineering.  At the student training front, this project has led to the training of three graduate students and two postdoctoral fellows. The trainees have entered the biotech workforce; joined prestigious postdoctoral labs, and started independent academic careers.  Our research also trained two undergraduate students.  One of the students is now enrolled in the graduate program at Berkeley, while the other is working in a biotechnology company in the LA area.
