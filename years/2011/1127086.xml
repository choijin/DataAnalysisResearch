<AbstractNarration>The Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences (BBCSS), a standing body of the National Academies, was established in 1997 with five principal goals: (1) to engage academic and other researchers in these sciences in the consideration of major national policy issues; (2) to promote and advance cross-disciplinary inquiry into complex scientific and policy questions; (3) to provide a forum for objective, independent, and rigorous deliberation among researchers, the public, the media, Congress, professional associations, the NSF and other federal agencies; (4) to draw attention to the significance of the behavioral, cognitive, and sensory sciences to national policy; and (5) to link these sciences to the diverse policy issues addressed by the National Academies.&lt;br/&gt;The Board convenes meetings for planning and other purposes, develops workshops and consensus studies that are separately funded and conducted by committees of experts, suggests appropriate experts for other National Academies studies, participates in the review of study activities and reports, and widely disseminates study results. It also regularly grapples with broad issues such as future directions and emerging trends of the behavioral sciences, with an emphasis on policy implications. Members of the Board serve as volunteers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences (BBCSS) is a standing unit within the National Academies of Sciences, Medicine and Engineering (The National Academies) in Washington, DC.  It is the only board at The National Academies whose focus is exclusively on the behavioral sciences writ large.  BBCSS was begun in 1997, with support from NSF (and subsequently other, additional federal agencies over the years), to promote cross-disciplinary inquiry into complex scientific and policy questions, draw attention to the behavioral sciences for national policy initiatives, and engage research scientists to create a vision of where behavioral science is going and how it can be helpful in addressing major national policy issues.  Board activities are the primary focus of core leadership support. The Board met twice a year during this five-year award for a total of 10 meetings.  Those meetings provided a venue for the members to meet with representatives from federal agencies and advance discussion of important research topics of interest (e.g. big data, social neuroscience, and pathways to healthy aging) by hosting open discussions and seminars at board meetings.  NSF staff from the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate presented or participated in many of these meetings and engaged the academic and federal community on the Division?s work and vision.  This award identified several themes for the Board to address some of which were modified over the life of the award to be responsive to changing national concerns.  Themes which played a major role in the board?s thinking over the award period included: Research Management (e.g. IRB requirements, Replicability), Education and Training, Developmental Sciences and Linguistics, Response to Threat and Resilience, and Brain and Behavior.  BBCSS provided oversight on numerous studies and workshops whose funding came from various sources; this practice ensures quality and depth from top expertise in the field. Notably, BBCSS developed and provided oversight for two studies that received NSF project support.  Proposed Revisions to the Common Rule (2014) was influential in federal-level discussions on revisions to IRB regulations as it pertains to the social and behavioral sciences.  Additionally, Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science (2015) continues to be a popular downloaded report (it was the third most-downloaded Academies report of over 200 such reports last year) and is sought by federal agencies, university administrators, and scientists alike.   The board provides a stable presence underscoring the importance of the behavioral sciences across the federal government, within the National Academies, and to other stakeholders such as scientists, the public and universities.  On the other side of this, the board director is available to intervene when the behavioral sciences are not represented in an important initiative and should or could be. The board director (and board members as appropriate) presented and developed new collaborations at professional national and international association meetings; for example, American Psychological Association, International Convention of Psychological Science, Society for Neuroscience, and the International Society of Political Psychology. In addition to sharing the work of the board and discussing the importance of the behavioral sciences in Washington, DC at conferences and meetings, the board director encouraged junior and senior academics to become involved in science policy and served as a contact for the behavioral science research community in helping individuals find ways to participate via fellowships and other roles.   The board director regularly visited Capitol Hill to share reports and explain how certain reports featuring the behavioral sciences might assist Congress in their work. She also met with a wide variety of federal agencies identifying issues they might have, explaining how the behavioral sciences could prove helpful to their concerns and subsequently inviting them to board meetings to encourage cross-fertilization of ideas across government agencies and the scientific community.
