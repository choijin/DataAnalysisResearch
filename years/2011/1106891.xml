<AbstractNarration>The investigator considers new default prior distributions for&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian model selection and model averaging in linear and generalized&lt;br/&gt;linear models.  Prior choice for model specific parameters and for&lt;br/&gt;prior model probabilities is of critical importance, particularly for&lt;br/&gt;modeling high dimensional relationships where subjective&lt;br/&gt;specifications are impractical or where an ``objective'' analysis is&lt;br/&gt;desired.  New families of objective priors that have desirable risk&lt;br/&gt;properties, adapt to unknown degrees of sparsity, and also permit&lt;br/&gt;tractable computations for large scale model search are studied. In&lt;br/&gt;high dimensional problems, the dimension of the model space is&lt;br/&gt;astronomical. Innovative methodology and algorithms for large scale&lt;br/&gt;stochastic search and model averaging for high dimensional model&lt;br/&gt;spaces are developed, with an emphasis on algorithms that exploit the&lt;br/&gt;architecture of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).  GPUs provide the&lt;br/&gt;computing power of a distributed cluster, but at a fraction of their&lt;br/&gt;cost and space/cooling requirements, but require care in the&lt;br/&gt;development of statistical algorithms that take advantage of their&lt;br/&gt;architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in technology have led to the collection of high dimensional&lt;br/&gt;data structures, spawning an increasingly complex array of statistical&lt;br/&gt;models for data. Goals of data analysis may include prediction and/or&lt;br/&gt;selection of a subset of models to test particular theories or to&lt;br/&gt;reduce attention from many speculative models to a few well chosen&lt;br/&gt;models; these are fundamental problems in statistics and throughout&lt;br/&gt;the sciences. In such settings, model uncertainty is ubiquitous.&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian methods offer an effective and conceptually appealing&lt;br/&gt;approach for addressing model uncertainty through Bayesian model&lt;br/&gt;averaging, incorporating both parameter and model uncertainty, while&lt;br/&gt;still permitting selection of a model via coherent decision-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;principles.  The methodological developments are driven by issues that&lt;br/&gt;arise from the following applications 1) identifying important factors&lt;br/&gt;to predict protein activity; 2) predicting risk of international&lt;br/&gt;conflict; 3) health effects of criteria pollutants; and 4) identifying&lt;br/&gt;single nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with ovarian&lt;br/&gt;cancer risk.  As prediction and model selection are some of&lt;br/&gt;the most fundamental and widespread problems in the sciences and&lt;br/&gt;beyond, the project's impact extends beyond the applications listed&lt;br/&gt;above.  The development and distribution of software ensures that&lt;br/&gt;these methods are widely available.</AbstractNarration>
