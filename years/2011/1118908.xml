<AbstractNarration>The generation and destruction of ocean basins on geologic timescales associated with Earth's plate tectonic system is a fundamental process that strongly influences climate patterns and ocean circulation, the location and timing of mountain building events, and the evolution and distribution of organisms. This project is testing  the hypothesis that the Paleo-Tethys Ocean--an ancient ocean basin between Eurasia and Gondwana--closed in a tectonic style analogous to the modern ongoing closure of the western Mediterranean Sea. This hypothesis is motivated by the geographical proximity of ancient continent-continent collision zones within Asia to the geologic remnants of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and the striking similarity of this tectonic assemblage to the modern western Mediterranean region. The Mediterranean-style model we are testing is counter to other tectonic models that suggest collisions between continents and high-pressure metamorphism of continental crust marks the demise of an ocean basin and the end of oceanic subduction. In contrast, the Mediterranean-style model involves the birth and rapid expansion of an ocean basin adjacent to the colliding continents. In addition to explicitly testing a Mediterranean-style closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, alternative hypotheses will be implicitly tested in this project. Hypothesis testing will involve the structural and stratigraphic analysis of rocks in and around the Tibetan Plateau, and the determination of ages and geochemical compositions of individual minerals and rock samples. This project is a multi-disciplinary and collaborative research effort between faculty, researchers, and students at the University of Rochester and the West Virginia University along with scientists from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research in the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We investigated Triassic sediments deposited in the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean, an ancient ocean basin between Eurasia and Gondwana, as well as the rocks that formed the continental margins surrounding eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean, in order to determine if this ocean basin was closed in a tectonic style similar to that of the modern, ongoing closure of the western Mediterranean Sea. Using structural and stratigraphic analysis of rocks in and around the Tibetan Plateau, and comparing the ages of zircon minerals and geochemical compositions of rock samples, we determined that rocks exposed to the north in the North China block and East Kunlun mountain belt were the dominant sources for the Triassic deposits in the north and central eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean (also known as the Songpan-Ganzi basin); thus, the&nbsp;North China block and East Kunlun mountain belt&nbsp;experienced exhumation during the Late Triassic time. To the south, the Ganzi-Litang Ocean must have been closed by Middle Triassic time to allow sediment shed from the Yidun terrane into the southern part of the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean. This implies that there may have been an orogenic belt or an uplifted region to the south of the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean during the Middle-Late Triassic time. Our data indicate that the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean was inverted during latest Triassic time and the oceanic sediments were eroded to provide a sediment source to sedimentary deposits that formed in other basins during latest Triassic time. These observations are depicted in Figure 1 (attached). &nbsp;Overall, our results do not support a Mediterranean-style model for closure of the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean because our results indicate deformation of eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean sedimentary deposits occurred synchronously with infilling of the Sichuan basin to the east of the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean. Timing and style of inversion is incompatible with tectonic style of closure occurring in the western Mediterranean Sea. Our data imply a new configuration of the eastern Paleotethys that has implications for the circulation and connection of Triassic ocean basins that would predict distribution of taxa and that would exert fundamental control on paleoclimate. Paleoclimate of the Triassic is particularly important for understanding recovery of lifeforms following the end-Permian extinction, as well as the cause of the end-Triassic extinction. In addition, the Triassic was a period of substantial plate tectonic reorganization our data provide constraints for models of this plate reorganization. Our data also provide additional characterization of the upper crust of the modern Tibetan plateau, which can be used to model seismic hazards of the Tibetan plateau and associated boundary structures that regularly experience large-magnitude (&gt;M5) seismic events.
