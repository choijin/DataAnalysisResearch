<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to develop methods to improve biomechanical modeling by providing greater understanding of the effects of variations and uncertainty in model inputs.  The study will focus on the process of developing computational models of the knee joint to study conditions such as risks for osteoarthritis.  The approach will more efficiently account for uncertainty in model inputs such as tissue material properties and loading conditions and anatomic variations between individuals.  By adapting robust design tools commonly used in other disciplines to the types of unknowns and variations seen in biomechanical models, the study will clarify how to identify the relative importance of different sources of variation in achieving a model that accurately predicts the clinical conditions.  The method will be tested by comparing various simplified models to a set of highly subject-specific models.  The award will also develop interactive teaching modules related to biomechanical modeling, statistical methods and experimental design for two engineering courses and a high school outreach program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this study will allow investigators to more efficiently decide where to focus their attention in the development of computational biomechanical models. Although the goal will be to provide a process for development of any biomechanical model, our test cases will be models for the investigation of factors such as obesity, in the risk for osteoarthritis.  With this method, it will be possible to select the minimum clinical measurements necessary to adequately test specific hypotheses.  This has the potential to reduce time, cost and risk to the subjects or patients.  The educational impact of this program will be to introduce students to the impacts of uncertainty in the context of interesting biomechanical questions, and to broadly disseminate interactive teaching modules for others to use in undergraduate and high school outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Design for Understanding: Methodology for Efficient Biomechanical Modeling of the Knee  Computational models are becoming more prevalent as tools for the evaluation of medical devices, risks for disease or consideration of medical treatments.  However, these models are based on many complex inputs that can vary widely between individuals and may be difficult to measure safely without great expense or risk to the patient or subject.  Uncertainty in these model inputs can contribute to uncertainty in final model predictions that could limit their usefulness in testing hypotheses about differences between groups or treatment conditions.  Ideally, we would fully customize models with patient specific information about every input parameter.  Unfortunately, this can be very expensive, risky to the patient, or not currently possible with known methodology.  Therefore, the goal of this project was to develop techniques that allow us to better understand which parameters are most critical in the model outcomes.  This will allow engineers and scientists to design efficient and cost-effective models while still ensuring that they offer valid results for the specific question being considered.   Our methods were developed and assessed in models of the human knee, where we considered variations in size, shape and material properties of the bones, as well as differences exhibited in walking patterns.  Ten "custom" models were developed with sophisticated gait analysis, detailed model geometry and tailored material properties. Results from these models were compared to various simplified versions of the modeling techniques to better understand impact of these model simplifications on predictions.  The approach developed guides the researcher to plan their biomechanical model design by comparing both the cost and the influence of various input collection methods on the uncertainty of the model results.  In addition to our studies of the knee, we leveraged our techniques with other ongoing studies of the eye and teeth, to broadly demonstrate the general method for use in biomechanical studies.  Our project also had broader impact through the training of several graduate and undergraduate students in research methods and biomechanics.  We also developed and disseminated educational modules related to biomechanical modeling and design of experiments techniques for high school, undergraduate and graduate classes.
