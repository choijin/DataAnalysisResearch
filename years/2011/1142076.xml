<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ross Sea is believed to contributes a huge portion (~1/3)  of the primary productivity of the Southern Ocean and is home to a similar large portion of the top predators (e.g. 38% of Adelie, 28% of Emperor penguins) of the Antarctic sea ice ecosystem. The trophic pathways in this system are complex in both space and time. One scenario for the Ross Sea ecosystem is that diatoms are grazed by krill, which are in turn the preferred food of fish, penguins and other predators. Phaeocystis colonies, on the other hand lead to grazing by pteropods and other organisms that are a non-favoured food source for top predators. Remotely sensed chlorophyll, indicating all phytoplankton, is then suggested to be a relatively poor predictor of penguin foraging efforts. This is also consistent with notion that algal species composition is very important to penguin grazing pressure, mediated by krill, and perhaps resulting in selective depletion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative research sets out to use an autonomous glider, equipped with a range of sensors, and informed by satellite chlorophyll imagery to be combined with 3-dimenisonal active penguin tracking to their preferred foraging sites. The effect of localized grazing pressure of krill on the appearance and disappearance of algal blooms will also be followed. Overall the objective of the research is to reconcile and explain several years of the study of the foraging habits and strategies of (top predator) penguins at the Cape Crozier site (Ross Island), with the dynamics of krill and their supporting algal food webs. The use of a glider to answer a primarily ecological questions is subject to moderate to high risk, and is potentially transformative.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many oceanographic projects today incorporate new technologies for making observations on different time and space scales than traditional, ship-based investigations.  Our project, based in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, is such an example.  We used an autonomous vehicle called a glider that oscillated within the water column and collected data continuously as it moved.  During 571 dives over 77 days, we measured temperature, salinity, and concentrations of plankton and small fish using optical and acoustic techniques.  In parallel, a number of Adelie penguins were monitored by attaching satellite tags that showed us where they were, how often they dove, and how deep they dove.  The purpose of both of these was to determine how penguins changed their diets during the transition from spring to summer, and how the dominant food items were related to the areaÃ†s oceanography and plankton.  We found that plankton distributions were largely independent of penguin prey items; furthermore, penguins appeared to shift their diets from krill (shrimp-like organisms) to small fish as the season progressed.  Krill moved deeper in the water, likely in response to penguin predation, while fish did not.  These new, cost-effective technologies show tremendous potential for unraveling basic ecological questions that have eluded answers for decades.
