<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on developing computational techniques and high-performance tools for societally relevant problems involving wave propagation in earthquake dynamics and volcano seismology. Increasingly, the hazard associated with these geophysical processes is being informed by detailed modeling of the underlying physical processes. This is computationally challenging due to the coupled multiphysics nature of the problem, existence of many temporal and spatial scales, and the large simulation volumes compared to the small-scale processes that need to be resolved. Additional constraints are placed on the numerical methods by the heterogeneous material properties in the earth and structural complexities such as topography and fault networks.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A computational framework for seismic wave propagation in complex geometries will be developed. This will extend the P.I.?s newly developed, provably stable high-order finite difference method and multi-block grids using coupled structured and unstructured grids. These tools will be used for problems in earthquake dynamics and volcano seismology, but can be extended to other problems involving wave propagation (e.g., seismic imaging, fracture mechanics, and enhanced geothermal energy production).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;An adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code will be developed for the simulation of large magnitude earthquakes using unaltered laboratory measured friction law parameters. Such studies are necessary to understand the effect of altering friction parameters as is routinely done in scenario earthquake simulations. AMR is required as the simulation volume is hundreds of thousands of cubic kilometers, with resolution, at the mm scale, needed in a few percent of the domain near the propagating rupture tip, i.e., transition from locked to sliding on the fault.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the P.I. will assist in advising of students, participate in course development, and lecture on topics in computational science.</AbstractNarration>

It is necessary to supplement our understanding of earthquakes with simulations because the largest and most devastating events are (fortunately) rare.

Intellectual Merits: A new technique was developed that is capable of modeling earthquakes on complex networks of faults. The method is provably robust and was implemented in a parallel code. This code has been released to the public and has been used by both the PI and others to simulate a variety of earthquakes. An example of this is the PI's work to understand the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Prior to this earthquake it was believed that rupture to the seafloor was not possible in this region given the physical properties of the fault and material in the top few kilometers of the fault zone.

The PI along with his collaborators used their numerical method to probe this question and show that large slip at the seafloor is not necessarily incompatible with our current understanding of the physics governing earthquakes. Broader Impacts: The PI's work has been made available to the public through publications and lectures, as well as several general audience press releases and news interviews. During the course of the fellowship, the PI was actively involved in mentoring several graduate students.
