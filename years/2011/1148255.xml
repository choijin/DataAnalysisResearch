<AbstractNarration>This project will catalyze a new generation of sensor-based streaming data applications by building on the foundation of the Open Source DataTurbine (OSDT) middleware (www.dataturbine.org). This will involve strategic software development, systems integration and testing, science experiments, and education and outreach. The software developments will include (A) tools for configuring, testing, and controlling distributed sensor systems, (B) software interfaces that are compliant with the Open Geospatial Consortium Sensor Web Enablement standards, (C) a new OSDT-Matlab interface, and (D) OSDT cybersecurity enhancements. These software products will be integrated into the production research infrastructures at Purdue, the University of Connecticut, the North Temperate Lake LTER Network site, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. The software will be professionally developed and managed as community resources. The intellectual merit of this project will be advances in software engineering, interoperability standards, and systems management for complex real-time sensor systems as well as advances on important open questions in civil engineering, marine science, and ecology. This project will yield broader impacts by enabling new science applications, enhancing productivity, and accelerating innovation across NSF directorates. To ensure that these broader impacts are realized, the team will provide student research opportunities, develop curriculum materials and training courses, and cultivate a community of software users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Open Source DataTurbine (OSDT) middleware software is a significant tool for meeting the challenges of measurement, recording, and data distribution of widely distributed environmental and scientific sensors. Scientists from this collaborative project's lead institution (and home of the project PI), the University of San Diego, coordinated activities and provided support and resources to a wide range of scientific communities via the dataturbine.org website, mailing list, software repository, code maintenance, publications, training, application integration, and demonstrations.   Project Team: A diverse group of collaborators comprising the OSDT Initiative team leveraged DataTurbine middleware to develop and demonstrate interconnected data collection and monitoring applications, along with the software tools and documented expertise to maintain, operate, and extend associated state of the art systems. This report documents the outcomes of one of those partnership activities, led by Purdue University in collaboration with the University of Connecticut.     Many other activities were conducted within the larger collaborative effort, and those partners and collaborators include:         Northern Temperate Lakes (NTL) Long Term Ecological Research (LTER)        Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)        Community Inventory of EarthCube Resources for Geosciences Interoperability (CINERGI)    Research Accomplishments: The Intellectual Merit of this effort focuses on advancing the state of the art in distributed, real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS). RTHS is a powerful and cost-effective testing method in which a structural system is split into a numerical component and a physical component. The physical component usually contains the parts of the structure that need to be evaluated, and these are physically constructed in the laboratory. The numerical component is simulated in a computer and usually contains the parts of the structure can are known and can be modeled. The two components (or more, if needed) are subjected to a dynamic input, and the complete system is simulated realistically by ensuring that the interactions between the two components at the boundaries reflect the real system.  The OSDT middleware was successfully used to conduct geographically distributed RTHS (dRTHS), where multiple components are tested at two distinct locations. The lessons learned were conveyed to the OSDT development team to enhance the capabilities of the base code. A major challenge in such experimentation is that the latency in the communication signal is significant and random, due to internet traffic, and thus methods to accommodate unknown delays were developed. Thus, millisecond-level control-loop feedback control between computing and structural systems widely separated on the Purdue University and University of Connecticut campuses. DataTurbine middleware was performance tested and found to sustain the high-rate data and provide advantages for improving data correlation between sites. Experiments were then performed to examine the performance of structural systems (see test configuration in Figure 1).  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Broader Impacts of this project included education and outreach, data products and publications. Moreover, the technologies developed within this project are enabling more advanced testing than has been done in the past, especially with regard to the distributed use of key laboratories to improve testing efficiency and reduce testing costs. See more details below.    Education and Outreach: Educational efforts also exploited the use of Data Turbine middleware to execute tele-operation experiments using seismic simulator tables. Undergraduate civil engineering students in Cali, Colombia, South America used the remote shake table at Purdue University to learn about structural dynamics and earthquake responses (see photos of experiments Figure...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
