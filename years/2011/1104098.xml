<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to provide funding for the three annual meetings on Geometric Group Theory on the Gulf Coast (abbreviated G^3). &lt;br/&gt;The next conference will be held in Panama City, FL on March 24-27th of 2011. Last decade have seen intense interactions and cross-fertilization of geometric group theory with other parts of mathematics such as asymptotic and coarse geometry, operator algebras and Novikov type conjectures, analysis and dynamics on group boundaries, discrete groups and nonpositively curved spaces. These are separate fields yet they increasingly borrow techniques, examples, and insights from each other, and their richness and interplay feeds back to the geometric group theory, and provides strong motivation for its development. The intellectual goal of the conference is to assemble researchers from these neighboring fields, so they can share ideas and expertise while interacting with students and junior mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The G^3 conference focuses on interactions of geometric group theory with other parts of mathematics. G^3 has been held annually since 1998 at various places on the Gulf Coast, and it has become an established and popular international meeting. Over the years a great many different people attended G^3, and it has become well-known for a unique friendly atmosphere which helped foster interactions of established and junior mathematicians, jump-start careers and collaborations, and build the sense of community in geometric group theory.&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found on the conference website http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~mineyev/ggg/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Geometric Group Theory on the Gulf Coast Conference (abbreviated Gee Cube) has been held annually since 1998 at various places on the Gulf Coast, and is now an established and popular international meeting. The conference focused on interactions of geometric group theory with other parts of mathematics.  Typically there are 18 fifty-minute-talks, including several talks by graduate students.  Aided by the conference small size (25-30 participants) and its waterfront locations, Gee Cube has become well-known for a unique friendly atmosphere that fosters interactions of established and junior mathematicians, help jump start careers and collaborations, and build the sense of community in geometric group theory.  The meetings funded with this grant were held on March 24-27, 2011 in Panama City Beach, Florida, April 5-8, 2012 in Pensacola Beach, Florida, and March 21-24, 2013 on South Padre Island, Texas.  The conference was organized by Igor Belegradek (Georgia Tech), Josh Barnard (South Alabama), Ben McReynolds (Purdue) and Igor Mineyev (Urbana Champaign).  Last decade has seen intense interactions and cross-fertilization of geometric group theory with other parts of mathematics which increasingly borrow techniques, examples, and insights from each other, and their richness and interplay feeds back to the geometric group theory, and provides strong motivation for its development.  By design Gee Cube does not focus on one subfield.  The intellectual goal of the conference was to assemble researchers from these neighboring fields, so they can share ideas and expertise while interacting with students and junior mathematicians.
