<AbstractNarration>In the upper atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars, molecular oxygen is dissociated into atomic oxygen by absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation. The oxygen atoms can then recombine through a 3-body interaction with another molecule to form molecular oxygen in an excited state. On Venus and Mars, the third molecule is carbon dioxide. The competition between photodissociation, recombination, and diffusive transport determines the atomic and molecular composition of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Accurate knowledge of the oxygen atom recombination processes is critical for modeling the diurnal behavior of the altitude profile of oxygen atoms and interpreting nightglow emissions from atomic oxygen, molecular oxygen, and hydroxyl. In this project, the Principal Investigator and a postdoctoral fellow will conduct laboratory experiments to study the yields of the excited molecular oxygen states generated following O-atom recombination in a carbon dioxide environment. An ultraviolet light pulse from an excimer laser will photoinitiate O-atom recombination in carbon dioxide, maintained in a temperature-controlled gas flow cell. Fluorescence and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) techniques will detect excited oxygen molecules and determine the yields of the excited states produced following O-atom recombination and subsequent relaxation in carbon dioxide. These measurements are needed to quantify oxygen airglow in the upper atmospheres of Venus and Mars and to probe their atmospheric dynamics by remote sensing. The results will benefit modelers of planetary atmospheres and will enhance the scientific returns on past and future missions to Venus and Mars. Application of basic chemistry and physics to the study of collisional processes is also critical for understanding the operation of high-power chemical lasers. Finally, the project will contribute to the training and research experience of a postdoctoral fellow and summer undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

Laser spectroscopic techniques were employed to study the kinetics, pathways, and mechanistic details of the formation of excited states of molecular oxygen following oxygen atom recombination in a carbon dioxide atmosphere; i.e., in an environment relevant to the atmospheres of Mars and Venus.  This project provided experimental evidence for the presence of the O2 (c-a) emission in the dark side of Venus at an altitude of approximately 95 km. Moreover, the laboratory measurements investigated the rates of deactivation of excited O2(c) molecules in collisions with O atoms and CO2. The results revealed the important role of O atoms in the emitting layer of the atmosphere of Venus. This project also contributed to two publications: one revising our understanding of the O(1D) + O2 energy transfer process and  the other presenting experimental evidence that, following photodissociation of CO2 below its ionization limit, additional pathways exist leading to CO(a) indirect production from higher CO triplet states.  This project also provided research training and educational opportunities for two summer undergraduate students and two postdoctoral fellows. The undergraduate students participated in SRI InternationalÃ†s NSF-supported Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.
