<AbstractNarration>The State University of New York at Brockport is developing and implementing resources and methodologies to improve technological pedagogical content knowledge in teacher education. The project is using resources and computational mathematics, science, and technology (C-MST) courses, developed under previous grants, to improve teacher education. It emphasizes the recently developed conceptual framework, technological pedagogical content knowledge that has now put both science educators and computational scientists on the same path to utilize an interdisciplinary approach to STEM and teacher education. Strong content knowledge (via a STEM degree), extensive field experience (150 hours), student teaching, dual certification (science and special education), computational pedagogy courses, monetary support in the form of internships and scholarships, and a capstone summer institute construct  a set of coherent strategies to attract, prepare, and retain a new cadre of 40 secondary school science teachers. The project is informed by a formative evaluation to enable frequent reviews and mid-course corrections and is disseminating its findings and resources through articles, conference papers and the project's website. The curriculum framework and learning modules are shared with national digital library collections contributing to teacher education nationwide.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The latest learning theories suggest that students learn better if they are engaged in activities closely resembling the way experts think and work. Accordingly, recent national K-12 learning objectives recommend constructivist activities to teach students experts&rsquo; habits of mind.

This outcome has resulted from a model of &ldquo;how we think and learn,&rdquo; arrived at through empirical data collected from teachers and students in this and other NSF projects by the principal investigator.

Today, they have evolved to showcase many structural and functional similarities with the brain. These similarities arise from quantifiable aspects of information constructs, as suggested by Alan Turing,<sup> </sup>and the appearance of a universal mechanism (Fig. 1) by which quantifiable things form and evolve.
