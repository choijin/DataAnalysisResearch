<AbstractNarration>The work will focus on models of computing with brain cells, more specifically the neurons and their major support cells in the brain, the glia. The major novelty of the project is the consideration of the glia cells in these models of computation. The interplay between glia and neurons has not been considered in the domain literature until now. Thus the project will not only look at how to perform computation taking inspiration from the organization of the neurons and glia into networks, but also explore topics such as investigating the power related to sequentiality/parallelism of such devices, synchronization, data processing and manipulation such as considering different types of output encoding for the computation. Several other topics considered already for neuronal systems such as universality/non-universality of networks with various restrictions, normal forms and consideration of the refractory period of neurons will also be investigated for the new devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will incorporate an experimental part in the second year of the timeline when with the help of the senior researcher on the project, Dr. Mark DeCoster (professor of Biomedical Engineering) the results of the first phase of the work will be validated in the lab. The work holds promise to significantly impact several research areas as well as the emerging area of computing with cells. In Computer Science, the research may yield new paradigms and new computing techniques (as has happened in the discovery of genetic algorithms and neural networks). In Biology, the project is likely to provide insight into the organization of brain cells networks, including the support cells for neurons, the glia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major objectives of this project is to gain more knowledge and insight into the extraordinary biological systems ? the cells and also to understand in a systemic way how the sub-cellular processes work and how the cell-cell communications can be useful for performing distributed computations. Algorithms, source codes and results of the project will be freely disseminated to the public through the project's website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project utilized computer software tools to visualize and simulate dynamic cell processes in the brain.  Additionally, the dynamic processes of living brain cells were experimentally obtained using a microscope that allowed us to take movies of calcium levels inside of brain cells over time.         We learned by using the simulation software and by doing experiments with the brain cells that balance is important for the whole brain to work together normally.  In software and simulation form, we made models of the brain cell balance by using a "predator-prey" system.  For example, in our computer simulations, wolves and sheep can represent the balance needed in the brain:  without wolves, sheep population may explode (get too big) and is not sustainable.  Without balance the sheep population may die out suddenly.  Thus wolves (predators) help balance the sheep (prey) population.         In like manner, in our brain, we need a balance as well.  The major balance we considered in this project was between two types of brain cells:  neurons and glia.  In our experiments using brain cell cultures we found that populations of glial cells are needed to balance the response of neurons to stimulation.  Neurons are the most sensitive brain cell type, and so if too few glia are available, then the neurons can become over-excited and may be injured and die.  This type of balance may be important in how both the normal brain functions, as well as how it behaves in many diseases.           During the course of this project award, the Principal Investigator used the technical aspects of the work to apply for and achieve additional funding as part of the National Science Foundation I-Corps Teams mechanism.  This new grant award (NSF Award # 1463098) provided additional professional training to both the PI and a Ph.D. student who served as the entrepreneurial lead (EL) on the new project.  As part of the I-Corps grant, some of the technical aspects for this completed project were shared in the form of a YouTube video that we created.  The video is posted on-line and may be found at:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9a_XdWLqLc          Last Modified: 07/13/2015       Submitted by: Mark A Decoster]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
