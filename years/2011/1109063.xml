<AbstractNarration>Sun&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1109063&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator develops a new mathematical framework for nonlinear sampling and recovery of signals with finite rate of innovation from theoretical viewpoint and in practical realization.  The investigator works on several fundamental problems concerning the recovery of a signal from its noisy sampled data, the exploration of efficient algorithmic methods in the presence of substantial noise, and the application of the novel sampling methodology to engineering problems.  This interdisciplinary project is based on the observations that signals in many engineering problems have finite rate of innovation and could be approximated by signals with sparse representations, and that the sampling process has strong neighbor dependency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sampling theory is one of the most basic and fascinating topics in mathematical science and in engineering sciences.  In engineering applications, such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging systems in communication, and mass spectrometry in medical diagnosis, noisy sampled data are obtained, real-time recovery is preferred, and very accurate restoration is crucial for meaningful justification.  Standard Fourier approaches and conventional sampling techniques are inapplicable in such problems.  The challenge resides in the requirement of rapid, accurate, and robust recovery.  The investigator applies calculus for infinite matrices and introduces novel compressive techniques to tackle fundamental sampling problems.  Success in the project could be both mathematically fundamental and technologically important, and has potential impact in the strategic areas of information technology and biotechnology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of the project is on  nonlinear sampling theory for  signals with finite rate of innovation both from a theoretical viewpoint  and in practical realization.  The PI have thirteen journal papers already published and accepted. He  gave more than twenty-five talks in professional conferences and   universities around the world. He supervised two PhD students and one  master student  worked in  various aspects of the project. The PI made contributions on several topics on sampling theory, including 1) nonlinear sampling problem in Banach spaces,  2)  mathematical safeguard of sparse stochastic process, 3)  mathematical framework on spatially distributed systems for signal sampling and reconstruction,  4) Galerkin method for real-time signal reconstruction,  5) sparse wavelet signal reconstructions from their  Fourier measurements, 6) universal capacity limit of transmission channels, and  7) the long-standing abc-problem for Gabor systems.  1. The fidelity measurement of perceptual signals, such as acoustic and  visual signals,  might not be well measured by the square error.   Alternatives of the fidelity measure are weighted norms for signals  living in some Banach spaces. The PI extended  strict monotonicity from  Hilbert spaces to Banach spaces and proposed an iteration algorithm to  solve nonlinear functional equations in Banach spaces. This finding has  been used to  locally identification and  qualification of  innovation positions and  amplitudes of signals with  finite rate of innovation.  2.. The fractional Laplacian has tight link to splines,  fractional  Brownian  motion, and signal processing. The PI and his collaborators found the unique  left-inverse of  the fractional Laplacian with the dilation-invariant  and integrable  property. This finding provides mathematical safeguard   to the  specification of sparse stochastic  processes with finite  rate of  innovation.  3. A spatially distributed system consists of huge amounts of small sensing devices with limited  computing and telecommunication capabilities.It has been widely used in  multivehicle  and  multirobot  networks,  wireless  sensor  networks,   smart  grids,  etc. Recent technological advances have opened up  possibilities to deploy  spatially distributed systems for signal  sampling and reconstruction. The PI and his collaborators introduced a  graph structure for such spatially distributed system  and a coupling  technique for signal sampling and reconstruction. This mathematical framework has been used to design robust  spatially distributed system against supplement, replacement and  impairment of agents,  and to develop distributed algorithms for  suboptimal  signal approximation in the presence of bounded sampling noises.  4. Real-time signal reconstruction is crucial in lots of engineering applications. In most of  sampling procedures in those applications, only finitely many samples are available. Lot of research has been done, but a general framework is still missing. The PI and his collaborators introduced a reconstruction framework based on Galerkin method, which is robust and fast-implementable and then applicable in real-world problems.  We observe that Galerkin equations can be efficiently solved and the unique solution is robust in the presence of noises.  5.. The problem of reconstructing sparse wavelet signals from their    Fourier measurements has many practical applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging,  and it has received a great deal of attentions in recent    years since the emergence of compressive sensing.   The PI and his    collaborators explicitly constructed a sampling set, whose cardinality    is independent on the signal dimension and  almost proportional to  the   signal sparsity. They introduced a  Prony algorithm to    recover high-dimensional sparse wavelet signals from their partial    Fourier measurements.  6. Filtering  is a basic technique in  signal transmission.
