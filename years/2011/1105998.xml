<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to explore the coupling of superconductivity into the conducting surface modes of Topological Insulators (TI) such as Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3, and other related compounds.  By making samples with superconducting electrodes separated by the TI, the behavior of superconducting pairs in the spin-orbit correlated surface state can be studied.  Such two dimensional systems have been predicted to exhibit p-wave superconductivity and have vortex cores that contain bound Majorana Fermion states, which may form the basis for topologically protected qubits. The samples are fabricated in two coupled molecular beam epitaxy systems, one specializing in the growth of the TI material and the other dedicated to the growth of niobium films.  Since the sample remains under ultra-high vacuum conditions during the growth of all layers, the interface is free of contaminants and very transparent junctions between the two materials are obtained.  Students working on this project are trained in advanced materials synthesis, nanoscale device fabrication, and low temperature measurement techniques. This provides them with a broad technical background that is useful for work in many areas of materials science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Nontechnical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Topological Insulator (TI) is a new kind of material in which the bulk of a sample is not conducting, but a two dimensional layer on its surface is.  Moreover, the conducting surface state is made up of only half of the electrons that a normal conductor has - for an electron with a given momentum, only one spin is present.  When superconducting pairs are introduced in such a 2D system with momentum-spin correlations, a new kind of state has been predicted to emerge, a so-called Majorana Fermion (MF). According to theory, this state can be used to construct a long-lived qubit, a quantum bit that can be processed by a quantum circuit that is also topologically protected from decoherence. To study this effect, samples of TIs are made using ultra high vacuum deposition technology. Then superconducting films are deposited on top to introduce superconductivity into the surface modes.  Devices are made using nanoscale lithography and advanced etching technology, and they are measured at low temperatures to search for MFs. The students working on this project receive training in a wide range of advanced science and technology preparing them well for developing technologies of the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Topological materials are unusual because on their surface they have a two dimensional electron "liquid" that can carry current.  Furthermore, for each of these surface electrons, there is only one spin direction present, unlike a normal electron state where two spins are allowed - spin up and spin down.  This reduced system means that magnetism is directly coupled to currents.  Another implication is that new types of electronic excitatiions are predicted to be present if the surface states are made to superconduct.  While this can happen naturally if a force can be introduced in the surface states to cause this to happen, it is not known how to do this so far.  An alternate scheme that has been proposed to make this happen is to use the "superconducting proximity effect" and induce superconductivity in the topological surface states by putting the surface in intimate contact with a conventional (s-wave) superconductor.  This should induce exotic (p-wave) topological superconductivity into the surface state electrons.  It was the purpose of this project to study how this occurs.  We carried out this work by growing thin films of the topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 on top of hexagonal sapphire substrates.  The TI has a similar crystal symmetry and it grew on the sapphire in such a manner that allowed us to obtain films of different thicknesseshaving surfaces that were essentially atomically flat.  We then deposited superconducting niobium onto the TI through a lithographically defined masking layer.  What resulted was an array of 1 micron square niobium islands separated from each other by 0.1 micron gaps in both lateral directions.  When we measured the resistance versus temperatureof this we saw the resistance drop at the superconducting transition of the niobium islands and then more slowly decrease as the temperature was lowered until a dramatic drop to near zero occurred at even lower temperatures.  The resistance went to zero in a manner predicted for two dimensional superconductivity known as a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoulless transition.  We also made samples of thin Bi2Se3 films of specific thicknesses placed directly on a thick superconductor, niobium. We examined how the phase transition into the superconducting state occurred in the Bi2Se3 as a function of thickness of the Bi2Se3.  We found out that superconductivity only penetrates a few molecular layers deep.  This sets the thickness scale for experiments seeking to exploit topological superconductivity in coherent quantum devices such as topological qubits.
