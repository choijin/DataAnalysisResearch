<AbstractNarration>Operational and safety goals for the built environment demand robust, scalable and reliable large&lt;br/&gt;scale monitoring for infrastructure systems. High performance real-time event detection and decision making&lt;br/&gt;requires models and algorithms to process large amounts of data from dense sensor networks deployed&lt;br/&gt;in these systems. Despite advances in the development of detection algorithms for such networks, there are&lt;br/&gt;two widely recognized and conflicting obstacles: detection rules need to be sufficiently complex to adapt to&lt;br/&gt;the spatiotemporal changes in the environment, requiring the sharing of data; but rules are constrained by&lt;br/&gt;statistical performance guarantees and computation and communicational budgets imposed by the network.&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these challenges by developing a fundamentally new approach that jointly accounts&lt;br/&gt;for statistical detection, communication constraints and distributed computation.&lt;br/&gt;This research develops a framework that integrates the distributed computation and communication constraints&lt;br/&gt;of the underlying network infrastructure with flexible stochastic modeling and learning algorithms&lt;br/&gt;with spatiotemporal data. The modeling and algorithms enable simultaneous and sequential decision making&lt;br/&gt;at many local sites, by borrowing information across the network in a statistically coherent and computationally&lt;br/&gt;efficient manner. Combining the formalism of sequential change point detection, nonparametric and&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic graphical models and spatiotemporal statistics, the project develops distributed and sequential&lt;br/&gt;message-passing algorithms for detecting changes in the underlying distributions generating network data.&lt;br/&gt;The models developed also offer new theoretical understanding of the trade-offs between statistical model&lt;br/&gt;complexity, distributed computation efficiency, and structure of communication constraints within the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary research brings together students and researchers from different areas, utilizing&lt;br/&gt;and developing knowledge and cross-disciplinary skills in the fields of computer science, statistics, signal&lt;br/&gt;processing and civil engineering.</AbstractNarration>
