<AbstractNarration>Computer Science educators are constantly reinventing introductory courses to revitalize the overall curriculum, without the requisite attention to the fundamental upper-level courses. While the focus on drawing students into Computer Science is vital to maintain the enrollment needed to supply a technically-starved workforce, it is vital to use innovative pedagogical approaches, contextualized to how students learn, throughout the curriculum ensuring that students attain the technical skills needed to succeed in industry. To address these challenges, this project has two main thrusts. First, it designs, pilots and evaluates curriculum materials for three upper-level Computer Science courses that utilize mobile computing technology to contextualize, motivate and demonstrate fundamental computing concepts on a platform students can relate to. The three courses utilize active learning pedagogical approaches that engage and encourage students to attain core computing principles while attaining the marketable technical skills associated with mobile technology. Second, it creates service-learning opportunities, out-of-classroom events and internship positions in which students can apply the mobile technology skills in an industry project and showcase their work to the larger community. The culmination of these efforts creates a synergy between instruction in and out of the classroom that balances the acquisition of fundamental computing skills and the attainment of in-demand industry technical skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Smart Mobile Application Research and DevelopmenT @ Towson University (SMART@TU) project had an underlying goal to engage and encourage students to learn core computing principles while attaining the marketable technical skills associated with mobile technologies. To do so, this project had two main goals:   To continually revitalize the upper-level Computer Science undergraduate program through the inclusion of emerging technologies to increase student motivation, retention and learning.  To provide immersive service-learning opportunities to Computer Science undergraduate students to gain real-world software development experience by engaging community partners.   As a part of this, the main efforts of this project involved: (1) designing, piloting and offering new curriculum materials for three upper-level Computer Science courses using a mobile computing platform paired with pedagogical approaches sensitive to the learning styles of todayÆs student; and, (2) developing out-of-classroom learning opportunities reinforcing in-classroom technical skills.  As a result of the efforts of this project, several specific outcomes were achieved, including:  The development and establishment of a permanent course in the Computer Science curriculum to provide students with the experience of working as part of a project team using current software design and development tools and environments. The development, piloting, evaluation and dissemination of six mobile computing learning interventions for two upper-level, core Computer Science courses that presents existing course content in the context of mobile computing. The establishment of the SMART@TU Mobile Application Development Lab at Towson University as a permanent application development/research lab for students working on mobile computing projects.  The organization of a mobile computing student club at Towson University, with nearly 300 members of students, staff, faculty members and Baltimore-area developers and industry leaders, and offering of 13 seminar events with a total of more than 500 members attending the technical talks.   The initiation of two service-learning, humanitarian, software development projects involving mobile application development: Project Wavyleaf, a mobile application to enable citizen-scientists to identification, reporting and mapping of wavyleaf basketgrass (Oplismenus hirtellus spp. undulatifolius), an invasive and potentially destructive grass that was first found in Maryland in 1997; and, Vital, a mobile application to monitor the health information of patients after a cardiac incident to detect and inform health professionals of any early signs of health anomalies.    In each case, the project outcomes were disseminated through several presentations/publications at appropriate computer science education conferences, posted to project-specific websites and/or through education repositories.    The outcomes of this project focused on utilizing modern technologies (i.e., mobile computing platforms) across several courses to emphasize the link between Computer Science concepts and create a more cohesive, modern, marketable education experience. The exposure to cutting-edge technologies in a capstone project course as well as in core, computer science courses will continue to contextualize important computing concepts to technologies familiar to todayÆs students. Societal benefits include an evaluated and improved educational approach spanning several courses that will be used to train students to imagine, design and develop the mobile applications of the future and enable a more prepared workforce. The SMART@TU Mobile Application Development Lab at Towson University will continue to provide service-learning opportunities for students and technology transfer for community partners without the technical resources. The current and future dissemination of this work, through project showcase days, the established mobile computing student club and o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
