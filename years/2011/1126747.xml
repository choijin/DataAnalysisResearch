<AbstractNarration>This project, aiming to develop instrumentation that enables rigorous experimental quality and dependability assessment of cloud computing systems, including cloud service-oriented architecture&lt;br/&gt;(SOA) systems, dramatically enhances the validation capability of cloud platform services and cyberinfrastructure. Cloud platforms must meet specified service level agreements (SLA) and provide mechanisms to support the minimization of the power used in cloud data centers without adversely affecting the quality of service (QoS). Also, some safety-critical emerging cloud applications, such as health-care and transportation applications, must meet stringent dependability requirements, that include high availability, reliability, performance, resilience, safety, and security. The proposed work establishes a high performance, metrics-driven instrument enabling rigorous evaluation for the following research projects on cloud performance: &lt;br/&gt;- Assurance of QoS in Service Clouds,&lt;br/&gt;- Optimization of Dependability in Evolving Clouds,&lt;br/&gt;- Mobile Device Power Management in Service Clouds,&lt;br/&gt;- Achievement of Highly Secure Compositions in Service Clouds, and&lt;br/&gt;- Testing and Validation of Secure Hardware-Software Architectures.&lt;br/&gt;The work aims to develop a flexible instrument for validation and verification of cloud performance, seen to be a key element in the future of computing services. In recent years, computer services have been moving to remote virtual machines ?in the cloud.? The commercial success of this new business model is based on service quality guarantees, which are becoming increasingly hard to verify as the complexity and volume of cloud services increase. Testbeds of this type are critical to the economic and research vitality of the academic and industrial communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation substantially raises the quality, scale, and scope of experimental research in dependability enhancement methods for cloud computing systems. It helps foster a strong scientifically based experimental paradigm for computing and provides capabilities that will greatly enhance the quality of undergraduate and graduate courses in computer science and engineering, as well as senior design projects by enabling students to work on realistic platforms. The instrumentation enhances the facilities of an NSF I/UCRC and will be available to researchers at the participating institutions and industrial partners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This MRI grant is for "infrastructure development" with the goal of developing a comprehensive set of instruments for measuring the dependability and quality of cloud computing systems, including various performance, reliability, usability, availability, and security attributes.  In this MRI project of  "infrastructure development" we have achieved our goal of developing a comprehensive set of instruments for measuring the dependability and quality of cloud computing systems, including various performance, reliability, availability, usability, and security attributes. The architecture and design has been completed but still under continuous improvement, the various instruments development are completed and ready to be used with some additional supervision and support from our team.  Experimental research on  highly-dependable cloud computing will be enabled by the  instrument  developed in this project. In addition, advances in  instrument from this project for cloud-based system testing, evaluation,  exploration, and optimization will be of immediate interest to a broad  group of high technology companies. Instruments for measuring quality  and dependability of cloud-based systems, which are also part of this  project, are needed before the deployment of high-quality systems in  critical application domains.  Cloud computing has many  potential usage in research, education, and many important societal  functions. The instruments developed in this project will enable  the experimental validation of proposed cloud computing solutions with  assured level of dependability, which in turn, will enable the  widespread application of cloud-based solutions in many disciplines of  science, engineering, education, and other societal functions.  Commercial technologies  invovling cloud computing solutions will benefit from the availability  of our research instrument by having an objective, publicly accessible  collection of instrument to measure and evaluate the dependability and  quality before the products or solutions are finalized and contiue to  benefit by tuning and improving deployed products and solutions for  better dependability and quality.  Many of the societal functions,  including economic development, government services, education,  business, etc., will be impacted by the paradigm shift from traditional  information technology and computing to cloud computing. This project  would help ensure dependability of such cloud computing infrastructure  thus benefit the society in general.
