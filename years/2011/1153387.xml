<AbstractNarration>This workshop takes stock of the current status of the science of voting technology and election administration.  The two major outcomes will be a (1) a conference proceeding, in written and video form, and (2) a blueprint for graduate education aimed at training a new generation of scholars who can engage in innovative research, working in a diverse, multidimensional field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards to intellectual merit, the nascent science of election administration and policy operates at the intersection of several fields of science and engineering, including computer science, design, economics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, operations research, political science, and statistics.  A few institutional efforts have combined these perspectives into a single research program.  Still, a consensus has yet to develop about the core knowledge necessary to support a scientific approach to election administration and policy.  The workshop will articulate an intellectual core and a framework in which professional knowledge might be accumulated, disseminated, and applied to practical problems associated with voting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards to broader impacts, the workshop will foster two major types of broader impacts.  The first is to develop closer links between the research conducted by established scientists and engineers in the field - most of whom have research profiles in more traditional fields - and graduate education in traditional STEM disciplines.  The second is to encourage a more coherent interaction between researchers in universities and research centers, on the one hand, and public officials, including election administrators, on the other.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The original proposal anticipated a conference in the Spring 2012 with follow-up activity in Fall 2012.   The conference anticipated bringing an interdisciplinary group together on the MIT campus to review the accumulating scientific literature on voting technologies, and to explore ways in which an interdisciplinary graduate training program could be developed to institutionalize these gains into the future.  However, the award was not granted in time to hold the conference at the originally scheduled time.  Anticipating that participants would be available for a conference in 2013, plans were made to shift the timing by a year --- holding the conference in the spring of 2013, with follow-up activity in the summer.  However, several people associated with the conference, particularly the PI, were heavily involved in working to provide expert testimony to the Presidential Commission on Election Administration (PCEA) in 2013.  This made it impossible to hold the conference at the revised time, as planned.  As research commitments of the original planners continued to grow, it became apparent that it would be impossible to plan an organize the proposed event anytime soon.  Therefore, it was decided to return the grant, with the hope that a similar event could be planned in the future, using institutional funds.
