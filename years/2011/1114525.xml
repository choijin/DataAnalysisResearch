<AbstractNarration>The Lost Ladybug Project (LLP) is a Cornell University citizen science project that connects science to education by using ladybugs to teach non-scientists concepts of biodiversity, invasive species, and conservation. The project has successfully engaged thousands of children (ages 5-11) in collecting field data on ladybugs and building a ladybug biology database that is useful to scientists. It has also reached 80,000 people over the Internet. The goal of the project is to promote lifelong appreciation of biodiversity and science, and provide scientists with data on the changing distribution and abundance of ladybug species across the country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project is broadening the Lost Ladybug Project's reach geographically, culturally, demographically, and contextually by creating new tools and materials for the website, and forging new connections with (1) youth groups, (2) science centers, community centers, botanical gardens, nature centers, and organic farms, (3) adults, (4) Native Americans, and (5) Spanish-speakers. The expanded project could potentially involve tens of thousands of new individuals in ladybug monitoring research. An evaluation study is measuring the impacts of the expansion on new participants' knowledge, skills, attitudes, interests, and behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Ladybug Project has been important in advancing scientific discovery and building scientific knowledge. Data collected by the project's volunteers have improved scientists' understanding of (1) ladybug species presence/absence, (2) shifts in ladybug species composition, (3) shifts in ladybug species ranges, and (4) change in ladybug body size and spot number. Evaluation data show that the project has a broad audience reach and is achieving its learning goals for adults and children. Broadening the project's reach will further increase the project's importance to ecology, conservation biology and biodiversity research, as well as education research.</AbstractNarration>

The results of this project are shared via LLP web pages with current reports and media story links; professional and public presentations; personal communications; social media; and scientific and informal science education publications.  PARTICIPANT POOL.  The LLP has reached over 1,400,000 people through our project website (www.lostladybug.org), LLP Facebook page activities, and other social media; an estimated 70,000 people have participated in LLP programs and event activities; and over 15,000 participants (encompassing all 50 US states) have submitted ladybug images, as individuals or in families or other groups.  Participation also includes email questions and requests for materials, Lost Ladybug Project Facebook "Likes" at 8,956 and Facebook conversation/question activity.  A wide range of individuals have been trained through participation in Lost Ladybug Project outreach activities: undergraduate students, extension and teaching specialists, 4H youth educators, classroom teachers, environmental educators, parents, graduate students, and faculty members, delivered presentations to the public.  Individuals with experience leading ladybug surveys and programs are now training other educators and volunteers to be leaders and to use the LLP in their classrooms and environmental education programs.  Increased numbers of national, state, and county parks, nature preserves, camps and museums are incorporating LLP activities into their ongoing outdoor programing. Educators are independently using LLP curricula and materials, creating their own, and documenting how the LLP meets learning standards.  NATIONAL LADYBUG DATABASE.  From photographs submitted by LLP participants, as of Sept 2017, we have positively identified over 38,000 submitted photographs of ladybug specimens from 195 different species.  The online LLP database of these photographs and data is catalogued, searchable, and downloadable by species, collection date, location, habitat, and collector.  The database is free and open to the public and scientific communities.  Perhaps most remarkable is that participants, since the spring of 2008, have found and photographed more of the once common and now suddenly rare ladybug species than have been found in any other survey in decades. As of 2017, participants have submitted 1,765 photographs of specimens of these three important ladybug species in the United States: Coccinella novemnotata, C. transversoguttata, and Adalia bipunctata. This represents more individuals of these now-rare species than have been reported in technical publications for the last 20 years.  The establishment of healthy and stable colonies of rare ladybug species in the LLP laboratory is an important contribution to research and education on the decline of these species in the wild.  Rebuilding or re-introduction of these species to their native habitats is now possible.  The LLP is making contributions towards addressing the challenge of the degradation of ecological services on which we all depend.

LLP participants were most motivated by: being excited to contribute to original scientific research, interest in the goals of the LLP, and the possibility they might discover a rare species of ladybug in their area.
