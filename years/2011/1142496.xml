<AbstractNarration>The Mississippi River is experiencing a historic flood of major geological significance.  The flooding provides an excellent chance to document sedimentation associated with the event and contrast it with storm deposition data from hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita.  It is possible that the massive sediment load carried through Southwest Pass will lead to gravity flows on the delta front that could be documented with repeat coring.  This research will determine the stratigraphic signature of the flood on the Mississippi subaqueous delta and will compare the sedimentological, radiochemical, and geochemical signature of the recent flood deposits on the shelf with previously studied hurricane deposits as well as examine strata of the delta front for evidence of flood-induced sediment-gravity flows.  The proposed research provides a rare opportunity to study the critical processes of sediment and solute supply to the coastal ocean for a major river system.  Broader impacts of the work include the training of up to six students in seagoing science and understanding the importance of major flooding events and sediment transport in the replenishment and erosion of the Mississippi Gulf Coast coastline.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Floods can dramatically increase the sediment load supplied to coastal margins, and thus, deposition associated with floods can influence sedimentation on continental shelves.  A geologically significant flood occurred in the Mississippi River from May to June 2011.  The river crest surpassed historic levels (5.27 m) in Vicksburg, MS, necessitating the opening of the Morganza Spillway for the first time in 37 years to re-direct floodwaters away from Baton Rouge and New Orleans, LA.  Even with reduced flooding, a large sediment load was discharged into the Gulf of Mexico.      The 2011 flood provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the extent of flood deposition and associated geochemical and sedimentological characteristics.  The primary goal of the study was to determine the stratigraphic signature of this event on the Louisiana continental shelf.  Sediment cores collected in August 2011 at 68 sites along the Louisiana shelf and from areas surrounding the mouths of the Mississippi  and Atchafalaya subaqueous deltas were examined using x-radiography, radioisotopes (7Be, 234Th, 210Pb) using gamma spectroscopy, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and grain size distribution.       Physical oceanographic and fluvial conditions on the Louisiana shelf influence the mode of sediment deposition, introduce spatial variability in sediment deposition, and are important factors driving sediment reworking.  Radioisotope, grain size distribution, and x-radiograph data suggest deposition on the Louisiana shelf associated with the 2011 Mississippi River flood have similar characteristics and relatively calm atmospheric conditions as other large river systems (e.g., Po River shelf).  The grain size of post-flood deposition is characterized by mainly clay (&gt;50%), and little sand content (&lt;5%) with porosities greater than 75%. This is comparable to the physical sediment characteristics of other flood deposits previously studied on similar continental shelves, and contrasts coarser grain sizes depicted in hurricane deposits resulting from the resuspension of previously deposited sediment.  Greater organic carbon:nitrogen ratios in the surface of collected cores have an increased terrestrial influence, suggesting recent deposition relative to time of sampling, and likely affiliated with the 2011 Mississippi River flood. Flood deposition, based on sediment properties and radioisotopic tracers, was limited in extent and thickness. Offshore Be-7 penetration depths (&lt;3 cm) are small, likely reflecting deposition in shallower environments due to lack of ocean energy to aid in greater transport across the shelf. Enhanced flood sedimentation was located to the west of the Atchafalaya River mouth in nearshore, shallow waters.  However. the thickest deposits on the Louisiana shelf are likely present in water depths shallower than that sampled in this study and directly adjacent to river mouths.        This research has demonstrated that floods can transport and deposit amounts of sediment comparable to hurricane/large storm deposits, but are dominantly composed of fine-grained terrigenous sediment rather than re-suspended, coarser sediment compositions in storm deposits.
