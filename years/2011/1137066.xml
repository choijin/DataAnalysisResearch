<AbstractNarration>The Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics provides core support to the Board of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) to aid the science community and advise federal agencies on atmospheric sciences and climate research issues. The BASC is part of the National Academies, chartered by Congress in 1863 to provide independent science advice to government. The BASC uses volunteer experts to assist in the design of research studies and workshops and to review and assess findings and assess priorities. The BASC also facilitates US involvement in international research programs such as World Climate Research Program, Climate Variability and Predictability Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BASC broadly impacts policy by synthesizing scientific information so it is useful to federal, state, and local decision makers. Thus this activity has substantial broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

The PRB&rsquo;s mission is to advance understanding of the polar regions, including all areas of science, engineering, human dimensions, and policy; foster application of polar science to benefit the public and decision makers; advise U.S. research programs so they are responsive to the needs of the nation; encourage interdisciplinary and cross polar perspectives; and provide a forum for independent discussion of polar issues.
