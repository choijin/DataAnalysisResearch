<AbstractNarration>The Earth's radiation belts consist of a population of energetic electrons that is trapped by the Earth's nominally dipole magnetic field.  A major challenge in radiation belt physics is identifying and describing the various processes that contribute to the energization of the electrons, and their loss, particularly uner highly dynamic geomagnetic conditions.   The aim of this 3-year project is to quantitatively understand a newly discovered wave-scattering mechanism, termed transit-time diffusion, which has the potential to play an important role in radiation belt energization.  This involves scattering by fast magnetosonic waves, which is a class of waves that has not previously been considered important for this problem.  A combination of modeling and analytical approaches will be used to answer a number of fundamental questions about this new mechanism and its relative importance for radiation belt dynamics compared to other wave processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be led and carried out mainly by a team of three early-career scientist and a graduate student will also be trained as part of the project. Energetic electron fluxes in the radiation belts constitute an important space weather concern, as they are known to adversely affect space-based assets upon which modern society is increasingly dependent. Consequently, better understanding and prediction of radiation belt dynamics would be of benefit to society at large.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work performed under this grant dealt with the interaction between energetic electrons in the Earth's near-space environment (also known as the Van Allen Radiation Belts) and a certain type of naturally-occurring plasma waves known as a "magnetosonic" (MS) wave.  We showed that the classical theory used in the space physics community, known as quasilinear diffusion theory, could not accurately capture wave interaction between electrons and MS waves because of the particular way that MS waves are oriented and confined in space, i.e., very oblique and tightly bound to the geomagnetic equator, and thus violating the fundamental assumptions of quasilinear theory.  Instead, we used test-particles numerically traced through the wave fields to determine the scattering and developed a set of augmented wave-particle interaction equations that could analytically captured the additional effects involved in the wave-particle interaction.  We then surveyed several years of satellite data (both from the THEMIS probes, and Van Allen Probes) and developed extensive MS wave maps in the inner magnetospere, and applied our new equations to determine the wave particle scattering characteristics.   In the final phase of the project, we focused on explaining the formation of electron butterfly pitch-angle distributions observed at low L-shells.  Using coincident observtions of MS waves, butterfly distributions, and numerical modeling, we were able to show the MS waves are able to resonantly interact with energetic electrons in such a way as to create butterfly distributions in just the right energy and pitch angle range, solving a puzzle that could not be explained with any other mechanism we know.
