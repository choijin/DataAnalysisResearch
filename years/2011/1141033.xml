<AbstractNarration>The project goal is to develop a collection of modules to be used in various combinations, to introduce undergraduate students to the concepts and techniques of Machine Learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings the concepts and techniques of Machine Learning to undergraduates, and explores the feasibility of making modular presentations of this material in formats for use in various combinations to meet the needs in a variety of subject areas. The project motivates the study by working with real scenarios from the subject domains and by using real data sets provided by an advisory board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project increases the pool of graduates available for research and development in areas where large quantities of data must be analyzed. The PIs attract students from underrepresented groups, both as testers of the materials and as students in the initial course deployments. The resulting modules are freely available for adaptation and reuse.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Earlier and Broader Access to Machine Learning Project Outcomes Report Federal Award ID: 1141033   Thomas Way, Lillian Cassel, Paula Matuszek, Mary-Angela Papalaskari, Carol Weiss  Project Description  Machine Learning is a topic that is in the news a lot, lately, whether it has to do with Google?s self-driving cars, deep-learning algorithms that protect computer systems and generate fake Facebook news stories, or making your smart phone recognize your face, voice or thumbprint. At a pivotal time in human history, Machine Learning has come to center stage as the drama of ever-increasing reliance on technology plays out to an ever-widening audience.  Our project, which we have dubbed colloquially "Machine Learning for Everyone," has focused on making sure that college graduates will enter the workforce with a literate and meaningful understanding of the technology of Machine Learning plays a role in virtually every aspect of our modern lives. Far from a geeky, super-hacker topic, Machine Learning is important to people working in all areas of human endeavor. To that end, we have spent the past 6 years developing a sequence of learning modules suitable for instructors and students in virtually any college discipline.  Project Goals  Recognizing the importance of our topic, from the outset we pursued these three key goals.  1.   Devise a module structure for effectively packaging and presenting materials for teaching machine learning to undergraduates, particularly non-computing majors  2.   Produce stand-alone modules that can be adapted for relevant learning experiences for students in a variety of fields, and  3.   Disseminate the knowledge gained about module development and propagation to the wider computing education community.  The modules our project has produced have a definite Computer Science flavor to them, but are ready for use in any discipline that has an interest in how the sophisticated and widely-used techniques of Machine Learning come into play. Since Machine Learning has applications to so many disciplines, the modules we have created broadly impact society as they serve a valuable purpose in educating the next generation of technologically literate citizens in a critical area.  Machine Learning For Everyone Modules  Let?s take a look at the modules that our Machine Learning for Everyone project has developed. These learning modules are designed to provide access to the tools and techniques associated with machine learning to a broad category of undergraduate students. The changing nature of science and its reliance on massive amounts of data has led to the integral use of machine learning approaches in just about every discipline. Recognizing this shift, flexible teaching materials have been developed to provide educators and students in a wide variety of academic fields with relevant machine learning topics and discipline-ready activities.  Modules  Introduction and Background  Machine Learning Introduction Kinds of Machine Learning Choosing Inputs for Machine Learning Introduction to WEKA for Text Classification Introduction to Classification and Clustering Ethics and Machine Learning   Supervised Methods  Evaluating Classifiers Decision Trees Support Vector Machines (SVMs) Neural Networks Naive Bayes K Nearest Neighbor   Unsupervised Methods  Clustering Dimensionality Reduction   How well do the modules work?  The members of our research team all use Machine Learning in a variety of ways in our classes and evangelize the topic to our colleagues across the Arts and Sciences disciplines to disseminate the knowledge we have developed to as many outlets as possible. To make sure that the modules we have created benefit student learning, we have an ongoing process of evaluating student learning for each.  By way of example, here are the results of evaluating our "Introduction to Classification and Clustering" module. This module has been used a number of times in classroom settings as part of an introduction to machine learning concepts. In each offering, students were presented with the "Start Up Survey" first to get a baseline starting point against which to measure learning. Then, module material was presented to students. Finally, a "Test Your Knowledge" survey quiz was given, providing a measure to compare student understanding before and after module presentation.  In the following results comparison, the module was used in the following courses:  Spring 2015 - Machine Learning &amp; Evolution class, 18 non-computer science majors Spring 2016 - Machine Learning &amp; Evolution class, 23 non-computer science majors Fall 2016 - Machine Learning, 12 computer science majors, unfamiliar with ML concepts   Results  Start-up (pre) and Test Your Knowledge (post) surveys were given before and after presentation of the module material. Three nearly identical questions appear in both, and comparison measures significant learning. While it is expected that students knew little before presentation of the material, it is encouraging that when learning was measured at the start of the following class meeting students retained the understanding gained in the previous class meeting presentation, demonstrating a mastery of the concepts.
