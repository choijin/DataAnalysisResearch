<AbstractNarration>The objective of this application is to seek NSF support for the 2nd inaugural joint Biomedical&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Society (BMES) and the Society for Physical Regulation in Biology and Medicine&lt;br/&gt;(SPRBM) Conference on Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) (30th SPRBM Annual&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Conference) (short: 2nd BMES-SPRBM Conference on CMBE). The first joint conference&lt;br/&gt;(2011) on the specific theme of Molecular Imaging and Mechanotransduction was extremely&lt;br/&gt;successful. This joint CMBE conference (2012) will expand the scope and be focused the theme of&lt;br/&gt;Cell Motility, Matrix, Mechanobiology and Regeneration. As a rising science field the cellular and&lt;br/&gt;molecular bioengineering became possible to culture and engineer cells outside the body, and&lt;br/&gt;provide intrinsic insights for their role in regeneration. In the mean time, the elucidation of the&lt;br/&gt;cellular and molecular basis of life became one of the great achievements of the twentieth century,&lt;br/&gt;culminating in the complete sequencing of the human genome. Today we stand in the midst of an&lt;br/&gt;amazing convergence, which has created a nexus for bioengineers. Both the BMES and the&lt;br/&gt;SPRBM realized that research at this remarkable nexus, Now, the inaugural joint BMES-SPRBM&lt;br/&gt;Conference on CBME is the beginning of a new focus of the promising subfield in biomedical&lt;br/&gt;engineering and much needed forum for this exciting field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The explosions of cellular motility, cellular/molecular functional matrix and the&lt;br/&gt;role of mechanobiology and regeneration such as extracellular matrix and the manipulations in vitro&lt;br/&gt;and in vivo enables new fundamental regeneration at the cellular and molecular level, as well as&lt;br/&gt;providing new monitoring modalities in vivo. Therefore, these lead to the exciting theme of the&lt;br/&gt;inaugural BMES-SPRBM joint Conference on CMBE. This application will be first is to provide&lt;br/&gt;support to young and junior researchers, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students whose&lt;br/&gt;submitted papers have been selected for podium presentation on the basis of scientific merits, and&lt;br/&gt;promote minority and women scientists in the field; and second to foster the emergence and growth&lt;br/&gt;of the exciting sub-filed of CMBE. The abstracts will be published in a Conference Proceeding, and&lt;br/&gt;selected full length papers will be published in a special issue of Cellular and Molecular&lt;br/&gt;Bioengineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of this meeting are: (1) delineate the current status of cellular and molecular&lt;br/&gt;motility, matrix, mechanobiology and regeneration, in which leaders from the CMBE fields will give&lt;br/&gt;an overview of cellular molecular motility, functional matrix concepts and review the current state of&lt;br/&gt;mechanobiology and adaptation, as well as their research in molecular/cellular/tissue/ functions and&lt;br/&gt;tissue/organ regeneration; (2) brainstorm the emerging field of CMBE with a focus on the role of&lt;br/&gt;cellular/molecular mechanics, motility, functional matrix and mechanotransduction with regeneration&lt;br/&gt;potentials, which the outcome will be published in a special issue of CMBE; (3) provide training&lt;br/&gt;workshop for junior faculty, investigators, and students on grant writing and opportunities; and (4)&lt;br/&gt;environment setting. The conference program will include Podium Sessions with invited Keynote&lt;br/&gt;speakers and other invited speakers. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior&lt;br/&gt;investigators will also be encouraged to submit abstracts. These abstracts will be organized into a&lt;br/&gt;poster session with cheese/wine receptions. Nine graduate students/postdoctoral fellows will be&lt;br/&gt;selected by the organizing committee to present short talks and six-eight junior investigators will be&lt;br/&gt;selected for a Young and Rising Star session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impacts: The rise of engineering in the twentieth century led to profound change for&lt;br/&gt;humankind. The advances in biology are equally amazing. It became possible to culture and&lt;br/&gt;engineer cells outside the body, and provide intrinsic insights for their role in regeneration. The role&lt;br/&gt;of mechanical modulation of cell functions has been an intensive focus in modern biology and&lt;br/&gt;bioengineering. The explosions of cellular motility, cellular/molecular functional matrix and the role&lt;br/&gt;of mechanobiology and regeneration enables new fundamental regeneration at the cellular and&lt;br/&gt;molecular level, as well as providing new monitoring modalities in vivo and in patients.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
