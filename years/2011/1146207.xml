<AbstractNarration>The manner in which climate change, human land-use and natural disturbances interact to disrupt natural systems remains a critical concern for science and society. With increasing rates of climate and land-use change the rate and magnitude of ecosystem changes will likely increase with major effects on critical services to humankind including the availability of natural resources and the ability of nature to buffer climate impacts. This research project will advance the understanding of how climate change interacts with human and natural disturbances to generate abrupt ecological changes by developing and analyzing a rich array of paleoecological, paleoclimatic, and archaeological data over the past 13,000 years.  The study will focus on periods characterized by sharp declines in oak and hemlock due to rapid climate change, major droughts, insect outbreaks, changing human-population and land-use regimes (e.g., deforestation, fire) at ca. 6000, 5500, and 4000 yr BP and the time of European settlement.  New methodologies will be applied to analyze ecosystem change and to explore the consequences for the earth's future. The research will concentrate on southern New England and three important, contrasting landscapes: the coast (Cape Cod and islands), near-coastal wetland area (Taunton River), and the inland-riverine area of the Connecticut and Deerfield Rivers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborators will apply their strengths in ecological, biophysical and social science to advance: (i) interdisciplinary training at undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral and mid-career levels; (ii) communication and engagement with broad audiences of scientists, decision makers, and policy makers; and (iii) environmental and conservation policy.  These efforts will capitalize on existing institutional strengths: Harvard Forest Programs in Science and Policy Integration, Program on Conservation Innovation, Summer Research in Ecology (NSF REU), Bullard Fellowship Program, Archaeology/ Paleoecology Field School and LTER program; the new LTER Network collaboration with the MBL Logan Journalist Program; the Emerson College undergraduate program in Science Communication and graduate programs in Geology and Geophysics at the University of Wyoming and Anthropology and Archaeology at the University of Massachusetts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project advanced ecological theory and conservation practice via the investigation of regional-scale dynamics related to: (i) climate change, including variations in temperature and precipitation; (ii) major cultural changes including shifts in population size, less well understood changes in hunting-gathering-collecting or horticultural practices and the abrupt shift from native to European culture; (iii) changes in fire regimes; and (iv) purported outbreaks of insects.  The project also resulted in valuable research experiences for graduate students (at U of Wyoming and U of Massachusetts-Amherst) and undergraduate students (through the Harvard Forest Research Experiences for Undergraduates program).  Two project findings are of particular significance.  First, we have demonstrated that the middle-Holocene decline of eastern hemlock is not attributable to a range-wide insect outbreak.  Instead, comparison of pollen records with multivariate paleoclimate data shows that abrupt cooling was responsible for a time-transgressive decline of hemlock populations across the region.  Second, our analysis of charcoal records from southern New England allowed us to evaluate the relative importance of climate and humans in controlling patterns of fire.  Elevated charcoal values during the early Holocene indicate high fire activity during the driest period of the post-glacial interval.  Charcoal peaks again at some sites during the middle Holocene, an interval characterized by multiple droughts and relatively high human population, and most charcoal records feature high values after European settlement.  The Late Woodland period, however, when indigenous populations were at their largest, was not a time of widespread burning.  Taken together, the charcoal, pollen, and archaeological data suggest that climate, and not humans, was the primary driver of regional-scale ecosystem changes.  These dynamics provide highly relevant analogs to many processes confronting ecosystems and society today.       Last Modified: 09/27/2016       Submitted by: David R Foster]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
