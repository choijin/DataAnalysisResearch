<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;1143988: Barba, Lorena A.; Trustees of Boston University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support two senior researchers and fifteen junior scientists from the United States, under the direction of Dr. Lorena A. Barba, to attend and conduct a workshop in Seattle, Washington, as a side meeting to the Supercomputing-11 Conference held concurrently during November 12-18, 2011.  The workshop is a follow up to a Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) held in Valparaiso, Chile in January 2011, titled "Scientific Computing in the Americas: the challenge of massive parallelism."  The primary goal of this workshop is to reinforce the network created during the PASI, reconnecting young scientists with senior researchers (PASI lecturers) and their peers, and, ultimately, to stimulate new collaborations.  The venue chosen will enable close interactions with one of the top events in the field of high performance computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original PASI brought together many high-level researchers in computational science and students at various levels to focus on the impact of general-purpose computation on Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) accelerators on scientific productivity.  GPU clusters are becoming a leading player in the high-performance computing arena, with 3 of the top 5 supercomputers in the world now based on this hardware.  There are important lessons to be learned in programming these accelerators as well as the more general issues associated with understanding the algorithms and programming models to achieve desired results.  The proposed workshop will be invaluable in providing the networking needed for these participants to continue with the work they started at the PASI and enable new collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
