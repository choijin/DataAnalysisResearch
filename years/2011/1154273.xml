<AbstractNarration>The Scholars-on-Track program at the College of Mount Saint Vincent (CMSV) is providing financial, social and academic support to promote achievement of students in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry. The program's primary goals include an improvement of academic performance, retention, degree completion and post-baccalaureate opportunities in these areas. To help realize these goals, the program builds on a "Freshman Seminar in Science" during the first semester of study that challenges these scholars to develop the knowledge base, discipline, and critical thinking skills essential to success in the sciences. The program also provides peer mentorship and tutoring throughout the first two years of baccalaureate study and encourages student participation in enrichment activities such as scientific conferences, career panels, field excursions to museums and academic centers. During the final two years of baccalaureate study, participating students complete an original research project and are encouraged to consider the option of an internship in one of the areas of focus. The activities offered through the Scholars-on-Track program have been shaped by scholarship and student support models that have proven to be particularly effective for students hailing from minority and underserved populations, both of whom comprise a significant portion of the CMSV student population.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The College of Mount Saint Vincent is an ethnically-diverse private college that serves traditionally under-represented students in the New York City area. The Scholars on Track: Improving Retention of Science Majors award allowed us to:  increase the success rate of students in their first-year science courses; increase the numbers of students who successfully complete the first two years of a baccalaureate program in biology, chemistry, or biochemistry; increase the retention of students to degree achievement in biology, chemistry, or biochemistry; increase the success rate in gaining admission to professional schools after graduation.   Twenty-six students were selected as "Scholars." These students received financial assistance and were required to meet specific academic and social requirements. These Scholars were the focus of the program that allowed the College to incorporate activities and strategies to meet the objectives listed above.  Through the Scholars program, the College has:      developed Freshmen Seminar courses to develop the skills that students will need to thrive as science majors; developed a peer-leader program in which students assist students in formal and informal mentoring programs; encouraged more students to serve as Teaching Assistants in introductory courses; established a dedicated space in Science Hall (the "Scholars Office") that students can use for quiet study or study groups; encouraged students to explore internship opportunities in science fields;  incorporated recitation periods in all introductory science courses for majors;  enhanced opportunities for informal student-faculty social interactions both on campus and through field trips and other science-related activities; brought speakers to campus and provided opportunities for science majors to the Scholars Program interact with the speakers informally before and after the presentation; added a career development component to presentations by outside speakers in which speakers discussed their career paths and how they addressed the challenges they faced; encouraged students to assume leadership positions in science-related campus activities; encouraged students to participate in research programs and funded students to attend conferences to present the results of their work; paired students with formal mentors who are distinguished alums of the college.   These activities and strategies have improved the learning experience for majors in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry at the College of Mount Saint Vincent.
