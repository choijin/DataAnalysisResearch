<AbstractNarration>Tougaloo College, a minority-serving institution, is awarding two-year scholarships to 18 talented, upper-level students with a major in biology, chemistry, mathematics or physics  who desire certification in secondary education and are committed to completing four years of teaching in grades 7-12 in high-need school districts in Mississippi. The substantial curriculum is being driven by clinical field-based experiences in formal and informal settings, seminars, and workshops in collaboration with established local school districts and community partners. The Noyce Program is being structured around undergraduate and post-graduate mentoring by STEM and Education Division faculty and master 7-12 teachers, professional development activities and networking. Scholars are being prepared to enter the 7-12 STEM classroom as highly qualified, highly effective teachers and are provided resources and support to ensure teacher retention.  Pre-Noyce activities such as teaching in the college's Summer Science Program are being made available to freshmen and sophomores who wish to ultimately apply for Noyce scholarships. By establishing a strong STEM Teacher Education Program that will impact Mississippi students for years to come, the Program is increasing the number of qualified beginning STEM teachers in Mississippi and increasing the number of effective beginning teachers in schools serving economic and socially disadvantaged students. The project is establishing a mechanism for ongoing participation between Tougaloo STEM and Education faculty, increasing the number and expertise of STEM beginning teachers, and subsequently improving the aspirations and competence of Mississippi students. By building partnerships with community schools, the Program is creating a pipeline for future qualified STEM teachers to serve in area high-need schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Tougaloo College Robert NOYCE Outcomes Report, 2017-2018   The major goal proposed for the NOYCE Scholarship Program was to recruit, retain and encourage natural sciences majors who are talented STEM students who have demonstrated an aptitude in STEM disciplines; a desire to teach; and, a willingness to explore opportunities for teaching in public school critical-needs districts  This goal embodied three following objectives formulated to assess the extent to which activities implemented in NOYCE  were  achieved; and, to  assure the program operated as intended. (1) Provide scholarships for junior and senior majors from biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics who have demonstrated an interest in obtaining teacher certification.   (2) Provide substantial curriculum that includes extensive clinical experience in the classroom and professional development for preparation to enter the 7-12 science and mathematics classroom as a highly qualified and highly effective teacher. (3) Provide resources and support to ensure teacher retention.   NOYCE Program objectives were implemented on a "no cost extension" bases for the 2017-2018 funded period.  Despite the lack of funding, concerted efforts were continued to encourage natural science majors with academic skills and preparation needed to teach in public schools critical-needs districts.  NOYCE activities implemented focused on the Scholars completing field experiences, making STEM presentations, participating in summer internships, joining professional organizations, and working with faculty advisors on the completion of senior theses.   Four (4) NOYCE Scholars remained in the 2017-2018 Cohort Group to complete some requirements despite the lack of receiving stipends to complete the program objectives.  One Scholar completed the Senior Thesis in May 2017, one will complete the thesis in May 2018 and the remaining Scholar by May 2019. Two Scholars had a major advisor in the Natural Science Division, the other Scholar?s advisor was in the Division of Education, Supervision and Instruction.   One Scholar participated in some activities and graduated plans to transfer to another college and pursue a degree in mathematics.  The 3 students who are currently in the NOYCE Program are enrolled in classes with field experience as a requirement. Each completed an internship to include serving as a mentor in a middle school; a teacher assistant in biology classes; and, a chemist teaching assistant.     The Scholars renewed membership in NEA, AAVW, NAACP and ACS and showed growth in making required oral presentations which was greatly influenced by the Scholars attending the STEM/STEAM Conference in Honolulu, Hawaii in the Summer of 2017. The Scholars also made presentations in collaboration with the Past Dean of the Division of Supervision and Instruction.  The presentation focused on teaching/learning titled "Differential Learning in Science Classrooms" and "Effects of Studying Natural Sciences for African Americans."    Accomplishing any goal for the NOYCE Program in 2017-2018 met with many challenges as there were no funds to fulfill the obligation for maximizing the success of the NOYCE Program.  However, the Scholars recognized the limitations and were willing to provide as much information as possible to include in this progress report.  The success of the program from an evaluative perspective, should be given consideration for future funding as some activities that are essential to enabling the Scholars to become certified teachers in critical needs districts remains to be fully accomplished.
