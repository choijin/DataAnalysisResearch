<AbstractNarration>Computational thinking (CT) is an emerging component of computer science education.  A common characteristic of successful efforts to introduce CT is the presence of a context to which students can relate.  This project builds upon previous efforts that have shown music to be a context that engages students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sample of student activities include writing computer programs to play music, developing web pages that incorporate music, and developing data structures and databases to catalog sounds.  Upper level courses in computing and music are synchronized by students working on collaborative projects across the disciplines.  An alternative format is to offer a hybrid course co-taught by faculty from both disciplines.  Expected outcomes include course materials and approaches for measuring CT gains.  Course materials include lecture notes, class activities, code examples and homework assignments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional development workshops provide expertise for faculty to adopt new education approaches and to participate in a community of like-minded educators.  Attendees are interdisciplinary two-person teams with expertise in computing as well as music.  Three summer workshops are expected to attract one hundred faculty from fifty institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort leverages a natural relationship between music and computing to teach CT concepts to undergraduates in all disciplines.  Materials are being developed for interdisciplinary general education courses and discipline-specific music and computing courses at more advanced levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The first goal of our project was to "develop new learning activities that integrate computing and music."  We accomplished this subgoal by expanding the scope of activities that we have students do in our original, interdisciplinary course, "Sound Thinking." This is a General Education course that is co-listed in the departments of music and computer science, co-taught by a professor from each of these departments, and open to all majors in the University.  In the most recent semester we the limit of 38 students enrolled, representing 15 majors.  Students may elect to receive either Technology or Arts and Humanities GenEd credit for the course, depending upon their majors.  The course website, which contains all teaching materials and assignments, is publicly available at http://soundthinking.uml.edu.  The second goal that we proposed was to "devise, test, and evaluate new techniques for assessing students' CT knowledge."  We were not able to pursue this goal deeply because we were awarded only 75% of the funding we requested and were instructed to concentrate on the third subgoal.  That third goal was to "disseminate modules and rubrics via workshops for 4- and 2-year college faculty to build expertise and foster interdisciplinary collaboration between computing and music."  This we accomplished through a series of workshops offered in Massachusetts and New York and in conjunction with two professional conferences.  We offered a total of eight workshops that were attended by 123 educators employed in higher ed and 55 employed in K-12.  Our original proposal was to provide workshops to 100 higher ed educators who would attend as 50 interdisciplinary pairs.  Of the 123 higher ed educators who attended, 102 of those came in pairs, while 21 came as individuals and were paired up with others from opposite disciplines at the workshop.  The 55 K-12 educators attended with permission from the NSF for us to allow non-higher ed people to attend as long as we focused on our primary target audience.  Thus, since we fully achieved our original goal for 50 higher ed interdisciplinary pairs, the additional attendees gave us even broader impact than originally anticipated.  Additional impact was achieved through publications.  The most significant of these was the book Computational Thinking In Sound by co-PI Gena Greher and PI Jesse Heines, published by Oxford University Press in April 2014.  Please see www.compthinkinsound.org for additional information on this book.

Perhaps most importantly, however, is that fact that a number of our workshop attendees have already begun implementing interdisciplinary programs in their home institutions and sharing what they learned with others.
