<AbstractNarration>This research project aims to understand the role of structural plasticity in mediating binding specificity and affinity between protein domains and flexible ligands.  The specific recognition of a ligand is the key function of many proteins, and forms the basis of the extensive networks that coordinate the activities of central biological processes.  In many biological contexts, a protein domain functionally recognizes a family of related ligands while discriminating against structurally similar ligands.  The hypothesis to be tested is that the recognition of related ligands is more structurally diverse than can be inferred from a single structure of a protein-ligand complex.  The rigorous biochemical and structural analysis of the ensemble of conformations adopted at biomolecular interfaces that is part of this research program will contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ligand-binding specificity.  Furthermore, this knowledge will provide insights for computational efforts aimed at understanding and predicting ligand-binding specificity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms that confer specificity in protein-ligand interactions, which are essential to a wide variety of biological functions.  In addition, the structural and biochemical data will complement ongoing computational studies by others that seek to model protein-ligand interactions.  Furthermore, the program outlined here promotes teaching, training and learning while advancing scientific discovery.  These activities occur through a well-designed and thoughtful postdoctoral fellow and graduate student mentoring program, as well as through teaching innovations in the undergraduate classroom.  The PI also participates in several programs to increase the participation of under-represented groups, including women and minorities in science, ranging from faculty, postdoctoral fellow and graduate student career mentoring to tailoring the graduate curriculum to facilitate recruitment and retention of under-represented minorities.  This program supports the use of our regional high field NMR facilities, including 800 and 900 MHz instruments equipped with cryogenic probes.  In addition to the normal avenues of dissemination of research findings, including peer-reviewed publication and presentations at scientific meetings, the PI participates in community outreach through science activities at local schools and as a CU Wizard, orchestrating a community science show.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this research program were to understand role of structural plasticity in mediating binding specificity and affinity between protein domains and flexible ligands.  In many biological contexts, a protein domain functionally recognizes a family of related ligands while discriminating against structurally similar ligands.  The hypothesis tested was that the recognition of related ligands is more structurally diverse than can be inferred from a single structure of a protein-ligand complex.  A rigorous biochemical and structural characterization of the ensemble of conformations adopted at biomolecular interfaces was performed to understand the mechanisms of specificity.   Two types of recognition systems were targeted in this study.  The first was a set of telomere-end binding proteins.  These proteins bind the single-stranded DNA that is universally present at chromosome ends with very tight affinities.  The important feature of these proteins is their ability to bind the inherently heterogeneous sequences present at telomeres while discriminating against non-telomeric sequences elsewhere in the genome.   We solved the crystal structure of one of the two OB-folds (Pot1pC) that make up the ssDNA-binding domain in S. pombe Pot1.  Comparison with the homologous human domain revealed unexpected structural divergence in the mode of ligand binding that explains the differing ligand requirements between species.  Despite the presence of apparently base-specific hydrogen bonds, Pot1pC is able to bind a wide range of ssDNA sequences with thermodynamic equivalence.  To address how Pot1pC binds ssDNA with little to no specificity, multiple structures of Pot1pC bound to non-cognate ssDNA ligands were solved.  These structures reveal that this promiscuity is implemented through new binding modes that thermodynamically compensate for base-substitutions through alternate stacking interactions and new H-bonding networks.  In the absence of discrimination against RNA by Pot1, the single-stranded DNA substrate would be overwhelmed by the pool of RNA containing the same sequence by mere chance. As Pot1pC exhibits plastic accommodation of degenerate ssDNA telomere sequences through alternative binding modes,  it is unclear how RNA would be discriminated against. Examination of ribose-position specificity of Pot1pC revealsed that RNA discrimination is additive, but not uniformly distributed across the nucleic-acid ligand. High resolution structures of several RNA-DNA chimeric ligands bound to Pot1pC reveal a widely utilized alternative binding mode that features significant rearrangement of the binding interface that thermodynamically accommodates RNA nucleotide substitutions at some nucleotides but not others.
