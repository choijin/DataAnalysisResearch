<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to students and other young researchers for travel and accommodation to the Machine Learning Summer School 2011 to be held in Purdue University, June 13-24, 2011.  World class speakers from academia and industry are delivering tutorial style lectures over a two week period, and these presentations are being recorded and made available over the Internet. The Summer School is suitable for participants with different backgrounds. Individuals without previous knowledge are able to learn more about the theory and practice of Machine Learning, while those wishing to broaden their expertise in this area find the advanced courses particularly useful. The participating students are able to network with international experts.</AbstractNarration>
