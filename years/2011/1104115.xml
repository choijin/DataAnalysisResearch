<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator proposes to use techniques from analysis, in particular from the study of heat and wave kernels and distribution theory, to study zeta functions of number theory.  In the field of regular graphs, both finite and infinite, the project will systematically develop a heat kernel approach to number theory on graphs, including the Ihara zeta function.  In previous work, the PI has developed a succinct relation between Fourier coefficients of weight zero Maass forms and weight two holomorphic forms, both associated to any finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surface.  The proposal involves a continuation of this work, striving toward bounds of the Fourier coefficients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the heat kernel and the wave kernel are mathematical objects which admit interpretations from many mathematical fields.  The heat kernel, in particular, can be viewed as a solution of a partial differential equation, as a one-parameter family of positive integrable functions, and as a function associated to probability theory and random walks.  As a result, the heat kernel provides a means by which one can employ ideas and results from one mathematical discipline in order to approach problems in another field.  The PI plans to continue this approach to study problems in number theory, analysis, and graph theory.    In addition to research interests, the PI has undertaken a number of educational endeavors striving to enhance opportunities for students.  As a faculty member at The City College of New York, the PI has developed courses in statistics and in financial mathematics for the Mathematics Department, and he works closely with the School of Education in their course offerings in teacher training programs.  In October 2010, the PI, together with J. Kramer, taught a graduate level course at the University of Sarajevo.  The proposed research includes a component of effort by the PI to enhance and further develop these teaching aspects of his mathematical interests.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In a 2000 paper by Serge Lang and the Principal Investigator, the authors described the heat kernel as a mathematical object which has many guises and manifestations throughout mathematics and physics.  Heuristically, the heat kernel K(t,x,y) of a domain measures the amount of heat at a point x and time t when at time zero a momentary burst of heat is introduced at point y.  If the domain is the infinitely long wire uniform thickness, then the heat kernel can be recast in terms of the normal probability density function.  Using elementary considerations from one variable calculus, the heat kernel for the real line can be shown to be the key mathematical object behind one construction of the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula.  Going beyond these considerations, the Jorgenson and Lang article described many occurrences of the heat kernel in various sub-disciplines of mathematics.  The research undertaken by the PI in this NSF award focuses the relation between heat kernels and zeta functions of graphs and geometry.  In general terms, a zeta function provides a means by which one counts certain fundamental constituents of the general object of study, such as prime numbers in the set of integers or prime geodesic paths on a surface.  Mathematicians have discovered from many different studies that zeta functions, both in their entirty and special values, address many key questions of interest.  During the time of the award, the PI undertook collaborations with various mathematicians and further previous investigations of heat kernel techniques and analysis and subsequent applications of questions of geometry and number theory.   In one article, the PI and his co-authors showed how the heat kernel can be used to provide a unified approach to different types of Eisenstein series, a form of zeta functions, on certain two dimensional surfaces.  The point of view in this paper has the prospect of extending to other settings.  In other work, the PI and his collaborators were able to provide the existence of functions which can be expressed as a q-expansion, or a type of infinite degree polynomial, whose coefficients are integers.  Historically, the coefficients of such q-expansions are often found to count objects in some mathematical sense, such as discovered in the celebrated "monstrous moonshine" conjectures.  The PI and his collaborators plan to continue their work supported by this NSF award to determine what, if any, mathematical objects are being counted by the series they discovered.
