<AbstractNarration>This proposed research will catalyze a long-term collaboration between U.S. and South Korean earth system scientists. It builds upon utilizing the Korean Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) newly launched icebreaker R/V Araon. KOPRI has outfitted the R/V Araon with selected research grade instruments to study atmospheric CO, NO/NO2, O3, CO2, Hg (g), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) along with chemical, physical and biological oceanographic parameters. The objectives include to&lt;br/&gt;1. Visit and examine the R/V Araon for its suitability for ocean-atmosphere research applications.&lt;br/&gt;2. Install and operate a ship-borne turbulence and motion correction flux system and chemical analyzers on the R/V Araon jackstaff tower and deck railing to survey and evaluate the suitability of the vessel for ship-borne research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project will develop a long-term collaboration between Korean and US scientists in utilizing one of the world's technologically most advanced ice breakers and research vessels, the R/V Araon. This effort is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together scientists with expertise in micrometeorology, biogeochemistry, atmospheric chemistry, oceanography, and Polar Regions. U.S. scientists will gain access to a unique observational research platform that will conduct yearly pole-to-pole cruises in the foreseeable future. Consequently, besides providing unique opportunities for oceanic and atmospheric research, this program will be a rare opportunity to observe changes in global chemical climate over the remote ocean and to quantify the processes controlling these changes. These activities are also expected to catalyze collaboration in other disciplines such as biology, marine geology and geophysics, cartography, and physical and chemical oceanography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to develop a multi-year collaborative research program bringing together scientists from multiple US institutions and the Korean Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) utilizing the new Araon polar ice breaker.  This objective follows an invitation by Korean researchers to join them and provide training for ocean-atmosphere polar research on the Araon.  The scientific questions to be studied encompass ocean-atmosphere interactions, in particular gas exchanges over the polar ocean and sea ice, and their sensitivity to climate change impacts.  A visit at KOPRI in Incheon, near Seoul, Korea, was organized.  The purpose of the visit was a workshop to bring together US and Korean researchers for developing the Korea-US research program.  Six US scientists travelled to Korea from Oct. 7 - 12, 2012, for a 3-day workshop, where all US and Korean participants presented  ~30 min seminars on thier research interests.  Half a day was spent on discussion of strategies for developing a research proposal, which funding agencies to approach, and itnerests and responsibilities of participating researchers.  On the third day of the meeting scientists traveled to Yeosu in the southern part of Korea, for a tour of the Araon in port.  Tae-Siek Rhee visited Boulder on Jan. 10-11, 2013, for follow-up discussions.   A letter of intent, titled "Pole-to-Pole Icebreaker Campaigns for Atmosphere and Sea Surface Obervations (PICASSO)" was prepared and submitted to the NSF INSPIRE call for pre-proposals in Feb. 2013 with the intention to later propose a full multi-year, multi-investigator, and multi-agency reserach proposal to this call.  Unfortunately, the pre-proposal was not selected for full proposal invitation.  Subsequently, a research proposal titled "Collaborative Research: Ocean Biogeochemical Controls on Atmosphere-Ocean Exchange of Ozone and CO2 Along a Pole-to-Pole Transect" was prepared and submitted on Aug. 15, 2013 to the NSF Chemical Oceanography program.  Unfortunately, this proposal was declined.  We are considering revising our proposal and resubmision to another program/agency in the near future.
