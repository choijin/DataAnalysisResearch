<AbstractNarration>The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) installed a cabled test bed and has been operating the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) since MARS became operational November 10, 2008. The purpose of this proposal is to provide continued funding for operations and maintenance costs of MARS. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MARS cabled test bed observatory provides a deep-water facility for testing and development and is a compelling solution for many ocean science experiments. MBARI has integrated the MARS Observatory into the Monterey Bay Aquarium 'Discovering Monterey Canyon' auditorium program as well as in the new MBARI exhibit. The Monterey Bay Aquarium has over one million visitors a year, thereby providing wide exposure for MARS and OOI to the public. The EARTH Project, a science teacher outreach effort, has used MARS as a tool at over 20 presentations to high school educators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most oceanographic instruments on the seafloor have no connections  with the surface, so they have to run on batteries and store their own  data. A cabled observatory like MARS removes those restrictions, allowing scientists to design new  types of oceanographic equipment and study the ocean in new ways. Providing electrical power and data connections for new research instruments in the deep-sea. That's the vision behind the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS).  The system consists of a 52-km (32-mile) undersea cable that carries data and  power to a "science node" 891 meters (2,923 feet) below the surface of  Monterey Bay. More than eight different science experiments can be attached to this main hub with eight nodes. Additional  experiments can be daisy-chained to each node. MARS is located at  latitude North 36 degrees 42.7481 minutes and longitude West 122 degrees  11.2139 minutes.      We invite ocean scientists to consider deploying instruments on the MARS ocean observatory testbed.  Over the last three years MARS has hosted the following projects:  The University of Tongji's, Seafloor Obseravtory which was connected directly to Tongji University in Shaghai, China.  The Monterey Ocean Bottom Broadband Seismometer, which is connected to the Northern California Seismic Network based at University of California, Berkeley.  The Benthic Microbial Fuel Cell Project, which produces electric power from microbes in the mud around the MARS site.  A new instrument that measures seawater acidity, and oxygen reduction.  A subsea camera that was connected to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  The Deep Environmental Sample Processor that identifies microbes by their RNA signature.  A test of a new Sediment Events Sensor  MARS O&amp;M is available to researchers world-wide to provide a deep sea test bed for ocean science applications.
