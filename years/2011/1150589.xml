<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-II project develops advanced&lt;br/&gt;technology capabilities for constructing and deploying client-adapted&lt;br/&gt;automated language translation systems within commercial settings that are&lt;br/&gt;used by globalizing enterprises and the language service provider companies&lt;br/&gt;(LSPs) that provide translation services to such enterprise clients.  The&lt;br/&gt;developed technology leverages databases of previously-translated material in&lt;br/&gt;order to produce client-adapted high-quality fully-automatic translations for&lt;br/&gt;commercial language service providers (LSPs) and their enterprise clients.&lt;br/&gt;This approach provides a scalable and less-costly solution for&lt;br/&gt;creating and deploying client-specific customized Machine Translation (MT)&lt;br/&gt;engines.  Once deployed, these customized MT systems expand the capabilities&lt;br/&gt;of clients to translate volumes of content that are not feasible to translate&lt;br/&gt;using current methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the impact&lt;br/&gt;that it will have on the broad commercial translation industry.  The&lt;br/&gt;technology developed in the project is likely to significantly reduce barriers&lt;br/&gt;to wide-spread adoption of MT technology by the broad LSP industry and their&lt;br/&gt;enterprise client-base. The 2010 commercial translation market is a $26&lt;br/&gt;billion industry, growing at a healthy pace. Current commercial MT offerings&lt;br/&gt;are expensive and too difficult to deploy for most enterprises and service&lt;br/&gt;providers.  Free web-based translation services serve casual users, but do not&lt;br/&gt;meet the quality and security needs of enterprises. The technology developed&lt;br/&gt;in this project and the cloud-based delivery model support scalable,&lt;br/&gt;easy-to-integrate MT services, which are highly attractive to a broad range of&lt;br/&gt;potential clients.  This approach will support cost-effective content generation into&lt;br/&gt;multiple target languages at a massive scale, a capability that is essential&lt;br/&gt;for globalizing US enterprises in order to compete in the information-rich&lt;br/&gt;market place of the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>

The Phase-II grant partly supported the significant challenge of streamlining this process and scaling the hosting software infrastructure and delivery capabilities.  Two supplements to the Phase-II grant accelerated the commercial adoption of Safaba's core technology.  A TECP supplement award provided supplemental funding for developing enhanced capabilities that allow select clients to remotely control the process of developing optimized MT engines using SafabaÆs software platform and to deploy these MT engines into production.  An AMJAIC supplemental project supported piloting SafabaÆs SBIR-funded technology solutions with a globalizing advanced manufacturing enterprise in order to develop automated translation solutions that directly support the ability of advanced manufacturing enterprises to expand their sales and marketing capabilities in foreign markets.  SafabaÆs MT technology was validated as superior in translation accuracy and performance to the technology of its main commercial competitors in various contrastive and competitive pilot projects with potential commercial clients. Revenue-generating deployments for several Fortune-500 enterprise clients were completed over the course of the Phase-II award.
