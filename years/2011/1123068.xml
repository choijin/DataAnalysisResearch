<AbstractNarration>The Boyer Report (Boyer Commission on Educating Undergraduates in Research Universities, "Reinventing Undergraduate Education; A Blueprint for America's Research Universities," 1998) identified three challenges that still permeate many public research universities: the need to start students in research activities earlier, providing quality research experiences for more students, and creating experiences that can be delivered to increasing numbers of transfer students. The second America COMPETES Act (January 2011) urged that undergraduates be included in standard NSF grants.  However, increasing participation in early undergraduate research continues to be a challenge at many institutions of higher education. This project is developing a collaborative approach to increasing early undergraduate participation in significant research activities.  This is being accomplished through courses and programs designed to teach general research skills, rather than only engaging students in specific disciplinary research activities.  By focusing on "research oriented" or "research skills" experiences, more students can be economically included early in their undergraduate studies.  The project is a partnership comprised of Washington State University, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Alabama, with faculty members from the University of Wisconsin-Madison participating in an advisory role.  The partners are adapting each others' existing research skills courses (one per institution, three in total).  All three courses are being made available to students at each partner institution. The three models are: &lt;br/&gt;- A faculty led boot camp short course, running one week in the summer as an intensive program (developed originally at WSU) &lt;br/&gt;- A peer mentored short course for transfer students just prior to the beginning of the academic year (developed originally at UCF) &lt;br/&gt;- A semester long seminar course that meets during the academic year using asynchronous delivery of lecture material (developed originally at Wisconsin). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is increased by an ongoing, comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness and cost of these programs at three universities, as undertaken by a centralized evaluation team. The assessment is addressing the following questions: &lt;br/&gt;- Do these three skills programs increase the number of students participating in undergraduate research while maintaining the quality of existing experiences? &lt;br/&gt;- Do skills programs decrease the "incubation period" of new undergraduate researchers in the laboratory and increase faculty participation campus-wide? &lt;br/&gt;- What are the costs and benefits of implementing sustainable research-oriented teaching and training modules at three public research universities?  &lt;br/&gt;This information is of potential value for institutions considering efforts to institutionalize or grow their undergraduate research programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our overarching goal is to adapt and adopt three existing "research oriented" programs to each institution; effectively Implementing Educational Innovations and Developing Faculty Expertise, in methods of increasing the number of undergraduates through increased retention in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) fields at each school by running student centered training programs. Through this grant, three institutions: University of Central Florida (UCF), University of Alabama (UA) and Washington State University (WSU) were involved.  The key outcomes of this work are as follows:  Intellectual Merit:  We have developed the educational materials for the three courses and disseminated the materials at each institution. Sample schedules, syllabi and materials such as sample lectures, assignments and a multiple-choice concept inventory are also available on our website (http://euro.eng.ua.edu).\ In terms of recruiting, one observation is that the approach to recruiting students into the courses depends on the presence of a centralized office for undergraduate research. UCF, with a full-time Director, Coordinator, and Administrative Assistant, are oversubscribed in their course offerings and have developed an application process for students. WSU, with a half-time Director and half-time assistant, sees increased interest in the programs and recently developed a similar semester long seminar to attract high-achieving freshman scholars focused on pursuing research. UA recently created a Director of Undergraduate Research position for their Emerging Scholars program. This program targets freshmen in a two-semester course offering (research preparation and research experience) and is considering initiating an office at the College of Engineering level. The courses developed in this grant were taught by the PI and Co-PI and advertised through student organizations and other offices across campus. UA modified the semester long seminar to a mini-mester format that meets three times per week and spans a five-week period. WSU modified the peer mentor short course to fit into a weekend prior to classes starting to attract a higher percentage of transfer students.  A NSF workshop grant proposal was funded in 2016 and in June 2017, 27 professionals from across the country will be attending UCF to learn about the EURO programming (almost 100 faculty and professional staff applied for these positions).    Broader Impact:  To date over 926 STEM undergraduate students (1194 total students, STEM and non-STEM) have been through our training programs and over 60 undergraduate peer mentors have served as mentors at three institutions. To assess learning gains within a training program, a pre- post test in the style of a concept inventory (50 question multiple-choice test bank) was developed. Results indicated that there were significant gains from pre to post regardless of institution or type of program. This indicated that all programs are effective in terms of increasing student?s scores on the 50-question concept inventory. A survey sent to all UCF and WSU participants over the life of the grant indicate that approximately 59% of participants that responded spent at least one semester engaged in undergraduate research with a faculty mentor. More than 75% of the students endorsed the pre-research prep program and it prepared them at least a fair amount to get involved in research and at least a little bit to be a better candidate for a research position. Approximately half of those that responded plan to attend graduate school or pursue an advanced degree, 26% plan to work in a field related to their STEM major, and 4% are unsure of their plans after graduation.
