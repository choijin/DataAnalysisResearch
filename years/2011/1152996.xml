<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program, Prof. Thomas Lectka of Johns Hopkins University develops new chemical methods that employ several independent catalysts working synergistically to produce chemically interesting and useful products not easily accessible in other ways.  Besides theoretical interest, operational simplicity, low catalyst loadings, mutual compatibility, and broad scope will be fundamental goals as well.  The foundation of the approach will be polycomponent catalysis (for example, a catalytic nucleophile in combination with an organometallic complex, a Lewis acid, and/or a phase transfer catalyst) that results in powerful methods for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant functionalized targets, including chiral fluorides, alkaloids, lactams and related compounds.  A focus on new methods of fluorination is especially noted; fluorinated organic molecules provide fruitful and exciting new leads for drug discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would serve three main goals: 1) the development of complex yet highly worthwhile new chemical processes; 2) fundamentally new approaches to the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant targets and other useful molecules; 3) and practical training in synthetic chemistry for graduate students (including members of underrepresented groups).  Equally, exposure of numerous undergraduates to synthetic projects (especially at hospital-oriented Johns Hopkins) will help to prepare them for careers in health-related occupations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most significant project outcomes of this grant involved new ways to install fluorine in organic molecules.  Fluorine is a special element; it is the most electronegative atom and when attached to an organic molecule alters its properties in interesting and useful ways.  For example, fluorinated drugs have achieved a high level of importance in pharmaceutical science the past few years; the importance of fluorine to biological chemistry is likewise increasing at a rapid rate.  Our studies concentrated on developing new ways to convert hydrocarbon (C-H bonds) into C-F bonds.  We insisted that these new methods be safe and easy to use, in contrast to the use of fluorine gas itself, which is difficult to handle and highly toxic.  We also expended much effort into understanding how the reactions occur (their mechanisms).  This understanding led to several new publications concerning improvements in fluorination methods.  In total, more than a dozen publications resulted from the funding of this grant, all in prestigious chemistry journals.  As the most electronegative element, fluorine demands electrons.  Another facet of our research involved seeing whether such an electronegative element could be made to withstand a positively charged environment.  The answer is yes in the form of fluoronium ions, in which fluorine carries a formal positive charge.  These experiments illustrate that fluorine's electronegativity is not an insurmountable barrier to new modes of chemical bonding.   Finally, this award has permitted the training of several graduate students and over a dozen undergraduates, many of whom have chosen to proceed with a career in science.  The techniques that they learned while working on this project should form an excellent basis for their newfound advanced scientific inquiries in gradaute and medical school.
