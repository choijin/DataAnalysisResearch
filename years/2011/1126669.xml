<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to acquire a LA-ICP-MS system to be used for the high resolution analysis of elemental and isotopic ratios of various substrates and materials in earth science, oceanographic, and climate change research. Acquisition of LA-ICP-MS would serve researchers working within various disciplines at UNC - CH and at other regional institutions. The requested LA-ICP-MS system is required for the broad range of research projects of multiple early career, mid-level, and senior researchers at UNC - CH. These projects include investigating temporal trends in carbonate mineralogy, developing a multielemental coral paleothermometer to reconstruct recent climate change, isotopic labeling of carbonate shells and skeletons in ocean acidification experiments, investigating trace element partitioning in synthetic and biogenic carbonates, investigating the origin and evolution of rhyolite magmas, investigating the relationship between plutons and volcanic rocks, reconnaissance U-Pb dating of zircons, evaluating the flux of U and Th isotopes from rivers and coastal environments to the ocean, diagenetic screening of paleoceanographic proxies, and elemental fingerprinting of fish otoliths to investigate patterns of fish migration, larval dispersal, and population connectivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will contribute to the advancement of science in a range of disciplines in geoscience, and to the training of a range of researchers and their associates. It will especially benefit the establishment of 5 junior researchers at UNC-CH whom are in the process of developing new research programs. One minority post-doc and two minority students from Belize have already been identified to receive training in the new facility.</AbstractNarration>

The newly acquired LA-ICP-MS serves researchers working within various disciplines at UNC - CH and at other institutions throughout the region and beyond.  As of 2013, the LA-ICP-MS at UNC was the only such system in the central North Carolina region available for academic research.

The newly acquired LA-ICP-MS system represents a substantial improvement in the precision, accuracy, and detection limits over the existing methods available at UNC-CH for quantifying elemental and isotopic composition.  The PI, co-PIs and other researchers have used the instrument over the past year in numerous research projects, including: (1) development of a novel multielemental paleotemperature proxy in coral skeletons (Ries), (2) reconstruction of global warming over the past century throughout a Caribbean reef system (Ries), (3) reconstruction of hydraulic regimes in historical mill ponds (Ries &amp; Merritts), (4) assessment of the extent to which Gulf of Mexico marsh fish have been exposed to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (Fodrie), (5) reconnaissance dating of zircons to investigate timing and mode of caldera formation (Coleman), and (6) investigation of the impact of damming on the sediment- and pollution-dynamics of a NC river system (McKee).
