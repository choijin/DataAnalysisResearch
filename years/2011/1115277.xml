<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the precise analytic form of the complex singularities of&lt;br/&gt;the Lorenz system, the figure-eight solution of the three-body problem, and signals obtained&lt;br/&gt;from the Navier-Stokes boundary layer. Both analytic and numerical techniques&lt;br/&gt;will be used. Research on the Lorenz system has the aim of understanding the analytic&lt;br/&gt;continuation of the Lorenz solutions to the entire complex plane. With regard to the&lt;br/&gt;figure-eight solution, the project will show that the complex singularities of this system&lt;br/&gt;have an appealingly simple structure. The Navier-Stokes boundary layer has been&lt;br/&gt;studied primarily using techniques from spectral analysis. We will locate and elucidate&lt;br/&gt;singularities of the analytic continuation of the signal in the complex plane, and and&lt;br/&gt;obtain a measurement as well as an understanding of the time scales imposed by the&lt;br/&gt;outer flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project endeavors to benefit the public in two respects. Firstly, we aim to obtain&lt;br/&gt;new insights into the Navier-Stokes boundary layer which is of immense importance in&lt;br/&gt;engineering and meteorology. As an example of its importance, we mention that a&lt;br/&gt;major part of the energy intake of automobiles is dissipated in the boundary layer.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, we will write a new book that puts computer architecture at the heart of&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing. This book will introduce a style of scientific computing that is&lt;br/&gt;deeply informed by recent progress in computer architecture to a wider audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The two major aims of this project were to develop a set of numerical algorithms to find complex singularities of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the turbulent regime, and to write a book introducing scientific programming in the context of computer architecture and systems software. Both these aims have been substantially realized.   Fully developed turbulence is characterized by self-similarity in the inertial range. If a fragment of a turbulent signal is isolated and scaled, it looks similar to the original signal. The famous 2/3-law of the velocity increment squared may be viewed as a consequence of self -similarity. However, at very fine scales, beyond the inertial range and in the dissipative range, turbulent signals are highly intermittent. Frisch and Morf (1981) conjectured that intermittency is a manifestation of singularities in the complex t-plane. In this project, we devised a number of numerical techniques which culminated in the numerical verification of the Frisch-Morf conjecture. The attached graphic shows an intermittent signal extracted from a turbulent flow as well as a phase plot of the complex singularity associated with it.   The second major aim of this project was to write a book connecting scientific programming with computer architecture. Every computer programming language provides an abstraction that makes the computer look much simpler than it is. However, as soon as we ask the question of what makes the program fast or slow, we have to get behind the abstractions and understand how the computer really works. What is the role of instruction pipelines in numerical linear algebra? What is the role of caches and the translation lookaside buffer in memory optimization? What is the connection of disk caches to processing large data sets? Many such questions are answered in a book titled Scientific Programming and Computer Architecture authored by the PI. Much emphasis is placed on accessibility to bring the book within reach of as large a number of scientists as possible. The book has been completed except for a brief appendix. The book is currently under review.   The modern economy is a computerized economy. The large number of students who have been trained through this project in going behind the abstractions of programming, and understanding the computer as a whole, and the greater number who will gain the same knowledge through the PI's book once it is published, constitute a contribution to the economic health and well-being of the nation.
