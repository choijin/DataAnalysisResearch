<AbstractNarration>This project will provide conference support to assist U.S.-based young researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, pre-tenure faculty) attend an international conference on 'Coherent Flow Structures in Geophysical Flows at the Earth's Surface'.  The objective of the conference is to bring together research teams who are using numerical simulation, laboratory modeling, and field observation to study coherent flow structures, their interaction with sediment, vegetation, and benthic communities, the manipulation of such flow structures for managing sedimentary environments, and the key role they play in Earth surface dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth's surface is largely sculpted by the interactions between moving fluids and the bed topography (in flows of air, water, and solids). Much work over many decades has sought to link the detail of the turbulent flow structure to the transport of sediment, to the development of bed topography, and to the feedbacks between these three. Investigation of the linkages in this ?trinity? of flow, form and transport have underlain much research over the past 20 years and have revealed the pivotal role of ?coherent flow structures? in controlling and modulating this trinity. The interaction between flow structure, mobile sediment, and surface morphology has thus become of central importance to understanding the dynamics of the Earth?s surface. Additionally, managing such flows is a key component of both sustainable engineering design/construction (such as flows around bridge piers, wing dykes and revetments) as well as in the maintenance of ecological habitats.  This interdisciplinary field of study is developing new young researchers who are seamlessly integrating numerical, laboratory, and field research to advance monitoring and modeling. A clear impact of this project is thus to support the development of early career interdisciplinary researchers in this area.</AbstractNarration>
