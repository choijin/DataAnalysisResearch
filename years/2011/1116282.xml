<AbstractNarration>While energy costs of data centers continue to double every five years, what is most disappointing is that most of this power is wasted.   Servers are only busy 10-30% of the time on average, but they are often left on, while idle, utilizing 60% or more of peak power.    This project, being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University, investigates simple load-oblivious, distributed auto-scaling of the data center capacity to reduce power consumption.    Our policies scale the number of servers that are on, as a function of changing load, shutting down servers, or putting them into sleep states, or changing the frequency at which they are run, without knowing the load in advance.     Our work combines full-scale implementation in a 23-server multi-tier data center together with queueing-theoretic analysis to reduce the search space of solutions and guide the algorithmic development.     We expect to develop algorithms which significantly reduce power consumption, while still meeting response time service level agreements.   Broader impacts of this work include direct collaboration with Intel Pittsburgh labs, publication of a textbook on queueing-theoretic modeling and its applications, and weekly coaching and management of the Western PA American Regions Mathematics League, to train the smartest young minds of tomorrow.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The annual cost of energy used by U.S. data centers alone in 2007 was approximately 7.4 billion dollars, and this number is only growing. Sadly, most of this energy is wasted, because these data centers are only 30% utilized.  Most of the servers at the data centers are left on, in anticipation of a peak burst of requests, but they are largely idle.  Since an idle server consumes almost as much energy as a busy one (65-70%), these idle servers are responsible for a large part of data center energy consumption.  The primary purpose of this award was to develop dynamic power management policies for data centers, based on turning servers on and off, so as to reduce waste.  The problem with turning servers off is that there is a huge setup cost needed to get a server back on (5 minutes of time), during which the server is not available to serve requests.  A primary outcome of the award is the development of the AutoScale algorithm, which dynamically adjusts which servers are on/off/idle, so as to both minimize energy usage, but simultaneously meet user latency goals.  The AutoScale algorithm is currently being deployed by Facebook, and they claim that it has provided them with energy savings of 10-15%.  A secondary purpose of this award was to develop mathematical models to help understand the impact of the setup cost on latency in a data center.  An important outcome of this award was the development of several new methods for analyzing Markov chains which can represent these setup costs.  Such Markov chains are infinite, repeating chains, which have here-to-fore never been analyzed in closed-form.  This award developed the RRR and CAP methods for analyzing such Markov chains.  Finally, this award has had many broader impact outcomes.  Two PhD students funded by this award have now graduated: Anshul Gandhi is an Assistant Professor at SUNY StonyBrook, and Sherwin Doroudi just started as an Assistant Professor at University of Minnesota.  Two other PhD students (Timothy Zhu and Kristen Gardner) have been supported as well and are a year away from graduating. An undergraduate was also supported off of a summer REU.  Additionally, the PI of the grant produced a textbook, "Performance Modeling and Design of Computer Systems," which was published by Cambridge University Press in 2013 and is now being used worldwide to teach performance modeling.  Finally, the PI and her students have given over 100 talks during the course of this grant to disseminate the research.  Two of these were keynote talks at major conferences. Several of these were talks to undergraduates on applying for PhD programs, and many were talks to high school and middle school girls on cool examples of computer science research.
