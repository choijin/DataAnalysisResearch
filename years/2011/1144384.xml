<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate a little-studied and potentially important factor in the development and maintenance of biological diversity in plant communities: the spatial arrangement of individual plants. The investigators will study how this factor may also control the productivity of communities and their invasibility by new species of plants introduced by humans. While many researchers have studied how altering the number and abundances of the species in an area affects invasion and biomass production, few have considered how the location of the individuals of each species affects these properties.  Researchers will experimentally establish tallgrass prairie communities with contrasting spatial arrangements of individuals to determine the effects of initial species pattern on invasion and production of biomass, and test whether commonly reported effects of species number and abundance are instead attributable to spatial patterns.  The project will test previously indistinguishable factors that affect invasion and biomass production in plant communities and shed new light on the effects of altering plant diversity in grasslands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include strengthening the infrastructure and workforce for science, training of students, public education, and potential applications to natural resource management.  The project will be the inaugural experiment for the University of North Dakota (UND) Biology Experimental Field Station and support UND's research and education focus in grassland ecology.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate students and findings from the study will inform grassland restoration practices throughout the tallgrass prairie region.  Laboratory personnel will also participate in outreach projects with the Grand Forks County Prairie Partners, a group dedicated to preserving and promoting citizen understanding of the tallgrass prairie in the northern Great Plains.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The goal of this project was to test whether the spatial positioning of plants in a community affects plant community diversity, productivity, and invasion resistance in the tallgrass prairie model system. We successfully established a large-scale manipulative field experiment (Species Pattern and Community Ecology [SPaCE] experiment) at a University of North Dakota field station in summer 2012 and used supporting greenhouse and field experiments to address the questions:  1. How does altering initial species pattern affect community-scale responses in grasslands?  2. Do effects of richness and evenness arise through effects on plant species pattern?  The SPaCE experiment was planted with transplants of 16 species in plots containing 2, 4 or 8 species planted at high, intermediate, or low (1.0, 0.8 or 0.64 respectively) evenness in random or clumped arrays. Additionally, half of the study plots were consistently weeded to assess how community manipulations affected invasion resistance ((3 richness levels x 3 evenness levels x 2 pattern x 2 invasion + 16 monoculture plots) x 5 blocks = 260 1m2 plots). We collected three years of data on plant biomass, plant invasion, plant resource-use, above-ground invertebrates, and below-ground biota associated with these plots in efforts supported by this and internal awards.  As predicted, altering plant species richness, evenness, and pattern variously affected plot productivity, diversity, and invasion responses.  As in other experiments, increasing richness increased biomass production, and the mechanism driving the differences in biomass production changed from selection effects to complementary effects over time.  Additionally, we found that initial planting pattern affects grassland productivity and the processes that lead to grassland invasion resistance and biodiversity effects. Initial aggregation of conspecific individuals reduced biomass production and increased diversity, which is consistent with previous species pattern experiments. Clumping conspecifics also consistently reduced invasion into low richness-intermediate evenness plots.  Further analyses indicate that these effects are driven by species-specific responses to plant pattern, and we are currently investigating whether plant-soil feedbacks contribute to the effects of plant community composition on these responses. Our findings challenge traditional perceptions regarding the scales over which the mechanisms that structure plant biomass occur, and expand our understanding of relationships between plant pattern and process.  These findings are directly applicable in the field of grassland restoration ecology, and we are using these findings in ongoing grassland establishment planning.  Broader Impacts  This project provided on-going training and professional development for one graduate and 17 undergraduate students.  Six of the undergraduate students conducted independent research projects and disseminated their results at regional or national meetings. All project participants were trained on plant identification and ecological sampling techniques and attended weekly laboratory meetings that included responsible conduct of research training.  Results were disseminated to the broader scientific community through oral and poster presentations (regional and national) and through publication in scientific journals. We are currently preparing manuscripts for publication on productivity and invasion responses with the addition of 2014 results.  To increase public interest in learning and STEM careers we annually engaged community members and students through volunteer field harvest events and involvement with the North Dakota State Science Fair and ND NATURE (Nurturing American Tribal Research and Education) programs.
