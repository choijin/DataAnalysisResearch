<AbstractNarration>It is widely acknowledged that the physical universe is unpredictable.  In computer science this unpredictability, modeled as access to randomness, turns out to be an enabling feature in algorithm design, cryptography and distributed computing.  For example, known methods of encrypting sensitive information for transmission over the internet rely crucially on the ability of computers to generate random sequences, and many fast algorithms are randomized algorithms.  So it is worthwhile to investigate exactly what can be done with and without randomness, and to identify the minimal assumptions on the randomness under which we can still get the benefits of randomized methods.  This is the central question of the area of derandomization: To what extent can we do without the use of randomness in computation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, PI will investigate basic questions related to the theme of derandomization towards the goals of showing that  (1) every randomized polynomial time algorithm can be simulated by a deterministic algorithm, that (2) every randomized algorithm with small memory can be simulated by a deterministic algorithm using small memory, and that (3) cryptography can be achieved even with defective sources of randomness. Besides being involved in graduate and undergraduate teaching around the subject of the proposal, the PI will organize reading groups, participate in efforts to recruit from underrepresented groups, and be involved in projects to increase graduate recruiting at education at the high school level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The major goals of the project have to do with pursuing questions in pseudorandomness and derandomization. Over the past year, the PI has been primarily pursuing research objectives in the closely related topic of proving lower bounds.      During the duration of this project, the PI and his collaborators have worked on many topics related to the goal of proving lower bounds, including:       1. Coding for Sunflowers. The famous sunflower conjecture of Erdos and Rado states that there is a function c(p) such that every collection of c(p)^k sets of size k contains p sets that share the same pairwise intersections. The PI simplified recent work of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang on the sunflower lemma. Our results give the strongest results for the sunflower lemma known.      2. Lower bounds for balancing sets and depth-2 threshhold circuits. In this paper, we gave new lower bounds for threshhold circuits. We showed that if a circuit of depth-2 computes the majority of n bits using gates that compute the majority of k bits, then k must be at least n/2.     Our publication, "Lower Bounds on Balancing Sets and Depth-2 Threshhold Circuits", appeared at ICALP 2019.     This project has supported several graduate students working on problems in lower bounds over the past 5 years. The PI is finishing work on a new text book on communication complexity that encapsulates recent work on this popular area, and should become an important resource for teaching this subject.
