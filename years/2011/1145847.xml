<AbstractNarration>Characterizing life's astounding diversity is fundamental to creating the stable, predictive classifications applied daily in agriculture, conservation, and medicine. Despite new genomic tools, however, species boundaries remain contentious since both the processes and traits that define species are spatially and temporally dynamic. This project uses multiple evidentiary approaches and novel protocols to test discovery-driven hypotheses of species delimitation in closely related Camassia and Hastingsia (rush lilies). Their morphological complexity, hybrids, and variable populations pose difficult classification challenges, making them ideal exemplars for defining the "best practices" of integrative taxonomy. Analysis of ecological and genetic differences, reproductive barriers, and the response of "generalist pollinators" to floral traits will add further insights into how diversity arises in a family where highly specialized pollination also occurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ecological and cultural value of camas to indigenous peoples enhances the project's broad focus, which engages K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students in investigations encompassing the full scope of systematics. Volunteer partnerships will foster diverse, structured experiences in threatened habitats. Access to internet keys will further improve rare and common plant identification. Finally, ecological niche modeling and records of insect visits and flowering times may facilitate tracking the effects of climate change on plant-pollinator interactions.</AbstractNarration>
