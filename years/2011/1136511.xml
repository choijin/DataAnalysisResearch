<AbstractNarration>The Seventh William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day, directed workshop on Geometry and Dynamics of Teichm端ller Spaces, to be held at the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August 30-September 3, 2011. This years workshop will consist of a two-day mini-course for graduate students and junior researchers on Teichm端ller theory, followed by a three day lecture series.&lt;br/&gt;Among the main topics of the workshop will be the recent work of Kahn and Markovic which combine methods from hyperbolic geometry with ergodic and mixing properties of geodesic flow to make a number of important breakthroughs  including the proof of the surface subgroup conjecture for closed hyperbolic manifolds and a recently posted proof of the Ehrenpries conjecture. Another topic will be to generalize work on classical Teichm端ller space to other moduli spaces such as the Hitchen component H_n(S) of surface representations into SL(n,R) and the  Culler-Vogtmann Outer space X_n of a free group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate  common themes and techniques among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested in these areas. The workshop will bring together leading researchers in geometry and topology  with graduates students and junior researchers who have a special interest in problems related to Geometry and Dynamics of Teichm端ller Spaces and will investigate a number of important questions at the forefront of research in these areas. The confluence of expertise from different areas will result in new collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.hamilton.tcd.ie/events/gt/gt2011.htm</AbstractNarration>

This workshop consisted of a two-day workshop for graduate students, followed by a three-day lecture series on the topic ofGeometry and Dynamics of Teichmuller Spaces.  Activities and Impacts. The workshop brought together some of the leading researchers in geometry and topology  who work on  problems in Geometry and Dynamics of Teichmuller Spaces. This is an important topic of current research and studies the space of different geometries an object, such as a surface, can have. The confluence of expertise from different areas at the workshop rsupported new collaborative projects, and in broadened the research horizons of the participants.  The format consisted of a two-day workshop for graduate students August 30-31 given by a team of leading researchers, followed by a three-day lecture series which described current research and new directions. On the last day, there was a problem session in which participants were encouraged to describe parallels that they observed between the problems and techniques used in the various fields.   Broader Impacts. Immediate broader impacts include the generation of a more well-defined set of research directions and open problems in a number of related fields for the next generation of young researchers to work on.   The workshop also supports strong links between the US and rest of the international research community and is a major annual forum for communication between the U.S. and European research communities.
