<AbstractNarration>This is a 3-year observation and modeling project to be undertaken as part of the Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) program. Atmospheric gravity waves are believed to play a vital role in the transport of energy and momentum between atmospheric layers. This project concerns the ubiquitous wave field in the thermosphere at the low latitude Arecibo Observatory (AO) site. Observing campaigns with the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar that employ a newly developed and tested innovative measurement technique will be used together with ray tracing, and first principles models. The goal is to self-consistently determine all of the parameters needed for reverse ray tracing for the gravity waves observed at the AO, to identify the most likely lower atmospheric and thermospheric sources for dozens of these gravity wave events, to determine the temporal evolution of the F region neutral wind, and to determine the neutral wind acceleration caused by select sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravity waves are a significant forcing source on mesosphere and lower thermosphere dynamics and their effects strongly impact general circulation and climate models. In addition, numerical weather prediction models, despite their tropospheric focus, have been shown to make better predictions when the upper-atmospheric dynamics are more accurately modeled. The project is collaboration between a female PI at North West Research Associates and an early career scientist at SRI International and also involves scientists at the NSF AO facility.</AbstractNarration>
