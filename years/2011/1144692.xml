<AbstractNarration>The study proposes a revision of a poorly known group of semifossorial frogs that occurs throughout the Neotropical lowlands east of the Andes from Panama to southern Brazil. This group has never been thoroughly studied to determine its species composition, species boundaries, and cryptic speciation in the group. The revision will be an important addition to understanding diversity and speciation of the Neotropical biota. Currently, most of the Neotropical biota is poorly understood with regard to species diversity and individual species distributions. Preliminary data suggest that morphological variation is a poor estimate of genetic diversity among Amazonian frogs.  The researchers intend to study the composition of this group of frogs using a combined approach of molecular and morphological characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will result in publications in scientific journals and a monographic revision of the group. The project involved collaborations with scientists throughout Latin America. It will also directly support the training of two undergraduates per year at the University of Richmond. Furthermore, the project will strengthen international scientific collaboration by training of two Brazilian researchers.  A specific aim of the project is to train research collaborators and interested undergraduates on synthetic and revisionary monographic work</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project resulted in the first molecular hypothesis of evolutionary relationships, i.e., similar to a family tree, among genera of the Microhylidae, a group of frogs distributed worldwide. This was critical and necessary to understand the evolutionary relationships of the poorly known frog genus Chiasmocleis, the focus of the study. Working with undergraduates at the University of Richmond and graduate students and colleagues from various countries in South America, we constructed the first comprehensive, i.e., including all but 1 species.  This hypothesis of relationships provided additional information on the morphology and evolution of these poorly studied frogs.  In addition, we described four new species for the genus and all these previously unknown species occur in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, which is considered a ?hotspot? of biodiversity and, at the same time, is undergoing significant habitat degradation and lost.  The species are considered ?cryptic species? because looking at them there are very difficult to differentiate from each other. However, we used genetic data and differences in their skeleton to differentiate them as new species.  Amphibians are undergoing a worldwide mass extinction and, at the same time, for most amphibians there is not enough data on their biology and current threats. Consequently, many species are labeled as "data deficient", one of the categories use by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to assess the conservation status of species.  Undoubtedly, the new species will be placed under "data deficient." However, having documented the presence of new species, that were previous confused with other known species, raises awareness of the biodiversity within the threatened Atlantic Forest and may also impact the conservation status of those other species.   The project resulted in the training of 9 (four females) undergraduates at UR and 1 graduate student that trained in molecular work at UR while completing his Ph.D. through the Univeristy of Uruguay.  In addition, two Master level students joined the lab, one (Mauricio Forlani) returned to Brazil and is currently working in conservation biology and the second one (Joao Tonini) will be completing his PH.D at George Washington University in August 2017.   Four of the undergraduate students identify from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.  Two undergraduates worked in the lab for their 4 years at UR and two others worked on projects for a minimum of 2 full years (summers and academic sessions). All presented their research at UR Spring Undergraduate Research Symposium as well as national and international conferences.
