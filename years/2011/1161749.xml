<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of recently synthesized ultrafine-grained metals with a high density of nanoscale twin lamellae that act as subgrain microstructures. To reveal how the deformation behaviors of this kind of materials depends on the internal microstructures and associated characteristic length scales (i.e., grain size and twin boundary spacing), we will apply a multiscale modeling approach that combines finite element (continuum and mesoscopic), dislocation dynamics (mesoscopic and microscopic) and molecular dynamics (atomic scale) methods. Ultra-large scale numerical simulations and theoretical modeling will be performed to capture various deformation mechanisms in such nanotwinned metals, including the interaction between dislocations, cracks and twin boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will generate new knowledge and fundamental understanding of nanotwinned metals, a new class of hierarchical nanostructured materials that possess an unusual combination of ultra-high strength, amazing ductility, enhanced strain hardening, high strain-rate sensitivity, remarkable fracture toughness and fatigue resistance. The advance of large-scale computational capabilities in materials research will enable USA to maintain scientific and technical leadership in the world. The educational components of the project include training of a PhD student, mentoring of undergraduates, and assimilation of state-of-the-art research results into the existing graduate and undergraduate courses in engineering at Brown University where there are currently strong student interests in mechanics of hierarchically nanostructured materials and structures. Additional outreach activities will be mediated by Brown?s Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) which has established a set of excellent outreach educational programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Recent developments in materials science and technology have witnessed the synthesis of nanotwinned metals, a new class of hierarchical nanostructured materials that possess an unusual combination of ultra-high strength, amazing ductility, enhanced strain hardening, high strain-rate sensitivity, remarkable fracture toughness and fatigue resistance. What is the origin of these unique mechanical behaviors, and what are the associated deformation mechanisms in such hierarchical nanostructured material? Over the past 4 years, the Principle Investigator (PI) and his team have performed cutting edge research aimed to reveal the new knowledge/concept and fundamental understanding that will provide insights and guidelines for designing new hierarchical nanostructured materials with tailor-designed mechanical properties, in particular nanotwinned metals with applications in next-generation interconnect and packaging components of micro-/nano- electronics and microelectromechanical systems. This research has produced the following findings.</p> <p><strong>Anisotropic plastic deformation mechanisms in nanotwinned metals.</strong> Anisotropic plastic deformation in columnar-grained copper in which preferentially oriented nanoscale twins are embedded has been studied. The PI and his team have developed an integrated approach of combining finite element analysis based on crystal plasticity theory, molecular dynamics simulations and experiments to investigate the deformation mechanisms of columnar-grained nanotwinned materials. The analysis showed that the dominant deformation mechanism can be effectively switched among three dislocation modes, from dislocation glide in between the twins to dislocation transfer across twin boundaries to dislocation-mediated boundary migration, by changing the loading orientation with respect to the twin planes (Fig. 1).</p> <p><strong>Evading the strength&ndash;ductility trade-off dilemma in steel through gradient hierarchical nanotwins.</strong> The strength&ndash;ductility trade-off has been a long-standing dilemma in materials science. The PI and his team have discovered a way of enhancing the strength of steel at no ductility trade-off by generating a gradient nanotwinned structure along the radial direction (Fig. 2). This work is of fundamental significance from both scientific and practical application points of view, since it revealed a very fundamental mechanism which could be used to evade the strength-ductility trade-off dilemma in steel. This study has stimulated broad interest and further research in seeking ways to generalize our findings to other ways of creating gradient microstructures with novel applications.</p> <p><strong>Recoverable plasticity in penta-twinned metallic nanowires governed by dislocation nucleation and retraction.</strong> There has been relatively little study on time-dependent mechanical properties of nanowires, in spite of their importance for the design, fabrication and operation of nanoscale devices. The PI and his team discovered a dislocation-mediated, time-dependent and fully reversible plastic behaviour in penta-twinned silver nanowires (Fig. 3). The observed behaviour in penta-twinned nanowires originates from the surface nucleation, propagation and retraction of partial dislocations. This work opens up a promising prospect of designing 1D nanostructures with time-dependent strain recovery capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Large anelasticity and associated energy dissipation in single-crystalline nanowires. </strong>Anelastic materials are being investigated for mechanical damping applications. The PI and his team discovered that single-crystalline ZnO and p-doped Si nanowires can exhibit anelastic behaviour that is up to four orders of magnitude larger than the largest anelasticity observed in bulk materials, with a timescale on the order of minutes (Fig. 4). The findings suggest that crystalline nanowires with point defects are promising materials for energy damping applications.</p> <p><strong>Nanotwin-governed toughening mechanism in hierarchically structured biological materials. </strong>As a natural bio-composite, Strombus gigas, exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, especially a high fracture toughness. The PI and his team reveal a toughening mechanism governed by nanoscale twins in the conch shell showing that the twin boundaries can effectively block crack propagation by inducing phase transformation and delocalization of deformation around the crack tip (Fig. 5). These findings provide a fundamental understanding of the contribution of hard basic building blocks at nanoscale to fracture resistance of the overall structure, which complement our previous knowledge about the roles of soft organic content and bio-composite structure in the toughness of bio-materials. The present study may also have profound impact on the design of strong and tough biomimetic materials with minimum organic content.</p> <p>The PI has published 10 papers in high-profile journals including Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Communications, Acta Materialia, Nano Letters and Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids. In addition, the PI had delivered 38 plenary, keynote and invited talks/seminars at scientific conferences, workshops, universities and national laboratories to disseminate the research findings from this project. The advance of high-speed and large-scale computational capabilities employed in this project continues to enable United States to maintain scientific and technical leadership in the world.</p> <p>The educational program under this project includes training of graduate students and research experience for undergraduates from underrepresented groups. Supported by this grant, the PI trained one PhD student (Sheng Yin), who is now beginning to search for a faculty positions in USA. For outreach activities, the PI served as a term as the Director of Brow&rsquo;s MRSEC program which organized and executed several dynamic outreach programs in education and technology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/09/2016<br>      Modified by: Huajian&nbsp;Gao</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1161749/1161749_10183541_1470714456333_Fig_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1161749/1161749_10183541_1470714456333_Fig_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Deformation mechanisms in nanotwinned metals."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1161749/1161749_10183541_1470714456333_Fig_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Deformation mechanisms in nanotwinned metals."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic illustration of a deformation-mechanism map in terms of twin thickness and loading orientation with respect to the twin planes.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lei Lu & Huajian Gao Teams</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Huajian&nbsp;Gao</div> <div class="imageTitle">Deformation mechanisms in nanotwinned metals.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1161749/1161749_10183541_1470714665610_Fig_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1161749/1161749_10183541_1470714665610_Fig_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Gradient nanotwinned structures in TWIP steel"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1161749/1161749_10183541_1470714665610_Fig_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Gradient nanotwinned structures in TWIP steel"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Microstructures showing a gradient nanotwin structure along the radial direction of a cylindrical TWIP steel sample subjected to 180° torsion.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yujie Wei & Huajian Gao Teams</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Huajian&nbsp;Gao</div> <div class="imageTitle">Gradient nanotwinned structures in TWIP steel</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1161749/1161749_10183541_1470714827148_Fig_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1161749/1161749_10183541_1470714827148_Fig_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Recoverable plastic deformation in penta-twinned Ag nanowires."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1161749/1161749_10183541_1470714827148_Fig_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Recoverable plastic deformation in penta-twinned Ag nanowires."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In situ measurements of stress and strain evolutions in Ag NWs.
