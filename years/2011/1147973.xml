<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to hold an NSF CISE-sponsored workshop in to survey the state-of-the art in cross-layer power optimization and management, to identify areas that require further research and development, and to chart a transformative research agenda for this field. The workshop is expected to bring together about 50 of the leading researchers studying system-wide power optimization techniques and dynamic power management from both academe and industry including representatives from major chip design companies. All of the material from the workshop will be made available to the research community and a detailed report will be prepared and submitted to NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power efficiency is an important driver for the semiconductor industry and all of its components. By investigating the shortcomings and weaknesses of the current approaches to power and/or energy efficiency it is expected that a new slate of low power technology and circuit solutions with tangible impact on the design of the next generation portable electronics as well as high performance (yet energy aware) computing will be achieved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF-sponsored Cross-layer Power Optimization and Management (CPOM) workshop was organized to collect and report the views of a group of researchers from universities, industry, and research laboratories on the need for potential new avenues of research that can change how power optimization and management is addressed in critical computing infrastructure. A final report was generated from the CPOM workshop and submitted to NSF CISE leadership and distributed in the research community.  The general findings of the report agree with many from other strategic visioning studies and documents recently made available to the public, including the CRA CCC 21st Century Computer Architecture White Paper and the NITRD Program 2012 Strategic Plan.  Energy-efficient computing solutions that cut across multiple layers of the computing stack and infrastructure are needed for sustaining advancements in information technology to address critical societal challenges. More precisely, key findings of the CPOM workshop may be summarized as follows:  1)      Energy efficiency in VLSI circuits and systems ranging from deeply embedded, to enterprise computing, to datacenters is a key concern of rising significance and value to the US and world economies.  2)      Cross-layer power optimization and management (CPOM) can address major challenges and open new opportunities which have potential to significantly lower the energy consumption of computing systems used pervasively in all sectors of our society (including scientific discovery), thereby providing higher sustainability of burgeoning information and communication infrastructure.  3)      NSF has vested interest in encouraging and supporting research in energy efficiency in general and cross-layer power optimization/management in particular; NSF support will be instrumental in building a community of researchers and innovators focused on advancing CPOM.  4)      NSF (CISE) has no specific program focused on basic research and core technology development with an energy efficiency focus. Existing programs within NSF CISE typically are scattered and lack focus, and/or have an application development/demonstration focus. It is essential for NSF to have a program focused on addressing energy efficiency and cross-layer power optimization and management for achieving it.  As advancement toward realizing key goals occur, this program may be folded into existing NSF CISE core programs.        Last Modified: 08/31/2013       Submitted by: Massoud Pedram]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
