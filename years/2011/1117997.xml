<AbstractNarration>Project Title: Semi-Regular Volumetric Parameterizations, Meshes, and Datafitting &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project PI: Elaine Cohen, University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volumetric models are increasingly pervasive in computer graphics, computer-aided geometric design, visualization, and medical data analysis.   Formulating high quality parameterizations and smooth representations is a difficult problem. Although it is possible to create unstructured tetrahedral based C0 bases, there are many problems for which semi-structured smooth hexahedral based representations give higher fidelity simulations, model representations, and analyses. However, automatic creation of such representations is still a challenge problem. At least partially because they require much manual interaction and effort, current techniques to create smooth representations have not been widely adopted. Our successful initial results in using mathematical theory to create representations for special classes of volumes has opened a door for extending the theory to create algorithms that deal with  more complex volumetric shapes. A semi-regular parameterization facilitates many geometric processing and analysis algorithms, allowing their extension to volumetric processing, and it supports the use of smooth higher-order bases for simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is creating automatic parameterization and data fitting techniques for heterogeneous volumes through i) developing a theoretical basis for techniques to represent volumetric models using semi-regular tensor product parameterizations, and ii) fitting higher order smooth representations of the volumes over the parameterizations and then using associated smooth bases for simulation. We are addressing domain matching, shape distortion, and issues in computational geometry for such algorithms. Shapes that are being investigated include multi-boundary polygonal models derived from scanned data and designed boundary models represented as smooth NURBS surfaces. Algorithms and software tools to help transform surface models to tensor product volume parameterizations and smooth representations of volumes were lacking, one issue that this research is overcoming. The results are being tested on a meaningful subset of graphics simulation problems, particularly in the case of elastic deformations of objects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research included developing techniques for parameterizing volumetric shape models, creating smooth, continuously differentiable representations, and visualizing them.  One intent is to be able to represent the volume with trivariate B-splines.  In order to do so, it is necessary to create large curvilinear hexahedra (curvilinearly distorted cubes), as large as possible, given the geometry and internal structure of the geometry. Each large curvilinear hexahedron is broken into a three-dimensional regular curvilinear grid of hexahedra. The assembly of these large curvilinear hexahedra, with matching constraints across the boundary is called a Semi-Regular (S-R) volumetric parameterization.  Once such a parameterization is attained, another goal is to create trivariate B-spline representations of geometry and material and simulation attributes over them that have matching constraints at their boundaries.   To take advantage of the accuracy possible in using these representations for simulation and specifying material attributes, we also created a direct isosurface visualization algorithm.  Isosurfaces are like "height" topographic maps, but are applied to other attributes and are in higher dimension and hence create surfaces (like the constant temperature surfaces in a room.)  This algorithm can create accurate images high order isosurfaces that cannot be computed using more standard low order techniques.   Generally, research into creating smooth, continuously differentiable volumetric parameterizations has been focused on migrating polygonal surface representations (models that have surfaces composed of large numbers of triangles) to either S-R hexahedral based representations (including trivariate B-splines) or unstructured hexahedra (the vertices of each of the small hexahedron may be adjacent to other than 8 hexahedra) to use in simulations. This means that the original CAD B-spline boundary representations are lost and cannot be further modified based on new design contraints. This effect is in contradiction to the goals of IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA) and further limits the design-simulate-redesign that is desirable for better results in Additive Manufacturing (AM), also called "3-D printing". To address this important issue, this research project extended its goals to include obtaining a high order curvilinear S-R volumetric representation that can maintain the original boundary representation.  The investigations resulted in progress in that direction with initial results that preserve the original B-spline boundary representation while also creating a S-R internal volumetric representation that continuously blends trivariate B-splines with higher order unstructured tetrahedral representations for both geometry and simulation. One additional aspect of this research investigated a new approach to using higher order tetrahedral finite elements for graphical animation of deformable bodies.  The approach adaptively modified the degree of individual B&eacute;zier tetrahedra in a time and simulation dependent method.  It achieved a computationally efficient adaptive-degree simulation framework and demonstrated, for the first time in computer graphics, animations of volumetric deformable bodies with nonlinear rest shapes.
