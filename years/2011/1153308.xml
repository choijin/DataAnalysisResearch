<AbstractNarration>Why has high-tech innovation produced by independent social enterprises emerged in developing countries? And how are these innovations being transferred to other countries around the world? This dissertation research investigates these questions through a study of the World Health Organization Vision 2020 (WHOV) program. The goal of the WHOV is to eradicate avoidable blindness globally, by, among other activities, sponsoring NGOs in India and Nepal who create new surgical science and ophthalmic technology in order to treat blindness. These innovations are distributed globally, to eye hospitals in other developing countries and to ophthalmologists and global health professionals in wealthy countries such as the United States. To investigate how these innovations are developed and how they move to other parts of the world, a research methodology called the extended case method is used. It includes a multi-site ethnographic analysis and semi-structured interviews at eye hospitals in Kenya, Nepal and India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical significance of this research is that it contradicts the assumption that highly sophisticated science and technology is developed in the west and transferred to developing countries.It also develops new theoretical knowledge about the role of nonprofit organizations in generating markets, contributing to theories of the dynamics of social enterprise funding for high-quality modern science and technology. Theoretical and empirical findings about innovation and technology transfer are used to train engineering students in the NSF Triple Helix GK-12 program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. A participatory photography project incorporates the perspectives of patients in the innovation process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the life of the award, from June 2012 until May 2013, this DDRIG resulted in several activities (performed by co-PI Logan Williams) that were essential to completing the dissertation research. Firstly, there were several research trips including: an international research trip to Mexico to conduct interviews; a domestic research trip to California to conduct interviews, make contacts for further interviews, and conduct archival research; a domestic research trip to North Carolina to conduct interviews, make contacts for the photovoice project, and conduct the photovoice project with blind and low vision participants.

The third activity was the purchasing of supplies and materials in order to conduct the photovoice project. The fourth activity was creation of a video documenting the photovoice project that was subsequently uploaded to You Tube (see broader impacts below for further discussion of this video). Approximately 50% of the award was spent on the photovoice project (a participatory action research project).     The intellectual merit of this dissertation research is seen in its contributions to three scholarly subfields of science, technology and society: political sociology of science; technology and development studies; and sociological and historical studies of the circulation of knowledge. This study adds a case study of the Global South to the political sociology of science work on research-agenda setting and scientific development. It describes two new concepts: socially responsible innovation systems (a contribution to technology and development studies) and contestation (a contribution to studies of the circulation of knowledge). Socially responsible innovation systems as a new concept explores the recent shift in the Appropriate Technology movement to address social goals on a large scale in LEDCs by emphasizing: local production of high-tech innovation, the strategic use of both market mechanisms and development aid, and the importance of their social mission. Contestation as a new concept explores how these NGOs disrupt future research agendas and challenge dominant practices as part of their practices of technoscience dissemination.     The broader impacts of this dissertation research include: public and scholarly dissemination of the results and professional training of graduate students.     Part of this research has been publically disseminated through online social networks and You Tube. On May 20, 2013, its sixth day on YouTube, the video documentary of the photovoice project jumped from approximately 100 to approximately 5000 views (possibly because friends of the co-PI posted the You Tube link on their Facebook pages). The viewer count continues to increase at a more moderate pace, as of May 31, 2013 there were 5440 views. The video documentary can be watched by following this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIQ-vGoTteg     This dissertation research has been presented at several scholarly venues, where NSF was acknowledged as a source of funding. During the life of the award, the co-PI Logan Williams has presented 4 conference papers based upon this dissertation research, and has been accepted to present 2 additional conference papers in the upcoming months. Her conference abstract to present at the 2013 Unite for Sight Global Health &amp; Innovation conference was rejected; therefore she has not yet publically presented this work to global health practitioners as she previously planned.     Additionally, this research has been presented as a guest lecture to undergraduate students interested in international issues.
