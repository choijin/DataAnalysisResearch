<AbstractNarration>1160184/1160117   &lt;br/&gt;Mayfield/Nikolov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scalable and low-cost production platforms are of growing importance for the development of affordable recombinant protein molecules.  This is especially true in the case of complex recombinant proteins that are often difficult and expensive to produce in commercial protein production platforms, such as mammalian cell culture and E. coli.  Protein production by mammalian cell cultures is still expensive because of stringent nutritional and growth requirements, specialized bioreactor design and environmental conditions, coupled with often low expression levels.  E. coli, although able to produce large quantities of protein inexpensively, is generally inefficient at producing properly folded, complex proteins as soluble molecules.  The single-cell eukaryotic alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has simple growth requirements (light, carbon dioxide, and salts) and its use as a production platform for complex recombinant proteins combines many of the most advantageous features of fermentation and cell cultures.  The specific features of C. reinhardtii chloroplast expression include: rapid generation of stably transformed master cell lines, efficient mammalian protein folding in a non-reducing environment, a host metabolism that is tolerant of "difficult-to-express" proteins, a low propensity for undesirable post-translational modifications and formation of insoluble aggregates, cell doubling times under 10 h using completely defined protein-free inorganic media, demonstrated scalability, and absence of endotoxin  and mammalian virus contamination.  The investigators have already demonstrated that C. reinhardtii is able to produce complex, multi-domain proteins that cannot be efficiently expressed in and purified from other heterologous systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the expression and purification of two unique and therapeutically important recombinant proteins that will serve to demonstrate the utility of the platform, and that could have high-impact provided they can be produced and purified at a competitive cost.  To develop C. reinhardtii as a broad and competitive platform for producing a unique class of recombinant proteins, the interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise will address challenges related to protein production, recovery, and purification.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop technologies and processes for an efficient, rapid, and scalable recombinant protein production platform for using C. reinhardtii.</AbstractNarration>

Effect of growth conditions on biomass and protein yield: All C. reinhardtii strains were grown using a simple and inexpensive TRIS-Acetate-Phosphate (TAP) medium.  Biomass accumulation after 5 days of cultivation under heterotrophic conditions (no light exposure) reaching 5 to 6 x105 cells/mL. In order to further increase cell concentration and provide sufficient nutrients for the subsequent induction phase, cell were resuspended in fresh medium at the end of the fifth day and were grown for additional 24 hours before induction by exposure to light.  Twenty four hours after resuspension the cell number increased almost two fold compared to non-resuspended cultures.  Osteopontin C. reinhardtii strain was designed for mixotrophic cultivation in TAP media with a constant light exposure of 300 &micro;mol m-2s-1. After 5 days of cultivation similar wet biomass yield (4 g/L) was achieved with the three transgenic algal strains, but OPN protein accumulation was about 50% lower compared with &alpha;CD22 scFvs and Pfs25.  Extraction and pretreatment of cell-free extracts: In order to improve the quality of cell lysate and improve the efficiency of adsorption chromatography (purification step), several pretreatment methods were compared.  Pretreatment of clarified and cell lysates by ammonium sulfate, acid, or cationic polymer (chitosan) precipitation revealed that direct pretreatment of cell lysates was equally effective in reducing extract impurities as that of clarified lysates.  Ammonium sulfate and acid precipitation were effective in reducing host cell protein by as much as 40%. The lysate pretreatment with chitosan at pH 5 proved to be a better method because it could reduce host cell protein by 82% and chlorophyll pigments by almost 58%. Compared to &alpha;CD22scFv, the pretreatment of OPN lysates with chitosan and ammonium resulted in a significantly higher loss of OPN.  Therefore, acid precipitation was chosen as a pretreatment method for OPN, whereas, chitosan and acidic precipitation were equally suitable for &alpha;CD22scFv.  None of the above pretreatment methods were compatible with Pfs 25 (malaria antigen) because precipitation induced formation of Pfs 25 multimers.   Purification of &alpha;CD22scFv and OPN:  All three recombinant proteins were engineered with N-terminal FLAG affinity tag for easy separation of recombinant proteins from crude extracts. Acid and chitosan pretreated &alpha;CD22scFv extracts were purified by adsorption to a strong anion exchange resin followed by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography. The two-step purification of &alpha;CD22scFv produced 98% pure &alpha;CD22scFv with 30% overall yield.
