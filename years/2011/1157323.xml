<AbstractNarration>Owing to predominant exchange processes that govern weather and climate on local, regional, and global scales, the atmospheric surface layer (ASL) is one of the most important parts of the atmosphere.  While the ASL is easily accessible to point measurements, quantifying with high precision and accuracy line- and areal-averages micrometeorological variables such as heat and momentum flux remains a major scientific and technological challenge.  A central goal of this effort is to enhance, refine and apply the science and technology of optical tomography of the atmospheric surface layer, where we focus on exploiting the ubiquitous vertical and horizontal angle-of-arrival (AOA) fluctuations of horizontally propagating light in the visible part of the spectrum.  Such AOA fluctuations, which carry information about mean values and fluctuations of the transverse wind velocity components and of the transverse temperature gradient components along the propagation path, will be observed with one or two large-aperture telescopes equipped with CCD cameras observing an array of test lights in the field(s) of view.  The three primary micrometeorological observables that can be retrieved with a single telescope are (1) temporal fluctuations of instantaneous, path-averaged, horizontal and vertical temperature gradients; (2) path averages of the horizontal and vertical components of the path-transverse wind velocity; and (3) path averages of the temperature turbulence structure parameter.  A pair of laterally spaced telescopes will lead to range-resolved observations.  The possibility to retrieve other turbulence statistics, such as variances of vertical and horizontal velocity components as well as vertical and lateral fluxes of heat and momentum, will also be explored.  Optically retrieved quantities will be compared with independent in-situ measurements along the propagation path in order to test the underlying hypotheses qualitatively and quantitatively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research program is centered on means to obtain and perform combined analysis of optical AOA fluctuation measurements and in-situ wind velocity and temperature measurements so as to obtain lead to a deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of the wind and temperature fields in the atmospheric surface layer.  Both strengths and limitations of optical AOA tomography based on the geometrical-optics and Markov approximations and the assumption of locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence will be explored theoretically by means of the Rytov theory and empirically by means of comparing optically-retrieved observables with collocated in-situ measurements so as to complement existing ASL remote sensing techniques, such as lidar, scintillometry, and acoustic tomography.  Broader impacts of this effort will be derived through graduate student education and exploration of more economical, readily portable and perhaps more sensitive means of probing the ASL.  Improved characterization of atmospheric light transmission and derived flux quantities offer the potential to mature into a more powerful standard technology for both research and operational objectives in micrometeorology, hydrology, renewable energy and climate physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Light propagating through the optically clear atmosphere experiences wavefront perturbations associated with turbulent temperature fluctuations in the atmosphere.  Wavefront tilts cause angle-of-arrival fluctuations (image motion), while changes in the wavefront curvature lead to focusing/defocusing effects and therefore to irradiance fluctuations (scintillation).  The twinkling of stars is one form of optical scintillation.  On the one hand, optical image motion and scintillation degrade image quality; on the other hand, image motion and scintillation carry information about wind and turbulence in the atmosphere, and this information can be used for atmospheric remote sensing purposes.  The project has integrated observational and theoretical methodologies for investigating and utilizing techniques to retrieve observables of the near-ground atmosphere from sequences of digital images. These images are captured with digital cameras attached to one or two ground-based telescopes that are pointed at test-light arrays deployed near the ground at a distance of typically 200 m. The retrieved atmospheric properties include wind velocities, optical turbulence "intensity" (more precisely, the temperature turbulence structure parameter), and fluctuations of the vertical temperature gradient.  These observables are important for understanding and predicting weather and climate.  Optical tomography in the sense of this project relies on the idea that cross-spectral analysis of image motion along propagation paths that intersect at small angles enables one to probe the atmosphere at or near the intersection points.  Scientific concepts and hypotheses that have been investigated and utilized in this project include the geometrical-optics approximation, the Rytov approximation, Taylor's frozen-turbulence approximation, the Fourier-Stieltjes representation of random fields and random time functions, the Obukhov-Corrsin theory of locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in the temperature field, and Hill's model of the spectral bump in the transition region between the inertial-convective range and the viscous-diffusive range.  The methodologies that have been investigated and advanced in this project are of interest also for scientists and engineers working in areas outside of meteorology, such as free-space optical communication, astronomy, adaptive optics, imaging and surveillance, navigation, directed-energy technology, and statistical fluid mechanics.    Simplifying assumptions such as the geometrical-optics approximation, the frozen-turbulence hypothesis, and the Obukhov-Corrsin theory of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence lead to robust retrieval algorithms, and the observables retrieved from the angle-of-arrival (AOA) fluctuations agree well with in-situ measurements collected simultaneously along the path. At frequencies in the inertial-convective range, the AOA spectra show a robust -8/3 power law as predicted by the standard assumptions. The system is inexpensive and scalable, and it can be used simultaneously as an image-motion sensor and as a scintillometer.  Results of this project have been documented in journal articles and conference papers and have been presented at scientific conferences and workshops.  Four graduate students have contributed to and intellectually benefited from this project.       Last Modified: 10/01/2015       Submitted by: Andreas Muschinski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
