<AbstractNarration>This project is co-funded by the Divisions of Materials Research, Chemistry, and Mathematical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: A team of chemists, materials scientists, and engineers at Pennsylvania State University is joined by a mathematician at the University of Delaware to investigate light-harvesting thin films for solar cells that contain plasmonic nanostructures coupled to periodic dielectrics. The project links the concepts of strong light scattering by sub-wavelength metallic structures with the light-trapping and light-guiding properties of photonic crystals. These structures are called multiplasmonic because they support the propagation of multiple surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) modes and can utilize both s- and p-polarized incident light. They offer promise for substantially increasing the utilization of light in thin film photovoltaic cells. This concept is explored computationally and experimentally in thin film semiconductor and planar dielectric light-concentrating architectures. The Rigorous Coupled Wave Approach is used to simulate and optimize light scattering and propagation. Because these calculations are time-intensive, mathematical research is planned to develop more efficient algorithms that will incorporate the optical properties needed to provide physically meaningful solutions. A fully 3-D time domain simulation tool will then be developed to enable broadband modeling of the multiplasmonic structures. In concert with the computational effort, the multiplasmonic concept is tested and validated in several experimental architectures. The simplest of these is a conventional SPP scattering layer, consisting of a metal backing film with a grid of scattering centers on a thin film multi-junction cell containing layers of polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductors. This structure allows the computational model to be validated in a photovoltaic cell and is expected to quantify polarization and multi-mode effects. Planar concentrator architectures containing periodic oxide or polymer dielectric layers with heterogeneously integrated silicon microcells are studied as photovoltaic modules. These designs are extended to a spectrum-splitting module that combines dye-sensitized solar cells and multiplasmonic silicon cells. New optical nanostructures and new patterning techniques are developed in order to fabricate these modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The large-scale implementation of solar photovoltaic power, a renewable resource that has the potential to dramatically impact the global energy economy, is limited by cost. The goal of this project is to explore a new principle for light trapping in solar cells. This approach could enable the design of solar cells that contain five times less silicon than conventional cells, while delivering the same amount of power. The concept is to couple two kinds of optical nanostructures: (1) very small metal particles, which are well known to scatter light strongly, and (2) patterned insulators that diffract light - the same phenomenon that gives rise to the colors of opals and butterfly wings. Theory predicts and preliminary experiments confirm that thin films of these combined structures are particularly good at light trapping. The challenge is to investigate the properties of different combinations, for which more efficient mathematical tools as well as fabrication methods must be developed, and to demonstrate that they can be integrated into solar cells in a manufacturable way. This project, with its multidisciplinary nature, engage graduate students in research that bridges topics in nanomaterials synthesis and patterning, solar cell module design, optical and electrical measurements, modeling, and mathematical algorithm development. Undergraduate honors students are also involved in this project at both Penn State and Delaware.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report borrows heavily from the Penn State outcomes report for this project with some modifications to focus on activities at Delaware.  Intellectual Merit:  The large-scale implementation of solar photovoltaic power, a renewable resource that has the capacity to dramatically impact the global energy economy, is limited by cost. Solar cells made of abundant materials, such as silicon, are expensive because of the cost of the material itself. The goal of this project was to explore a new principle for light trapping in solar cells. The approach taken in this project could enable the design of solar cells that contain five times less silicon than conventional cells, while delivering the same amount of power.  So far, inexpensive light trapping structures have employed luminescent molecules, nanoscale metal particles, or refractive materials.  The disadvantages of these materials is that they do not capture the full solar spectrum; additionally, the first two waste some of the trapped light by converting it to heat.  This project explored the intimate combination of nanoscale metallic and refractive materials.  Theory suggested that this combination would lead to a better spectral response &ndash; i.e., light trapping over a broader range of colors in the solar spectrum &ndash; as well as lower loss from the metallic component.  These new structures are called multiplasmonic, because they exploit the harvesting of light by exciting an electron plasma in the metal at multiple wavelengths.  The Delaware teamÆs main contribution to this multi-disciplinary project was 1) to develop optimization tools, 2) perform computational tests of proposed designs and 3) carry our mathematical analysis of alternative schemes for simulating photovoltaic devices.  For items 1) and 2) our goal was to take basic designs from the theory team at PSU and improve the desired output from the design by applying modern optimization techniques.  For example before concentrator solar cells were fabricated and tested, extensive computational results suggested that such a structure would efficiently concentrate light using our multiplasmonic designs.  Similarly extensive testing and optimization of the spectrum splitters that can direct light to two different solar absorbers was performed. These splitters enable the design of a new kind of efficient tandem solar cell.  Concerning item 3) we worked closely with the Penn State theory group to compare two numerical schemes for computing the electromagnetic field in a solar cell. These methods have competing advantages and disadvantages and it is important to understand their performance for the structures studied in our grant.  We also developed a new class of computational schemes for thin film structures using state of the art theory of time domain problems.  At the end of the project, we contributed to:  (1) the theoretical validation of a multiplasmonic concentrator structure for silicon solar cells, (2) theoretical validation of all-refractive spectrum-splitting lenses that can direct light to two different solar absorbers, enabling the design of a new kind of efficient tandem solar cell, (3) a better understanding of the main computational approaches for simulating thin film devices.  The understanding developed in item 3) this project can be applicable not only to solar cells, but also to other problems that involve light trapping and light guiding, such as sensors and displays.   Broader impact:  This Delaware project trained two postdoctoral fellows in a combined computational/experimental project that built expertise in numerical analysis, computation, and optics.     This was an interdisciplinary project that crossed traditional boundaries of chemistry, engineering, and mathematics. The confluence of expertise on a common problem was especially good training for the postdocs involved, who learned techniques and ideas from their collaborators in other aspects of the projects.
