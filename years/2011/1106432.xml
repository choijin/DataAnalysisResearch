<AbstractNarration>The properties of the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the survival times of a population have been studied for a long time under the standard right censorship (RC) model, which assumes independent censoring. The independent assumption is sometimes not justified in applications.  In this project a new RC model that allows dependent censoring is introduced. The new model is more realistic in many applications including the analysis of survival times of cancer patients in a follow-up study that the investigator and his collaborators are engaged in. Under the new model, the PI plans to establish the asymptotic properties of the NPMLE of the survival function on the real line. New models that allow the dependent censoring for doubly censored data and other types of interval-censored data will also be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right censored and doubly-censored data occur frequently in industrial experiments and medical research. The new models proposed by the investigator are motivated by the needs in the cancer research in which the investigator is analyzing certain breast cancer data provided by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The results from this project will be useful in the analysis of the data from clinical trials and engineering reliability studies. The theoretical results will contritute to the advancement of the statistical theory of survival analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project leads to the findings of the two interesting results:     In this project, the PI, together with his Ph.D graduate students,  settle all the remaining open questions on the consistency and  asymptotic normality of the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator  (NPMLE) under right censoring.     Right censored data occur in medical research and industrial experiments.  The survival time is either observed exactly, or lost to follow-up, only  is known being alive at the last follow-up time. Under the non-parametric  set-up, there is no parametric assumption on the distribution of the  survival time. The distribution function is estimated by the NPMLE,  by maximizing the partial likelihood function. The estimator is   consistency  if it is getting close to the true distribution if the  number of observations is getting larger. Asymptotic normality explains  the deviation of the estimator.     In the literature, under the assumption that the censoring time and  survival time are independent, the consistency of the NPMLE is settled,  but the asymptotic normality of the NPMLE is only known for some special  cases.  The project leads to a new model for the right censoring.  The  model satisfies  the necessary and sufficient condition that the partial  likelihood is equivalent to the full liklihood.  The PI explains that  the model is also realistic in practical situation, and gives examples  in medical research.  Under this model, the PI derives the asymptotic  limit of the NPMLE on the whole real line and finds the necessary and  sufficient condition that the NPMLE is asymptotically normally distributed.     For the parallel problem under the double censoring, the PI also makes  progresses. The consistency and asymptotic normality have been  established under a new model called the dependent censorship model,  which allows the censoring vector and the survival time being dependent.
