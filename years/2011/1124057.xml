<AbstractNarration>In recent decades, the flow of legal ideas across continents and countries has intensified to such an extent that some legal scholars write of the "globalization of law." Digital forms of information storage and communication have made it cheaper and easier than ever for attorneys and judges to acquire and use legal materials from virtually anywhere in the world. Judges in numerous countries increasingly draw upon foreign and international legal materials to help them resolve questions that arise in their own national courts. This project will collect, prepare, analyze, and disseminate information on the globalization of law through national high courts. The current study will record citations to foreign and international legal materials in the decisions of about 40 constitutional or supreme courts, covering a 20-year span of time. The countries to be included represent all of the world's regions and major legal traditions. The researchers will use statistical techniques to analyze the patterns of judicial globalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will be the first systematic, international, multi-year database of citations to the full range of foreign and international legal materials. Both the data and the analyses will be freely available to legal researchers, law practitioners, and policy makers through an interactive web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project is to construct a database of citations to foreigh and international legal materials in the decisions of constitutional courts and supreme courts from a representative sample of 30 countries around the world.  The database will be the first to provide systematic, crossnational, and crosstemporal data on the role of national high courts in "globalizing" law.  The database will allow the PIs to map and to explain the transnational movement of legal ideas and norms.  The principal research activity to date has been coding decisions from the constitutional court of South Africa, the Supreme Courts of Canada, United States and Philippines, as well as the High Court of Australia.  This work was done under the direction of PI Wayne Sandholtz.  The software will extract citations to foreign courts, international courts, and international treaties.   Project researchers have coded over 1,405 cases, which have included over 23,653 citations to foreign and international legal materials in four languages; English, Spanish, French and German.  The database will be useful to attorneys and judges involved in litigating or deciding transnational disputes.  PI Wayne Sandholtz has transferred to University of Southern California, Dornsife and continued the work.  Dr Stone Sweet has transferred to the National University of Singapore.
