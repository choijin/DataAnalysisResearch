<AbstractNarration>In this project, the principal investigator and his collaborators propose to develop new methods and techniques that will provide a better understanding of the qualitative behavior of solutions of  dispersive models. These models describe relevant physical phenomena, including several arising in fluid mechanics and in wave propagation. In a multidisciplinary approach, these innovative methods will improve the design of efficient numerical tools in the study of some outstanding problems in fluids dynamics. Also, they will establish new parameters in the modeling and simulation for these types of systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve the aforementioned goals, the principal investigator and the project's other participants will continue the development of powerful analytic techniques mainly coming from harmonic analysis. While the new approaches will be focused in concrete nonlinear problems, their applicability will be broad. This is of potential interest to researchers in other disciplines. The principal investigator will disseminate his results as widely as possible through expositions at professional meetings and electronic publications. Research and education will be vigorously integrated with special efforts to promote and broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, with the active participation of undergraduates, with innovative pedagogical initiatives and modes of collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of the project  was to provide  and develop tools  for the better understanding of the qualitative behavior of solutions to several canonical non-linear dispersive models. These models arise in several physical situations, mainly in the study of wave propagation in different media. This goal was achieved by the the PI in the publications listed below.   The broader impacts of the proposed activities  included education and the integration of people from underrepresented groups. Moreover, the international nature of this effort offered a unique opportunity for all the participants, but specially the students, to work in a diverse, multicultural,and increasingly global scientific community.     The proposed research played a central role in the education and training of a new cadre of math students in applications of techniques coming mainly from harmonic analysis into problems arising in mathematical physics.  Two Ph.D. students from UCSB (Math) completed their dissertations under the umbrella of this project working directly under the supervision of the PI. They were Cynthia Flores  and Derek Smith. Ms. Flores is the first member in her family to attend college and Mr. Smith is a veteran.  From Brazil, one  Ph.D. student was involved, Gleison Do Nascimento Santos from IMPA, Rio de Janeiro (Math).The Brazilian student was supported by a fellowship from the National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) of Brazil. Also during the years of support we had the visit of some advance graduate students and post docs from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.  An important aspect of this project was an international component which will not only bring clear scientific benefits through a synergetic collaboration but also was an enriching educational and cultural experience for all the participants, particularly for our  graduate students.    During this period the PI conducted several outreach activites to broaden the participation of underrepresented students in research experiences related to the project and to encourage them to pursue a career in Math and the Sciences. The PI met few times with local high school students, mainly those with Spanish background. In these meetings  a wide range of topics covering mathematics problems, college degree, activities of a university professor, research-teaching,  etc.  were discussed. The main idea was to encourage them to attend college and to raise their interest in science.    Some funds from this grant were used to support the weekly seminar Hypethian Seminar in our Department, which main goal is to encourage the participation of women in mathematics as well as discuss their career opportunities in mathematics.
