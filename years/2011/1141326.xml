<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Erebus Bay population of Weddell seals in Antarctica?s Ross Sea is the most southerly breeding population of mammal in the world, closely associated with persistent shore-fast ice, and one that has been intensively studied since 1968. The resulting long-term database, which includes data for 20,586 marked individuals, contains detailed population information that provides an excellent opportunity to study linkages between environmental conditions and demographic processes in the Antarctic. The population?s location is of special interest as the Ross Sea is one of the most productive areas of the Southern Ocean, one of the few pristine marine environments remaining on the planet, and, in contrast to the Antarctic Peninsula and Arctic, is undergoing a gradual lengthening of the sea-ice season.&lt;br/&gt;The work to be continued here capitalizes on (1) long-term data for individual seals and their polar environment; (2) experience collecting and analyzing data from the extensive study population; and (3) recent statistical advances in hierarchical modeling that allow for rigorous treatment of individual heterogeneity (in mark-recapture and body mass data) and inclusion of diverse covariates hypothesized to explain variation in fitness components. Covariates to be considered include traits of individuals and their mothers and environmental conditions throughout life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will continue to (1) provide detailed data on known-age individuals to other science projects and (2) educate and mentor the next generation of ecologists through academic and professional training and research experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the project we monitored the status of the Weddell seal population in Erebus Bay, Antarctica and studied the lives of individuals. The population was large and highly productive during the years of study. In each year of the study, the population produced a number of pups that was well above the long-term average for 1978-present. This was in striking contrast to low production of pups during 2004 and 2005 when massive icebergs impacted the area. Our studies of the lives of individuals provide additional insights into the inner workings of the population. Each year since 1978, all pups born in the study area have been associated with their mothers, and both mothers and pups have been outfitted with small, uniquely numbered tags. By surveying all animals in the population at least 6 times each year, the study has information on the complete reproductive histories of large numbers of known-age females. During this project, we were able to determine that although the population had low production during the iceberg era, the underlying cause was that females skipped reproduction but continued to have high survival during the challenging conditions presented by the icebergs. We also learned that the rates of colony attendance by non-reproductive females varies among individuals and among years. Non-reproductive females might benefit by attending colonies by learning or finding suitable mates for future reproductive events. But, they might also have more difficulty in foraging beneath the ice sheets that are present in the pupping colonies. Females in poorer body condition might not attend the colonies and gain benefits of better foraging, which is something we plan to study in future work. We were also able to determine that females vary individually and annually in their rates of reproduction. Females typically begin reproducing at age 8 years old and breed in 2 out of every 3 years. However, we determined that rates of reproduction change with female age: they climb steadily early in a female&rsquo;s reproductive life, peak when females are in their mid-teens, and decline at older ages. We also learned that some females have much higher rates of reproduction than others and are able to produce pups repeatedly even up to age 31 years, which is the latest age ever recorded in our population. All adult females have similar and quite high survival rates, though the rates do decline some when females are in their 20s. It appears that the overall strategy of females in the population is to preserve their survival to the extent possible and to reproduce as often as possible when conditions allow them to do so without greatly impairing their survival. Weddell seal mothers raise their pups alone and rely heavily on stored body reserves to nurse their pups during the lactation period that lasts several weeks or more. We monitored body mass for a sample of ~200 mother-pup pairs soon after birth and at 2 later dates in lactation to better understand whether and how maternal allocation of nutrition to pups might vary among mothers. We learned that the youngest and oldest mothers tend to weigh less than prime-age mothers do and that the body mass of pups at birth follows a similar pattern: pups born to prime-age mothers tend to be born heavier than those of younger or older mothers. We also learned that individual females vary in terms of how much they tend to weigh and how much their pups tend to weigh such that measurements from individual mothers tend to be repeatable across years. A very strong indicator of how much a pup will weigh late in lactation is the body mass of its mother at the time she gave birth. The heaviest mothers give birth to larger pups and lose a greater proportion of their body mass during the first 35 days of lactation. Because they are losing a greater proportion of a greater mass, they are losing much more weight than are lighter mothers. Although they are not quite as efficient at converting their lost mass to mass gains in their pups, the heaviest mothers still have a strong tendency to have pups that weigh much more than the pups of lighter mothers. Such strong differences in pup body mass late in lactation when they are about to become independent from their mothers could have strong consequences with regards to how well different pups fare at surviving to adulthood and making contributions to the population in the future. Our ongoing research is focused on evaluating whether or not that is true. Our project trained 3 Ph.D. students and 1 M.S. student and provided 15 other recent university students with experience conducting Antarctic field work. Our outreach materials cataloged at WeddellSealScience.com have resulted in over 1,539,620 podcast downloads to date.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/15/2018<br>      Modified by: Jay&nbsp;J&nbsp;Rotella</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141326/1141326_10175434_1537028343978_IMG_1240--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141326/1141326_10175434_1537028343978_IMG_1240--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Weddell seal mother and pup"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141326/1141326_10175434_1537028343978_IMG_1240--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Weddell seal mother and pup"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A female Weddell seal with her young pup in front of Mount Erebus in Erebus Bay, Antarctica</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jay Rotella</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jay&nbsp;J&nbsp;Rotella</div> <div class="imageTitle">Weddell seal mother and pup</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141326/1141326_10175434_1537028596365_690A9215--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141326/1141326_10175434_1537028596365_690A9215--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Weddell seal pup"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141326/1141326_10175434_1537028596365_690A9215--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Weddell seal pup"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A young Weddell seal pup in Erebus Bay, Antarctica</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jay Rotella</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jay&nbsp;J&nbsp;Rotella</div> <div class="imageTitle">Weddell seal pup</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141326/1141326_10175434_1537029034091_DSC_0344--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141326/1141326_10175434_1537029034091_DSC_0344--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Emperor penguins and Weddell seals"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1141326/1141326_10175434_1537029034091_DSC_0344--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Emperor penguins and Weddell seals"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Emperor penguins in Weddell seal pupping colony in Erebus Bay, Antarctica</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jay Rotella</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jay&nbsp;J&nbsp;Rotella</div> <div class="imageTitle">Emperor penguins and Weddell seals</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
