<AbstractNarration>1135419&lt;br/&gt;Guldiken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) proposal, we aim to investigate a low power, biocompatible surface acoustic wave (SAW) device for detailed interrogation of plaque composition to quantify its vulnerability to rupture. This information is vital in fundamental understanding of coronary heart disease, the leading cause of mortality in developed countries. In this interdisciplinary pilot study, an interdigital transducer and sensor array platform will be explored that will make contact with the arterial wall for inspection. As the micro-device is in contact with the arterial wall, any boundary condition change (such as existence of vulnerable plaque) will alter the phase and amplitude of the received wave. This response change will be used to quantify the ?health? of the arterial wall. The proposed research in nature is "high risk-high reward" with research outcome benefiting millions of people not only in U.S., but also worldwide including medically underserved geographical areas and people at high risk for developing coronary heart disease. Also, this work may have significant impact on patient care, potentially reducing the morbidity and mortality; and may affect the U.S. economy by decreasing healthcare costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary research program will advance the fundamental knowledge on atherosclerotic plaque characterization by fundamentally investigating a low power, biocompatible surface acoustic wave (SAW) device for detailed interrogation of plaque composition to quantify its vulnerability to rupture. If successful, this work will lead to an integrated, compact, efficient and simple SAW device that is capable of accurately identifying vulnerable plaques as well as other significant applications. The significant novel items in the proposed work are 1) first time demonstration of surface acoustic wave based atherosclerotic plaque characterization; 2) a platform addressing limitations of the current state-of-the-art costly vulnerable plaque detection systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The concepts contained in this proposal are not only applicable for vulnerable plaque detection, but also for ultra-sensitive sensor technology for wide variety of applications and in mixing applications. The proposed SAW device platform may find use in new generation of high-density devices in various fields including targeted drug delivery; medical, chemical and environmental monitoring systems; medical diagnostics applications; cooling of microelectronic devices and micro-propulsion for space applications. The proposed interdisciplinary technique may also solve wide variety of important clinical problems, for instance via establishing a low powered, fully-integrated (with mixers, sensors, valves, pumps, separators, etc.) lab-on-a-chip device for disease detection in low-resource settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unrestricted access research website explaining fundamentals and broad impact of acoustic based medical devices and documenting our research progress will be established in a language suitable for broad non-technical audience. The successful graduate training grant programs in USF (NSF IGERT, NSF Bridge to the Doctorate I, II, III and Alfred P. Sloan Minority PhD) will be leveraged for bright student recruitment within minorities and females. Education will focus on a graduate/undergraduate level course "Fundamental acoustic concepts and acoustic transducers" that will be developed attracting students from several departments. Information sessions and separate PI's lab tours demonstrating basic acoustic experiments during the frequent visit from local high-schools to the state of the art Nanotechnology Research and Education Center (NREC) will enable further motivation of students to pursue higher education in STEM fields. K-12 students will also be given opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the PI's lab as a part of outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
