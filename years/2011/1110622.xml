<AbstractNarration>This research seeks to improve understanding of the physics of convergent boundary zones (CBZ), focusing on the neutral to stable boundary layer, within which CBZ's and convective initiation (CI) are poorly understood.  Two primary and closely related objectives include comprehensive investigations of:&lt;br/&gt;1. CBZ kinematics and CI during the Afternoon to Evening Transition (AET);&lt;br/&gt;2. Characteristics of CBZs (e.g., bores, gravity waves) within the stable (nocturnal) boundary layer and their impact on cloud formation and CI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves data collection, analysis, and numerical modeling activities.  A major component of this research will be accomplished by deploying a mobile X-band dual polarization radar (MAX) and a mobile profiling system (MIPS) within a meso-Gamma-scale mesonet when CBZ's are anticipated from mid-afternoon to evening.  The MIPS will be embedded within one lobe of a high-resolution dual Doppler network (18 km baseline), formed by the MAX and a fixed site C-band radar. Additional surface observations will include fixed and mobile platforms.  The research team also plans to use data from the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement-Southern Great Plains (ARM SGP) profiling site in Oklahoma, combined with multiple Doppler radar observations from a new network of radars installed around the ARM SGP central site.   Numerical simulations, designed to complement the observations, will provide additional details on boundary layer and CI processes inferred from the observations.  Results of this project will be compared to International H2O project (and other) studies, which have shown a highly 3-D structure of CBZ's within deep convective boundary layers, due to interactions of large eddies with cold front and drylines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. &lt;br/&gt;This project will provide considerable advances in our understanding of the physics of CBZ's and CI by examining these phenomena in a parameter space (neutral to stable) that has not been comprehensively explored in previous studies.  The unique feature of this project is its emphasis on the AET and nocturnal boundary layer (neutral to stable conditions).  Since the MAX and MIPS are mobile platforms, they will be utilized in a preconfigured dual Doppler network when CBZs are expected during the mid-afternoon to evening time periods.  This flexibility will provide comprehensive datasets at low cost and low risk when compared to limited duration field campaigns.  In addition, data from the ARM SGP site (northern OK) will be monitored and analyzed similarly.  Both experimental locations will provide comprehensive data from wind profilers, vertically pointing radars, balloon soundings, ground-based IR/microwave profilers, and multiple Doppler radar arrays.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. &lt;br/&gt;Improved forecasting of CI, lightning, severe weather (tornadoes), and boundary-layer atmosphere transports (air quality) represent significant societal benefits of this research.  The comprehensive nature of measurements (and the 24/7 capability) will increase probability of serendipitous scientific discoveries.  The data collected at the Huntsville and Lamont (OK) sites, and the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) instrumentation, will be utilized extensively in PI's (i) two graduate level courses, Boundary Layer Meteorology and Ground-Based Remote Sensing; and (ii) a book Ground-Based Remote Sensing.  Two UAH graduate students and one postdoctoral associate will be actively engaged in all aspects of the field campaign and subsequent modeling activities.  The UAH platforms will be made available to other UAH students who have research interests in related topics.  The project will support and utilize MIPS and MAX, the former of which has been utilized in numerous scientific projects over the last decade.  The datasets will contribute to other disciplines, such as mesoscale/microscale structure of fronts, gravity waves in the severe storms environment, boundary layer process, and properties of biological flyers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, the third Atmospheric Boundary Identification and Delineation Experiment (ABIDE-3) consisted of three general goals:  1)    Improve understanding of the changes in the boundary layer during the late afternoon to evening transition (AET).  2)    Examine changes in low-level convergence and associated development of clouds and thunderstorms during this transition period.  3)    Examine nocturnal disturbances, such as bores and wavelike phenomena and their impact on cloud development and maintenance of thunderstorms arranged in a linear configuration.  The experimental domain was centered around Huntsville, Alabama, where existing Doppler radars, and the Mobile Integrated Profiling System form a network with the capability to derive airflow in the boundary layer over a domain of about 1000 km2.  Measurements were acquired during the summer months of 2012 and 2013.  Boundary layer changes during the AET period begin with a reduction in the variability of horizontal wind and an increase in low-level humidity (mixing ratio) prior to sunset, and a minimum in vertical motion variance shortly after sunset.  This reduction in turbulence is associated with an increase in wind above the surface layer.  Case studies examining the behavior of convergent boundary zones (CBZ) such as gust fronts suggest that convergence decreases at a rate lower than expected if surface conditions were not changing during the AET period.  Convergence associated with wave-like phenomenon such as bores, which were found to develop during the AET period, tends to increase during the AET.  Overall, the physical processes associated with CBZs are complicated by the presence of both density current and bore-like flows.  Bores were found to develop under low wind shear conditions late in the AET period as a result of transformation of thunderstorm-induced gust fronts to bores.  Shallow bores associated with modest pressure increases of 0.3-0.5 mb often persisted for several hours.  One implication is that bores are more frequent than previously thought, particularly in low wind shear conditions.  Improved understanding of bores and their role in cloud formation, convective initiation, maintenance of lines of thunderstorms, and even tornadogenesis represents s fundamental challenge to represent these phenomena and their evolution in numerical weather prediction models in order to improve short-term forecasts of these important phenomena.
