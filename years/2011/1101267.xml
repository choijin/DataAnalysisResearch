<AbstractNarration>The PI will continue his investigations into the relationship between asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;conjectures in number theory and stable cohomology of moduli spaces.  The moduli spaces that arise from consideration of analytic number theory over function fields (Hurwitz spaces, moduli spaces of holomorphic rational curves on varieties) are spaces that have already attracted a great deal of attention from topologists; it turns out that topological theorems and conjectures about the rational cohomology of these spaces translates, via the Lefschetz trace formula, into very clean asymptotic formulas for things like "the average size of p-torsion in the class group of a quadratic imaginary field."  Some of these formulas agree with function-field analogues of established conjectures in number theory, and thus prove those analogues; others suggest new conjectures.  Beyond this main theme, the PI will study algebro-geometric methods for Kakeya problems, applications of expander graphs in arithmetic geometry, and the arithmetic of nilpotent quotients of fundamental groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is carrying out research at the interface between two fields that are quite different on the surface.  The first field is the classical subject of analytic number theory, whose central questions involve "counting."  For example:  what is the chance that a random number is not a multiple of any perfect square greater than 1?  The second field, much newer, is that of topology, which asks questions about abstract shapes, like curvy high-dimensional surfaces.  For instance, one can ask about the space of all sets of n different points in the plane.  It turns out, thanks to fundamental insights developed by Grothendieck in the 1960s, that topological questions about high-dimensional spaces can give us very deep insights into counting questions about whole numbers!  The PI and his collaborators are proving new topological theorems which prove some old conjectures in number theory, and suggest new conjectures; this work will help build new bridges between the two subjects.  The PI will also continue outreach work as a mathematical expositor, maintaining a popular math blog and writing articles about mathematics for national publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In "Geometric Analytic Number Theory," the PI proposed to systematically investigate an analogy between algebraic topology (the study of high-dimensional shapes) and analytic number theory (the study of numbers, their arithmetic properties, and their distribution.)  These two fields seem on their face quite different from one another, but thanks to the groundbreaking ideas of Grothendieck, they are connected under the skin.     During the grant period, I collaborated with other nmber theorists to analyze the underlying geometry of the well-known "Cohen-Lenstra conjectures," a conjecture in number theory which has stood untouched since 1980.  These conjectures turn out to be related to the geometry of variants of the "configuration space," which keeps track of all the different ways to place a set of points in a circle with no two points coinciding.     Configuration spaces also play a role in my work with the topologists Tom Church and Benson Farb, where we investigated a new form of stability called "representation stability."  The configuration spaces get more and more complicated as you put more and more points in the circle, or so it seems -- but we show that, if you express the geometry in the right mathematical language, it can really be thought of as something that "stabilizes" -- that is, as the number of points gets larger and larger, the geometry, in this new and more general sense, stays the same.  Representation stability turns out to be a ubiquitous phenomenon, arising in natural problems coming from topology, number theory, combinatorics, and algebra.  By now, the subject has grown into a small field of its own, with conferences on the topic taking place around the world.  Together with a Ph.D. student, Marton Hablicsek, I used geometric methods to analyze a question of Bourgain:  if you have N^2 lines in 3-dimensional, of which no more than N lie in any plane, and S is a set of points containing N points of each line, how small can S be?  We find that the answer to this question depends in an intricate way on the geometry of fields of "characteristic p" -- that is, number systems in which a prime number, like 2 or 5, is actually equal to 0.  During the course of the grant, three Ph.D. students completed their degrees under my supervision, and I mentored three postdoctoral fellows.  In the "broader impact" section of the proposal, I proposed to continue my work promoting pure and applied mathematics to the general public through journalism.  During the grant period, I published a book, HOW NOT TO BE WRONG, which was a New York Times bestseller; appeared on national radio programs like All Things Considered; published articles on mathematical topics in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and Slate; and gave public lectures about math around the United States and the world.
