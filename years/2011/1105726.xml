<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports Professor Raymond C. Francis at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry with this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award. He will work with Dr. Aaron Levitt, a Research Associate at Andritz, Inc. Professor Francis will work to further enhance energy recovery from pulping effluent or black liquor (BL), which contains 45-55% of the original chip mass from the pulping process and has a relatively high caloric value. Energy recovery is hampered by high sulfur content, thus, the overall aim is to further investigate the non-sulfur NaOH/anthraquinone process (soda/AQ or SAQ) and more specifically to try to understand why SAQ pulps are more difficult to bleach than kraft pulps. A detailed study of the bleachability problem has led to improvements in the SAQ process where new approaches may lead to a commercially viable process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Raymond C. Francis will demonstrate how society would benefit if more energy were to be produced from wood and other biomass (CO2-neutral sources) and by a reduction in the emission of reduced sulfur compounds into the environment. Development of new mechanisms, techniques and analytical tools that can be used by the entire scientific community is also likely to result from the research. The NSF funding would directly and indirectly help to educate and train graduate students in the critical area of process modifications to increase energy and chemical production from wood and other biomass that are abundant. Professor Francis presently supervises four PhD and one MSc students, including a black male and a female who should both graduate with PhD degrees by August 2011. He has also graduated three females with MSc degrees since May 2008 and all three have enjoyed great success since then. NSF funding would assist the university co-PI in continuing to disseminate new knowledge through publications and conferences and to attract industry support. Nine refereed publications have been achieved since the program started in March 2006 and numerous presentations have been made at International Conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CHE 1105726 &ndash; Project Outcomes Report   An Investigation of Depolymerization and Condensation Reactions of Lignin under Alkaline Conditions  Intellectual Merit: Most of the low lignin pulp (for paper and paperboard) produced in the US is derived from the kraft pulping process that uses NaOH and Na2S. The pulping effluent or black liquor (BL) typically contains 45-55% of the original chip mass and has a relatively high calorific value. Energy recovery from this BL is hampered by its high sulfur content. The aim of CHE 1105726 was to investigate the non-sulfur NaOH/anthraquinone process (soda/AQ or SAQ) and more specifically, try to understand why SAQ pulps are more difficult to bleach than kraft pulps. The scientific objective was to demonstrate whether or not lignin-carbohydrate (L-C) condensation occurs in alkaline cooking and to a greater degree in SAQ as compared to kraft.  The results obtained were quite convincing that the gluco-lignin and xylo-lignin complexes were native to the wood and accumulated in the residual lignin as alkaline cooking proceeded. The residual lignin is the fraction bound or trapped in the fiber walls or surfaces. On the other hand, the results were also convincing that the arabino-lignin complexes were formed in part by L-C condensation and the reaction rate was higher for SAQ as compared to kraft. There was accumulation of galacto-lignin complexes as both kraft and SAQ cooking proceeded.

The accumulation of galacto-lignin complexes occurred to a greater degree in SAQ as compared to kraft cooking. This was not the case for xylo-lignin and gluco-lignin complexes.   Arabino-lignin complexes were the most unreactive of the LCC to all three of the bleaching chemicals that are widely used at commercial scale, i.e. oxygen and hydrogen peroxide under alkaline conditions and chlorine dioxide under acidic conditions. Those results are described in Nicholson et al., Tappi Journal 14 (10), 663-670 (2015).   Funding from CHE 1105726 resulted in two graduates with doctoral degrees. Both graduates have worked full-time and continuously in the scientific/engineering discipline since graduation. Six refereed publications resulted from the research and a seventh manuscript is almost ready for submission. Results from the research were also presented at four (4) International Conferences. In addition to the 2 doctoral students, three undergraduate interns worked on the project. All five trainees co-authored at least one refereed publication.  Broader Impact: Society would benefit if more energy were to be produced from wood and other biomass (CO2-neutral sources) and by a reduction in the emission of reduced sulfur compounds into the environment. The proposal described the improved possibility of integrated gasification of BL and low quality biomass (LQB) from wood and agricultural wastes if the SAQ process were to be implemented.
