<AbstractNarration>This study examines the capacity within the state of Kansas to use two state data bases, Kansas Individual Data on Students (KIDS) for K-12 and Kansas State Postsecondary Database (KSPSD), to inform a discussion between K-12 education and postsecondary education faculty and policy makers about mathematics. Two years of data 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 will be used to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Examine the predictive validity of the K-12 state assessment for the placement of students in postsecondary mathematics courses;&lt;br/&gt;2. Examine the extent to which curricular expectations in a given school district match those required for placement into and success in postsecondary education;&lt;br/&gt;3. Examine the extent the analyses contribute to discussion about policy makers and stateholders in K-12 and postsecondary education.&lt;br/&gt; In addition, a case study will be used to examine the extent curricular expectations in one school district match those required for placement and success in college level mathematics. Findings from the study will be reported to state board members. Researchers from Kansas State University and the University of Missouri-Kansas City will do the analyses. Data will be analyzed from two cohorts of all of the students who attended high schools in Kansas and continued to higher education in the state. The study will produce information about the validity of the high school state assessment to predict success in higher education mathematics and what type of information is informative to policy makers. Results from the study will increase the validity of the high school assessment with the intent of increasing the proportion of students ready to take college-qualifying mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from the two aggregated databases will be analyzed using Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling (HGLM). The data sets will include student performance, demographic, high school context, teacher preparation, and student degree of participation in postsecondary education. The analysis will produce data on the relationship of grade 11 mathematics scores and post secondary institution placement scores. The case study will analyze the data for two graduating classes from one high school who enrolled immediately into the community college. This analysis will look more closely at the expectations of the high schools with what is required by higher education. Information from all of the analysis will be given to policy boards to see what is most meaningful to them and what is most useful to develop their capacity to make decisions. Evaluation will be done by a panel review and the Office of Educational Innovation and Evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opportunity to examine the specific articulation (or not) between K-12 and higher education could be influential for policy makers, the entire K-12, and higher education systems. Results have the potential to reduce inefficiencies in students' learning progression and extra monetary costs to students for these courses. The study could potentially have a very broad impact. For example, the two assessment consortia funded by Race to the Top grants are grappling with the issue of college-readiness and how to assess it. A carefully done study of this sort could affect policy decisions nation-wide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Math Matters: Transitions from K-12 to Postsecondary Education" examined the capacity of state- and district-level data to explore the relationship between K-12 math performance and math placement/success in postsecondary education.  Question #1: Do K-12 math assessments predict postsecondary math placement/success? Does this vary with student/school characteristics?  Databases from a state department of education and postsecondary education governing board were merged. Records for all students graduating from high school in 2008-2011 and continuing in postsecondary education in that state produced a dataset of 50,720 files. Major findings:  As students' performance on the K-12 math assessment increased, rates of placement in developmental math decreased and rates of success in postsecondary math increased. K-12 math assessments were more related to postsecondary math placement than postsecondary math success. Student-level Variables:    At lower levels of K-12 math performance, the probability of being placed in developmental math and not passing postsecondary math is higher for students from populations underrepresented in STEM. This difference decreased as performance on the K-12 math assessment increased. At state universities, females are more likely to be placed in developmental math. At all levels of performance on the K-12 math assessment, females are more likely to pass developmental/non-developmental math. Among students who performed at below proficient/proficient levels, those with mild/moderate disabilities were more likely to be placed in developmental math. Students with mild/moderate disabilities who performed at below or above proficient levels were less likely to pass developmental math.   School-level Variables: Proportion of students qualifying for free/reduced lunch (FRL)    At all levels of performance on the K-12 math assessment, as the percentile rank of students qualifying for FRL increased, the likelihood that the student will be placed in development math at community colleges increased. Percentile of students qualifying for FRL had a small/mixed effect on the likelihood of passing developmental/non-developmental math.     Question #2: How do student math course-taking patterns/performance in high school math compare to developmental math placement/success in postsecondary math?  Data collected from 1,532 high school (HS) graduates in 2008/9 who subsequently enrolled at a local community college (CC) included highest HS math course taken, HS math grade point average (GPA) and performance on the K-12 math assessment. Students' math placement at the CC was based on ACT or COMPASS math score. Major findings:  HS math course completion matters: Fifty-three percent of the students were placed in developmental math at the CC, including 90% of those who did not complete at least College Algebra, 28% of those who completed College Algebra, and 8% of those who completed calculus in high school. HS math achievement matters:    Students with lower HS math GPAs and lower performance on the K-12 math assessment were more apt to be placed in developmental math regardless of the highest level of HS math completed. Only 54% of students passed their CC developmental math course; HS math GPA was the strongest predictor of passing. Of those who completed college-level math in HS and took college-level math at the CC, 84% passed. Passing students had higher HS math GPAs than non-passing students.     Question #3: How do education policymakers and postsecondary mathematics faculty interpret the actual placement/success rates as well as the variables affecting the probabilities of math placement/success? Major findings:  The extent to which K-12 math assessments was consistent with developmental math placement/success in postsecondary math was surprising. Controlling for performance on the K-12 math assessment, the higher developmental math placement rates at CC were concerning. Gender differences in the probability of being placed in developmental math/succeeding in postsecondary math were explained in terms of social patterns. Differences based on race/ethnicity and mild/moderate disability were concerning. Performance on the K-12 math assessment is consistent with developmental math placement and success in postsecondary math, but use of K-12 assessments for math placement decisions in postsecondary education is not feasible. Two factors - number of students for whom math assessment information would not be available (non-traditional students and out-of-state/international students) and timing of the K-12 math assessment (Grade 10) - limits its usefulness for this purpose.   Intellectual Merit: This study addressed a barrier experienced by students moving from K-12 into postsecondary education. The variables identified - institutional (community colleges/state universities), student (race/ethnicity, gender, mild/moderate disability), and high school (percentage of students qualifying for free/reduced lunch) - provide a basis for discussions on increasing the coherence of K-16 education. This study could be duplicated in other states.  Broader Impacts: Given workforce needs for students with postsecondary education credentials and the certain continued administration of state mathematics assessments, we might augment the STEM workforce pipeline and diversity by increasing the number of students taking advanced math in high school and decreasing the impact of the variables identified in this study on postsecondary math placement/success.
