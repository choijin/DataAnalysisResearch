<AbstractNarration>This study addresses the engagement of organizations with policy processes in the U.S. Congress.  Organizations are often assumed to be influential but the nature of the influence has not been fully specified.  In this project, the interdisciplinary team of Principal Investigators from computer and information science and political science will develop a model of organization influence on legislative outcomes.  This study will use comprehensive reports of engagement activities from the U.S. Senate Office of Public Records to evaluate the timing and impact of engagement. The computer and information scientists will collaborate with the political scientists to develop, enhance, and analyze this comprehensive time series data.  This includes building a database system for engagement activities, merging theat data with other sources of information on organizations and issues, coding bills and issues using software designed to classify digitized text, and establishing organization policy preferences using social network analysis techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will model the behavior of a variety of organizational types including corporations, trade associations, professional associations, and nonprofit organizations within a shared organizational field.  The research will contrast theories of isomorphism among organizations with theories of resource dependence to highlight similarities and differences in organization behavior and influence.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the project will establish an interdisciplinary collaboration and apply information science methodologies to the study of policy processes and will, more broadly, integrate computer and information sciences into social science research.  In addition, one of the products of the study will be a comprehensive database available to other researchers to address questions of policy development within the executive branch, the development of important pieces of legislation, and the processes associated with major policy outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project had three major goals:  To create a      relational database on lobbying disclosure that is easily queried and      accessible to researchers; To study why      interest groups mobilize to lobby the U.S. Congress; and To study the      influence that differentially mobilized interest groups have on the policy      agenda within Congress.   An object-relational database was built for lobbying information that integrates databases maintained separately by the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. This lobbying database is complete through 2014.  A multi-label multi-classification predictor was built to predict the code(s) for specific issues, using (a) the definitions in the Topics Codebook: Policy Agenda Project 2013; (b) the general code applied when lobbying forms and reports are submitted to either the House of Representatives or the Senate; and (c) the words in the specific issue itself. The overall prediction accuracy is &gt;86%, outperforming general state-of-the-art text classification algorithms.  The object-relational database developed through this project provides greater transparency to how lobbying influences federal legislation.  In particular, the computer-automated technique developed to code specific issues provides a way to show how lobbyists and their employers attempt to influence legislators and members of the executive branch on various policy issues.  By disambiguating corporate names, we make it easy to track lobbying across legislative sessions and across the House of Representatives and the Senate.  This project bridges the interests of social and organizational science (SOS) with computer science (CS), but based on the aims of the project, it should have the most significant impact on social and organizational science.  Impact on SOS: Specifically, the object-relational database for lobbying information integrates databases maintained separately by the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives.  This database will allow social and organizational scientists an easy way to examine lobbying across both arms of Congress.  Moreover, researchers will also have access to the multi-label multi-classification predictor that predicts specific issues codes based on the Topics Codebook: Policy Agenda Project 2013.  Together, these two contributions should enable rapid and focused research on policy issues and lobbying, helping to create a more transparent understanding of the influence of lobbying on federal legislation and regulation.  Impact on CS: This project helped further the understanding of real-world challenges faced by automated text mining and text classification for a multi-labeled dataset. Specifically, the project facilitated the development of new algorithms that can be applied to such datasets with more robust response to noise and mis-labeling.  To date, four conference publications and one book chapter resulted from this project, including one tier-1 information science conference with an acceptance rate of 25% (in 2015):  1.
