<AbstractNarration>Brassinosteroids are important plant hormones that promote plant growth and enhance plant resistance to a variety of environmental stresses by increasing or decreasing the expression of hundreds, if not thousands of plant genes.  This project uses a combinatory approach of biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, genomics, and genetics to investigate the biological functions of a small family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors in regulating the expression of some of these growth-related genes.  It also studies how the gene-regulatory activities of these transcription factors themselves are controlled by protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interaction.  The successful completion of this project will significantly enhance our understanding of the gene regulatory mechanisms of the plant steroid hormones to stimulate growth and could lead to better strategies to increase grain yield in crop plants and biomass production in biofuel feedstocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide excellent training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral research fellow to gain significant research experience and to develop their ability to critically analyze experimental data, formulate testable hypothesis, and solve scientific problems.  It will also contribute to the University of Michigan's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program and Summer Research Opportunity Program that specifically recruits outstanding underrepresented undergraduates into research laboratories.  This project will integrate the proposed research activities with an Introductory Plant Biology course and will generate exciting experimental data that will be discussed with students of a Plant Physiology course.  The successful execution of the proposed project will create interesting mutant or transgenic plants that can be used as teaching materials for science education at local public schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Brassinosteroids are a special class of plant hormones that regulate many different physiological processes during the entire life cycle of a plant via controlling the expression of thousands of different plant genes.  The completion of this NSF-funded research project revealed a novel mechanism by which the plant steroid hormones regulate the activities of several closely-related transcriptional factors known as basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, which are responsible for controlling the expression of hundreds if not thousands, of plant genes crucial for plant growth and development.   Given the importance of the plant steroid hormones in regulating plant growth and development, the knowledge gained from this NSF-funded investigation could lead to a novel strategy for increasing biomass production in biofuel feedstocks and for increasing grain yield in staple food crops without overproducing the plant steroids.  In addition, this NSF-funded study has generated many useful biological reagents that could be used by other plant biologists to make additional discoveries on the impact of the plant steroid hormones on plant growth.  The generated plant materials could also be used as teaching materials for science education at local public school and for plant biology-related courses in colleges and universities.  More importantly, this NSF-funded project has provided outstanding training opportunities for high school/undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral research fellows, and visiting scientists to develop their ability to critically analyze experimental data, formulate testable hypothesis, and solve scientific problems.
