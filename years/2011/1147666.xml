<AbstractNarration>Recent studies have revealed significant warming of lakes throughout the world, but scientists are just beginning to understand the global extent, regional patterns, causes, and ecological consequences of lake warming. The Global Lake Temperature Collaboration (GLTC) was established in 2010 to coordinate activities of an international group of investigators with access to global lake temperature records. The GLTC, now comprised of more than 50 investigators, will hold a workshop to bring participants to a common location to synthesize temperature data collected at lakes and by satellites into a global database, assess the causes and ecological implications of the observed changes in lake temperature, identify directions for future research, and develop plans for data management and education and outreach. Specific research topics that will be addressed at the workshop will include temperature trends and how they vary around the globe, climatic and geographic factors that may influence temperature trends, comparability of temperature trends in surface and deeper waters, and likely ecological consequences of observed changes in lake temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the workshop will include the development of international collaborations, enhancement of infrastructure for research and education by creating a unified database of lake temperature data, integration of research and education through student interaction and curriculum development, and dissemination of workshop results and data through publications, conferences, a project website, and education and outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is now recognized that global and regional climate change has &ndash; and continues to have &ndash; significant impacts on water resources and aquatic ecosystems. Recent studies, for example, have shown that many lakes and reservoirs throughout the world are warming rapidly, in some cases even more rapidly than the local air temperature. These large changes in water temperature have important implications for physical lake processes such as evaporation and vertical mixing, which can also impact water levels, biological productivity, and other aspects of lake ecology.  Given these recent findings, it is important that the scientific community continue to closely monitor changes in water temperature of lakes and reservoirs throughout the world. Doing so, however, requires a coordinated, global effort that combines the "best of both worlds" from both satellite and field-based "in situ" measurements. This combined approach allows for broad coverage of the worldÆs largest lakes (from satellite), while at the same time providing ground-based validation in the field. The in situ measurements also provide information on smaller lakes, water temperature data below the lake surface, and records that often go back further in time than the satellite data.  It is with these broad goals in mind that the Global Lake Temperature Collaboration (GLTC; http://laketemperature.org/) began in the fall of 2010 to establish an international group of investigators with interest in and access to global lake temperature records.
