<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Scott Rychnovsky of the Department of Chemistry at University of California Irvine will develop a new strategy to assign the configuration of optically pure amines and alcohols.  The strategy uses kinetic resolution catalysts and reagents, which are reactive compounds that are known to react faster with one mirror image of a molecule than the other.  Reactions will be investigated with amines and alcohols to identify structural features that correlate with rate differences between mirror-image (enantiomeric) molecules.  Understanding of the relationship between structure and rate could lead to a general tool to predict the absolute configuration of molecules based on the rates of reaction with benchmark reagents.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amines and alcohols are very common structural elements in biologically active natural products and in new pharmaceutical agents.  Assigning the complete three-dimensional structure to these molecules is the first step in understanding their activity.  This project will facilitate research in many fields related to chemistry including pharmaceutical development, agricultural chemistry, medicinal chemistry and natural product isolation and structure assignment. The project will be developed with the participation of a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project was to develop new tools for determining the absolute configuration of molecules. Many molecules can exist in a right-handed or left-handed forms, and these two different forms have different properties.  (Molecules that have this property are called chiral.) Often pharmaceutical agents exist in these two forms, where the left-handed form may be active and the right-handed form may lead to side effects.  Identifying absolute configuration is essential to understanding the structure and properties of molecules, and is a necessary step in pharmaceutical research.     The new strategy we have developed is the Competing Enantioselective Conversion (CEC) method.  In this method, the enantiopure target molecule will be reacted with left-handed and right-handed forms of a chiral reagent.    The fast-reacting form will be identified and comparisons with benchmark compounds will allow the unknown configuration (handedness) of the target molecule to be assigned.  Learning which reaction is faster is accomplished by an analytical method to assess the amount of product formed in the two reactions.  Three different analytical methods have been use in our CEC methods: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Electrospray Mass Spectroscopy, and Thin Layer Chromatography.  The latter two methods are more sensitive than the former, and this advantage was exploited to improve the sensitivity of the analysis. The CEC method is an improvement over classic methods for absolute configuration assignment, both in terms of time required and the simplicity of the analysis. The new CEC method is very sensitive, and can be used to determine the configuration of a few micrograms of an alcohol or an amine.  This level of sensitivity is a dramatic improvement over other methods used to assign configuration.     The Competing Enantioselective Conversion method is relatively simple to perform, and it has been developed into a laboratory experiment for the introductory organic chemistry course at UC Irvine.  Over 3000 students have performed this lab, and the vast majority of there were able to identify the correct configuration of their test alcohol.  The details of this experiment have been published, and other universities are beginning to make use of it.  It provides an excellent starting point to explain the concept of chirality (handedness) and teach students how the handedness of molecules affects their properties.  In this way, the laboratory experiment give students a direct demonstration of the effect of chirality and serves to popularize science          Last Modified: 04/08/2016       Submitted by: James S Nowick]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
