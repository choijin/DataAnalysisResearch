<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative research is to provide much needed experimental data and effective modeling approaches for the disproportionate collapse analysis of older reinforced concrete flat-plate buildings that are commonly used for large residential and office complexes. Experimental and analytical studies will be conducted to examine the performance of such flat-plate structures under the scenario of a sudden loss of a column during an extreme loading event. The experiments will be performed on laterally restrained slab-column connections under static and dynamic loading and multi-panel specimens subjected to sudden load release. The tests will be conducted to provide data to define key parameters needed for analytical modeling, to identify the local strength and deformation capacity of the flat-plate systems, and to study the post-punching behavior of slab-column connections. Finite element simulations will be employed to facilitate the design of experiments, to determine local deformation demands, to define failure propagation characteristics, and to examine the effects of other design parameters not considered in the experiments. Simplified analytical tools will also be developed for quick evaluation of the progressive collapse resilience of flat-plate buildings without conducting a detailed finite element analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this project will lead to improved design guidelines for safer flat-plate buildings under extreme loading events. The data obtained from this study will also help in the development of appropriate rehabilitation approaches for flat-plate structures that are vulnerable to disproportionate collapse. Research findings will be disseminated to the structural engineering community through publications, presentations, and websites created for this project. High school students and undergraduate students will be engaged in this project to enhance their research interests in engineering. Research results will be integrated into the graduate level courses related to slab structures, and the project will provide advanced training to graduate student through their involvement in the project research activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project is to provide urgently-needed experimental data and effective modeling approaches for the disproportionate collapse of older reinforced concrete flat-plate buildings. There is a large inventory of flat-plate buildings used as apartment, hotel, office, hospital, or classroom buildings in the U.S. These older flat plates are among the structural systems most vulnerable to catastrophic disproportionate collapse due to the lack of continuity of slab bottom reinforcement at columns needed to ensure structural integrity. The keystone of the research is examining the performance of older flat-plates experiencing the sudden loss of a bearing column, a loading scenario not considered in the current design practice but used to represent low-probability, high-consequence events.

The tests also showed that residual load-carrying capacity is available following a punching failure and the post-punching capacity is about 50% of the punching failure load. The tests conducted on multi-panel specimens indicated that, if gravity load intensity is greater than approximately 50% of the design load capacity, a progressive collapse may result from instantaneous column removal. Compression membrane forces were evidenced by the slab expansion and strains....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
