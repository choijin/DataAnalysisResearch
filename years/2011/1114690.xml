<AbstractNarration>SPYHOUNDS is a new transmedia learning experience for 6- to10-year old children.  SPYHOUNDS represents an effort to extend the value of the successful TV series FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman by moving to a new media platform and revamping the storyline. The popular character Ruff Ruffman becomes a super spy through  top-secret missions.  Ruff needs help (both on and offline) from kids at home, who become the spyhounds.  Each mission is designed to have kids watch new animation, complete online activities designed to promote STEM exploration, and participate in offline activities that require kids to investigate real world phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pathways grant provides development support to fund a pilot phase of the project. The STEM content in the pilot phase will focus on physical science.  Deliverables will include 3 x 60-second mini animated episodes, 3 interactive games rolling out over a 6-week period, 6 x 60-second audio updates from Ruff, daily in-character blog updates as Ruff plays out the mission, offline decoding activities supported by video clips, daily social media updates through Facebook and Twitter, editorial staff reviewing/posting user generated content, and Web-based survey data.  WGBH and Concord Evaluation Group will conduct formative and summative evaluation using a wide array of success metric and analytics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the project design is rooted in an evidence-based curriculum and lessons learned from prior work, the Spyhounds concept offers a new educational media model. The pilot phase supported by this grant will help inform the future development of a year-long effort.  The project's goal is help audience members develop understanding of science and math concepts, enhance problem-solving skills, and expand their understanding of how science and math are used in the real world.  Spyhounds has potential to contribute to theory development, especially as it evaluates how young audiences take information learned online and apply it in the real world.</AbstractNarration>

The SPYHOUNDS project was supported by an NSF Pathways grant that funded the following major accomplishments:     1. Development of a new format for children's STEM learning  Children today are more media-savvy than ever, and their habits are evolving quickly. Our intent with SPYHOUNDS was to create a new web format that would take advantage of what children love about media and combine it with what we know to be beneficial to serious STEM learning.     In developing the SPYHOUNDS format, we first developed an underlying curriculum that fleshed out our science and math goals.

Evaluation of the SPYHOUNDS pilot as a viable format for children's STEM learning  SPYHOUNDS launched on November 28, 2011. It was "live" for four weeks (meaning new content was rolled out daily) and the entire site remains fully accessible online. During its first five weeks, SPYHOUNDS proved itself to be extremely popular with children &ndash; the website received over 4 million pageviews, and kids submitted 146,000 drawings and 55,000 messages to Ruff detailing their ideas and experiments.     Outside evaluation by Concord Evaluation Group (CEG) provided additional evidence for SPYHOUNDS's success. CEG analyzing pre- and post-test data from 115 kids in 21 states who followed along with the SPYHOUNDS site for the full four-...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
