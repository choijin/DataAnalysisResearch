<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;08 August 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1119737&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON)&lt;br/&gt;PI:   J. Malbrough&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  D. Guidry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support item for the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) for use aboard the R/V PELICAN; namely a new side A-frame.  This item will enhance safety and provide greatly enhanced support capabilities to science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The R/V PELICAN supports federally funded scientific research in the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, educational cruises, and involvement in the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center which is an intern-based training program for marine technicians.  PELICAN also provided significant federal agency science support following the Deep Water Horizon disaster in 2010.</AbstractNarration>

As directed in the award, Naval architects at Arthur Darden &amp; Associates completed the design and engineering of the A-frame and Quality Shipyard in Houma, Louisiana conducted the fabrication and installation.  The new A-Frame was marked "Suitable for Cable Breaking Strength up to 11,600 lbs., per 46 CFR 189.35-9."  The total cost of this project which included design, engineering, fabrication and installation was $46,000. All funds have been expended and all work is complete.
