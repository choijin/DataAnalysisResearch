<AbstractNarration>Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer homology are powerful invariants for knots and three-manifolds, which were discovered around the year 2000, and which have since stirred a tremendous amount of research activity. In particular, both Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer homology have been used to give new proofs of the topological Milnor conjecture and of the existence of exotic smooth structures on the open four-ball. Previously, such results had only been accessible via gauge theory. While Khovanov homology is defined combinatorially, via a construction which is motivated by the representation theory of quantum groups, Heegaard Floer homology is defined analytically, through moduli spaces of solutions of differential equations. Around 2008, Heegaard Floer homology was extended to an invariant for three-manifolds with non-empty boundary, called "bordered Floer homology", which can be used to compute Heegaard Floer homology combinatorially whenever a decomposition of a three-manifold into suitable smaller pieces is given. A main goal of this project is to study the relationship between bordered Floer homology and Khovanov homology for tangles. Comparing these two theories will expectedly shed more light on the geometric content of Khovanov homology and thus make Khovanov homology more suited to applications. Moreover, the envisioned relationship between bordered Floer homology and Khovanov homology will provide an example of a perhaps more general connection between symplectic geometry and representation theory. Other goals of this project are to develop new homology theories for contact three-manifolds, and to analyze the properties of Khovanov homology groups of n-cables of knots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians have long been interested in classifying topological spaces that are locally three-dimensional (like our physical universe) or locally four-dimensional (like four-dimensional space-time). Related to the problem of classifying such spaces is the problem of classifying knotted loops embedded in a given three-dimensional space. Over the past two decades, mathematicians have used ideas coming from several different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics (in particular from symplectic geometry, quantum field theory, string theory, and loop quantum gravity) to develop powerful new tools for classifying knots and low-dimensional spaces. The most notable ones among these new tools are Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer homology. This proposal aims to investigate the connections between certain generalizations of Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer homology, and to use these connections to study knot theoretical problems. Mathematical knot theory has applications in biomedical research, where it is used to study the processes that are responsible for unraveling DNA strands during cell division. Thus, this project is important not only from a theoretical perspective, but also for its potential applications to biomedical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Low-dimensional topology studies certain low-dimensional spaces known as "manifolds". By definition, an n-dimensional manifold (short: n-manifold) is a space which locally looks like a standard n-dimensional vector space. For example, the surface of the earth can be viewed as a 2-manifold, since it locally looks like a 2-dimensional plane, even though its global shape is that of a sphere.  Besides low-dimensional spaces, low-dimensional topology also studies 1-dimensional knotted objects, which go by the names "braids", "knots", "links", and "tangles". These objects can be thought of as (collections of) knotted loops and strings contained within a 3-dimensional manifold.  To analyze the properties of a space, topologists aim to find so-called "invariants". These are quantities which capture information about the global structure of a space, and which, at the same time, remain unchanged when the space undergoes minor local deformations. The present project has been focused on two such invariants: Khovanov homology, an algebraically defined invariant for knots and links in the standard 3-dimensional space; and Heegaard Floer homology, an invariant for 3-manifolds, which is defined analytically through spaces of solutions of differential equations.  In joint work with Grigsby, the PI used Khovanov homology to prove an elementary fact about unlinked braid closures. Moreover, a similar argument involving Heegaard Floer homology was used to prove a result about fibered links in certain 3-manifolds.  In joint work with Doig, the PI used Heegaard Floer homology to prove a classification resutl for certain 3-manifold known as "lens spaces". Roughly speaking, this result says that if two lens spaces can be connected by a 4-manifold known as a homology cobordism, then they must be topologoically equivalent. Although this result had been known before, the proof given by Doig and the PI is new, and can potentientally be extended to larger classes of 3-manifolds, whose classification up to homology cobordism is yet unknown.  In joint work with Auroux and Grigsby, the PI proved a relationship between two different invariants for knots and links contained in a thickened annulus. The first of these invariants is a direct summand of so-called "annular Khovanov homology", and the second invariant is defined in terms of the Hochschild homology of a braid invariant discovered by Khovanov and Seidel. Using different methods, Beliakova, Putyra, and the PI subsequently proved a more general relationship between the full annular Khovanov homology and a tangle invariant defined by Chen and Khovanov.  In joint work with Grigsby and Licata, the PI discovered (previously unknown) symmetries on annular Khovanov homology.

In the case where the annular link consists of n parallel components, there are additional symmetries coming from permutations of the link components.

Understanding colored Khovanov homology seems to be a vital step in the direction of extending Khovanov homology to an invariant for 3-manifolds.  In joint work with Beliakova and Putyra, the PI further constructed a deformation of annular Khovanov homology, whose symmetries are goverened by an action of the quantum group associated to sl(2).
