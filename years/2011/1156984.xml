<AbstractNarration>Global climate change and associated impacts on our national inland waters have led to new pressures for better land and water resource management. This is true to an even greater extent on native reservations, which deal with complicated resource management issues and lack young native scientists to meet current needs.  A better understanding of biological, chemical, ecological and physical processes is needed to form a solid foundation for predictive approaches to resource management.  The Research Experience for Undergraduates Site on Sustainable Land and Water Resources will engage 14 undergraduate students per year for three years in the key elements of sustainable land and water resources research that are essential to improving management practices.  Resource management is interdisciplinary in nature requiring knowledge of biological, chemical, ecological and physical processes that continuously shape and alter the Earth's near-surface environment.  Improving resource management practices is socially relevant and of acknowledged national importance. Students in this REU program will be engaged in research projects that have immediate social relevance to US communities, including native reservations. Students will work on one of three teams on projects that integrate Earth-surface dynamics, ecology, geology, hydrology, neolimnology (study of inland waters) and paleolimnology principles and techniques.  The program takes an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach that emphasizes quantitative and predictive methods. One team will focus on an experimental approach to one of two problems at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory: (1) improving stream restoration practices for ecosystem health and fish habitat or (2) debris flow hazards; one team will examine the effects of surface water management practice on groundwater resources in Montana; and one team will investigate past and present habitat conditions of wild rice lakes in northern Minnesota. An All-Team Gathering at the conclusion of the program will expose all students to an ethics program that considers student research in the context of the community and students will present their research to a large group of faculty and students.</AbstractNarration>

These very diverse teams had 74% of participants from groups underrepresented in STEM.  Many of the students were nontraditional students, and about a third were parents.  About half of the students were Native American.  Research took place on two Native reservations (Flathead Reservation, Polson Montana and Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior, Chippewa) and many of the research projects were related to traditional native food sources.  Employees of the tribes' Resource Management Divisions participated in the REU.  A third team did research at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory on the University of Minnesota.    Participants completed research papers and posters.  Research was presented at conferences as varied at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting, the American Indian Science and Engineering Society Meeting, the Nibi and Manoomin Symposium Building Lasting Relations, and the Geoscience Alliance Conference on A Changing Climate's Affects on Rivers, Estuaries, Oceans, First Foods, and Tribal Health.  Intellectual merit:  Research related to barriers to STEM participation by underrepresented groups has been conducted and presented in national meetings and in the AGU Monograph:  Future Earth:  Advancing Civic Understanding of the Anthropocene.  Results from reports by our external evaluator, Emily Geraghty Ward, Rocky Mountain College, indicate the following: Nearly all of the students at the different REU sites (Team Stream, Team Zaaga'igan, and Team SPAW) had the opportunity to participate in the entire research process: identifying a research question to pursue, designing experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and reporting their results. Students mentioned that being involved with each step in the research process gave them more ownership of the project and gave them a feel for what graduate research would be like in the future. Many students indicated that the REU experience helped "refine" their research interests by helping them decide to pursue future research in a particular field. There was sustained interest in graduate school after the REU program. Over 80% of participants "will definitely" and "will probably" attend grad school. Over half of the participants felt "very comfortable" with collecting data in a lab setting and designing a poster. Nearly half of the participants felt very comfortable conducting a literature review, which is significant given that before the REU experience only 32% of students had helped with a lit review for research.

After the REU experience, about half of the students indicated interest in the Hydrology career field, with Conservation Scientist, Environmental, Environmental Scientist, Geoscientist and Geographer garnering interest from students as well. There was a marked increase from pre- to post-survey in hydrology as a career interest (from 45% to just over 65%). Increases were also seen in the areas of conservation and environmental science, geoscience and atmospheric scientist. Environmental engineering also...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
