<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in Physics at William Marsh Rice University.   The award will support students for ten weeks of summer research in topics potentially including chemistry, physics, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, materials science, and bioengineering. Each student becomes involved in cutting-edge research by joining an individual research group and working with graduate students, postdocs and faculty supervisors. The students will form a cohesive group through joint housing, weekly interdisciplinary scientific seminars, and weekly social activities. These activities also include laboratory safety training and participation in an online course in ethical and responsible scientific conduct. In mid-session, the students will present brief computer presentations of their work to each other and the PI. In the seventh week, students will construct abstracts for their projects. During the last week students will turn in written reports, design and assemble poster presentations on their research, then present their posters alongside the other undergraduate participants in an extremely well-attended session of the Annual RQI Colloquium. There will also be a lunch meeting with faculty from various disciplines to discuss strategies for graduate school, the admissions process, and other professional/technical career options.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The reason why University education is called "higher", is that it is indeed special: University teachers do not simply pass along a knowledge that they have learnt. They also contribute to creating that knowledge. The process by which knowledge is created is what we call "research".   Rice University is a research academic institution with a distinct undergraduate focus. It is therefore the ideal hosting place for an REU program meant to give highly motivated students the opportunity of "getting their hands dirty" in a real research environment. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the program provides stipends, housing and travel expense reimbursement for the participants. The financial support enables the students to spend much of their summer focused on research and interacting with different research groups.   The supervision of the REU program was entrusted to the Rice Quantum Institute. In 2015, the last year of the program, Rice University merged the Rice Quantum Institute (RQI) and the Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology (SI) to form the Smalley-Curl Institute (SCI).

It is within this multi- and inter-disciplinary framework that this REU program has continued the successful training of undergraduate students during the summer.  The REU program we could offer our students is a very broad one, spanning a wide range of thematic research topics.  Rice University is a world leader in the fields of advanced materials, plasmonics and nanophotonics, carbon nanotechnology, biophysics and bioengineering, advanced materials, ultracold atom physics, quantum magnetism, condensed matter and chemical physics, and all aspects of nanoscience and nanotechnology. It is in this dynamic, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary environment that our undergraduates have had one of their first opportunities to participate in research.  The program concludes each year with the annual Summer Research Colloquium and Poster Session  that includes the REU participants as well as Applied Physics graduate students.  All of the undergraduates present a poster that summarizes their summer work. The Colloquium has grown from a few tens of attendees in 1979 to more than 300 registered participants in 2015. It is a full-fledged conference, attended by all REU-related faculty and students as well as by people outside of Rice, coming from exciting places such as NASA, HoustonÆs corporate sector and the Texas Medical Center.

We have definitely been succesfull in increasing women participation from 10% in 2012 up to 50% in 2015.  In the 4 years of the program, our students have disseminated their work in 8 articles and conference proceedings. Utlimately, though, the purpose of all REU programs is to help undergraduate students to identify career paths in science and engineering and to encourage them to enroll in graduate programs.
