<AbstractNarration>The University of California-San Diego is a premier research university with a focus on the STEM disciplines.  In the current proposed project, the institution seeks to implement a multi-pronged approach toward a longitudinal social science study that will identify and analyze mechanism of cumulative disadvantage for women, minorities and LGBT faculty in the STEM fields.  The two primary research questions include a focus on the disproportionate cumulative disadvantage of special populations of STEM faculty and on means by which disadvantages at the discipline, department and individual levels lead to disparities in career outcomes.  Specific methodological tools that will be used to facilitate this project are longitudinal panel surveys, longitudinal salary analyses, salary and productivity analyses and interviews with various faculty from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will study the specific mechanisms of cumulative disadvantage for women, URM, and LGBT faculty across a four-year period with the goal of identifying individual, departmental, and disciplinary factors that influence a host of outcome variables (e.g., pay, productivity, advancement).  The concept of cumulative disadvantage has been studied with computer simulations and qualitatively, but this proposed project represents the first, primarily quantitative investigation of an issue central to understanding the circumstances of various faculty groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;The University of California-San Diego project proposes to examine the impact of cumulative disadvantage for women, underrepresented minorities and LGBT faculty in the academic STEM disciplines that results in disparities in career outcomes.  As such, the project will have a broad impact on special populations of women faculty who have been largely underserved by the ADVANCE community.  This study represents the first of its kind and, if successful will contribute tremendously to advancing current knowledge regarding the underrepresentation of women faculty from a broad range of perspectives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, led by PI Mary Blair-Loy and Co-PIs Erin Cech and Jeanne Ferrante, examines the cultural definition of scientific merit and its consequences for inequality in academic STEM.  It studies the case of STEM faculty in a top public research university.  This university lauds its fairness in rewarding the best faculty.  It provides an exemplar case to examine whether and how unequal outcomes occur alongside the university?s commitments to objectivity and excellence.  The researchers find that cultural understandings of scientific merit create barriers to fairly evaluating faculty who are underrepresented racial minorities, LGBT, and/or women.    The research team conducted surveys and interviews, and constructed a database of scholarly productivity.  The project asks:  How can academic science, which values meritocracy and objectivity, produce unequal outcomes, including the underrepresentation and devaluation of many women, sexual minorities, and racial minorities?  In a forthcoming book, Blair-Loy and Cech answer this question by examining the definitions of merit within academic STEM professional culture.[i]  They analyze the content of academic STEM culture as cultural schemas.  Cultural schemas are shared, taken-for-granted understandings that justify organizational policies and resource distribution.  The book analyzes two schemas that shape scientists? definitions of merit:  work devotion and scientific excellence.  The work devotion schema is a cultural mandate that defines work as a calling deserving of single-minded commitment.  It defines merit as expressing unwavering dedication to one?s profession above all other commitments, including family caregiving.  The authors find negative consequences for faculty who are seen as not measuring up to the schemas of work devotion.  Mothers of young children are often stigmatized, even though mothers? actual scholarly productivity is similar to others?.  Further, mothers are often paid less than similar colleagues with the same scholarly productivity.   The schema of scientific excellence defines certain characteristics as markers of excellence.  The highest valuation goes to faculty who seem to have creative brilliance and assertive self-promotion.  Interpersonal skills are also valued.  The least valued characteristics are caring about improving society and promoting diversity.  These markers are cultural beliefs, not objective judgments of performance.  The authors find that professors who regard themselves as assertive and self-promoting are not, in fact, more productive than similar colleagues with less assertive self-conceptions.  Yet there are negative consequences for faculty who are not seen as measuring up to this schema of scientific excellence.  Broader social biases that assume that heterosexual white men are generally more creatively brilliant and assertive translate into higher rewards for these men, on average, compared to other colleagues.  In contrast, women of color, are penalized for assertiveness.  Skills in interpersonal relationships generally benefit men but penalize women.  Finally, we find barriers for LGBT faculty, who report being less respected and less included, in part because their colleagues see LGBT identity as politicizing research.  Additionally, research articles trace broader negative consequences of these cultural schemas for science.  Flexibility stigma is one harsh consequence for faculty who are seen to violate the work devotion schema.[ii]  Cech and Blair-Loy find that professors who report flexibility stigma in their department&mdash;regardless of their family status -- are less satisfied at work and less likely to want to stay. The flexibility stigma thereby affects entire departments, parents and non-parents alike.  Further, Cech, Blair-Loy and Rogers show that the recognition of chilly workplace climates does not simply emerge from personal experiences of marginalization.[iii]  Across different demographic groups and different experiences, professors who are aware of systematic disadvantages for women and racial minorities are more likely than colleagues without that awareness to recognize chilly climates that negatively affect women and minorities.    Intellectual Merit  The project shows how social biases are built into definitions of scientific merit.  Despite beliefs that the assessment of merit is race- and gender-blind, schemas of scientific excellence and work devotion generally give white, heterosexual men more credit, while creating barriers to fairly evaluating other faculty with the same credentials. More broadly, this project shows that cultural beliefs about excellence and worthiness can create and reinforce inequalities.  Broader Impacts  Understanding these dynamics can lead to transformation. This research shows that knowledge of structural barriers is linked to an awareness that climates can be unwelcoming to underrepresented scientists.  Awareness is a first step toward change.  Second, research findings empowered leaders at the focal campus to reshape family accommodation policies in ways that are less stigmatizing; these new policies help define family caregiving across the generations as a legitimate part of the lives of women and men scientists.
