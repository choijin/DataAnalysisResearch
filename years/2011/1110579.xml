<AbstractNarration>This project will combine innovative sampling techniques to trace evolutionary patterns of dinosaur diets and habitats. Combining methods of measuring wear patterns and determining the chemical composition of dinosaur teeth can help determine where these animals were living and what they were eating. The two objectives of this project are to examine the dietary evolution of a group of herbivorous dinosaurs called neoceratopsian, and to identify dietary variation in a growth series of protoceratopsian dinosaurs. The goal of this study is to quantify the diets of extinct herbivorous dinosaurs, something that has been previously shrouded in mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide for numerous mentoring opportunities at the American Museum of Natural History and in the greater New York City area. Moreover, results from these analyses will be disseminated in museum educational programs, scientific papers, and at national conferences. It will expose the public to innovative methods being used to study dinosaurs through the engaging concept of dietary reconstruction.</AbstractNarration>
