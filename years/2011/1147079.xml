<AbstractNarration>The University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities is awarded a grant to develop a framework for the integration of tools for mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics research that builds on the community-driven analytical framework for genomic data analysis named Galaxy.  Developed at Penn State University, Galaxy is designed specifically to enable existing applications to become usable by life scientists while enhancing reproducibility functions through data capture, workflow development and sharing.  This project will extend this framework by deploying and integrating a series of key software programs for MS-based proteomics data analysis, thus creating Galaxy Tool Modules for Proteomics which will be Galaxy-P (http://getgalaxyp.org/). Reliance on computation and informatics is inherent to system-wide molecular studies at the level of the genome, proteome and metabolome using high throughput analytical platforms.  Analysis and management of such data requires informatics solutions, including software for capture, processing, analysis, annotation and dissemination of the data and experimental procedures used.  Unfortunately, in many cases these informatics solutions do not meet the needs of the researchers, detracting from their use and adoption and thus creating an analytical bottle-neck in biological research using high throughput technologies.  This is especially the case in the still maturing field of MS-based proteomics where a significant shortcoming is the difficulty in accessing and assembling useful software into integrated workflows or pipelines, especially by users who lack computational expertise.  Too often data analysis is left to the core proteomics lab or expert in computation with limited involvement of the project researcher.  Also lacking is an effective means to document and share experimental procedures and workflows and the more systematic adoption of scientific community standards. Consequently, process transparency, repeatability and dissemination of effective, complex data analyses suffer.  Due to these collective shortcomings the full depth and richness of information of MS-based proteomics data is not realized, limiting new discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;Development of Galaxy-P will not only provide informatics solutions to Minnesota researchers, but also a freely-available platform enabling integration of genomic and proteomic data and analytics for a broad community of systems biology researchers. In addition, the project will leverage unique training resources in place at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI) and area undergraduate colleges, developing a local area network and mechanism for training opportunities for young scientists in systems biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project has focused on the extension and re-purposing of the open and freely available Galaxy bioinformatics platform to enable large-scale analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data.  The Galaxy for proteomics (Galaxy-P) platform developed leverages the numerous advantages inherent to the core Galaxy software, traditionally used for genomic data analysis applications.  The advantages include a user-friendly web-based interface, the ability to bring together many different software tools to create usable workflows in a single software platform, and its amenability to large volumes of data inherent to proteomic and genomic studies.  Galaxy-P has made many sophisticated software tools more accessible and usable by non-expert bench scientists conducting studies on proteins.  Along with software for mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data analysis, our work has laid the foundation for analysis pipelines that integrate information on genomes (e.g. gene sequences) with data on proteins that are coded by these genes.  These tools have taken advantage of the numerous genomic data analysis software already in Galaxy, and linking them to proteomics software.  We have demonstrated how these workflows in Galaxy-P can identify novel protein sequences that are caused by mutations in the genome (proteogenomic analysis).  We have also shown how these workflows can be used to study the proteins expressed by communities of bacteria, by integrating genomic sequencing information on these bacteria with proteomic data (metaproteomics analysis).  A focus with all of these applications have been to develop the software and workflows in a manner such that non-experts can utilize these tools in their own research.  We have also worked with numerous collaborators on this project, who have brought specific biological research projects with questions tailored to the strengths of the Galaxy-P platform.  We have successfully applied Galaxy-P to numerous projects, including the study of microbial communities within a host organism to the molecular biology of ground squirrel hibernation.  A main focus in our work has also been in promoting Galaxy-P to the greater research community, so that it can be utilized by researchers who would benefit from our software.  We have conducted a number of hands-on training workshops at national conferences, as well as presenting our work both at conferences and via publication in leading scientific journals.  These efforts have added to a growing number of Galaxy-P users, as well as software developers who are interested in implementing their software in the platform  Finally, we have leveraged our research activities to provide training opportunities in bioinformatics and computational biology to undergraduates.  Focusing on students from smaller, four year colleges within the Minnesota region, we have trained 6 students over the period of grant funding.  These students gained experience in the cross-disciplinary area of bioinformatics, learning not only about software and its development, but also about MS technology and the biological questions it can help solve.  Several of these students have used this experience as a stepping stone to graduate school in biologically-focused research.
