<AbstractNarration>Plants have an immune system that is activated when they detect pathogen attack. There are two modes of plant immunity, each triggered by different types of pathogen-derived molecules as cues of attack. How these two modes of immunity influence each other to modify the immune response is not well understood. This project will precisely measure the influence of each mode upon the other and seek to discover the plant proteins that mediate cross-mode interactions. Since the two modes are central in plant immunity, this project will potentially extend our understanding of how plants use their immune system to defend themselves against pathogens. Potential applications of the work include tools and knowledge to improve the performance of the plant immune system in agricultural settings, which can lead to better control of crop diseases with less impact on the environment. Another important aspect of this project is training undergraduate students who have limited time for research work. While this project functions as a pilot case for a new undergraduate training platform, the platform will be easily expanded to involve more students at multiple sites. Therefore, it has the potential to improve biology education for a large number of undergraduate students. Since this project involves statistical and computational components as well as biological components, post-doctoral, doctoral, and undergraduate students will be trained in broad areas of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Plants turn on immune response when they detect pathogen attack. However, microbial pathogens can evolve much faster than plants and have evolved various ways to interfere with the plant immune signaling network, which regulates a battery of plant immune responses. As a counter measure, plants have evolved a very complex network for immune signaling: different parts of the network compensate each other, so that the network can keep functioning even when some parts are disabled by pathogens. To study this complex signaling network, we mainly use the model plant Arabidopsis. In this project, we focused on interactions between two modes of immunity, pattern-triggered and effector-triggered immunity (PTI and ETI), which are triggered by detection of different types of molecular cues from pathogens. Generally, PTI is triggered by very early molecular cues although the information qualities of these early cues are not great (it could be from non-pathogenic microbes): ETI is triggered a little later by much more reliable molecular cues. Another aspect of immune response is that the immune response is bad for plants as well. Therefore, unnecessary immune response should be avoided. One thing we learned in this project is that if PTI signaling is not strongly interfered by pathogens, which suggests that PTI is successful in stopping the pathogens, the later ETI program can be aborted, probably to avoid a bad effect of unnecessary immune responses. This decision of aborting further immune response appears to be made in a conservative manner: multiple different indications of early immune success seem to be needed to make this decision. This is probably because pathogens may quickly evolve to fake such an indicator if only one such indicator is sufficient to make plants to abort the immune program.</p> <p>It is very difficult to study the mechanisms that are hidden under such a complex network. This is because even when one part of the network is disabled, not much difference is observed in performance of the network because some other parts compensate the loss. Thus, a traditional genetics approach (knocking out one gene at a time) does not give out much information about how the network functions as a whole. To overcome this problem, we simultaneously knocked-out four major components of the network, which largely abolished PTI and ETI. Starting with this broken state of the network, we put back the major components one by one to learn how each component and groups of the components exactly work in the network. Combining this approach (which we call network reconstitution) with measuring the activities of the components through the time after PTI triggered, we built a computer model that explains the signal flow among the network components. Using this PTI model, we learned which particular signal flows are important for the network components to compensate each other and how this network can respond differently to different molecular cues.
