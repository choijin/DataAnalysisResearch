<AbstractNarration>A sophisticated simulation method is developed to investigate the interactions between whole cell intracellular calcium dynamics and the building blocks of calcium handling, spatially localized subcellular calcium elevations known as "calcium puffs" and "sparks."   Using techniques originally developed in theoretical physical chemistry and statistical physics, equations are derived and analyzed for the moments of the local calcium concentration associated with the large number of calcium release sites in living cells.  This extends the classical "gating variable" approach to modeling the opening and closing of ion channels - introduced by Nobel prize winners Hodgkin and Huxley - to account for the short range of action of intracellular calcium and local coupling of intracellular calcium channels.  Traditional models of coupled local and global calcium responses involve stochastic simulation methods that are computationally intensive and often prohibit both mathematical analysis and large-scale parameters studies.  Conversely, moment-based whole cell models of intracellular calcium responses are systems of ordinary differential equations that can be studied using geometric and graphical approaches.  Gregory Smith (William &amp; Mary) and students develop, validate, and benchmark this mathematical modeling framework and, subsequently, deploy it in the laboratories of Eric Sobie (Mount Sinai) and Sandor Gyorke (Ohio State) to interpret live cell calcium imaging experiments that probe how beat-to-beat calcium cycling in heart muscle cells changes in response to drugs, mutations, and disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User-friendly software is produced to assist other laboratories in their development of more realistic and predictive models of calcium responses in cardiac, smooth, and striated muscle, neurons, and non-excitable cells.  Graduate students involved in this project experience high-quality interdisciplinary scientific training at the interface of applied mathematics and cell physiology. The project also expands and supports Smith's activities as Director of the William &amp; Mary Biomathematics Initiative, e.g., curriculum development in biological modeling, coordination of an interdisciplinary faculty-student journal club, mentoring of undergraduate research students, and authorship of an undergraduate text introducing neuroscience majors to nonlinear dynamics in the context of electrophysiology (with Christopher Del Negro).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project focused on mathematical and computational modeling of the cellular physiology of heart.   In heart muscle cells (cardiac myocytes), changes in the intracellular calcium concentration couple the pacemaking electrical signals that occur during each heart beat to the contraction of the chambers of the heart.  This "excitation-contraction coupling" is a process that is essential for normal heart function and, consequently, scientists are interested in both experimental and theoretical approaches to understanding the intracellular calcium handling of cardiac myocytes.    The focus of our theoretical work was the development of state-of-the-art techniques for computer simulation of calcium handling in living cells.  While conventional mathematical approaches (e.g., compartmental models) have provided insight into the dynamics of global (cell-wide) calcium signals, and more sophisticated models can be used to study spatially localized calcium signals, mathematical physiologists have struggled with the disparate spatial scales relevant to cardiac calcium signaling. Because cellular physiologists believe the interaction between localized (subcellular) and global (cellular) calcium signals are key aspects of the normal and abnormal function of the heart, we proposed the development of a novel modeling approach.    Our idea was to represent the local dynamics of calcium by the moments (mean, variance, etc.) of probability densities for the calcium concentration near both open and closed channels in heart muscle cells.  One reason to think that the approach would work well is the large number of functional units for local calcium signaling per cell (about 20,000, see figure, which shows twelve). Though the method we proposed and developed is mathematically sophisticated, it worked very well.    The principal investigator and his graduate trainees performed proof-of-concept studies and applied the multi-scale modeling approach to address important physiological questions. In the scientific articles the resulted from this grant, we took care to explain our new methodology in a way that will be accessible to biological scientists with less mathematical training.  We expect this new framework for simulation of interacting subcellular and cellular calcium signals will be a useful tool for understanding changes in cardiac calcium cycling that result from drugs, mutations, or acquired diseases.
