<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research project proposes to develop and commercialize an active driving&lt;br/&gt;aid to enable semi-autonomous, cooperative navigation of an electric power wheelchair (EPW) both&lt;br/&gt;indoors and in dynamic, outdoor environments. The device is called CoPilot and is intended to be used&lt;br/&gt;by EPW users who suffer from deteriorating cognitive, perceptive, or motor function. CoPilot is an intelligent&lt;br/&gt;sensor and semi-autonomous drive control system that works in cooperation with the driver to aid&lt;br/&gt;in negotiating changing terrain, avoiding obstacles/collisions, and maintaining a straight path. The goal is&lt;br/&gt;to prolong independent living and safety for seniors in their homes. The basis for the innovation is that as&lt;br/&gt;an elder person begins to lose perceptive or motor function, CoPilot can augment that loss because it can&lt;br/&gt;interpret the user?s intent and it can see out into the environment on their behalf. This project will leverage&lt;br/&gt;the latest in 3D LIDAR technology for robust perception, exploit the team?s experience in commercializing&lt;br/&gt;the smart wheelchair of the Automated Transport and Retrieval System (including acquiring FDA approval),&lt;br/&gt;and will apply the knowledge the team has gained in developing autonomous driving solutions through their&lt;br/&gt;participation in the DARPA Urban Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable prolonged independent living and safety&lt;br/&gt;for seniors in their homes while also providing significant economic relief to the U.S. healthcare system. The&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that the number of people over the age of 65 will&lt;br/&gt;increase from 38.9 million people in 2008 to over 70 million by 2030. This rapid growth in the U.S. elder&lt;br/&gt;population will also increase the number of people with age-related symptoms that hamper their mobility.&lt;br/&gt;Such common symptoms include visual impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer?s disease. A second, more&lt;br/&gt;serious side effect of this aging population is that it will place unprecedented strains on the U.S. healthcare&lt;br/&gt;system. This impact can be moderated in part by enabling individuals to maintain their independence and&lt;br/&gt;safety while living at home longer. It is estimated that adding a single month of independence and health to&lt;br/&gt;America?s elder population would save $5 billion, while decreasing hospitalization and institutionalization&lt;br/&gt;10% would save $50 billion annually. As a result, technology for home-centered approaches to healthcare,&lt;br/&gt;such as CoPilot, are necessary.</AbstractNarration>
