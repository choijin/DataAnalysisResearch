<AbstractNarration>Peer learning can provide students with an engaging learning environment that nurtures development of higher-order cognitive skills needed by engineers for innovation. This collaborative project led by the University of Oklahoma Norman Campus with partners from Tuskegee University and the Pennsylvania State University, University Park is using mobile smart devices to facilitate peer learning. Open ended problem solving ability is one key student outcome being enhanced by this project. In the Teaching to Learn (TeatoL) environment participants serve as both teacher and learner and will collectively learn from each other's experiences. The project is developing new understanding in how students (a) understand their own cognitive processes, (b) respond to peer teaching and learning, (c) can develop peer critique and reflection, (d) use mobile devices and social networks to enhance learning. In addition the project will develop a better understanding of how "flat" classrooms impact learning, and the impact of peer learning on underrepresented STEM students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Open-ended problems significantly differ from the well-defined text-book problems, and require critical thinking and problem solving experience. In most instances, applying engineering principles to solve open-ended problems is a very challenging task for students. Given this challenge, the project aimed at:  (1) improving students' ability to learn and apply engineering concepts to creatively solve open-ended problem, and  (2) developing effective applications for mobile smart devices for peer learning and sharing learning experiences to foster creative problem solving through modifying and reforming learning experiences.  As part of this project, and through designed experiments the following goals were achieved.  (1) Evaluation of Learning Gains: Using the technology-assisted knowledge sharing platform conceptualized as part of this work, empirical work was undertaken to assess the learning gains across three data collection sites (Penn State, University of Oklahoma and Tuskegee University). Analyses included paired-t tests and regressions, and showed that technology-assisted peer-learning had a significant effect for all project data collection sites, and types of the open-ended problems included.  (2) Student Motivation: It was documented that student motivation in using the technology-assisted peer-learning platform remained high during the implementation.  (3) All curriculum material developed, allowing technology-assisted peer learning is made available.   Results are augmented with students perceptions on the usability of the technology platform, using a modified Task-Technology Fit Model.
