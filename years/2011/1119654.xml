<AbstractNarration>This exploratory research and development project engages high-school students as student-tutors who create screen-capture videos that demonstrate step-by-step solutions to mathematical problems and explicate the use of interactive applets. The project has three development goals (a model for creating the media, a model for collaboration with teachers, and enhancements to a Lesson Study model) and three research goals (to test conjectures about student change, to analyze reconfigured roles for teachers and students, and to advance a theory of personalized learning communities.) The project tests whether the mathematical and communication skills of student-tutors improve in the process of making the video materials. It also tests whether teachers and the student users of the videos benefit from them. Further, the project will examine whether the process of creating and disseminating the videos is replicable and scalable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses design research methods as well as both formative and summative evaluations to achieve the research and development goals. The investigators pose a series of thoughtful research questions and plan to use a variety of research methods to collect and analyze data to answer them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is potentially transformative. The advances in technology present opportunities and challenges for improving student learning. Built on strong theoretical and empirical foundations and prior work, the project takes full advantages of the opportunities of tutoring using 21st-century technologies - marrying screen-capture video with a model of student-delivered tutoring. The project will contribute to an understanding of how teachers and student-tutors change and exercise creativity through participating in digital media production. The findings of the project will have broader impact in at least three dimensions: (1) The videos created by students will be helpful for other students' learning; (2) The research on engaging students in creating videos can not only help us understand the effective use of technology, but also help us understand the mechanism for developing students' generative thinking and creativity; and (3) This project can provide insights about how to integrate 21st-Century technology into regular classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This exploratory project had three development goals and three research goals.  The development goals were to:  1. Develop a replicable and scalable model for student production of digital media in service of school mathematics curricula.  2. Develop a model for intergenerational, global and cross-cultural communication and service leadership.  3. Develop enhancements to the lesson study model through computer supported collaboration, digital lessons, and implementation of asynchronous modalities.  The research goals were to:  4. Test conjectures about student change (students who create the media engage more and become more expert in underlying mathematics) and repository value (the media resources they produce are materially useful both to their teachers and their peers)  5. Analyze the potential for reconfiguring student and teacher roles in cyberenabled future learning environments  6. Refine a theory of high performance personalized learning communities.  The project carried out approximately 25 workshops and held numerous collaborative media-making clubs, collecting data in each activity.  Additionally, it supported the participation of approximately 10 US doctoral students and postdocs who studied learner engagement, a main focus of this project, in collaborative partner laboratories in Finland as a supplement to the activities of the US-Finland Science Across Virtual Institutes effort involving sixteen research teams in the US and Finland.     This project has confirmed conjectures that cross-generational collaboration between teachers and students in the process of instructional media engenders fundamentally different classroom dynamics and routine flow experiences in learning.  Conjectures about co-construction of mathematical and scientific thought, deep immersion and flow in learning, and different classroom interactional patterns by which collaboration would enhance, rather than subtract from the respect students held for teachers, were all confirmed.  Additionally, conjectures about stronger mathematical learning through self-explanation and repeated reasoning by students, and the potential of digital forms of Japanese lesson study practices, were confirmed.   This projectÆs impact in the US is difficult to parse from the broader maker-space movement.  The project is something of a founding effort of the national maker space movement in terms of digital maker spaces in formal school settings.  The project is having a major national impact in the Republic of Namibia, because it furnished the core rationale for a three year Fulbright effort that is now giving rise to a national project of collaborative digital media-making.  In this process, we have coined a new use of the term participatory teaching to indicate carefully calibrated sharing with students of teaching responsibiilities primarily held by teachers.  We have collected extensive data on how cross-generational collaboration alters the social and behavioral context for learning, including identity formation of both students and teachers.  We have developed contributions to learner engagement theory in this project that have not yet been published.  These contributions will contribute to the theory of personalized learning communities.  Two book chapters, two refereed articles, two articles in submission, and sixteen conference presentations including half in refereed proceedings have constituted one aspect of the dissemination.  This project was one of 24 innovative efforts featured at the 2012 National Cyberlearning Research Summit, and it was featured at the 2015 NSF-White House Summit on Education for All.
