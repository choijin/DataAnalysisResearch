<AbstractNarration>This research examines the relations between perceived racial discrimination and romantic relationship functioning among African American couples. Very little research has examined the relations among perceived discrimination and romantic relationship functioning, and very little is known about how perceived discrimination affects interpersonal relationships or how romantic relationship interactions influence people's response to perceived discrimination. The proposed research seeks to fill this important gap in the literature by employing a prospective daily diary study to examine the unfolding context of African American couples' daily lives. These couples will complete a one-time background survey and a 3-week daily diary survey. Every day for 21 days, participants will log onto a secure website to access the daily diary portion of the study to record their daily experiences and feelings. Ultimately, the investigators will examine how feeling accepted or rejected by romantic partners influences the relation between perceived discrimination and intra-personal outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is consistent with NSF's goal to support research that has broader scientific impacts in a number of ways. It will fill an important gap in the psychological literature by examining African Americans' perceptions of racial discrimination, the impact it has on their romantic relationship functioning as well as how relationships can influence the negative consequences of perceived racial discrimination. Examining factors that moderate the harmful physiological responses to discrimination and the resulting negative health outcomes should help contribute to reducing existing health disparities facing African Americans. In addition, several ethnic minority graduate and undergraduate students are likely to be included in the conduct the research.</AbstractNarration>

Data collected from this project allows for statistical modeling of the actor-partner relationship capable of providing a fuller and more dynamic view of how discrimination influences functioning than has been available in previous research.  Outcomes from this project are likely to expand the psychosocial scope of how researchers consider discriminatory experiences &ndash; from focusing solely on individual perceptions to including assessments of how their effects may vicariously influence the functioning and adjustment of romantic partners. Understanding the factors that buffer or exacerbate the negative effects of perceived discrimination on romantic relationship functioning can help relationship therapists better understand the unique effects of these experiences on relationship functioning.  Finally, several ethnic minority and first generation graduate and undergraduate students were involved with this research project. Our students were provided with a lot of hands on training in data collection, data management and statistical analyses.  These training experiences will help our students pursue careers in the sciences, which will broaden the participation of these underrepresented groups in the field.
