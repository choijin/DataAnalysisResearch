<AbstractNarration>This Proposal was submitted to the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) Broad Agency Announcement 10-024 titled "Marine Mammal Detection and Monitoring" and selected for funding by NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's propose to use existing data collected during the 2006 ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (OAWRS) Experiment in the Gulf of Maine to develop passive and active methods for tracking marine mammals in near-real-time. The goals of the proposal include development of signal processing techniques for near-real-time localization and ranging of marine mammal vocalizations using a high-resolution array, including using the array invariant method for ranging, adaptive non-linear matched filter processing for improved SNR of signals, and modeling to estimate the performance of the developed algorithms in variable levels of noise. Additional effort will be used to estimate the low frequency target strengths of localized marine mammals from the passive acoustic analysis phase in the study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining passive and active acoustic sensing with towed arrays provides an efficient approach for detecting, localizing and classifying marine mammals rapidly over wide areas for many important operations such as geophysical surveys, naval exercises and population assessment surveys that already deploy towed arrays. Acoustic sensing is the only approach that is effective during night-time operations, and in the daytime during poor weather conditions not conducive to visual surveys. It is important to remotely sense marine mammal locations and behavior so that steps can be taken to minimize impact of man-made activities on their populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative effort between male and female faculty and commercial partners in different disciplines. The improved sensing capabilities of marine mammals over wide ranges could be used in the future for mitigation purposes to limit human induced sound impacts on marine mammal populations, such as those produced by marine geophysical research that use active seismic equipment. The study will also provide education opportunities for undergraduate students and support one graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  We have developed and demonstrated the passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS) approach for the detection, localization and species classification of marine mammals over instantaneous wide areas spanning continental-shelf scale regions (&gt;10,000 km^2).  POAWRS uses a large-aperture densely-sampled (&gt; 32 hydrophones per aperture) coherent hydrophone array system with orders of magnitude higher array gain to enable detection of whale vocalizations either two orders of magnitude more distant in range or lower in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than a single hydrophone, which has no array gain.  POAWRS was applied in post-processing to detect, localize and classify over eight distinct MM species, including mysticetes: fin, humpback, blue, sei and minke whales; and odontocetes: sperm, orca, and pilot whales, and several other delphinid species, such as the common and bottlenose dolphins; from their vocalizations recorded during a three week long NOPP-funded Gulf of Maine Fall 2006 Experiment.  The temporal-spatial distributions and vocalization behavior of diverse MM species determined by POAWRS were found to be highly correlated to their prey-fish, Atlantic herring, distributions over the roughly two week long herring spawning period, where the herring were imaged using active ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing, calibrated by local ultrasonic echosounding and capture-trawl sampling.   POAWRS was also applied in post-processing to monitor, localize and distinguish multiple sperm whale individuals from their click and creak sequences recorded on the LTAR array during the NSF-MRI funded (OCE-1040101) sea test of that array on the New England continental shelf and slope waters in spring 2013. Whale bearings were estimated using time-domain beamforming that provided high coherent array gain in sperm whale click signal-to-noise ratio.  Whale ranges from the receiver array center were estimated using the moving array triangulation technique from a sequence of whale bearing measurements. Multiple concurrently vocalizing sperm whales in the far-field of the horizontal receiver array were distinguished and classified based on their horizontal spatial locations and the inter-pulse intervals of their vocalized click signals.  We applied and demonstrated the POAWRS technique in near real-time during the ONR and Norwegian-government funded Nordic Seas 2014 experiment to detect, localize and track a subset of humpback and sperm whale vocalizations received on a high-resolution towed receiver array system.  This result will be used in the future to examine marine mammal behavior and interaction with several prey-fish species off the coast of Norway.   The outcome of this project have been disseminated through numerous conference presentations and several journal publications.  We also developed a database management system implemented using mySQL that interfaces with MATLAB for rapid acess, retrieval and processing of marine mammal vocalizations measured using the high-resolution towed receiver array system.  Our database currently contains several hundred thousand vocalizations from diverse species.  The POAWRS approach can be applied in geophysical surveys and naval operations for instantaneous wide-area marine mammal monitoring which is mandated by the marine mammal protection act. The wide area coverage of the POAWRS approach can be applied to ensure more efficient field operations, and minimize loss of survey time at sea. Furthermore, acoustic sensing is the only approach that is effective during night-time operations, and in the daytime during poor weather conditions not conducive to visual surveys  This project provided an excellent opportunity for training and development in an interdisciplinary area spanning ocean remote sensing, acoustics, marine mammal science, ecosystem biology, animal group behavior, engineering, computer vision and machine learning, mathematical, physical and information sciences and so enha...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
