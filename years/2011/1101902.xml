<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to create the first set of quantum interference based slow and stopped light photonic devices. Quantum interference creates some of the strongest light-matter interactions ever observed, including electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), slow light, and stopped light. A large number of possible applications exist, including optical data processing, enhanced sensing, (quantum) optical memories, and quantum information processing. However, to date there is no viable platform that combines large quantum interference effects with photonic device integration.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to explore the use of a recently developed self-contained atomic spectroscopy platform for creating a new class of photonic devices based on quantum interference. To this end, a second generation hollow-core waveguide spectroscopy chip for high temperature and high optical density operation will be developed and used to demonstrate stopped light on a chip. A set of novel, canonical photonic devices for chip-scale sensing and optical signal processing based on quantum interference, slow and stopped light will be demonstrated. This new class of devices will have transformative impact on the use of non-solid (atomic) media for photonics.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work are to unite several fields, including microfabrication, integrated optics, atomic spectroscopy, and device physics. This collaborative project will provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to acquire a unique, multidisciplinary skill set. The program is complemented by a number of outreach efforts to recruit undergraduate students from underrepresented groups through established and successful programs at UCSC and BYU, respectively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of this project was to develop slow and stopped light photonic devices that rely on rubidium vapor to exploit nonlinear optical processes.  These devices were meant to be chip based to take advantage of small geometries and available precision microfabrication processes.  In order to create rubidium vapor chips we first developed methods to seal very reactive rubidium into reservoirs attached to the chip.  These reservoirs were made from glass, copper, and copper plated sealing layers such as indium.  We made optical interrogation regions using hollow waveguides with both long and short interrogation regions.  Using glass capillaries we discovered that rubidium has an extremely long interaction time with glass which slows its migration.  We determined that commercially viable chips need to have short migration regions and developed new integrated optics designs for reactive vapors which rely on a combination of buried channel waveguides and hollow waveguides with periodic holes in their walls.  Three graduate students and four undergraduate students worked on this research project over its four year timespan.  All student participants were exposed to a variety of engineering fields including optics, materials, atomic spectroscopy, and semiconductor processing.  Many of them have already accepted jobs with semiconductor manufacturing companies as this project provided invaluable experience on semiconductor process design and materials characterization.  Undergraduate students working on this project have also been a part of the IMMERSE program at BYU, an undergraduate specific research program which prepares students for further graduate studies.  IMMERSE students participate in several scientific outreach programs including lab demonstrations for SOAR, an on-campus BYU sponsored program for underrepresented minority high school students.  Additionally, IMMERSE provides staffing for Chip Camp, a three-day engineering based summer camp for 7th and 8th graders.  In 2015, Chip Camp brought 122 students to the BYU campus to learn about engineering principles, especially those related to the semiconductor field.
