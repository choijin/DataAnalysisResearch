<AbstractNarration>The proliferation of "green roofs" or more generally, ecoroofs in the United States has increased dramatically in the last ten years and has radically expanded the historical function of a roof. Ecoroofs offer new opportunities to provide environmental, economical, and social benefits. However, ecoroofs carry higher gravity loads and must support long-duration transient fluid loading compared to traditional systems. This shift in roof design demands has outpaced building codes and regulations, and more importantly exceeded our fundamental understanding of roof structural behaviors under these nontraditional loads. Regrettably, conventionally engineered roofs account for a disproportionately large number of structural failures with over $1 billion in damages since 1990 for a single insurer. Proper design of ecoroofs to ensure structural safety and serviceability of these relatively "sensitive" structural components requires research to address these three critical questions: &lt;br/&gt;1.Under earthquake induced roof shaking, does the ecoroof planting material mobilize? To what degree is the ecoroof planting material coupled to the structure? Can roof dead load imbalances be expected after an earthquake?&lt;br/&gt;2.During rain events, what are the load effects produced on ecoroofs and over what time-scales? How loads are distributed in ecoroofs and will traditional design approaches ensure ponding stability and prevent overloading? &lt;br/&gt;3.What are the engineering properties of typical ecoroof planting materials? Which properties are most critical to achieving ecoroof performance during seismic and rain events?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is the first to examine the structural, geotechnical, and planting interactions on ecoroof seismic performance. The research focuses on system response to demonstrate the important interactions of the design elements. An ecoroof structural simulator will be developed to test full-scale laboratory ecoroof prototypes and will be integrated with field survey and component laboratory data to produce new knowledge on fluid-structure interaction at the roof including: planting material mobility during lateral shaking, water retention and drainage characteristics, and long-term service performance. These will provide background material for development of a structural guide for ecoroof designs in seismic zones.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ecoroofs are becoming more widely used, and in some jurisdictions are being mandated, across the US in sustainable design practice. An ecoroof uses planting material placed on the roof that enables plants to grow. The planting material holds moisture in the pore spaces of the soil over a longer time-scale than conventional roofs.  This research project investigated the effects of rain loading on the structural performance of ecoroofs considering their unique material characteristics. The study also looked at the combined influences of rain loading with the effects of lateral shaking from earthquakes.  A large population of in-service ecoroofs was surveyed to quantify their characteristics and to collect ecoroof planting material samples.  The material samples were used to establish the engineering properties using geotechnical index testing and strength testing including water content, organic content, specific gravity, in-situ void ratio, moist and dry unit weight, median grain size, coefficient of uniformity, coefficient of curvature, and estimated dead loads. The planting material performance when subjected to lateral shaking was established using undrained cyclic simple shear tests.   Soil-scale, component level, and 1m x 1m system tests were conducted to identify interactions between all relevant ecoroof components including insulation, waterproofing membrane, root barrier, filter mat, and planting materials. Ecoroof materials begin to move around on the roof at relatively low levels of shaking.  A full-size shake table was designed and built to enable simulation of roof-level dynamic motions to understand what happens to the ecoroof materials during an earthquake . The shaking table motions were controlled and demonstrated for a structural steel framing system typical of a commercial  roof (Fig. 1). An extensive ecoroof, widely used in practice, was constructed to industry standards and specifications and grown in-place on the structural roof model (Fig. 2). Long-duration and short duration environmental tests were conducted, including ponding effects, to characterize structural behavior of the roof framing (Fig. 3).     The hydraulic load tests validated existing approaches for treatment of the soil loading characteristics for design events.   Results of this research were used to make recommendations for selection of ecoroof materials that can meet design expectations.
