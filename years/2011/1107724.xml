Cultural Learning In addition to the long-term collaborations forged between participants and their host researchers, the group of twenty-five American students who travelled together to Taiwan was greeted by an energetic group of students from the National Tsing Hua University. The team of Taiwanese students hosted a weeklong orientation program, which provided elementary Chinese language training and a calligraphy class, a tour of the Ying-ge Ceramics Museum, a highly informative lecture on the indigenous tribes o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
