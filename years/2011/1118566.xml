<AbstractNarration>Dr. Jie Qing proposes to organize a summer program on Mathematical Relativity at the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research in Beijing in June 2011. Mathematical research of general relativity is a significant and active part of mathematics. In fact it becomes increasingly a major source of inspirations for mathematical researches in the fields of differential geometry and differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed summer program will host one week research conference and invite four experts in the field to teach mini-courses in the rest two weeks. The proposed program is inviting many graduate students and young people in the field both from China and US. The proposed program will provide international travel to the participants, particularly, students or young researchers, from US.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mathematical research of general relativity is a significant and active part of mathematics. The mathematical relativity is a field where there have been successful interactions between mathematicians and physicists. In fact it becomes increasingly a major source of inspirations for mathematical researches in the fields of differential geometry and differential equations.      The basics of general relativity is the Einstein theory of gravity, in which the law of gravitation is described by a space-time and Einstein equations. Though there are many successful applications of Einstein theory in Astrophysics and cosmology, the lack of a better description of black holes and a better understanding of the formation of black holes remain to be the hurdle for further developments and applications of general relativity in our understanding of the nature. Therefore the broad impact of the promotion of research in matrhematrical relativity is tremendous.     The program was a three week program in mathematocal relativity, which was held at Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research, Beijing June 6 - June 25 2011.
