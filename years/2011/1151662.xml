<AbstractNarration>This CAREER proposal, co-funded by two Divisions in the Directorate of Geosciences (Earth Sciences and Atmospheric and Geospatial Sciences), is constructed around a plan for improving our knowledge of the source physics and atmospheric propagation effects that take place during volcanic eruptions while training students and international participants in these novel techniques. When volcanoes erupt they impinge upon the atmosphere and produce high-amplitude acoustic radiation.  These volcano sounds are comprised of both high frequency (i.e., audible) and sub-sonic energy (i.e., low frequency, or infrasonic) components, which are directly relatable to the style and intensity of an eruption.  Volcano acoustics is thus an important tool for both remotely tracking an eruption, which is vital to volcano monitoring endeavors, and for quantifying material fluxes, which is fundamentally important for studies of eruption dynamics.  Moreover, because low frequency volcano sounds are often exceptionally intense they are generally detectable at distances ranging from tens to thousands of kilometers from the volcano.  This allows for implementation of acoustic remote sensing networks for continuous surveillance of restless volcanoes and to probe the intervening atmosphere to track changeable winds and temperatures, which influence sound propagation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toward the improved understanding of eruption source physics and atmospheric propagation effects, PI Jeffrey Johnson and colleagues, along with a team of graduate students, will investigate volcano acoustic sources and the evolution of these signals as they are transmitted through the atmosphere.  During proposed field work the research team will utilize dense networks of specialized broadband microphones to record the intense (and often continuous) acoustic signals produced by a spectrum of active volcanoes in Latin America.  Together with conjoint optical, multi-spectral, and meteorological observations they will develop and test models of sound generation and atmospheric sound transmission.  Acoustic source physics and propagation modeling have vital impacts for the burgeoning fields of atmospheric infrasound studies, which encompass disciplines as varied as nuclear test ban monitoring, explosion physics, urban noise pollution, microbarom climatology, atmospheric tomography, and geophysical investigation of phenomena such as thunder, bolides, and earthquakes. Broader impacts of the proposed volcano dynamical studies are also expected to lead to development of improved surveillance techniques for monitoring hazardous volcanoes, which can ultimately lead to better forecasting and mitigation of volcanic hazards.  The international nature of this work will foster collaboration between scientists in the U.S., Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, and Chile.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Active volcanoes radiate intense infrasound, or acoustic waves that are typically concentrated at inaudible frequencies below 20 Hz.  This type of sound is able to propagate for long distances (many kilometers) and for extended durations (many minutes) to be recorded by specialized microphones far from a volcano?s immediate hazard zone.  Such recordings are used to track and interpret activity at the volcanic vent and/or on the slopes of a volcano.  Infrasound data are important both for volcano monitoring applications as well as for fundamental volcano research focused on eruption dynamics.  This NSF project analyzed the infrasound recorded from a variety of active volcanoes, including those producing explosions, those with boiling lava lakes, and those that induced gravity-driven flows, such as rock fall and lahars (volcanic mud flows).  A principal objective was the quantification of the physical movements happening both in volcanic vents and on the slopes of volcanoes.  This work addressed significant research questions such as "How much gas is released during volcanic explosions?" and "How fast do volcanic flows travel down slope?"  Remote acoustic monitoring of these phenomena is particularly illuminating and important because proximal recording may be dangerous or inconvenient.  Furthermore, these processes might not be otherwise observable using other technologies and/or during night-time and inclement weather.  One key outcome of this project is the new understanding of how crater dimension modulates the infrasound that is recorded during volcanic activity.  Each volcanic crater substantially influences the nature of its volcano ?voiceprint?, including both its frequency content and the amount of reverberation.  Changing infrasound quality can thus be related to variations in crater shape.  Such changes in infrasound character were documented at Volc&aacute;n Villarrica (Chile) during the lead-up to the large eruption on March 3rd, 2015 and were modeled as the progressive rise of the lava lake within the summit crater.
