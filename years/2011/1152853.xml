<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms supports work by Professor William Connick at the University of Cincinnati to prepare new materials containing platinum(II) salts and to determine the factors that govern the colorimetric and luminescence-based responses of these materials to aqueous anions.  These studies are expected to lead to new materials and methods for their preparation.  In addition, this research will provide fundamental insight into the influence of micro- and nanoenvironments on structure and electronic properties of the incorporated platinum salts.  Ultimately, these studies are expected to provide the knowledge needed to develop rational strategies for designing aqueous anion sensing devices.  The research will be accomplished by exploring a series of synthetic strategies and employing a battery of physical methods for materials characterization and investigations of ion exchange.  The research activities will bring together a research team composed of high school students, undergraduate students, graduate students, and Professor Connick. In collaboration with a Cincinnati Public Schools teacher, hands-on demonstrations of these ion-exchange materials will be developed in order to help teach fundamental chemical concepts to high students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the importance of monitoring anion levels in the environment and the human body, the rapid, on-site and low-cost detection of certain ions (e.g., oxyanions) remains a significant challenge. For example, perchlorate anion poses a health hazard because it persists for long times in the environment and interferes with thyroid function. However, sensitive methods of perchlorate detection are expensive and cumbersome for field work.  The research conducted under this award will lay the foundation for a new strategy for ion sensing.  The resulting anion-sensitive materials will exhibit characteristic phosphorescence when exposed to certain aqueous anions, such as perchlorate.  In principle, this anion-induced response can be exploited for the rapid, low-cost detection of specific aqueous anions in flowing natural water, underground plumes, industrial effluent, and municipal water. Activities under this award will focus on developing methods for preparing materials with these properties and determining how they work.  The resulting insights are an essential first step toward the development of rational approaches for incorporation of these materials in ion sensing devices.  Thus, the research is expected to enable new technologies that promote sustainability.  The knowledge gathered from these studies also is expected to be relevant in fields such as ion sequestration, vapor-sensing, chemical catalysis, and non-linear optics.</AbstractNarration>

This project directly engaged more than 70 researchers (including many students), thereby contributing to their professional development as scientists.  An outreach program directly impacted ~270 8th graders in the Cincinnati Public School District by engaging them in hands-on, inquiry-based learning.  The project also resulted in the creation of a 5-day workshop on chemical sensing for rising 9th graders.       Last Modified: 02/12/2017       Submitted by: William B Connick]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
