<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project is designed to provide a detailed understanding of photophysics in conjugated polymers used for optoelectronic applications. Transient absorption and delayed luminescence experiments are performed on solutions and films of electroluminescent polymers to address the root cause of the decrease in fluorescence quantum yield in films, the branching ratio for recombination of charge carriers to form singlet states and the origin of magnetic field effects in organic light-emitting diodes. In donor-acceptor blends relevant to fabrication of solar cells from conjugated polymers, time-delayed field collection experiments to quantify charge photogeneration efficiency and transient absorption to ascertain whether energy transfer plays an important role in organic photovoltaics.&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical: The research has implications for the design of materials and device structures for solar cells, optically pumped film lasers, lighting, display devices and spintronic technologies based on processable conjugated polymer materials. Graduate and undergraduate students participating in the research acquire interdisciplinary training in areas as diverse as condensed matter physics, optics, materials science, analytical chemistry and device engineering. Hands-on educational modules demonstrating how conjugated polymers can change color and enable light detection as in solar cells are developed for middle and secondary school students in collaboration with a local high school science teacher and disseminated on the Internet</AbstractNarration>

One thrust of our work is devoted to understanding why this is the case and what strategies can be used to inhibit formation of poorly emitting morphologies. A second line of investigation is to determine whether a recent hypothesis that the polymers are advantaged over the current materials in terms of their propensity to form "singlet states", the more efficient of two possible states formed by recombination of electrically injected charges, is correct. In both cases, we have taken a unique approach to elucidating the underlying science.  In the case of looking at the reasons for low luminescence efficiency in polymer films, we have showed that reductions in order are helpful and identified specific red chromophores that are responsible for reduced luminescence.
