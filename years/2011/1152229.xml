<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professors Steven Buratto, Michael Bowers, and Horia Metiu from the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) to prepare, characterize, and test two new types of nanostructured catalysts, having the common feature of being very small, isolated, well-defined catalytically-active sites. The investigators have designed and constructed a unique, highly versatile apparatus which allows production of model catalysts (both metals and metal oxides) by deposition of mass-selected nanoclusters from the gas phase onto single crystal oxide supports. These well-defined nanocluster catalysts are characterized using a normal array of surface science methods and, in addition, utilization of ultrahigh vacuum combined with scanning-tip microscopy (UHV-STM) methods to probe the size and shape of the nanoclusters before and after reaction. The chemistry of such model catalysts is monitored in UHV using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) and at elevated pressures using a high pressure batch reactor attached to the surface science chamber. Specifically, the investigators will prepare and study the catalytic activity of very small VxOy mass-selected clusters supported on single crystal titanium dioxide (110) surfaces in the oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde. They will probe the catalytic activity as a function of both x and y to develop a model for the reaction mechanism. They will also prepare and study the catalytic activity of very small mass-selected, binary clusters such as palladium/gold and platinum/tin alloys of various compositions supported on single crystal titanium dioxide (110) surfaces in the synthesis of vinyl acetate and the selective hydrogenation of alkenes as a function of composition as well as develop a model for the reaction mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large number of industrial processes use nanometer-size clusters (both metal and metal oxide) supported on oxide surfaces to perform reactions that would not take place, or would be commercially unsuccessful if performed on the bulk material. In research supported by this grant the investigators will utilize state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical methods to probe the catalytic activity of well-defined nanocluster catalysts in great detail and develop a fundamental understanding of the catalytic chemistry at the atomic level. The concepts developed through this research will help optimize important industrial processes using these nanoscale catalysts and provide valuable insight into the discovery of new nanoscale catalytic materials.  Researchers supported by this grant will also be active in outreach to K-12 schools in the Santa Barbara area. They plan to develop a tutorial presentation on an atomistic view of heterogeneous catalysis that will be included in the currently active outreach program in the department at UCSB. In addition, researchers working on this project will visit high schools in the Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties three times per year to discuss their research and its impact as well as to promote science education.</AbstractNarration>

We have designed and constructed a highly versatile apparatus and developed a research paradigm, which allows us to produce model catalysts by deposition of well-defined, atomically-precise nanoclusters from the gas phase onto metal and metal oxide supports.

Our research has focused on the reactivity of very small VxOy mass-selected clusters supported on single crystal TiO2(110) surfaces in the oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol.  In addition, we utilize scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to probe the geometry of the VxOy nanoclusters on the TiO2(110) surface.  This unique capability to control nanocluster composition atom-by-atom provided the requisite level of detail to understand the chemistry on the atomic level and yielded important insight into the development of the VxOy/TiO2(110) catalytic system.  Our research has resulted in several important discoveries. First, we have discovered new chemistry resulting from the interaction of methanol and the bare TiO2(110) surface.  In addition to the production of methanol and formaldehyde via disproportionation, we also observe the production of methane in temperature programmed reaction (TPR) spectra.  In-situ STM images of the different stages along the methanol reaction pathway has resulted in a reaction mechanism.  We attribute the production of methanol, formaldehyde, and methane from reduced TiO2(110) above 600 K to two distinct disproportionation reactions. The first disproportionation reaction produces methanol and formaldehyde and is the same disproportionation reaction reported previously by many groups. The second disproportionation reaction produces methane and formaldehyde. In this second reaction it is assumed that one of the methoxy groups is stabilized by a Ti interstitial, which results in C-O bond cleavage, desorption of formaldehyde and methane, and oxidation of the surface.  We have also thoroughly investigated oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of methanol from V2O5, V2O6, and V3O9 &ndash; decorated TiO2(110) surfaces.  Deposited V2O5 clusters on TiO2(110) surfaces are not active in the ODH of methanol at any temperature, indicating that V2O5 is not the catalytically active species in the vanadia/TiO2(110) catalyst.  This result is not surprising when one considers the stability of supported V2O5.  DFT calculations show that V2O5 adsorbed on a clean, defect-free rutile TiO2(110) surface is quite stable, and requires more than 1 eV of energy to convert the V2O5 to a reactive form.  On the other hand, the addition of a single oxygen atom results in an active cluster.  Formaldehyde production via methanol ODH was readily observed from V2O6 clusters deposited on reduced TiO2(110).  Furthermore, we have also found that the reactivity of the V2O6 clusters is strongly dependent on the oxidation state of the TiO2(110) surface.  V2O6 clusters deposited on stoichiometric TiO2(110) surfaces produced both formaldehyde and methyl formate via methanol ODH.  V2O6 clusters deposited on a pre-oxidized TiO2(110) produced exclusively methyl formate via methanol ODH.  Careful STM imaging and DFT calculations showed that the structure of the V2O6 cluster on the surface is responsible for the difference in reactivity.  The gas-phase structure of V2O6+ contains a peroxo group.  The peroxo group is broken when the V2O6 cluster binds to the reduced TiO2(110) surface.  The peroxo group remains intact when the V2O6 cluster binds to the TiO2(110) surface.  Finally, we have observed strong formaldehyde and methyl formate desorption from V3O9 clusters on a reduced TiO2(110).  Methyl formate desorption at 360 K represents the lowest temperature desorption state of any methanol ODH product observed.  We have analyzed the structure of the V3O9 clusters on a reduced TiO2(110) by STM and DFT and found that the most probable V3O9 geometry has at least one intact peroxo group.  Graduate students funded by this grant have had the opportunity to interact continuously with three different research groups, and have acquired hands-on experience in a large number of techniques of surface science, gas-phase chemistry, scanned probe microscopy, and high level theory.  Researchers supported by this grant (including PIs) have also been part of several outreach programs to K-12 schools in the Santa Barbara area.  In addition, researchers have visited high schools in the Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties to discuss their research and its impact as well as to promote science education.
