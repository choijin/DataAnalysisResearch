<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rationale for the Workshop.  With the growing maturity and popularity of cloud computing in the commercial arena, cloud computing is likely to become a dominant computing substrate for diverse types of applications and services in the future in the areas of scientific computing, transportation applications, and health-care informatics.  Although many of the research advances made by the research investigators funded by NSF's CNS Division have been critical to the success of cloud computing, the intent of this event was to help NSF and other funding agencies to develop a coherent vision of cloud computing from a scientific perspective.    With this goal in mind, funding was requested and approved to organize a workshop style meeting of approximately 50-60 NSF principal investigators to develop a coherent research vision and agenda for the future research in cloud computing.   Activities &amp; Outcomes   1. In late December 2010, an invitation letter was electronicallydistributed to the PIs in the CNS Division. PI Agrawal and Program Director Goudaidentified the following topical areas as the focus of the meeting:          Cloud Architectures and Systems            Network Support for the Cloud                 Data Portability, Consistency, and Management  Programming Models for the Cloud  Fault Masking in the Cloud            Cloud Security, Privacy, and Auditing Cloud Debugging, Certification, and Update            Cloud Self-Monitoring and Autonomic Control            Cloud Inter-operability and Standardization            Green Clouds Cloud Test-Beds   2.
