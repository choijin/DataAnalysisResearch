<AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award provides funding for the development of a nano-manufacturing process on flexible devices.  The development of this process will couple Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing process with molecularly-engineered nanoparticle thin film transfer technology to produce flexible chemical sensor arrays.  The process parameters controlling the chemical and physical properties associated with the nanostructured flexible devices, and the factors controlling the interfacial interactions between the nanostructured thin films and the flexible substrates will be determined.  An effective processing route for transferring nanoparticle-structured thin films onto flexible array devices with controllable adhesions, address precision, and interparticle spatial properties will be demonstrated.  The electrical properties of the nanostructured flexible devices under various structural, mechanical, flexibility, and environmental manipulations will be characterized.  The sensor response characteristics of an integrated flexible sensor array system will be evaluated in terms of performance and reliability for the detection of VOCs.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results will lead to advancement in understanding the design criteria between nanostructure engineering and large-scale R2R manufacturing for producing nanostructured flexible devices.  The primary goal of this work is to establish the correlation between the device electrical properties and the flexibility parameters under various environmental conditions in the fundamental front, and demonstrate the nano-manufacturing process for transferring molecularly-engineered nanoparticle thin films onto flexible sensor array devices in the application front.   The accomplishment of this goal will help achieve low-cost and scale-up integration of nanostructured materials and flexible functional devices.  The capability of the nanostructured flexible chemical sensor arrays for reliable and multiplexing detection of VOCs and toxic gases will benefit the society in addressing the increasing environmental concerns over air pollution and quality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In Today's society, there are clear needs to address the increasing environmental concerns over air quality and to develop portable devices for point-of-care detection. These needs required capabilities of reliable and sensitive detection of volatile chemicals and toxic gases, but also scalable manufacturing processes that produce low-cost and high-performance sensors products.  This project represents an important step in developing these capabilities by understanding how nanoomaterials interfaces and roll-to-toll fabrication technologies can be coupled in an effective nano-manufacturing process.  This understanding focuses on creation of flexible sensors that are potentially commercializable by industrial partners for integration into scalable sensor manufacturing processes.  The basic concept stems from the promise that the coupling of nanostructured materials and flexible substrates would exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity to chemical/biological species and would enable low cost in manufacturing electronic devices with conformal adaptivity. To harness the nanostructured properties in a flexible sensor platform, this project features an academic-industrial collaboration team with experts in nanotechnology, chemical sensors and industrial engineering.  While the academic researchers focus on fundamental understanding of factors controlling the nano-manufacturing processes, the industrial partner focuses on device hardware/software platform for integration of the nano-manufactured sensors into portable devices.  In contrast to traditional approaches, a key element of the sensors developed in this project features multifunction.  One example involves a flexible, conformal, or wearable sensor that not only detects chemical species but also responds to physical or environmental changes in a predictable way.  The findings from this project have an important implication for the design of sensors in terms of their signal magnitude and device orientation for highly sensitive detection of chemicals or device deformation in complex sensing environment or on complex curved surfaces for a wide range of applications, including wearable electronics and skin sensors for tracking stretching and twisting with high directional sensitivity.  In comparison with traditional time-consuming and high-cost manufacturing processes, the integration of nanomaterials assembling and printing processes in roll-to-roll fabrication enables low-cost manufacturing with an added value in product wearability. One example involves nanoink stamping or printing and thermal or laser sintering for creating sensor devices on flexible substrates, which has demonstrated promises for portable and wearable detection of chemical species and environmental monitoring of air pollution, and also for sensing biomarkers from human breath (e.g., acetone and other biomarker molecules associated with diabetes breath). This simple "printing-sintering-printing" process is potentially viable for integration as a fully-printable and versatile process in roll-to-roll manufacturing of low-cost and portable electronic devices.
