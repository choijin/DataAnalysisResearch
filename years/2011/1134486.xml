<AbstractNarration>1134486&lt;br/&gt;Subramanian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photocatalysis and nanomaterial fabrication are one of the keys to developing renewable energy sources. PIs Vaidyanathan Subramanian of the University of Nevada Reno and Muhammad Huda of University of Texas at Arlington have received an award to test the hypothesis that a class of stable multi-functional bandgap-engineered composite oxide nanomaterials (BECONs) can be constructed with inexpensive, eco-friendly, and earth abundant elements. These BECONs will be used in photocatalysis and enable new solar-driven processes for energy generation, producing solar fuels such as hydrogen from water and methane or methanol from CO2. The integrated theoretical and experimental research involves studying a promising model system of photoactive BECONs from the pyrochlore family (A2B2O7) that drive water-splitting reactions using visible light. BECON using Bi, Ti, and Fe will be synthesized using a novel reverse micelle method. Through the collaboration, the structure-property-relationships, multi-functionality, and photocatalytic activity of these model materials will be investigated. Density functional theory studies will help interpret experimental data and drive materials design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several features of this proposal are unique and may offer transformative outcomes. First, one of the limits in solar energy driven processes is the ability to use the entire spectrum of light to produce photocatalysis and energy. New materials with suitable bandgaps are always being sought for this use. The PIs have already obtained some encouraging preliminary data which supports the potential of BECONS to convert visible light and not just the ultraviolet light to energy service. In addition the use of non-exotic elements is in line with the current direction for the sustainable material search. Finally the collaborative efforts marry the predictions resulting from the modeling work with the experimental synthesis and testing work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational/outreach objectives of the proposal include a new undergraduate course that integrates content from the research program to teach photoelectrochemistry concepts; a toolkit for screening photoactive materials for solar energy conversion applications for undergraduate and graduate student use;  and to coordinate and continue advising the sustainable energy forum, a popular student organization that the UNR-PI has conceived and established at University of Nevada, Reno, that focuses on awareness about alternate energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is interesting, the results could be significant, and this project is a part of the Program efforts at supporting catalytic programs in renewable energy. This proposed work will have an impact on scientific and technological aspects of solar driven processes to facilitate efficient harvesting of visible light to deliver photocatalytic solar energy assisted fuel production.</AbstractNarration>

A battery of techniques were used to determine the properties of the BECONs. Through this project our teams of 12 individuals led by two PIs have successful shown that modeling / simulation can be a critical component to assist experimentalists trying to design photocatalysts.     Basic concept and research As a proof-of-concept, we have used the elements Bismuth, Titanium, Iron, Manganese, and Oxygen to form the photocatalysts. These materials were used as building blocks and assembled into a photocatalyst that exist in the pyrochlore phase. The choice of these elements allowed us to successfully use visible light along with UV light to activate the photocatalyst. The use of visible light is important since it is a significant part of the solar spectrum. Further, we have also determined that the photocatalyst can be prepared using a now patented method that results in a good control of the physical features (such as shape, size, and size distribution) of the photocatalyst. The fundamental studies that we focused on was light-driven charge separation, transport, and application to redox processes.     Relevance and application The application of this material has been tested in two areas of current relevance and interest: Clean fuel production and environmental remediation. In the former case, the produced material were successfully shown to generate hydrogen from a mixture of water and an alcohol. The inclusion of eco-friendly and earth-abundant elements such as iron favorably improved the hydrogen generation. In the latter case, a prototype effluent from a textile mill waste was targeted for remediation. The photocatalysts were shown to remediate the pollutant effectively using a combination of UV and visible light.  The materials were also noted to be reusable after repeated application indicating that they are promising from a sustainability standpoint.     Beyond committed project deliverables. Due to the timely evolution and exploding interest in graphene &ndash; based materials, we have also examined the effect of graphene &ndash; based materials as an additive with the photocatalysts we developed. We successfully integrated the graphene-based material with our oxides. Further, the composite thus prepared were also shown to be useful in photocatalysis. Specifically, the carbon additive allowed for improving the photocatalytic activity multifold within a few minutes. While this is an exciting preliminary result, it remains to be seen how the role of carbon can improve the activity over several hours.     Training of individuals Both PIs were able to interact and discuss the evolution of the project from time to time. They facilitated the training of 9 undergraduates, 4 graduates, 1 post-doctoral scientist, and one research scientist across their groups in Reno and Arlington during the grant period. The project allowed all the participants to benefit from interaction between the tiered knowledge levels. The experience allowed students at both campus to produce graduate thesis, obtain employment, and contribute to the work force. The undergraduates were able to receive recognition in the form of awards from the University and research fellowships. The contents of this research were disseminated across conferences and invited presentations at the national and international stage.     Products from this work The work resulted in the production and completion of 12 Publications [9 peer reviewed articles, 2 US full patents, 1 educational ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
