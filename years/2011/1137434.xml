<AbstractNarration>This project centers on a two-day workshop that will help focus the Earth surface process research community on potential ways of contributing to NSF's Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) initiative. In particular, the project aims develop ideas for research opportunities in sustainable energy pathways and to share these broadly.  The workshop will involve 15-20 participants from diverse fields, backgrounds, and career levels, and will produce a 5-10 page white paper on research opportunities in sustainable energy pathways that will be disseminated across the Earth surface research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcome of this project was a workshop and associated white paper on the ways in which research on natural processes occurring at the EarthÆs surface can support and enhance societyÆs ability to live sustainably in the surface environment. This was motivated by a major new initiative at the National Science Foundation (NSF): Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES).  The workshop took place over two days in October of 2011 at the University of Minnesota and involved 18 participants from across the US, plus two members of NSFÆs Earth surface group.    The group developed an overview of some of the many ways that human interactions with the surface environment influence sustainability. These range from familiar issues such as the effect of roads on the landscape to dramatic examples such as "dust bowls" to more subtle ones like the effects of invisible contamination in buried sediments. We also found that SEES offers a wealth of new opportunities for education at all levels linking the surface environment with sustainability. The attached figure illustrates some of the ways in which sustainability is linked to the science of the EarthÆs surface &ndash; the æcritical zoneÆ for life and human activity.
