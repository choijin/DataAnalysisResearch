<AbstractNarration>The Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center is a national partnership of community colleges, high schools, universities, informal educational organizations, research institutions, marine industries, professional societies, and working professionals. MATE's mission is to improve marine technical education and increase the number of highly-skilled technical professionals who enter ocean-related occupations.  The Center characterizes and researches trends in the ocean workforce, identifies the knowledge and skills this workforce needs, places this information in the hands of educational institutions at all levels, and works to ensure that curricula and programs are appropriately preparing students to meet workforce needs. MATE's programs represent unique approaches to engaging students in STEM learning experiences and developing the capacity for increasing the nation's technological workforce.  The geographic distribution of MATE partners makes products of this Center available to a broad audience; the strategies developed as a result of MATE's research into barriers of participation help to engage and involve traditionally underrepresented groups. These efforts prepare a diverse workforce that ensures U.S. competitiveness in a global economy that is currently, and increasingly, dependent on ocean activities.</AbstractNarration>

The MATE Underwater Robotics competition was the focus of two films (a documentary, Underwater Dreams, and a major motion picture, Spare Parts) and a book (also called Spare Parts).   In 2012 the MATE Center created SeaMATE.  SeaMATE is a social enterprise that provides community college students with income and work experience while generating products that support marine technical education.

Excerpts of the book can be viewed here www.marinetech.org/underwater_robotics/.    More than 100 detailed educational modules and videos have been developed by MATE staff and education partners to accompany the topics in this textbook (see http://www.marinetech.org/curriculum/).  In June 2013 MATE created a password protection site for our curriculum products.   In 2015, 29,857 different users logged in to view these resources.    MATE has developed detailed occupational guidelines for seven marine occupations that can be viewed herehttp://www.marinetech.org/workforce/.  The integration of these guidelines with more than 50 other marine careers can be found at www.oceancareers.com, a MATE product produced with NSF funding from a COSEE grant.  In addition, the Center disseminates workforce information through the website and in/at webinars, conferences, and faculty workshops.
