<AbstractNarration>Tapeworms are gut-dwelling parasites known from all vertebrate classes. Tapeworms of sharks and rays have been useful bioindicators of elasmobranch migration, distribution, and feeding. The proposed research focuses on the elasmobranch tapeworm order Lecanicephalidea. Recent contributions to lecanicephalidean diversity (29 new species and 6 new genera in the past 10 years) have created a lag in our understanding family-level relationships of genera within this order resulting in the need for an updated classification. The specific goals of this study are to: (1) generate the first molecular phylogeny for a subset of lecanicephalidean genera; and (2) identify morphological characters supporting family-level relationships using standard techniques (light and scanning microscopy and histology) and novel techniques, traditionally not used in this group (transmission electron microscopy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will add to our knowledge of tapeworm biodiversity, evolution, and to host-parasite relationships. Increased understanding of evolutionary relationships in this group will hone our predictions about diversity in selected hosts and geographic areas. A series of parasitology lectures will be taught to Kansas high school biology student, introducing Kansas parasites in the classroom and field, as well as elasmobranch tapeworms and their hosts. Collaborations will be fostered between parasitologists in the U.S., Mexico, and Czech Republic.</AbstractNarration>
