<AbstractNarration>The dayside magnetosphere plays a crucial role in controlling the mass and energy in-flow from the solar wind (ionized plasma blown from the Sun). NASA's THEMIS spacecraft were launched into favorable orbits to study the interaction of solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. These spacecraft are often positioned so that geomagnetic field lines connect them to the upper atmospheric regions in view of the ground-based observing stations. Relating the satellite data to their auroral footprints has revolutionized abilities to study dynamic processes in the solar wind and geospace. During winter times the high-latitude regions can be permanently in dark permitting optical observations of the aurora even at magnetic midday. As two-dimensional dynamic images of the aurora are signatures of plasma processes operating on the flux tube at some distance above the Earth, the joint studies of the THEMIS plasma data and optical instruments deployed at the South Pole and Automatic Geophysical Observatories in the Antarctic provide a unique opportunity to answer four specific questions: (1) Do existing geomagnetic field models accurately map the dayside magnetospheric boundaries? (2) Are the dayside soft aurora "footprints" of the magnetospheric cusp and whether they occur on open field lines? (3) When do latitudinal motions of the dayside aurora represent in-out motion of the Earth's magnetopause? (4) What is the mechanism responsible for the production of the frequently observed Poleward Moving Auroral Forms? The Antarctic optical observations provide a high-resolution dynamic view of the auroral context related to the in situ satellite measurements; such coordinated data exists from the austral winter of 2007 to today. This research also contributes to the training and education of both the graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major objective of the project was to understand how the dayside magnetosphere controls the mass and energy in-flow from the solar wind (the ionized plasma travelling from the Sun to Earth). The Earth?s magnetosphere is illustrated in Figure 1.   The magnetospheric the most energy significant to magnetospheric particle energy is trapped in the plasma sheet.  Auroral particles are injected into the inne magnetosphere on the night side and the electrons drift towards the dayside (blue arrows). The related precipitation is seen located somewhat equatorward but still within the auroral zone as hard auroras in the all sky imager blue wavelength channel. On the dayside electrons gain direct entry on the dayside and create bright auroras that have strong emission in the red wavelength channel in the all sky imager (red arrow). These "red" auroras are located polewards.  Our all sky imager data with simultaneous measurements with the THEMIS satellites showed that these red auroras occur in the region of open field lines resulting from direct plasma entry from solar wind via the the magnetosheath. In this project we showed that the boundary of the closed/open field line region on the dayside is equatorward of the part of the auroral oval containing the "red" soft auroras and poleward from the region containing the "blue" hard auroras.   Comparing the mean energy of the electrons measured at the THEMIS satellites and in the aurora on the same field line we found that the electrons had to undergo some modest  acceleration on the way down.  As we have seen the direct entry solar wind particles create the poleward soft "red" shown as a yellow auroral belt in the figure and the trapped electron more energetic auroras on closed field lines are shown as a blue belt at lower latitude. When the Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in the solar wind is southward then "re-connection" takes place between the Earth field and the IMF at the dayside sub-solar region.  We illustrated one of the THMEIS satellites near this re-connection region. Following re-connection, the plasma drifts anti-sunward across the poles illustrated with the thick black arrow.  Poleward moving auroral forms (PMAF-s) are generated in the poleward soft auroral belt and they commence traversing poleward of the cusp auroras moving anti-sunward.  This is illustrated with the red arrow in the northern hemisphere.  In Figure 2 we show one of the the satellite THB which is a monitor of the  IMF an solar wind at the optimum location, close by and directly upwind of the magnetosphere.  PMAF-s are considered to be signatures of dayside re-connection of the IMF and the geomagnetic field.  The experimental evidence for this is still somewhat limited. The fact that PMAF-s are seen in the open field region (within the red cusp aurora) at latitudes higher than the open-closed magnetospheric field boundary suggests that if PMAF-s are indeed associated with re-connection, then they are an delayed auroral response occurring when the reconnected flux is already moving in the region of open field lines.  We have found that the drift of PMAF-s is consistent with drifts associated with ionospheric plasma as measured by radars.  The direction of these drifts are strongly influenced by the IMF Y component. The electric fields responsible for these drifts are consistent with the theoretically proposed hemispheric (north-south) asymmetry. Most of the work regarding PMAF-s and the corresponding refereed publication was the work of one of our undergraduate student interns who got prime authorship in recognition of her work.  In a collaborative work with UCLA our all sky imager data of PMAF-s were compared to THEMIS satellite data and they found that IMF and solar wind signatures correlated with PMAF occurrence in many cases.
