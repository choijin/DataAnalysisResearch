<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award is to investigate a novel joining process, autogenous (no filler material) laser brazing, for joining dissimilar biocompatible metals.  Specifically, the project aims to develop a fundamental understanding of autogenous laser brazed joints by considering the thermal, kinetic, and thermodynamic aspects of the process, to experimentally and numerically investigate the effect of non-equilibrium processing conditions on the thermodynamic properties of the weld metal mixture and their effect on the resulting phases and interface microstructures, and to significantly enhance the knowledge of intermetallic phase formation in dissimilar material pairs and investigate potential avenues for their mitigation or elimination.  The projected approach to address this issue is by limiting mixing of the materials and rapidly cooling the molten metal without the use of filler materials. Phase, microstructure, and strength will be characterized.  The results will validate the modeling efforts which will consist of finite cooling rate phase formation and spatially resolved composition calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits of this project are expected to enable the design and fabrication of innovative, implantable medical devices that selectively incorporate biocompatible metals with unique properties to significantly enhance device performance or introduce groundbreaking functionalities.  The need to join these materials stems from the desire to integrate their unique properties in a robust and cost-effective manner. The main impediment to widespread use of dissimilar metal joints, however, is the formation of brittle intermetallic phases within the joints.  The PI's strong support by a key industrial partner could lead to rapid development of real life applications of these devices with broad societal impact. The processing techniques, analysis methods, and predictive capabilities developed for the biocompatible metal pairs addressed in this project can be extended to other material pairs for aircraft structure and automobile battery applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A novel joining process termed as "autogenous laser brazing" of dissimilar metals has been developed.  The process minimizes heat input by slightly melting one metal and wetting it onto the other.  In this way, an exceedingly narrow yet strong weld forms (Figure: Optical micrograph of joint cross-section) and minimal element mixing occurs (Figure: EDX line scan composition profiles).  As a result, the formation of brittle intermetallic components is reduced, as evidenced in electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) measurements (Figure: EBSD/EDS Phase Identification Map) and numerical simulation (Figure: Phase development curves as predicted by CALPHAD simulation).  Mechanical testing also showed the join strength is higher than that of the metals.  Although the investigation is carried out for the nickel titanium and stainless steel pair, the principles apply to other pairs.  For micro-scale medical devices applications, both wire and tubular configurations in the order of submillimeter in diameter were investigated.  For the wire form, the process involves only laser heating along the axial direction, while for the tubular form, an additional rotation motion by a wire is found beneficial to further limit excessive heat input.  To further improve the joint strength, the effect of using a cup and cone interfacial geometry for joining of NiTi-SS wires was explored.  Joints that had a certain apex angle of the cone were found to consistently have higher fracture strengths than the cones with other angles and the result was theoretically understood.  To further investigate the potential of the process for manufacturing implantable medical devices, the biocompatibility of the joined materials was investigated.  Laser joined samples underwent nickel release rate, polarization (Figure: Polarization response of metal samples in PBS solution), hemolysis, and cytotoxicity testing.  Competing effects regarding grain refinement and galvanic effects were found to influence the corrosion response.   Numerical modeling of the corrosion currents along the wires, by making use of polarization data, helped to explain these results (Figure: Numerical simulation results for the distribution of the electric potential in the PBS solution). All of these results indicate that the autogenous laser brazing process results in joints with good biocompatibility as well.           Last Modified: 11/28/2015       Submitted by: Y.
