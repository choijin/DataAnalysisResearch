<AbstractNarration>Conventional climate models continue to struggle to properly represent large-scale tropical moist convective systems including convectively coupled equatorial waves) and the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). Because these disturbances have global impacts on weather and climate through atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections, this casts a shadow of doubt on the reliability of climate prediction on different timescales ranging from intraseasonal to seasonal and longer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project has the goals of improving understanding of the dynamics of these disturbances, and enhancing the ability to simulate them by using a new Lagrangian atmospheric model that simulates atmospheric circulations by predicting motions of individual air parcels. Educational impacts of this project will include further development of climate modeling capabilities at Yale and Susquehanna Universities, which will benefit both undergraduate and graduate students by introducing them to cutting edge techniques in atmospheric modeling and convective parametrization. In addition there is a plan to educate the general public about the fundamentals of weather and climate modeling. Thus the project has substantial broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we further developed and applied a new Lagrangian atmospheric model (LAM) that showed promise for being able to accurately simulate tropical weather systems.  Although this model is for the atmosphere, it is easiest to visualize how the Lagrangian method works by considering its application to a body of water (see Image 1).  Fluid circulations are predicted by calculating the motions of individual fluid elements, referred to as parcels, which exert pressure on their nearest neighbors.  At the beginning of this project, the LAM was quite simple, useful primarily for simulating one kind of tropical weather system over the oceans.  During the course of the project we made many improvements to the model such as including a new method for calculating evaporation and heat coming from ocean surfaces, improving the accuracy of the model's treatment radiative heating, and implementing a new global geometry and land surface model (see Image 2). This made the model capable of predicting global atmospheric circulations and precipitation patterns that result from a specified sea surface temperature field, which has allowed us to make more detailed comparisions with models used for climate prediction, so that we can further assess the utility of the LAM.  Our results are encouraging.  The LAM accurately simulates the behavior of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), a giant tropical weather system that alters weather around the world when it is active, and which has been notoriously difficult to simulate with climate models for decades.  The LAM MJO has a period of 40-50 days, propagates eastward about 5 m/s, and has about the same amplitude as the observed MJO (see Image 3 top panels). It also has accurate zonal wind perturbations and moisture variations (see LAM MJO bottom panels).  While many models have difficulty generating accurate precipitation fields when they are tuned to have a strong MJO, the LAM can be tuned to have precipitation patterns that are competitive with other climate models and a realistic MJO at the same time (see Image 4).
