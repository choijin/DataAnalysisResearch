<AbstractNarration>Computers and people live in a world governed by policy.  At the lowest level, policies determine how information flows within networks; at the highest level, they describe how users' personal information is shared across applications.  Of course, end-users, as policy authors, make mistakes: rules can have unintended consequences and multiple policies can interact in ways that their authors didn't intend.  Users can benefit from tools to help them understand the policies they write and maintain.  Policy analysis refers to rigorous methods for detecting these situations before they cause harm.  Given the personal and sensitive information migrating to cloud-based applications, analyzers for mainstream policy contexts have clear impact on computing infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior research has shown that first-order logic is a suitable foundation for capturing and analyzing many application- and network-based policies.  In particular, analyses based on scenario-finding provide concrete and detailed feedback for policy authors.  This project focuses on techniques to make scenario-finding effective for real-world policies based on first-order logic. Specifically, the project pursues (1) foundational research on algorithms for model-finding in first-order logic, (2) methods to analyze federations of policies across multiple levels of abstraction (such as found in cloud computing), (3) handling additional policy features such as numeric constraints and dynamic network routing, and (4) methods to automatically generate repairs to policies against requirements or scenarios.  The PIs' existing Margrave policy analyzer serves as a testbed and deployment vehicle for this research.</AbstractNarration>

Given the personal and sensitiveinformation migrating to cloud-based applications, analyzers formainstream policy contexts have clear impact on computinginfrastructure.  This project developed a variety of tools that help people understandpolicies: in computer networks, in social media, in computersecurity, and other domains.  Our tools can be used by people writingpolicies from scratch, they can be used to help people modify policiessafely, and they can be used by ordinary users to understand thepolicies they are subject to.   The use of such analysis tools is broadly referred to as the use of"formal methods". An obstacle to the widespread adoption of formalmethods is the fact that they typically require a high degree ofmathematical sophistication to be used effectively.  A key focus of ourwork on this project has been to structure our tools so that they can beused by people not trained in formal methods.   Formal methods research has traditionally been evaluated only in thecontext of its mathematical correcteness.  There has been essentially noprincipled investigation of the human factors involved in formalmethods.  As another contribution of our project, we have embarked uponthe first, to our knowledge, crowd-sourced study of formal methods,exploring the efficacy of certain design choices of our tools bymeasuring user performance in controlled experiments.  This promises tobe a fruitful new line of research in the intersection of formal methodsand human-computer interaction.
