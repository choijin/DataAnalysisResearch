<AbstractNarration>In this project, the principal investigator proposes to develop a deeper understanding of isometry groups of homogeneous spaces by evolving Riemannian and Lie structures to look for highly symmetric Riemannian metrics on a given homogeneous space.  The hybrid techniques used lie at the intersection of Riemannian geometry and Geometric Invariant Theory and are motivated by geometric evolutions like the Ricci flow.  In the presence of a transitive nilpotent group of isometries, the proposed techniques have been successfully employed by the principal investigator to show that Ricci soliton metrics on nilmanifolds have maximal isometry groups.  The principal investigator proposes to develop this approach in the more general setting that the transitive group of isometries is solvable to achieve similar results for Einstein and Ricci soliton metrics on solvmanifolds.  Similar questions on compact nilmanifolds will also be addressed.  As several of the proprosed problems can naturally be rephrased in the language of Geometric Invariant Theory, this avenue will be explored as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is devoted to the fundamental problem in geometry of finding a best shape for a given object.  The objects of interest are homogeneous spaces, which are spaces having the property that every point looks the same as every other point.  These spaces serve as basic examples across many branches of mathematics and have been a source of inspiration in modern geometry for over a century.  Although homogeneous spaces have been tirelessly explored, there are still many fundamental questions that have not been resolved.  The principal investigator will address this question of finding preferred metrics, aiming to show that Einstein and Ricci solitons metrics are the most symmetric choice of geometry on a fixed homogeneous space, when they exist.The PI will continue his work, supervising undergraduate research and attracting graduate students for area of research. The project has the potential to provide attractive and challenging opportunities for the undergraduate and graduate students of his university through the study of the Ricci flow on solvable Lie groups.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, the PI worked to advance the state of knowledge on homogeneous Einstein spaces.  Homogeneous Einstein spaces can be considered as natural model spaces - e.g. the Earth is not perfectly round, but we compare it to a nice round sphere; the round sphere is an example of a homogeneous Einstein spaces.  In principle, determining which homogeneous spaces admit Einstein metrics should be straightforward as the problem reduces, in theory, to solving a set of polynomials simultaneously.  However, the reality is much more complicated.  Even in low dimensions (such as dimension 6), the polynomial equations are too complicated to be analyzed by any known techniques.  To approach the problem above, the PI and other researchers are working to develop a new set of tools to determine which homogeneous spaces are able to admit Einstein metrics - and what these metrics look like when they exist.  Although we have not finished the long sought classification of homogeneous Einstein spaces, over the past four years substantial progress has been made to this end.  The structure of homogeneous Einstein spaces is now more clear and we can now definitively say that certain homogeneous spaces in question cannot admit Einstein metrics.  In addition to working on the classification of homogeneous Einstein spaces, the PI worked with Carolyn Gordon to prove that Einstein solvmanifolds are spaces with "maximal symmetry".  This result confirms the popular belief that Einstein metrics should have extra symmetry properties - beyond those other metrics.  The PI also worked with Peter Petersen and Michael Williams to prove new stability results for the Ricci flow around non-compact, homogeneous Ricci solitons.  In March of 2012, the PI helped co-organize a conference on Ricci solitons and symmetry.  In May of 2014, the PI helped co-organized a conference on gorup actions in Riemannian geometry.  The organizers were able to include many junior mathematicians, as well as several women and other underrepresented groups, as both participants and speakers.  During the project period, the PI also worked with graduate and undergraduate students on research projects.  The PI trained students in the modern techniques used to study Ricci flow, curve shortening flow, and their discrete analogues.
