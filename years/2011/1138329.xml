<AbstractNarration>Proposal # 1138329&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Prof. Olivia A. Graeve, Alfred University&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  Prof. Erica Corral, University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;Title: Enabling participation of Hispanic Students in SHPE 2011 Graduate Activities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposers are requesting support from the National Science Foundation Human Resource Development (ENG) to provide travel funds for undergraduate students, both from 2-year and 4-year colleges, graduate students, high school teachers, and faculty, to participate in the SHPE 2011 annual meeting (October 26-30, 2011, Anaheim, CA). The PI's are very experienced at providing technical assistance with paper and poster presentations. A draft of the proposed agenda is included in the proposal as well as evaluation information and its implementation. The proposal well done, very cost-effective and I highly recommend approval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal provides travel funds to enable the participation of Hispanic students, engineering faculty and high school teachers in the Annual Meeting of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). Attendance to the meeting will promote mentorship between students and faculty; broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in engineering; and enhance students, faculty and high school teacher's ability to develop engineering-related ideas and projects. The Principal Investigator is a valuable resource for students given her work with the SHPE meeting over the past 10 years.&lt;br/&gt;Student, faculty and high school teacher's participation in the annual meeting of SHPE will lead to improved research and mentorship, regionally and nationally, as well as to attracting and retaining underrepresented minority students in engineering. Moreover, the conference will give students access to faculty and researchers in the field of engineering; thereby building and enhancing networks, partnerships, and potential mentoring relationships between students, universities, and the engineering research community-at-large. The results will be disseminated nationally through the SHPE magazine and website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omnia El-Hakim, Program Director of Diversity and Outreach</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The philosophy and vision for the SHPE Graduate Program is to promote graduate education and academic careers among Hispanic engineers through a variety of preparatory Workshops, Panels, and student competitions, but most importantly through the establishment of a network of undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty that can serve as mentors to each other, so as to promote success at the highest levels of academia.  These activities have found an excellent home at the annual meetings of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) during the last fifteen years, starting with a small technical paper competition in the early years, and resulting in the current NSF-funded program, which has many components.  The program is specifically focused on increasing the number of Hispanic engineering professors at all levels of the academic ladder starting with support for current Assistant and Associate Professors and moving down the line to graduate and undergraduate students, who will be the future academic workforce of this country.  While many excellent programs across the country are focused on improving education at the K-12 level, the PI (Prof. Olivia A. Graeve) has seen the need to establish a network of individuals at the higher levels of formal education and increase the number of Hispanic engineering faculty in this country.  Why? There is no doubt that a pipeline from high school to college needs to be firmly established among Hispanics, but once students arrive in college, they encounter very few Hispanic engineering role models and "cheerleaders" that look and speak like them.  The SHPE Graduate Program is a response to this challenge.  More specifically, the objective of this program is to change the dreadful statistics in regards to Hispanic engineering faculty numbers, in turn, providing the role models needed by future generations of Hispanic engineers.  The philosophy of this program is divided among three main objectives and interconnected activities:  1. The development of a network of Hispanic engineering faculty that can serve as mentors for each other in order to promote their advancement.  Specific Activities:  Encourage participation in SHPE conference graduate activities as judges for the technical paper and poster competitions, speakers in research symposia at the conference, speakers and panelists in Graduate Institute and GRAD Lab workshops, and participants in the annual Faculty Dinner at the conference.  Also, the establishment (which just happened this year) of a SHPE Young Investigator Award, to reward achievements in engineering for the Assistant Professors.  2. The development of activities for graduate students to promote careers in academia.  SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES:  (1) The Graduate Institute, which constitutes a special set of workshops and activities that run concurrently with the SHPE conference.  (2) The graduate technical paper and poster competitions to allow students interactions among each other and among professionals in their fields.  3. The development of activities for undergraduate students to promote graduate education.  SPECIFIC ACTIVITY:  (1) The GRAD Lab, which is a GEM Consortium program that we schedule during the SHPE meeting and enhance it with connections to the faculty and the Graduate Institute participants.  (2) The undergraduate technical paper and poster competitions to allow students interactions among each other and among professionals in their fields.
