<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Metal oxide nanopowders play major roles in applications including recording media, catalysts, as fillers for plastics, or for forming ceramic prosthetics (hip replacements). Most commercial nanopowders are made by flame processing volatile, toxic and polluting metal chlorides. Researchers at the University of Michigan (UM) have developed a process that escapes metal chlorides furnishing the same products while greatly expanding the number and types of oxides accessible. This approach has generated metal oxide nanopowders that offer novel lasing behavior; act as new catalysts for auto and diesel exhaust cleanup as well as providing facile routes to prosthetic ceramics with exceptional control of final properties.  The UM process uses turbulent flames to combust metal-organic complexes (not chlorides) dissolved in alcohols. Despite the unique materials made, the exact process(es) whereby combustion generates metal ions that condense to form nuclei, which coalesce to form particles primarily of kinetic products are unknown. Given the considerable potential of this process for creating novel nanomaterials, researchers at UM are conducting basic studies including computer modeling to delineate the steps involved in particle formation to identify the scientific principles whereby nanopowders form. These principles will then be used to design the synthesis of new nanopowders for applications including catalysts, ceramic materials with controlled/novel properties including for example transparent ceramics or lithium battery electrolytes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Liquid feed flame spray pyrolysis (LF-FSP), as developed at UM, provides a wide variety of single and mixed-metal oxide nanopowders that are often kinetic rather than the thermodynamic phases observed in most other nanoparticle syntheses. They have been shown to exhibit unique catalytic, photonic, electronic and ion conducting properties. LF-FSP uses a turbulent rather than a laminar flow flame. While laminar flow flames are easily modeled, turbulent flames are much less so. Consequently, most of the UM discoveries arise from empirical efforts. Researchers at UM believe that establishing a detailed understanding of the scientific underpinnings to LF-FSP processing will provide the basis for greatly expanding its utility in providing new nanopowders with novel properties especially for catalysts, photonic materials and in low temperature processing of dense, ceramic materials. The Laine and Violi groups have teamed together to develop a predictive model that identifies how specific processing parameters (e.g., temperature) contribute to the size and chemical composition of nanopowders. The model development is being guided and validated by the experimental techniques. In particular, they will explore the formation of spinel phase materials MOAl2O3 (M = Mg, Co, Ni, etc.) at compositions outside thermodynamic phase fields. The process variables that control the formation of these nanopowders are being assessed incisively to establish processing-property relationships of use in the modeling studies. The expected outcome entails controlled approaches to novel nanopowders for multiple practical applications.  Research done in both groups is being used to train graduate and undergraduate students in the design, synthesis, characterization and processing (and handling) of nanopowders. At the undergraduate level, students from the undergraduate research opportunity program (UROP) are working with graduate students to learn how to characterize nanopowders using multiple spectroscopic tools, to map properties and to use the characterization data to develop theoretical models of the formation processes and methods of controlling what materials/nanopowders form.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The synthesis, processing and properties of single and mixed-metal oxide nanopowders (NPs) are subjects of intense and continuing research. Industry produces kilotons/yr of TiO2, SiO2 and Al2O3 NPs via gas phase, flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) oxidizing metal chlorides in H2/O2 flames. Disparate rates of hydrolysis prevent synthesis of mixed-metal oxides.  At the UM we escape traditional FSP problems using liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis (LF-FSP) wherein alcohol solutions of metalloorganics aerosolized with O2 are combusted &asymp; 1000&deg;C and quenched &asymp; 1000&deg;C/100 msec providing dispersible, single/mixed-metal oxide NPs at 20-100 g/h. These NPs have original feed compositions with 20-100 nm average particle sizes, APSs.

The rapid quench produces NPs with novel (metastable) phases or phase compositions not seen in published phase diagrams.  Our objectives were trifold: (1) develop new basic science in processing multiphase NPs expanding compositions, morphologies and physical properties accessible using LF-FSP including fine-grained monolithic and thin film composites; (2) develop practical solutions to basic long term problems in ceramics processing and (3) model gas phase formation mechanisms that control particle and phase formation.    Basic Science&mdash;Intellectual Merit. Fundamental studies on processing temperature effects on NP size found, surprisingly, that longer carbon chain alcohols generate longer flame plumes but with little temperature variation (1250-1400&deg;C) contrary to the outcome anticipated.  In another study, we compared diffusion processes during sintering of nanopowder compacts (APSs 30-40 nm) made from atomically-mixed binary systems 0.25MO:1.0Al2O3 spinels (M = Mg, Ni, Co) with compacts from ball-milled mixtures of identical composition NPs (APSs 30-40 nm). Final microstructures were identical; contrary to the long subscribed "bottom-up" processing concept that atomically mixed NPs will provide finer microstructures and faster densification than NPs mixtures where stoichiometric homogeneity is at &asymp; 100 nm scale.  In contrast, atomically mixed Y3Al5O12 NPs sinter at slower rates than ball milled mixtures of the same composition leading to finer final (95 % dense) grain sizes (400 nm) for ball milled vs. atomically mixed systems (4-5 &micro;m). Atomically mixed NPs form YAG much earlier during sintering hindering further densification because of lower diffusion rates; ball milled mixtures sinter faster as YAG forms more slowly because of diffusion distances.  NPs, because their high surface curvature and small size, are very reactive. We are probing this reactivity to modify NP chemistries while maintaining their high surface areas. In collaboration with S. Noda of Waseda University we can transform (CoO)0.25(Al2O3)0.75 NPs into nano Co studded nano Al2O3 particles to produce novel catalysts producing single-walled carbon nanotube bundles as seen in Figure 1.  In a complementary study, heating single phase (TiO2)0.43(Al2O3)0.57 NPs in NH3/120 mL/min/1000&deg;C selectively nitrides the TiO2 and extracts it giving core-shell TiN-Al2O3 particles while retaining surface areas and NP APSs Figure 2.  We also extended our work on core-shell NPs to other systems producing nNPs as seen in Figures 3 and 4 which can be densified to give three phase composites in work that now shows bottom up processing is better than ball milled processing. In Figure 5 we processed dense, flexible films of Li+ conducting ceramics equal to liquid electrolytes.  In modeling studies we have developed models of particle growth and aggregation as illustrated in Figure 6.  Broader Impact. A practical example motivated by the flame temperature studies led to a direct route from ag-waste, rice hull ash, to Si(OEt)4 used to produce fumed silica.
