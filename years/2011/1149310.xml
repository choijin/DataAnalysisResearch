<AbstractNarration>This dissertation research project will investigate vowel harmony in Maasai, an Eastern Nilotic language with a million speakers in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. In a language with vowel harmony, some or all vowels in a word must share a particular characteristic, so certain types of vowels may not occur together in the same word. In Maasai, most words are pronounced either with the tongue root advanced for all vowels or retracted for all vowels. Vowel harmony is found in many languages, including Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, Igbo, and Mongolian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying vowel harmony in Maasai is important for several reasons. First, little work has been done on Maasai; all of the current analyses of Maasai vowel harmony depend on the same set of data from the 1950s. Second, vowel harmony in Maasai is extremely complex, and includes intricacies not found in any other language. Previous descriptions are inadequate, and none of the data are based on acoustic analysis. This project will fill that gap. The student investigator will record Maasai speakers in Tanzania in order to check the accuracy of data that have been reported in the literature, to provide new data, to perform acoustic analysis of the data, to present a phonological analysis of the data, and to make the data available to the wider linguistic community for further research. Careful analysis of such a complicated phonological system provides linguists with insights about the possible types of complex sound systems that humans are capable of learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Attaining a better understanding of a particular language&mdash;especially a language as unique as Maasai&mdash;is extremely valuable.  It gives us important insights into the types of systems found in human languages.  Linguists study language; phonologists study sound systems found in human languages.   Unraveling the mystery of human language grants us a valuable glimpse into the workings of the human mind.     The purpose of this research was to study a phonological phenomenon called vowel harmony in the Maasai language. Vowel harmony is found in many languages, including Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, Igbo, and Mongolian.  Assimilation processes occur in many languages: adjacent sounds become more similar to each other.  Vowel harmony is interesting because it is a long distance assimilation process; some or all vowels in a word must share certain features.  In Maasai, the presence of one vowel that is pronounced with the root of the tongue advanced [ATR] causes all other vowels to be produced with the root of the tongue forward. Vowel harmony has proven very difficult to account for in many phonological frameworks.     There are two main reasons why studying vowel harmony in Maasai is so important.  First, it has resisted analysis; harmony in Maasai is an extremely complex system and prior attempts to account for it fail or do not account for all the data.  The other reason is that, unlike other better studied languages with vowel harmony, not much work has been done on Maasai.  In fact, all of previous analyses of Maasai vowel harmony depended on the same set of data from the 1950s.  The purpose of this research was to make recordings of Maasai speakers, to perform acoustic analysis of the data, to check the accuracy of forms upon which certain analyses hinge, and to make the data available for further researchers.             Maasai speakers were recorded in Arusha, Tanzania.  A program called PRAAT was used to analyze the physical properties of the vowels themselves. It was determined that non-ATR vowels that undergo harmony are indistinguishable from ATR vowels that have not undergone assimilation. Some previous claims about the data were found to be incorrect.  All of the data can be accounted for within the Optimality Theory framework, a phonological theory used to account for patterns in the worldÆs languages.
