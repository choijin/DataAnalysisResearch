<AbstractNarration>Analysis on fractals is part of a program to develop ``rough analysis", where the underlying space is far from smooth.  Fractals have a lot of structure that can be used to advantage in this task.  Strichartz has contributed to the development of this area and its connections to classical ``smooth" analysis, and will continue his research in this area.  In particular, he will investigate problems in the following general categories:  Laplacians on Julia sets, Spectral theory, boundary value problems and Sobolev spaces, Hodge De Rham theory of k-forms, mean value properties of harmonic functions, the infinity-Laplacian, integral geometry, physically realistic models, Littlewood-Paley theory, sampling based on mean values, Peano curves, removable singularities , and thick carpets.  Some of the research will involve ``experimental mathematics" to be carried out in collaboration with undergraduate students (mainly REU students).  Strichartz has been a leader in the field for the past 15 years.  He has been able to bring to this area a broad expertise in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations and analysis on manifolds, and has succeeded in broadening the scope of research in this area.  This mathematics research project will continue this development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics research project deals the study of fractals. Scientists use fractals to model many real world phenomena.  Electrical engineers build antennae, and chemists build molecules with the geometry of specific fractals studied in this project.  The development of the mathematical theory of analysis on fractals may provide scientists with useful tools for their work.  For an example of an important scientific problem that demands the technique being developed in this project, consider the question of what happens when sunlight hits the top of a cloud.  Some of the heat is reflected back into space, and some is absorbed into the cloud.  The best model of a cloud is as a fractal mixture of water vapor and air.  A scientific experiment will be required to determine the most suitable specific fractal model to use, and this most likely will depend on the type of cloud.  After the fractal geometry is chosen, it will still require the analysis of the solution of the heat equation on such fractals to resolve the problem.  The heat equation is an example of the type of differential equations studied in this project.  Strichartz is currently supervising the research of a graduate student in physics, with the goal of studying analysis on physically realistic fractal models.  Strichartz has been a leader in the development of experimental techniques in mathematics.  The proposed research will continue this development.  Strichartz  has successfully mentored nearly 100 undergraduate students in research work (including many women and several underrepresented minorities), largely through the REU program. Strichartz has written a book, suitable for undergraduates and graduate students to introduce them to the field and has organized conferences with a strong educational component.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                 Mathematics builds the infrastructure that scientists use to study the world.  Subjects such as geometry, algebra, probability, and calculus have been studied by mathematicians for centuries for their own intrinsic interest, while at the same time they have provided invaluable tools to all sciences.  Calculus was developed in the 17th century, and has since broadened to an area of mathematics called analysis, which includes a vast interconnected set of basic problem areas, including the theory of differential equations.  Differential equations allow you to answer basic questions about objects, such as 1) if you hit it with a hammer, how will it vibrate?, and 2) if you heat it with a blowtorch, how will the temperature change?  A fundamental assumption needed in order to apply the classical theory of differential equations is that the object be smooth.  Nevertheless, the world is full of nonsmooth objects, and mathematicians have been aware of the challenge of extending the basic concepts and techniques of analysis to the nonsmooth setting.                   In the 1970Æs, Benoit Mandelbrot introduced the notion of fractal, bringing together ideas that had been developed over the previous century.  A fractal is an object whose geometry exhibits a characteristic complexity at all scales.  In other words, no matter how much you zoom in on it, you see more or less the same pattern.  A self-similar fractal is one where you see exactly the same pattern.  Mandelbrot gave a far reaching vision of many real objects that might best be modeled by fractals, such as clouds, and ferns and coastlines, and stimulated many scientists to look at the world from the fractal perspective.  At the same time, he inspired mathematicians to continue to develop the mathematics of fractals, especially fractal geometry.  Starting in the 1980Æs mathematicians began to study probability and analysis on fractals.                   The research supported by this grant has been mainly in the area of analysis on fractals.  The mathematical tools developed may be expected to lead to progress on scientific questions, such as:  when sunlight hits the top of a cloud, how much of the heat is reflected back into space, and how does the rest of the heat distribute through the cloud?  But the mathematics has its own intrinsic interest, and has led to feedback in more classical areas of analysis.                   Mathematicians need to build; this means proving theorems, inventing definitions, and formulating precise conjectures.  But they also need to dream; this means developing heuristic ideas that are too speculative to be made precise, but point to new developments and make connections among disparate areas.  More recently, mathematicians have found a need to experiment; this means using computers to carry out numerical computations that uncover new and important patterns.  The research supported by this grant has made contributions to all three endeavors.                   Experimentation has played a vital role in the research supported by this grant.  The experiments have been carried out by undergraduate research assistants, many of whom have been supported through Research Experiences for Undergraduates grants.  Not only have these students contributed vital insights into the research problems, but they have learned a methodology that promises to play an important role in the future development of mathematics.
