<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Sergei Dzyuba from Texas Christian University and colleagues Jean-Luc Montchamp, Onofrio Annunziata and Youngha Ryu will acquire an isothermal titration calorimeter. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) functional nanogels based on poly(vinyl alcohol)-ligand complexation, (b) non-hydrolyzable phosphinic DNA analogues, (c) determination of interactions within supramolecular polymer networks, (d) ionic liquid-assisted gelation of organic solvents, and (e) preparation of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) analogues and evaluation of their binding affinity to the TPP riboswitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a very sensitive thermodynamic technique that is used to characterize binding interactions between species such as those between a small molecule and an enzyme. ITC measures directly the heat absorbed or released during a binding process. This provides insight on the strength of chemical and biochemical binding interactions. The calorimeter will also be incorporated into several upper division level laboratory classes at Texas Christian University but it will also be accessible to neighboring institutions such as Texas Woman's University, UT-Arlington, University of North Texas and the UNT Health Science Center. This instrument will be used not only in research but also in educational and outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
