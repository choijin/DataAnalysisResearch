<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;1160515&lt;br/&gt;Gubbins, Keith E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GOALI project involves university-industry collaboration between researchers at North Carolina State University (NCSU) and at Quantachrome Instruments, a leading maker of instruments for characterizing nano-structured materials. The aim of this project is to investigate the effects of confinement in nanoporous materials on pressure enhancement, diffusion, phase changes and supercapacitor performance, using realistic atomistic models of the materials. Fundamental understanding of these effects will assist in optimization of the materials for specific applications. The materials to be studied are carbide-derived carbons, mesoporous carbons and oxides, and hierarchical carbons and oxides. Applications of particular interest are the use of these materials for diffusional separations, chemical reactions and supercapacitors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve cooperative research with researchers in Zhejiang University in Hangzhou (Professors Wang Qi and Liu Ying-Chun and coworkers) in China on diffusion in nanopores; the University of Hong Kong (Professor Kwong-Yu Chan and coworkers) on carbon-based supercapacitors; and Shinshu University (Professor Katsumi Kaneko) on pressure enhancement effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation of these materials and experimental studies of structure and adsorption on them will be performed by researchers at Quantachrome Instruments and University of Hong Kong, and this data will be provided to the NCSU researchers. Quantachrome scientists will also offer advice on directions for the modeling work carried out at NCSU. The NCSU researchers will develop and test new simulation methodologies to model these materials and study effects of confinement on the properties of confined nano-phases. In particular, Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations will be carried out to study adsorption, pressure enhancement and diffusion in these materials. In the case of the carbon materials, molecular simulations will be carried out to determine their use as supercapacitors, including studies of capacitance, power density and diffusion in the pore structures, with the aim of understanding the influence of pore design on performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The realistic models that are being developed in this work will make possible fundamental investigations of the influence of confinement and nature of the material on adsorption, phase changes, diffusion, reactions and electrode performance. Recently, we have demonstrated that very high pressures (tens of thousands of bars) exist in confined nanophases within carbons and silicas, and studies of this effect are expected to &lt;br/&gt; provide new insight into many confinement effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. Improved understanding of the behavior of nano-phases confined within these novel nano-porous materials will impact a broad range of technologies, and is essential to the design of new biological and chemical sensors, nano-reactors, energy storage media, electrodes for fuel cells and supercapacitors, and nano-structured catalysts. The graduate students working on this project will learn modern multi-scale modeling methods, and will gain experience of international cooperative research through our active collaborations in this area with the researchers in China, Hong Kong and Japan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Porous materials, such as activated carbons, porous silicas and oxides, find many applications in the chemical, oil and gas, food and pharmaceutical industries, including use in separation of chemicals, as catalysts for chemical reactions, purification of water and as fuel cell electrodes.  They also find application in drug delivery and as supercapacitors for storing electricity.  The pores in these materials range in size from a billionth to about one ten millionth of a meter. It is the very large surface area of the pore walls and the strong intermolecular forces exerted by the walls on molecules adsorbed within the pores that lead to so many applications.   This project is aimed at investigating several features of fluids confined within these porous materials that are so far not well understood. The main outcomes of this work are summarized below.  Intellectual Merit  1. High Pressure Effects.  There is strong experimental evidence that in many cases the molecules confined in the narrow pores are subject to great pressures, often thousands or tens of thousands of atmospheres, due to the strong wall forces. The results found in this project provide a guide to the influence of the adsorbent material, pore size and shape and temperature on the pressures within the pores, and provide fundamental understanding of these pressure enhancement effects. Such understanding is key to future applications, such as the preparation of novel high pressure materials with useful properties, and high pressure chemical reactions.  2. Diffusion of Water in Activated Carbons.  An experimental study of the diffusion of water in porous carbons, using the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, found that water exhibited two distinctly different diffusion rates, one relatively slow, the other about five times faster. Computer simulations of the water diffusion using realistic models of the carbon materials showed that this behavior arises from the presence of oxygenated chemical groups (hydroxyl, carbonyl, etc.) on the pore walls.  Water molecules tend to bond to these groups, so that such molecules diffuse much more slowly, whereas molecules further from the walls can diffuse much faster.  3. Corresponding States Theory for Adsorption. A new corresponding states theory has been developed to describe the behavior of fluids confined within these porous materials and provides a new and more accurate way to interpret experimental adsorption measurements.  These measurements are used to determine the properties of the porous material, such as surface area and pore size.  4. Effect of Wall Roughness.  Current instruments to measure adsorption in porous materials assume that the pore walls are smooth when calculating pore width and surface area.  However, most materials have energetically rough surfaces due to chemical groups on the walls.  We have developed a theory to account for such roughness, which can be incorporated in the software of these instruments, thus improving the accuracy of their predictions.     Broader Impact  1. Training and Professional Development. Three Ph.D. students, Katherine Phillips, Cody Addington and Deepti Srivastava, and one postdoctoral researcher (part time), Ruby An, worked on the project, and were educated in advanced theoretical and molecular simulation methods for the study of nano-meter scale systems of the type studied here.  In addition, two undergraduate researchers, Andrew Santos and William Harris, participated in the project.  Santos is now pursuing the Ph.D. degree at Princeton University, and Harris also plans to study for the Ph.D.  The three graduate students all gained experience in international research collaboration through our joint projects with researchers at the Technical University of Berlin and at Shinshu University (Nagano, Japan).  In addition, both Addington and An had experience in collaboration with industry through our collaboration with Dr. Matthias Thommes, Director of Research at Quantachrome Instruments.  2.  The results of this research have been disseminated through publication of 15 papers in international scientific journals. In addition the Principal Investigator presented the results in 25 invited lectures during the period of the grant. Several of the invited talks were named lectureships, including the Rossini Lecture, International Conference on Chemical Thermodynamics, Buzios, Brazil, August 2012; The Leader's Forum, Imperial College London, U.K., May, 2013; Lennard-Jones Lecture, Royal Society of Chemistry, Manchester, U.K., September, 2013.  3. The findings from this project impact operations in the chemical, oil and gas, pharmaceutical industries.  They are also of interest in materials science, chemistry and physics.  4.  Some of the findings of this project are being incorporated in a graduate course, CHE 775, Multi-Scale Modeling of Matter, taught by the Principal Investigator at North Carolina State University.
