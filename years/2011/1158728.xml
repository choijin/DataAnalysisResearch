<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research award to James Madison University (JMU) research proposal will study and assess ways in which sustainability instruction in five contexts can be integrated into existing material in engineering, science, social science, education, and the humanities. Specifically, the objectives of this proposal are 1) to employ a systems theory approach to integrating research and instruction in five sustainability contexts (environmental, social/cultural, economic, technical, individual) into existing material in the university curriculum; 2) to utilize a cross-disciplinary approach to sustainability that includes perspectives from other disciplines (science, social science, education, humanities) in order to give engineering students a comprehensive understanding for solving sustainability problems; and 3) to create a personalized instructional approach that focuses on individual values and behaviors. The final deliverable will be a first iteration of a low-cost global model for sustainability research, instruction, and assessment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This model will allow universities to examine their programs to determine the content and methodologies they employ to teach sustainability, and consequently, determine appropriate methods for integrating cross-disciplinary instruction based on values and behaviors into their curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model will provide an inexpensive, scalable, and transferable model for integrating systems and cross-disciplinary instruction based on individual values and behaviors into an engineering course or curriculum. In the university, this project will make more visible the important research and instructional implications of sustainability in engineering, science, social science, education, and the humanities. Faculty and students involved in this effort (approximately 400 over three years) will have a greater understanding of a realistic systems approach to sustainability they will take with them into their adult lives and careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A Contextual Approach to Researching and Teaching Sustainability     We define sustainability using a systems approach that includes social, economic, environmental, and individual contexts.  Our research projects involve changing and experimenting with our teaching methodologies and their effects on students.  Some of this involves research into teaching strategies in competency-based education, cognitive behavioral change, intentional self-development, and related areas.  Individual Sustainability (Sustainable Personality):  An important context missing from most discussions of sustainability, especially within academia (or society in general), is individual sustainability.  Living a sustainable lifestyle includes creating harmony, interconnection, and relatively high levels of awareness in one's values, thoughts, and behaviors, as well as maintaining an increasing control over one's physical, emotional, social, philosophical/spiritual, and intellectual life.  The general skills that lead to individual sustainability are awareness, motivation, and the ability to engage in intentional self-development.  In supporting personal awareness and motivation--the development of Individual Sustainability--we conducted research to determine if the cognitive dissonance that occurs when students realize their behaviors do not reflect their admirable values motivates them to align their values and behaviors.  Our research studies included over 1000 students (all majors and academic levels) over a period of four years at James Madison University.  In a series of written explorations comparing their Real Selves and Ideal Selves--in contexts (intellectual, social, philosophical, physical, and emotional)--students defined behaviors they would consider ideal for themselves, that is, aligned with their Ideal Selves.  The motivation for change comes from the misalignment of their real and ideal selves--cognitive dissonance.  Our findings indicate that students may have high opinions of themselves, or greatly value integrity, and want to align their behaviors with their values in most all settings and contexts.  In students' self-reports, we find motivation to be very high, and significant, sometimes dramatic, change in individual behavior (to align with their ideal selves) is common among our subjects.  In longitudinal studies, we found most students maintained a significant level of alignment between their values and behaviors, but at a lower rate at six months than at six weeks.  The effects of cognitive dissonance on students increase their motivation and the practice of aligning their values and behaviors in all our research projects, regardless of the focus...professional skills or personality skills.  Our data and interviews with students indicate that both the Individual Sustainability material and cognitive dissonance teaching methodology are highly educational and often transformational, even for students who did not enjoy the study.
