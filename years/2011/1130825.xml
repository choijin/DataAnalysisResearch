<AbstractNarration>The objective of this grant is to investigate the feasibility of cellulose nanocrystals as an alternative to silicon for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  The structure, mechanical properties, surface chemistry, and ability to self-assemble into well defined architectures over multiple scales make cellulose nanocrystals particularly attractive building blocks for advanced materials. In this research, cellulose nanocrystals with controlled size distributions and surface chemistries will be processed to form dry films and fabricated into devices using conventional MEMS fabrication techniques such as lithography and etching.  Finally, the properties of the resulting devices will be characterized to yield an interrelation between the cellulose nanocrystal MEMS device properties, the cellulose nanocrystal dispersion microstructure, and film processing conditions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will enable renewable cellulose materials to be used as an inexpensive alternative to the high-cost electronic grade silicon, which is currently the industry standard for advanced sensor platforms.  Results of this research have the potential to transform the MEMS industry, as well as other silicon based technologies. This would have considerable economic impact; Yole Developpement projects the MEMS industry will exceed $13 billion in 2012.  Even if the full potential of this research is not realized, it will provide fundamental insight into the processing of nanocylinders for advanced materials applications. The research will also enhance a strong collaboration between Chemical Engineering faculty at Auburn University and Clemson University.  The research will contribute to the education and training of two Ph. D. students, one post doctoral researcher, and four undergraduate researchers. Graduate student rotations in each of the PIs laboratory will provide a diverse perspective and training for the advanced materials workforce.  The research team will also engage in outreach activities to foster the development of the next generation of scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research titled "Processing and Properties of Cellulose Films for MEMS Applications" was to test the hypothesis that cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) dispersions can be processed into films with tailored mechanical, optical, and electrical properties suitable for micromachining to produce advanced microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The intellectual merit focused on a fundamental understanding of the effects of dispersion microstructure and anisotropic ordering, on the mechanical and electrical properties of films for MEMS devices; a multibillion-dollar industry dominated by crystalline silicon technology.  If successful, cellulose will displace silicon as an inexpensive, abundant, renewable, and biocompatible alternative for MEMS devices.  We have made significant advancements in synthesizing CNCs from biomass, understanding of the effect of CNC surface chemistry on dispersion phase behavior, and formation of uniform oriented CNC films for processing into MEMS devices.   The collaboration between Clemson University and Auburn University has demonstrated the feasibility of processing CNC films into characteristic MEMS device features using methods currently employed in the silicon MEMS industry.  To further optimize this technology and exploit the unique properties of CNCÆs further knowledge of the colloidal phase behavior and film formation is required.   CNCs produced using sulfuric acid hydrolysis results in surface sulfate ester groups (CNC-SA) that provide electrostatic interparticle repulsion forces, resulting in cholesteric or chiral nematic liquid crystal formation.  While this chiral nematic structure self-assembles in solution and exists in an undisturbed dried film (Figure 1), application of shear in a blade coating or spin coating process can alter this structure to induce oriented alignment along the direction of shear.  Figure 2 demonstrates the spin coating of 12.54 w/v% CNC solutions onto a silicon wafer platform viewed through reflective cross polarized microscopy with a quarter wave plate.   At all spin speeds and CNC-SA concentrations, highly uniform alignment in the direction of shear is obtained.  At higher spin speeds, a striated structure is obtained as a result of film instability, which has periodic variation in film thickness.  The striated structure is tunable with CNC-SA concentration and spin speeds and has potential for application in device and sensor fabrication.   Our research also focused alternative CNC surface chemistry, specifically CNCs hydrolyzed by HCl and acetic acid (CNC-AA) with surface methyl ester groups.  The CNC-AA are larger in size, less hydrophilic, and possess a lower surface charge density compared to the CNC-SA.  The CNC-AA possess unique phase behavior where a crosshatch birefringent texture is observed in a glassy phase and shows "frozen-in" flow shear behavior. This crosshatch pattern is maintained in dried film. Atomic force microscopy surface imaging shows that the basic unit of CNC-AA microstructure in the film consists of 1.5 &mu;m scale aligned nanorods clusters, which provides the dimensions of each individual "hatch" in the birefrigent texture. Cross-section scanning electron microscopy of the dried CNC-AA film indicates a layered sheet-like structure with void space in between, shown in Figure 3.  The film structure can be defined as a fine scale schlieren texture observed in other systems but not well characterized.  These results provide significant insight into the orientation and structures that result in the crosshatch texture and possess features found in a nematic liquid crystal without the long range order.  This material structure is of significant interest for many applications that range from MEMS devices to nanocomposite films or coatings with enhanced barrier, mechanical or optical properties.  We have also studied the phase behavior of CNC-SA and CNC-AA mixtures that undergo a transition from chiral nematic to the fine scale nema...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
