<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the international collaboration in chemistry research program of Prof. Stephen Duirk of the University of Akron, Prof. Michael Plewa of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Dr. Susan Richardson of USEPA, and Dr. Thomas Ternes of the Federal Institute of Hydrology in Koblenz, Germany. The collaborative team of investigators and their students will employ advanced measurement methods to elucidate the formation mechanisms of highly toxic iodo-disinfectant by-products (iodo-DBPs) from the reaction of drinking water disinfectants with iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM). ICM have never been investigated as precursors to DBPs in drinking water treatment, despite the fact that they are widely used and are found at high levels in surface waters. The US researchers will identify low molecular weight iodo-DBPs formed during the reaction of chlorinated oxidants with ICM and their TPs, and German researchers will identify high molecular weight reaction products. The toxicity (mammalian cell genotoxicity and cytotoxicity) of the reaction product mixtures and of individual iodo-DBPs identified will also be measured to determine which ICM and their microbial transformation products and reaction conditions give rise to toxic by-products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As clean water sources are contaminated with anthropogenic chemicals from wastewater inputs, it is important to understand how these contaminants can be chemically transformed during drinking water treatment resulting in the formation of toxic transformation products. Understanding contaminant transformation pathways will ultimately result in minimizing or eliminating the formation of highly toxic DBPs in drinking water, which could potentially impact the millions of people worldwide who consume disinfected drinking water. The study will provide undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to carry out an environmental chemical science project of great societal importance in an international collaborative setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international collaborative research project is supported jointly by NSF and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) (DFG).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF1124865 International Collaboration in Chemistry: Iodinated Disinfection By-product and Total Organic Halogen Formation: Reaction of Chlorinated Oxidants with X-ray Contrast Media in the Presence of Natural Organic Matter  This international collaboration was between four research groups investigating the transformation of iodide containing pharmaceuticals under simulated drinking water treatment.  Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are a result of chemicals used to disinfect potable water that react with organic material present in the drinking water source.  Source waters contain organic material from multiple origins.  Some organic material is naturally occurring due to the decomposition of biomass, algal production, or from man-made chemicals.  Personal Care Products and Pharmaceuticals (PCPPs) contaminate a drinking water source through insufficient treatment of wastewater.  Since municipal wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove PCPPs, they are generally found in downstream drinking water sources for other communities.  Therefore, the fate of PCPPs in the environment and during drinking water treatment has been a growing concern.  Some of these contaminants do not react with the chemical disinfectants used to treat potable water.  However, some PCPPs have been found to react with some disinfectants resulting in the formation of toxic/carcinogenic byproducts knowns as DBPs.  Since most drinking water treatment plants in the U.S. use chlorinated disinfectants, a majority of these DBPs contain chlorine that is incorporated into the PCPPs as they are transformed into smaller but carcinogenic byproducts.  This project specifically focused on a certain class of PCPPs known as iodinated x-ray contrast media (ICM).  ICM are used to enhance imaging of soft tissue during computerized tomography (CT) scans, are administered at a 200 g dose, and are metabolically stable.  Worldwide, about 12.5% of more than 600 million X-ray examinations conducted annually use ICM.  Due to their relatively high solubility, ICM are almost totally excreted through urine and feces within 24 hours of being administered.  Due to their chemical properties, ICM are recalcitrant to conventional wastewater treatment and are one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents, lakes, rivers, creeks, and other water sources.  Diatrizoate, iohexol, iomeprol, iopamidol, and iopromide were the 5 most detected ICM in drinking water sources at 10 drinking water treatment plants in U.S., with iopamidol being the predominant ICM.  Of the 5 most frequently ICM detected in drinking water sources, only iopamidol was found to be reactive with chlorinated disinfectants used during drinking water treatment.  Iopamidol is transformed into smaller iodinated products that have been found to be the most toxic and carcinogenic chemical compounds to humans created during the disinfection of drinking water.  This work has identify iopamidol as the only ICM that appears to be reactive with chlorinated oxidants resulting in the formation of highly toxic iodo-DBPs.  Therefore, greater international restrictions may be placed on iopamidol use allowing other ICM that do not result in the formation of iodo-DPBs to be used in medical imaging.  This International Collaboration in Chemistry has been a joint effort between Dr. Ternes in at the Institute of Hydrology in Germany, Dr. Plewa at the University of Illinois, Dr. Richardson at the University of South Carolina, and Dr. Duirk at the University of Akron.  This group effort has resulted in the identification and the formation of DBPs that pose a significant threat to drinking water supplies in developed nations around the globe.  One student in Germany has received his Ph.D. in chemistry, one Ph.D. student was funded and received his degree in toxicology form the University of Illinois, one Ph.D. student was partially funded at the University of South Carolina, and 5 master?s students and one Ph.D. student at the University of Akron were either fully or partially funded throughout the duration of this project.  The students interacted and work cooperatively and meet at internationally conferences providing a framework for future work.  Understanding that some PCPPs pose a greater threat to human health, the fate of PCPPs in the environment should be comprehensively assess prior to approval and mass distribution.  More comprehensive environmental fate protocols could alleviate some of the emerging threats to our drinking water sources and the quality of potable water for future generations.
