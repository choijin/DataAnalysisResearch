<AbstractNarration>********Technical Abstract********&lt;br/&gt;This project will support experimental research in the strongly correlated electron phenomena in rare earth related materials.  These phenomena arise from a subtle interplay between competing interactions, either electronic or magnetic, which can be controlled through tuning the experimental parameters such as temperature, magnetic field, chemical composition, and reduced dimensionality.  The primary focus of this research is on the effect of magnetism on unconventional superconductivity in the filled skutterudite substitution system Pr1-xNdxOs4Sb12, the investigation of the electronic structures of near-by compounds NdOs4Sb12 and CeOs4Sb12 for understanding the quantum critical behavior and superconducting pairing mechanism in PrOs4Sb12, and the effect of reduced dimensionality on magnetism in gadolinium and neodymium nanoparticles.  Through the synthesis of high quality specimens and the establishment of transport and thermodynamical properties of these rare earth materials, they can be used as model systems to probe the localized and itinerant nature of the electron states and test the existing theories for strongly correlated electron phenomena.  The research experience and practical placement provided by this project will help undergraduate and MS program students pursue Ph. D degrees and start their careers in industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*******Non-Technical Abstract*******&lt;br/&gt;This project will support material science research of rare-earth related materials at an undergraduate institution.  The primary focus of this research is on the synthesis and characterization of superconducting materials and magnetic nanoparticles, with the goal of understanding their underlying mechanisms.  These materials promise useful technical applications in diverse fields such as energy conservation, energy storage, digital information storage, and medical imaging.  This project will allow direct participation by undergraduate and MS-program students in the experiments, giving them hands-on experience at the early stage of their academic life.  The opportunities provided through this work will encourage students to pursue higher education and careers in the STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supports research of rare-earth related materials at an undergraduate institution.  Physical properties and phenomena associated with superconductivity, magnetism, influence of magnetism on superconductivity, and synthesis of nanoparticles are particularly focused.  These materials have great potentials to be applied in various technologies such as energy conservation, energy storage, digital information storage, and medical imaging.   Superconductivity is the electricity flowing perfectly, which has been the target of research since it can resolve societyÆs issues on energy consumption.  However, magnetism is the nemesis of conventional superconductivity.  Many rare-earth superconductors display unconventional nature and have much more tolerance for magnetism.  Therefore, understanding the mechanism responsible for unconventional superconductivity can help future development in novel materials and technologies.  The goal of the current project is to determine the effect of ferromagnetism due to the presence of the neodymium magnetic moment on the unconventional superconductivity of PrOs4Sb12 by the substitution study in the Pr1-xNdxOs4Sb12 system.  In this project, we found abnormal suppression of the neodymium moment for the neodymium rich region.  In concentrations near middle, superconductivity and weak ferromagnetism coexist in atomic level.  For one concentration in the praseodymium-rich side, no internal magnetic field was found in superconducting state, which is different than the PrOs4Sb12 case.  However, strong dynamic fluctuations of neodymium moments are present.   Due to large uncompensated electronic states at the surface of nano-sized materials, their physical properties are very different from their bulk counterparts, such as changes of color, reduced magnetism, reduced melting temperature, and increased reactivity.  At the current stage of the project, submicron sized gadolinium and neodymium clusters have been produced by the inverse micelle techniques by utilizing the appropriate ratio of non-polar and polar solvents, and surfactant (hexane/methanol/DDAB for stable gadolinium clusters and heptane/methanol/AOT for neodymium clusters).  This project allows direct participation of undergraduate and MS-program students in the experimental research of condensed matter physics, training them hands-on experience and systematic approaches to solving scientific problems at the early stage of their academic life.  The opportunities provided through this work encourage students to pursue higher education and careers in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
