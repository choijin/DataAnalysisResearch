<AbstractNarration>This research project addresses the important problem of improving and maintaining peoples' healthy lifestyles by inventing smart technology based on fundamental scientific principles. The approaches are economically feasible and socially compelling approaches, with a focus on maintaining the health and independence of older adults in a home environment.  The project uses a mix of networking and monitoring technologies to connect older adults with a remote health coach (real person facilitated by a semi-automated program) and remote family members.  One of the key design issues is how best to preserve privacy and enable the participants to control the distribution and sharing of their data. The intervention is designed to provide coordinated and continuous health management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research for this project uses the integration of data from a variety of sensors in the home, yielding information for activity monitoring, sleep monitoring, gait and movement analysis, socialization measures, as well as a variety of cognitive metrics derived from computer interactions with adaptive games.   Rigorous computational engineering models of the cognitive and physical functions of the patient, as well as context and environment, are used to infer patient state and provide feedback for the patient and the remote health coach.  The modeling techniques include Partially Observable Markov Process and Hybrid Control Modes.  User models that incorporate behavior change principles are then used to drive algorithms to optimize automated feedback and recommendations that serve as prompts for a health coach managing a large number of patients.  These approaches to remote health management are evaluated by leveraging an existing prototype platform with the capability of collecting data from the homes of elderly participants.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this research was to investigate the use of smart technologies to maintain and improve healthy life styles in elderly population. We have built the platform for observing and providing health intervention via an automated interactive exercise system based on Microsoft Kinect camera. The system was successfully deployed into several homes to collect exercise data alongside other observational data (e.g. sleep, mobility), self-reported surveys, and standardized fitness measures over a period of 18 weeks.</p> <p>Based on the collected exercise data, we developed a mathematical framework for modeling the individual behavior that relates the exercise performance with the standard measures of physical fitness, such as flexibility, balance, endurance, and strength. Within this framework we developed new kinematic filtering technique that improves the quality of motion data captured by low-cost depth sensing cameras. The output of the filter provides smooth angular trajectories that can be analyzed in terms of individual&rsquo;s range of motion and flexibility. Furthermore, we introduced a new methodology for non-supervised temporal segmentation of repetitive physical activity into individual repetitions. Finally, we developed dynamics modeling framework that estimates joint torques and forces from motion data. The estimated joint torques during the exercise performance provide information relevant for the estimation of joint loading that can be further used to tailor exercise activity to the individual user. As part of the technical evaluation of the system, we also produced two evaluations of different Kinect cameras in comparison with the motion capture system that have received high number of citations (over 180).</p> <p>Another goal of this research was to investigate how the introduced exercise intervention affected user behavior. The analysis of the data showed that the engagement of the participants with the exercise system varied quite a bit. We proposed a concept of &ldquo;decisional balance&rdquo; that would model the changes in an exercise outcome measure over time (e.g., the number of exercises performed per session or the difficulty of the exercises in the session) as a function of self-reported levels of motivation, energy, and pain before and after each exercise session.&nbsp; The rationale for such a model is that increases in motivation and energy potentially balance against increases in pain that may develop naturally or as a result of subjects using the Kinect-based exercise system to affect the exercise outcomes.&nbsp; Our findings indicate that different individuals may require different approaches to health coaching.</p> <p>This project also provided an outstanding opportunity for the students to collaborate in a multi-disciplinary research. During the course of the project, we engaged three postdoctoral students as well as several undergraduate students who contributed to the design and development of the exercise software and user interface, experimental design, data collection, and data analysis. The project was presented at various official events at the participating Universities to K-12 students and their parents. The results of this project and lessons learned from deploying this new technology into the homes of elderly individuals have been disseminated to the research community at several conferences and in various publications.</p> <p>The developed methodologies for temporal segmentation, kinematic and dynamic modeling, and biomechanical analysis of human movement can be adapted in health sciences, in particular for sports medicine, rehabilitation, exercise, etc. The concept of automated exercise platform in connection with the coaching platform could reduce the cost of care for elderly individuals as it would provide benefits and improvements in their level of independence while requiring less resources currently invested into their care.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/12/2016<br>      Modified by: Ruzena&nbsp;K&nbsp;Bajcsy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711686474_fig1_interactive_exercise_software--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711686474_fig1_interactive_exercise_software--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Kinect-based Exercise Software"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711686474_fig1_interactive_exercise_software--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Kinect-based Exercise Software"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Real-time feedback screen of the Kinect-based exercise system that was deployed into homes of 7 elderly individuals.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gregorij Kurillo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ruzena&nbsp;K&nbsp;Bajcsy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Kinect-based Exercise Software</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711752302_fig2_skeletal_sequence--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711752302_fig2_skeletal_sequence--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Skeletal recording by Kinect"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711752302_fig2_skeletal_sequence--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Skeletal recording by Kinect"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Motion sequence recorded by Kinect for the exercise Cops & Robbers.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gregorij Kurillo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ruzena&nbsp;K&nbsp;Bajcsy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Skeletal recording by Kinect</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711831290_fig3_kinect_comparison--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711831290_fig3_kinect_comparison--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Comparison of Kinect 1 and Kinect 2 with motion capture."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711831290_fig3_kinect_comparison--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Comparison of Kinect 1 and Kinect 2 with motion capture."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Comparison of Kinect 1 and Kinect 2 with motion capture.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Qifei Wang</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ruzena&nbsp;K&nbsp;Bajcsy</div> <div class="imageTitle">Comparison of Kinect 1 and Kinect 2 with motion capture.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711891705_fig4_joint_angles--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711891705_fig4_joint_angles--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Joint angle segmentation."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1111965/1111965_10132170_1473711891705_fig4_joint_angles--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Joint angle segmentation."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Data analysis of flexibility for one coaching session.
