<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The order Tetraodontiformes is a group of roughly 350 species of fishes that has long attracted the attention of animal behaviorists and fish anatomists because of their exceptional ecological, behavioral, and anatomical diversity (Figure 1). Tetraodontiform fishes (e.g. filefishes, triggerfishes and pufferfishes) exhibit an exceptional range of skull bone and muscle modifications compared to the cranial anatomy of most fishes. The most profound example of these differences is several unusual subdivisions of the adductor mandibulae muscles that function in closing the jaws. While most fishes have three or four adductor mandibulae muscles, each family in the order Tetraodontiformes has a different number of adductor mandibulae muscles, ranging from two in spikefishes, to more than 10 in some filefish species. This differential skull anatomy among close relatives provides an ideal experimental platform for investigating questions about the evolution of multiply subdivided muscles, the physiological consequences of structurally complex musculoskeletal systems, and the neural control of architecturally complex functional systems.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the summer of 2011, I developed and carried out a research project that quantitatively compared the skull shape and jaw function of various tetraodontiform fishes native to Taiwan over 10 weeks in residence at the Academia Sinica. During frequent trips to local fish markets and by my own hook and line fishing efforts, I collected approximately 60 fresh fish specimens from 43 different tetraodontiform species, identified them to species, photographed them, and dissected their cheek musculature to characterize the jaw closing muscles and cranial anatomy of each fish.

Their goal was to use clues from their fishÆs anatomy (teeth, jaw size, mouth shape, etc) to figure out what their fish eats. At the end of each session, each group of girls demonstrate...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
