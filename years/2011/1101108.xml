<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to establish a general three-dimensional model capable of predicting the stress-strain-magnetization behavior of magnetic shape memory alloys under any type of magnetic and/or mechanical loading. Magnetic shape memory alloys are unique because they experience a recoverable strain when exposed to a magnetic field as internal martensitic variants reorient.  The challenges associated with modeling these materials include, but are not limited to, determining when the variants reorient and the direction of reorientation under any loading. As an initial step towards a three-dimensional model, a complete model for any two-dimensional magneto-mechanical loading is needed. In order to better understand these alloys and to assist with the modeling, all qualitatively different biaxial load cases with compressive stress and/or magnetic field will be tested experimentally.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials, methodologies, and results of this research will be integrated in the Adaptive Materials and Systems course taught by the principal investigator, providing students with unique training in magnetically adaptive materials.  The results of this project will be presented to peers at technical conferences, to students and faculty at Northern Arizona University, and to the general population during the annual Flagstaff Festival of Science, as well as published in journals and conference proceedings.  Finally, this work will create a means of predicting the behavior of magnetic shape memory alloys subject to complex loads, which will give engineers insight into potential applications of these alloys and a robust tool for the design of devices that include magnetic shape memory alloys.</AbstractNarration>
