<AbstractNarration>The great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011 has reminded us of the hazards to life and property that attend such events, and of the need for a focused scientific effort to understand both their causes and effects. Cascadia, which extends from northern California to southern British Columbia, will be the site of a future great earthquake that will affect a number of large metropolitan centers, including Seattle and Portland. The Cascadia Initiative is an effort to gain a better understanding of seismicity in the region that includes the deployment of an array of instruments both onshore and offshore. Several ancillary studies are also planned or under way; one such study is a sophisticated 3D (three dimensional) seismic survey to be carried out off the coast of Washington. The suite of 2D seismic profiles that will be acquired by this project will provide essential data for planning and carrying out the 3D survey. The chief broader impact of this study is the very high societal relevance of gaining an improved understanding of the seismic risk in this region.</AbstractNarration>

The Pacific Northwest in the U.S. is home to the Cascadia subduction zone, which is thought to generate earthquakes as large as M9.2.  Despite the importance on understanding the earthquake hazard offshore Washington, Oregon and California,  little work has been done to image the seismogenic portion of this subduction system.

The COAST project (Cascadia Open-Access Seismic Transects) consisted of a two-week cruise of the R/V Marcus G. Langseth.

In addition to the seismic data, a full suite of gravity, magnetic, multibeam bathymetry, and acoustic backscatter data were also acquired.  The multichannel seismic reflection data beautifully imaged deformation of sediments associated with this convergent margin, although the detachment surface delineating the boundary between down-going sediments and sediments left behind in the accrentionary wedge was not imaged.  This absence may be due to either poor imaging or the plate boundary may at times be located in the down-going oceanic slab; this observation may have important ramifications with regards to the extent of earthquake rupture.  Large landslides at the toe of the forearc and listtric normal faults near the coast line both highlight the potential to generate large tsunamis during rupture along the Cascadia margin, and should be considered when mitigating loss of life and property along the low-lying areas in this region.
