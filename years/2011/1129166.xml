<AbstractNarration>A major goal of biological and ecological sciences is to understand natural systems well enough to predict how species and populations will respond to a rapidly changing world (i.e., climate change, habitat loss, etc.). A population under any conditions will grow, shrink, or disappear altogether depending on how efficiently individuals consume resources (food), utilize that food metabolically, and eventually reproduce. However, making accurate predictions based on these metabolic processes is complicated by the realities that each species has different resource requirements and that no two individuals within a species are exactly alike. Rather, individuals vary and this variation, both within and across species, is central to many ecological and evolutionary processes. Developing the ability to predict responses of biological systems to a changing world therefore requires a mechanistic understanding of variation. The goal of this project is to improve this mechanistic understanding by examining variation within a metabolic context across a range of species that have a spectrum of commonly-seen resource requirements. Further, the  work capitalizes on a unique biological characteristic of this group of species that allows control and manipulation of individual reproduction, facilitating experimental study of the mechanistic links between variation in individual consumption, metabolism, and reproduction. The foundation this research is a combination of field measurements and laboratory experiments using both well-established and newly-developed techniques to quantify these links. The result will be a quantitative framework to predict how individuals will respond reproductively to changes in resource use. Because of the close link between individual reproduction and population dynamics, this research will contribute substantially to predictions in population dynamics under realistic conditions where individuals use more than a single resource, and improve the prediction of responses to current and future ecological changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research will make broad contributions to society in three ways. (1) The development of K-12 lesson plans to enhance science education, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing early STEM education in the United States. This aspect of the project brings together local grade school teachers, undergraduate students in elementary education from the University of South Carolina (USC), and experts from the USC Center for Science Education to develop a series of lesson plans based on the proposed scientific investigations. (2) Improve commonly used chemical tool (stable isotopes) used in assessing food web links in ecological systems. (3) Improve understanding of species of management concern. Several of the  study species are of management concern because they are either problematic invaders in many areas globally, are currently increasing in abundance as a result of reduced consumer pressure because of overfishing, or are dominant yet understudied consumers in their respective habitats. This study will provide important information on the impacts of these species, as well as on their reproductive potential.</AbstractNarration>

Then for each species we experimentally measured the impacts of dietary intake on reproductive success.   We found that the diet of each of the species we examined was influenced by changes to their environment brought about by humans.  Each species experienced a different type of human-caused stress, and this meant that each species had its own unique mechanisms that caused differences between individuals in their diets.  A simple example of this can be seen by contrasting two of the species we examined.  The mangrove tree crab in Florida is responding to climate change by moving further northward.  Its mangrove habitat is also creeping northward, but not as fast.  As a consequence, some of the tree crabs now live in salt marshes that are found north of the mangroves.  Crabs in the salt marsh have a different diet and also experience much less shading than those in the mangroves.  As a result, the balance between the energy intake from food and the energy expenditure (which is determined by temperature for these cold-blooded animals) has shifted so that crabs in the marsh have less energy available for reproduction.  They are producing smaller clutches of lower quality eggs than their counterparts in the mangrove.  As a second example, mud crab lives in oyster reefs on the southeast coast that are often degraded for several reasons (oyster harvesting, disease, lack of oxygen in the water, getting buried by sediment, etc.).  Mud crabs eat oysters, so as oyster reefs degrade, mud crabs have less to eat.  However, the reduction in food consumption depends on the personality of the individual crab.  Bold crabs will readily leave degraded reefs to find better ones that offer more food, while shy crabs are more likely to remain on degraded reefs rather than take the risk of trying to move between reefs.    This results in bold crabs living on healthy reefs where they eat a lot of food and shy crabs living on low quality reefs where they eat smaller amounts of food.  The amount of food consumed by individual crabs in turn controls how many eggs they produce.   As illustrated by these two examples, each system we examined had very different mechanisms that altered dietary food intake, but in each case the end result was the same &ndash; as crabs ate less food, and especially as they ate less animal food (even if they still ate lots of plants), their reproductive success dropped off quickly.

This project involved 8 graduate students and more than 2 dozen undergraduate students who participated and received training and experience in all aspects of the scientific process.  Results from this project have also had important impacts on the nonscientific community.
