<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the 5th Annual NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE) Grantees Conference, a program review and research networking workshop that will highlight the ongoing research and educational activities of the NSF NSE grant programs. The proposed conference will be held at the Westin Arlington Gateway Hotel, Arlington, VA on 5-7 December 2011. The lead academic chair of the meeting will be John R. Regalbuto of the University of South Carolina. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals for this proposed 3-day conference are to promote dissemination of innovative research progress, to facilitate research partnerships, and to identify future research directions. Oral presentations with question periods, panel discussions, and a poster session are planned as platforms to promote inter-university and academic/industry/government/national-laboratory interactions. These interactions represent a vital step toward the advancement of the goals of the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) (www.nano.gov) which are to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) conduct research and development to realize the full potential of nanoscale science and engineering; &lt;br/&gt;2) develop the skilled workforce and supporting infrastructure needed to advance research and development; &lt;br/&gt;3) better understand the social, ethical, health, and environmental implications of the technology; and, &lt;br/&gt;4) facilitate transfer of the new technologies into commercial products.</AbstractNarration>
