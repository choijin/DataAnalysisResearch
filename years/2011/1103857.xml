<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research in Algebraic Geometry is concerned with the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. It offers models for non-linear problems across the mathematical spectrum, with numerous applications to statistics, science and engineering. The systems of interest typically involve many equations and many variables, and it is essential to look for ways to simplify them. One such way of achieving this goal is to set certain parameters to zero: if done carefully, the resulting systems retain many properties of the original one and may be easier to study.  The field of Tropical Geometry has developed the tools to select these parameters.  It is in this sense that tropical varieties are combinatorial shadows of algebraic varieties.  Non-Archimedean analytic geometry, as developed by Berkovich, is a variation of classical complex analytic geometry for non-Archimedean fields such as p-adic numbers or Laurent power series. Solutions to a system of polynomial equations over these fields form a totally disconnected space in their natural topology. The process of analytification adds just enough points to make them locally connected and Hausdorff. The resulting spaces are technically difficult to study but, notably, their heart is combinatorial: they can be examined through the lens of tropical and polyhedral geometry.  The findings of this project included the application of this powerful philosophy through concrete examples, including elliptic curves, the tropical Grassmannian of planes of Speyer-Sturmfels, and a compactification of the well-known space of phylogenetic trees of Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann. We expect this last example will have implications to the analysis and comparison of evolutionary processes, including cancer. The space of trees and the compact tropical Grassmannian of planes can provide a geometric description of these spaces in order to compare evolutionary processes.
