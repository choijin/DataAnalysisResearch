<AbstractNarration>Fayetteville State University's "Preparing Future Educators for Placement in K-12 Mathematics and Science Classrooms" (PrEP) Noyce Scholarship Program involves collaboration among the Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science, Chemistry and Physics, Natural Sciences, the School of Education, and the Mathematics and Science Education Center to provide scholarships to future teachers.  Candidates for these scholarships are undergraduates majoring in one of the sciences or mathematics at FSU and professionals with science degrees who are returning to school to become qualified as secondary school teachers of their disciplines.  To encourage undergraduates to consider this career path, the program also provides internships for freshmen and sophomores to assist summer teaching activities both at Fayetteville State University and at partner community colleges.  To assist new teachers in the first two years of their induction as active teachers in high-need school districts, a program of ongoing mentoring and continuing professional development maintains the professional learning network developed during the scholarship training.  From attracting young students to the teaching profession, through teacher training, to support of new mature professionals, this comprehensive program provides 66 new STEM teachers to a region in great need of STEM educators.  As a Historically Black College or University, FSU serves large numbers of underrepresented minority students.  The Noyce Scholars among them, 66 all told, are leaders and role models for the students they teach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In August 2011, the National Science Foundation (NSF), through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, approved the grant proposal for the Fayetteville State University Preparing Future Educators for Placement in K-12 Mathematics and Science Classrooms Program (FSU PrEP).  A total of $1,183,058 was awarded for a 60-month program to begin in 2011 and expired August 31, 2017 (with a one-year, no-cost extension).  The FSU PrEP Noyce grant provided incentives to entice eligible students to double-major in education and STEM subjects, assistance throughout the experience to ensure students grasped their STEM subject matter, effective pedagogy and developed a passion for teaching.   Goal 1  Spur interest of a greater number of freshman/sophomores in secondary math and science education through participation in the learning community and develop a summer paid internship program that provides exemplary STEM teaching experiences for freshmen/sophomores at FSU and FSU Pre-College programs.   1.a.i. Obj.: Due to the discontinuation of the Mathematics and Biology Secondary Education degrees in spring 2013, the Learning Community was no longer a source for recruitment of candidates for the Noyce Scholars program.   1.a.ii. Obj.: Since the program?s inception, 7 students have participated in 12 summer STEM internships, and all have declared majors in STEM disciplines and education.   Increase the number and diversity of students double-majoring in a STEM major and secondary education, as well as middle school majors concentrating in science and mathematics.  1.b.i. Obj.: Eleven of the 12 students have completed their Baccalaureate degrees or licensures in STEM within two years after receiving the scholarship/stipend.  The remaining student only began receiving support in spring 2016 and will finish spring 2018.   1.b.ii. Obj.: All of the students participating in the Noyce Scholars Program have completed the education programs/seminars/workshops required.  Develop and implement an induction program to support stipend recipients during the first two years of their STEM teaching careers.  1.c.i. Obj.: All Noyce mentor teachers/Fellows/Scholars attended professional development together, thus allowing all to develop increased preparation for teaching skills.  1.c.ii. Obj.: Eleven students have reached Noyce Fellows status, and all have developed best pedagogical practices and professional ethics in STEM education.   Goal 2  Develop a Noyce Internship program to spur interest in more freshmen/sophomores in secondary mathematics and science education and develop a paid internship program.  As discussed in Obj. 1.a.ii, seven students participated in 12 summer STEM internships.  Goal 3  Increase the number and diversity of secondary science and mathematics teachers.  The 11 Noyce participants who have graduated or completed their licensure, are teaching STEM subjects in high/middle schools.  Specifically, 1 private school, 7 high school, 3 middle school teachers.  Of the high school teachers, 4 (math); 2  (Biology), and 1 (Physical Science). Of the 3 middle school teachers, 1 (math) and 2 (science). The one private school teacher teaches math (grades 7-11), and Physics. The final Noyce participant will complete her licensure until 2018.  The Noyce Scholars program has served 16 students: 13 females and 3 males. Of the 13 females, 3 (white) and 10 (African-American).
