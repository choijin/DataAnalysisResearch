<AbstractNarration>Gannon University continues the Scholars of Excellence in Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS) scholarship program.  Over the five-year grant period, the program supports 20 academically promising students per year.  The goals of the SEECS program are to: 1) increase the enrollment of financially needy, academically talented students in engineering and computer science programs; 2) assist students through scholarships and rigorous academic support, and 3) foster professional development to prepare students for STEM careers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cornerstone of the program is the Professional and Personal Enrichment Seminars which offer a single, shared experience for all scholars.  Developmental workshops build social, academic, and career skills.  Organizational and leadership skills are developed through team activities, colloquium speakers and field trips.  The seminar includes a service-learning team design activity.  Paired with a community non-profit organization, the students identify and design a solution to a STEM-related problem to aid the organization.  Such enrichment activities make students more aware of the role of STEM professionals and help them develop social and leadership skills.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project impacts are multifold: 1) to enhance the referral network and partnerships with the Erie City (PA) School District and local Talent Search programs; 2) to disseminate the program structure and successes as a model for implementation; 3) to empower students to provide STEM solutions to local non-profit organizations, and 4) to increase the involvement of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM professions.</AbstractNarration>

The seminars involved considerable interaction among scholars and with the PIs, thus enhancing the bond among scholars as a way of increasing retention.  Developmental workshops, offered by student support offices, built social, academic, and career skills.

Four students? poster presentations, three at the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) North Central Section Conference (2014-16) and one at the 2017 ASEE Zone II Conference, occurred during the grant period showcasing their community-based design project. In addition, one work-in progress article was presented at the 2017 ASEE Zone II Conference title "Development and Design of a Medical Sterilizer for Mission Hospitals."  During this grant period, one journal article (International Journal of Service Learning in Engineering) and four conference papers (ASEE Annual Meetings, ICEER Annual Conference, Frontiers in Education) have been published by the PIs reporting many aspects of the SEECS program.   Finally, the impact of the program?s structure has met the intellectual merit and broader impact criteria of SEECS by having: (1) enhanced the disposition of the scholars towards engineering, service, and professionalism, (2) achieved retention objectives, (3) enabled collaborative PI-students scholarly activities, (4) disseminated the program structure and successes through professional outlets, thereby providing a model for implementation, (5) increased the involvement of women in STEM professions by continuing with successful recruitment practices, and (6) provided enrichment and professional development activities.
