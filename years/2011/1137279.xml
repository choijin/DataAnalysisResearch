<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This project aims at combining cognitive and computational neuroscience, neuroengineering and system identification towards a transformative understanding of the way distributed brain dynamics interact with motor activity in humans. 3-D body and limbs movement kinematics, eye movements and electroencephalographic (EEG) spatiotemporal brain data will be recorded simultaneously during motor control and adaptation in healthy and Parkinson?s disease patients. In particular, altered and real world motor tasks will be simulated in 3-D immersive virtual reality technology with force feedback robots providing proprioceptive interaction and feedback. Cognitive, behavioral and kinematics data will constrain the design of large-scale computational models of motor control and adaptation based on known anatomy and physiology of the basal ganglia. Neuromorphic engineering will guide the design of mobile embedded computational systems for real-time emulation of the brain-body models and closed-loop sensory-motor control for Parkinson?s patients. We expect that the development of new machines for neuro-rehabilitation will result in a threefold synergetic interaction between engineering and neuroscience: human-machine interactions will transform the notion of movement control and provide new contexts to study embodied cognition that will benefit neuroscience; in turn, new knowledge in neuroscience and motor control will accelerate the development of adaptive machines for rehabilitation and/or enhancement. Finally, comprehensive and predictive mathematical models of motor control implemented in neuromorphic hardware are expected to lead to new intelligent neuroprosthetic tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Outcomes of this research will contribute to the system-level understanding of humanmachine interactions and motor learning and control in real world environments for humans, and will lead to the development of a new generation of wireless brain and body activity sensors and adaptive prosthetics devices. This will advance our knowledge of human-machine interactions, stimulate the engineering of new brain/body sensors and actuators, and have a direct influence in diverse areas where humans are coupled with machines, such as brain-machine interfaces, prosthetics and telemanipulation. We anticipate that the confluence of cognitive and computational neuroscience, control theory and wearable, unobtrusive bioinstrumentation will provide novel non-invasive approaches or the treatment and neuro-rehabilitation of Parkinson?s disease and will potentially transform our understanding of brain/body interactions. The project draws graduate and undergraduate students across divisions and in the NSF Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center (TDLC) and Institute of Neural Computation (INC) at UCSD participating in interdisciplinary engineering and neuroscience aspects of the design, optimization, and training of largescale neuromorphic systems and their human interfaces. Through outreach channels on campus supported by the TDLC and the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), the program will actively pursue increased participation in research and education of the next generation of scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

Besides aiming at advances in our fundamental understanding of the multiple feedback loops in brain-body interactions that underlie motor control, the project leveraged non-invasive brain-body sensing and force neurofeedback, coupled with adaptive control strategies derived through system identification of the various neural and motor pathways, for activity-induced synaptic plasticity towards non-invasive rehabilitation of neurological motor disorders, and ParkinsonÆs disease (PD) in particular.  Research outcomes on all fronts of the project have made significant impact in advancing science and technology of neurofeedback and brain-computer interfaces for remediation of neurological disorders.  New developments by our group in on-line and wearable wireless tools for mobile brain-machine-body imaging [Ahktar et al, 2012; Chi et al, 2012; Shih et al 2012], in parallel with development of large-scale silicon models of thalamocortical brain dynamics using neuromorphic integrated circuits [Yu et al 2012, Pedroni et al 2013] have provided a basis for system-level studies of brain dynamics of human motor control in mapping proprioception [Govil et al 2013, Akinin et al 2013], balance [Hernandez et al 2012, 2015], cognitive function [Bigdely-Shamlo et al 2013, Iversen et al 2014, 2015], and reward conditioning [Courellis et al 2015].  The newly developed techniques for real-time 3-D modeling and extraction of source dynamics and connectivity [Mullen et al 2013] and on-line independent component analysis of EEG data [Hsu et al 2015] have further provided powerful tools to connect between the various levels of representation in non-invasive study of brain function from circuits to whole-brain dynamics, by relating EEG signals to cortical focal sources [Mullen et al, 2015].  Results of the research have been extensively published in the peer-reviewed literature (over 70 journal publications) and presented at international conferences and invited/plenary talks as documented in this report.
