<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an on-line analyzer to enable the increased use of alternative fuels in cement manufacturing, and thus reduce energy costs. Cement manufacturing is highly energy-intensive, accounting for a significant portion of fuel use in the world. The rising cost of energy has motivated cement manufacturers to use alternative fuels available at low or no cost (e.g., tires, municipal waste etc.).  However, the use of alternative fuels creates manufacturing problems due to the lack of adequate and timely analysis feedback. In this project, a Rapid Clinker Analyzer (RCA) will be designed, built and evaluated to demonstrate that the system captures and analyzes data in a much faster and cost-effective manner to allow cement manufacturers to analyze product clinker in near-real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to significantly increase the use of alternative fuels in cement manufacturing. Widespread adoption of this technology will result in significant savings to cement manufacturers, while greatly reducing the use of fossil fuels.  In addition, the shift to alternative fuels will reduce landfills, and thus mitigate negative environmental impacts of waste products. This new technology will also provide a unique advancement in analyzer technology because of the more rapid performance and smaller sample required.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this Phase II/IIB Rapid Clinker Analyzer (RCA) development effort, several new Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) analyzers were developed.  This includes designing a Rapid Clinker Analyzer, a Raw Meal Analyzer, and the world?s lightest cross belt analyzer specifically designed for lowest installation and operational costs.     The work included advancements in physics, mechanical design, signal-processing electronics, hardware, and process-control software. Subsystems comprising the above R&amp;D performed are being made available to the world?s current users of older conventional conveyor-mounted PGNAA analyzers.   The broader impact of this work performed under this NSF grant, is that the funding provided has enabled/kick-started, XRSciences, LLC, a new American startup company. Our achievement was the development and building of the technological foundation to manufacture for domestic and international sales, not just one product but a line of 21st Century products for several world-wide heavy industries (Portland Cement, Mining, Metals &amp; Minerals etc.)  Our newly developed product line (a) reduces consumption of fossil fuels, (b) decreases green-house gas emissions, (c) improves the quality of the respective products of these industries, and (d) increases profitability of the companies utilizing our new product line.  For the USA taxpayers, the impact is two-fold: (a) Additional American jobs and (b) with increases in international export sales, therein boosting USA economy by helping reduce the USA export-import trade deficit.  The societal benefit is significant reduction in global greenhouse gas production - aimed to help slow and (ultimately reverse) global warming through the purchase and use of the XRSciences new product line.
