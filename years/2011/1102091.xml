<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for participants in a sequence of three regional conferences in applied mathematics to be held in the upstate New York area.  These three meetings of the New York Conference on Applied Mathematics are to be held at the:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* State University of New York, Buffalo, on Saturday, April 16, 2011;&lt;br/&gt;* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on Saturday, April 14, 2012; and&lt;br/&gt;* Cornell University on Saturday, April 13, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference programs, which will include talks in mathematical biology, imaging science, fluid mechanics, applications of dynamical systems, network theory, and numerical analysis, will also feature poster sessions, brief "research advertisement" presentations, and panel discussions on open problems and future directions in applied and computational mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference series will strengthen ties between applied mathematicians and scientists working in the upstate New York region and will allow researchers and students to stay abreast of a wide array of advances in applied and computational mathematics.  The meetings encourage and support participation by students, junior researchers, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://acm.rit.edu/NYCAM</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 1st New York Conference on Applied Mathematics (NYCAM) was held at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Fall 2009 and was hosted by the RIT Center for Applied and Computational Mathematics, which originated the concept for an annual series of NYCAM meetings with the intent of strengthening ties among applied mathematicians and scientists working in the region. The upstate New York region and the nearby Ontario, Canada region have a wealth of talent in applied and computational mathematics based at a number of institutions and companies such as RIT, Cornell, SUNY Buffalo, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Clarkson University, Syracuse University, University of Toronto, Eastman Kodak, Xerox, Corning, University of Guelph, McMaster University, and many more. This NSF conference grant made it possible to continue the New York Conference on Applied Mathematics for three additional years.  The 1st NYCAM has held at RIT in Rochester, NY on October 17, 2009 and had roughly 90 participants and 50 presentations.  The 2nd NYCAM was held at the University of Buffalo on April 30, 2011 and had 110 participants and featured over 60 talks and posters.  The 3rd NYCAM was held at RPI in Troy, NY on October 13, 2012 and had 70 participants and over 50 talks and posters.  The 4th NYCAM was held at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY on November 9, 2013 and had over 120 participants and featured 70 talks and posters.  These one-day conferences featured talks and posters from professors, students, and researchers working in industry.  Applied mathematical modeling and computation in areas such as mathematical biology, network science, fluid mechanics, applications of dynamical systems, numerical analysis and scientific computing, imaging science, and much more were explored at the conferences.  The annual meetings allowed researchers and students to stay abreast of a wide array of advances in applied and computational mathematics, and the diversity of program topics made it possible for conference participants to re-imagine where the field of applied math is going.  The regional focus of the meetings facilitated significant student participation, including numerous student talks and posters.  Undergraduate and graduate students, not often able to financially afford to travel to distant conferences, attended the NYCAM meetings which provided a very important component of their education.  Applied mathematicians in the upstate New York region working in theory, modeling, and computation are continually contributing to advances in science and engineering.  A primary result of the NYCAM meetings was not only dissemination of results among applied mathematicians in the region, but strengthening of the interchanges between mathematical sciences and researchers working in other disciplines both at universities and at industries.
