<AbstractNarration>Lange will explore several subjects that require solving problems in pure computability theory, some that are purely model-theoretic, and some that are a mix of the two.  For example, Lange is studying the structure consisting of the computably enumerable (c.e.) sets under inclusion, an object of intense study in classical computability theory. The problems she plans to study focus on when  a given c.e.  &lt;br/&gt;set is mapped by an automorphism of this structure to a set that   &lt;br/&gt;computes the halting problem.  On the other hand, Lange is examining the computational complexity of structures associated with real closed fields, generalizations of the ordered field of the reals.  Many of these questions cannot be answered without first solving purely algebraic or model theoretic problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of computable structure theory, Lange's area of research, is  &lt;br/&gt;to examine mathematical structures from an algorithmic perspective.   &lt;br/&gt;There are many problems in mathematics for which there is no way to compute a solution.  Knowing a problem is not computably solvable, however, provides only limited information about its algorithmic complexity.  Given two problems, if one can compute a solution to the first problem from a solution to the second, the second problem is at  &lt;br/&gt;least as computationally difficult as the first.   Lange and others in  &lt;br/&gt;the field work to precisely calibrate the algorithmic difficulty of a mathematical problem by finding its place in  the standard computational framework that grew out of Turing's work.  A critical aspect of computable structure theory is understanding the relationship between definability and computability.  Definability refers to the ability to describe aspects of a mathematical object using a formal language.  Thus, answering questions in computable structure theory often furthers the  understanding of the mathematical objects under consideration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Lange  works in  computability theory, a  branch of mathematical logic that analyzes  theoretical models of computation.  The majority of her work for this project is in computable structure theory, a subdiscipline that aims to calibrate the computational power of specific mathematical  problems.   Lange's research in this subdiscipline  centers on integer parts for real closed fields.  The real numbers   consists of all numbers that can be written using the decimal system (e.g., 3.1415...).  A real closed field is a mathematical structure that has the same algebraic   properties as the real numbers.   Now, the integers (all whole numbers) form a kind of backbone for  the reals in that every real number can be rounded to an integer  "close" to it.   However, the integers are not a backbone for many real closed fields.  Given a real closed field R, it is natural to ask whether there is some subset Z of R  that behaves like  the integers do inside the reals.  Such a subset Z is called an integer part.  Mourgues and Ressayre   proved that the answer is yes: every real closed field has an integer part.     From the perspective of  computable structure theory, a natural goal is to determine exactly how  hard it is to compute an integer part, given a real closed field.  Lange and her collaborator J. Knight (with others) worked on related questions throughout the project period.  They have obtained some complexity bounds on computing  integer parts, and they have exactly characterized the computational power of finding some related structures.  Measuring the computational content of a problem (such as finding integer parts) requires obtaining a deep understanding of what aspects of a solution drive complexity.  This work often involves answering  questions in the original domain of the problem (in this case algebra) that are of independent interest.     This work on integer parts required that Lange and J. Knight answer a natural question about  Newton's method, a classical technique for solving polynomial equations, in an important number system called a Hahn field.  Lange and J.
