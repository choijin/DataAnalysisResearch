<AbstractNarration>This project is renewing the Dean-in-Residence Program (DIR) at the National Science Foundation. This program has been run twice before in the early 21rst Century. The DIR program is a cooperative activity between the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) and the Division of Graduate Education.  It is designed to improve communication and understanding about issues in graduate STEM education through a partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the graduate community represented by the Council of Graduate School, which is the only U.S. organization dedicated solely to the advancement of graduate education and research, with a membership of over 500 institutions of higher education. The core purpose of the DIR Program is to improve substantive ongoing communications between senior university leaders of graduate education and the NSF. This partnership can contribute significantly to the NSF portfolio in graduate education and result in the improvement of graduate education in the U.S.  The program renews the DIR each year through the joint selection of a new dean by NSF and CGS. The selected individual is in residence at the NSF at least 60% of the time and as much as 80%, with the remaining work time spent at CGS.  In recent years, the CGS has undertaken large scale projects and increased analyses that are useful to the NSF in assessing the effectiveness of their programs to support graduate students.  An example is the Doctoral Completion project - a long term effort to measure accurately what fraction of students admitted to PhD programs complete their degrees in a certain amount of time, how completion rates differ by key variables (e.g. field of degree), and how to improve completion.  In general the analyses and data provided by CGS are valuable to NSF program planning and evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS)/ National Science Foundation (NSF) Dean in Residence project was designed to deepen the conversation between NSF &ndash; a major funder of graduate students and graduate initiatives &ndash; and the campus leaders responsible for ensuring access to and success in high quality master?s and doctoral degree programs.   These objectives were met through a variety of activities, including:  a series of conference presentations by NSF program officers at annual CGS and regional affiliate meetings; a compilation of a set of resources universities use to actively assist graduate students and prospective graduate students as they apply for NSF?s prestigious Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP); the development of a speaker series that brought graduate education researchers and experts to NSF to give presentations to the Division of Graduate Education and other NSF staff; the facilitation of in-depth discussions between NSF and other federal agencies that value investment in graduate education, as well as  between the various NSF directorates; and a hosted workshop, engaging funders and graduate educators from the U.S., Canada, Germany, Japan, and the European Union in a discussion of strategies for evaluating the impact of international experiences on the subsequent careers of STEM doctoral students.    All panels and presentations were coordinated by the dean in residence, who split time between CGS and NSF, and the process for ensuring continuing participation in national and regional graduate education conferences has become more regularized.  Results of the workshop on international research experiences have been disseminated widely online and through a webinar attended by approximately 250 graduate faculty and administrators.  Results of the CGS/NSF dean in residence project have also appeared as lead articles in the CGS newsletter.  Through conference presentations, facilitated dialogue, webinars, research and analysis, this project has helped NSF to understand the impact of the investments they are making in graduate education and to gain the insights about day-to-day operations on university campuses and in STEM degree programs that can further refine and strengthen their investment portfolio.
