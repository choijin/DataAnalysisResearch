<AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel and subsistence to students so that they can attend the Symposium on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), which this year is being held San Jose, California in June 2011 as part of the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC). PLDI is a top conference in the field of programming language and compiler technology. Attending enables students to hear the latest results in the field, meet with other researchers, and build community with the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ACM Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI) is one of the premier conferences in computer science. Thus, it is a critical one to attend for students working in the areas covered by PLDI.  In 2011 the conference was held at the ACM Federated Conference in San Jose, CA.  This proposal provided partial or full support for 14 additional students to attend the conference.  ACM SIGPLAN already has a mechanism for supporting student travel to the PLDI conference (http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm ) but that program only supports authors or co-authors of papers. The purpose of the NSF grant was to allow additional students to attend the conference that would otherwise not be able to attend.   Among the students awarded support were four females, three undergraduates, one masters student, and six US citizens.  All students attend US universities.  Some students chose to provide impact statements for how attending the conference affected their careers, as in the following example from one of the undergraduates:    "I hope that attending PLDI will first give me a better understanding of what doing academic research as a career would be like and the greater community I would be in, as well as allow me to discuss my ideas for the work I've done and work I plan to do with different people who have a broader understanding of what is interesting and useful in the field of parallel programming languages."
