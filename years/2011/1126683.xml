<AbstractNarration>This MRI project will build a large, novel magneto-electrostatic spectrometer, highly optimized for precision measurements of four key parameters describing neutron beta decay: "a", the electron-neutrino correlation, "b", the Fierz interference term, as well as "A/B/C", the beta/neutrino/proton asymmetries.  The device will be mounted at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline (FnPB) of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  The proposed spectrometer will be a premier instrument for precision study (at the level of a part in ~1000) of neutron beta decay in the US and in the world.  The experiment is expected to provide critical results toward resolving longstanding discrepancies in the neutron decay world data set.  The proposed device, coupled with state of the art neutron beam, will enable the collaboration to set stringent limits on certain processes that would extend the Standard Model, with strong implications in astrophysics.  The spectrometer will be developed and built by a consortium comprising University of Virginia (UVa), Arizona State University (ASU), and ORNL, with UVa as the lead institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides advancing fundamental science, the proposed project's impact is mainly in higher education.  The UVa and the ASU groups have established records of training Ph.D. and postdoctoral scientists who have proceeded to assume productive roles in academia, research, and industry.  Several undergraduate students will gain valuable research experience working on the proposed project; four have already been deeply involved in the design phase.  As well, the PIs' groups have an established record of including members of underrepresented minorities (in recent past there have been two African American Ph.D. students, as well as women Ph.D. students, postdocs, and undergraduate students).  The PIs are strongly committed to attracting members of underrepresented groups, to help broaden the human resource base of the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Neutron beta decay, n &rarr; p+ e + &nu;, is one of the most basic processes in all of nuclear physics, and it affects profoundly certain fundamental properties of the universe we live in.  The most basic laws governing natural processes at the smallest length scale accessible to human study are embodied in the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles and interactions.  Although the SM has been spectacularly successful in describing all available experimental evidence, it is known to be incomplete and in need of substantial extesions.  Therefore, stringent tests of the SM rank among the top priorities in modern physics.  Neutron beta decay provides one of the means for rigorous testing of the SM.  The Nab experiment, a collaboration of  10 US and 3 international institutions based at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL),Tennessee, has the goal to improve the precision of the electron-neutrino angular correlation a in neutron beta decay by more than an order of magnitude, from the current &Delta;a/a = 4% to &Delta;a/a = 0.1%. Nab also aims to measure b, the Fierz interference term, a subtle distortion of the electron energy spectrum in neutron beta decay, at the precision of &Delta;b = 0.003. The parameter b vanishes in the Standard Model.  Measurements of a and b at the goal precision of Nab would strongly constrain possible particles and processes beyond the SM.  The objective of the present award "MRI Consortium: Development of a Magneto-Electrostatic Spectrometer for High Precision Measurements of Neutron Beta Decay"  was to design, contract and oversee the building of, and finally to install at SNS, a complex Nab magneto-electrostatic spectrometer for the purpose of carrying out the Nab measurements.  The actively shielded spectrometer comprising six primary coils, five counter-coils, and four trim coils, all superconducting, and an ultra high vacuum (UHV) bore tube with tightly controlled work function surfaces, was designed by the University of Virginia (UVa) group and built by Cryogenic Ltd, UK, under close supervision by UVa and ORNL scientists.  In spite of production delays and a technical setback at Cryogenic, the spectrometer was completed, tested to be in full compliance with design specifications for the magnetic field, transported to ORNL, and installed in the Fundamental Neutron Beamline at SNS. The electrostatic part of the spectrometer, designed and built by the UVa group, consists of several sets of electrodes with highly optimized geometrical shapes and custom surface coatings.  As noted above, tight Nab systematics require ultra high vacuum; the vacuum system was also designed and implemented by the UVa group.  The Arizona State University (ASU) group designed and built the iron structure that serves simultaneously as a passive magnetic shield and mechanical support for the spectrometer.  Thus, all technical and scientific goals of the MRI award have been met fully, and the Nab experiment is now ready to proceed without impediments.  Broader impacts of the project include extensive research training received by about 20 undergraduate students, 9 graduate students, as well as 4 postdocs and junior research personnel.  Technical developments and results have been shared in approximately a dozen reports and publications, with broad dissemination at scientific meetings and conferences.  Of note is the participation of graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs in presenting these results, thus obtaining valuable professional training.  Silicon detector design and techniques developed for Nab are already in use, or planned to be used, by other groups in subatomic physics.  Advanced Monte Carlo simulation techniques refined for Nab are finding applications in medical research, specifically in radiation oncology.
