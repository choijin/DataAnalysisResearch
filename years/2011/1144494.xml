<AbstractNarration>The Alaska/Aleutian Arc is the most geologically active region in North America with abundant large earthquakes and eruptions from more than 50 active volcanoes.  Determining precisely how and when the Aleutian Arc began to form is one of the key elements for understanding the origin of the Bering Sea-Alaska-North Pacific region as well as how several circum-Pacific volcanic zones are related to one another.  Our understanding of how volcanism initiated in the Aleutian Arc is clouded due in large part to the scarcity of data that bear on the ages of the earliest volcanic rocks in the Aleutian Islands.  The proposed reconnaissance investigation of Aleutian Arc inception involves sampling and determining the ages of the oldest records of volcanism.  The aim is to define when Aleutian arc volcanism started and highlight potential linkages with the initiation of volcanism elsewhere in the Pacific and the rapid change in the relative motions of oceanic plates that occurred 52 million years ago.  In addition, the proposed research will generate basic information regarding how and why the Aleutian arc poses significant volcanic and earthquake hazards to the population in Alaska and around the Pacific Rim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will employ state-of-the-art 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb geochronology, along with geochemical, and isotopic analysis of the dated rocks.  The focus is on subaerial outcrops on Amatignak, Ulak, and Kiska islands, which hold the greatest potential for exploration into the early history of the Aleutians.  New geochronologic and geochemical data will precisely constrain when the Aleutian arc inception began, what the compositions of the eruptive products were, and how they evolved through the earliest history of the arc.  This information will also be used to evaluate the existing tectonic models of Aleutian arc inception and Pacific Plate motion during the middle Eocene.  This project will forge a new collaboration between scientists at UW-Madison, Cornell University, and the University of Alaska-Fairbanks/USGS that may benefit the GeoPRISMS program for its duration.  Our findings will be used immediately to determine where future efforts to examine the Aleutian Arc and its fore-arc structures via submersible ROVs, dredging, and geophysical imaging should concentrate to best address questions of subduction zone initiation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to determine how and when the Aleutian arc formed and to characterize the compositions of the Aleutian arc crust during initiation and growth.  We identified rock outcrops on several islands that appeared to have a high probability of providing new limits on the timing of Aleutian arc inception. Two reconnaissance field campaigns were conducted in the summers of 2012 and 2013 with the help of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service vessel M/V Tiglax.   Initial age determinations and geochemical analyses from the rocks collected during the field campaigns revealed that most of the subaerial samples of the older portions of the central and western Aleutians are &lt; 40 million years old and thus provide little information on subduction initiation.  As a result, we refocused our priorities and aimed to constrain the along- and across-arc chemical evolution of the central and western Aleutians over the last 40 million years of arc history.    A summary of the findings is provided here:  Overall, we have conducted 40Ar/39Ar laser age determinations along with geochemical and isotopic analyses on more than 130 samples.  Twenty-two 40Ar/39Ar ages reveal that magmatism in the Delarof (178 &deg;W) region spanned 37 million years and was coincident with two arc-wide magmatic flare ups ~34 million years ago) ~6 million years ago.  A significant transition in arc chemistry of the lavas in this region occurs in the last 5 million years where lavas from nearby active volcanoes Gareloi and Tanaga exhibit a higher amount of a subducted sediment signature in the erupted magma compared to older Delarof Islands closer to the Aleutian trench.   As part of our attempt to understand the evolution of the central Aleutian arc lower crust, we have studied xenoliths, or crustal material incorporated into an erupted magma, from Kanaga Island.  The variable textures, mineral chemistries, and isotopic ratios of these xenoliths show they had experienced a complex history before being incorporated into their ~7 million year old host lava. These xenoliths are interpreted as lower crustal cumulates of mafic arc magmas.  It is from a granulite xenolith that we have surprisingly obtained the oldest age yet reported in the Aleutian arc.   We interpret this age as a time of metamorphism and recrystallization of mafic arc crust by younger arc magmas intruding the existing arc crust.   Calc-alkaline plutons, like those thought to be major crustal building blocks of continental margins are rare in oceanic island arcs, but are present in the Aleutian arc. The oldest of these is the ~10 km wide Hidden Bay pluton on Adak Island. New 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb zircon ages from 16 units show the pluton evolved from 34.6 to 30.9 million years ago in a series of events.  Mineralogical, trace element, and isotopic evidence suggest the plutonic units largely evolved in the deep crust with final crystallization occurring at shallow levels. The presence of calc-alkaline plutons in the central Aleutian arc by 34 Ma requires crustal thicknesses approaching those of the modern arc.  Such a scenario requires a very rapid build-up of the Aleutian ridge in the Eocene.  Our new chemical and 40Ar/39Ar analyses from Attu island, the westernmost Aleutian island, indicate that the oldest units formed between 40 and 16 Ma and have chemical compositions similar to the Marianas arc in the western Pacific.  To our knowledge, similar magmatic rocks are virtually unknown east of Attu.  This project has involved the theses of two students: UW-Madison MS student Allen Schaen and Cornell University Ph.D. student Ashley Tibbetts. Allen Schaen participated in two "open houses" aboard the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service vessel M/V Tiglax while it was in port in Dutch Harbor and in Adak in August of 2013. He answered questions asked by visitors about volcanoes, geology, rocks, and his project.  The findings from this project were presented in 8 talks by Schaen, Jicha, and Kay at ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
