<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of the program is to develop an integrated droplet-based microfluidic system for parallel screening of phenotypic changes in nematode worms within droplet microenvironments of varying chemical compositions. This work aims to provide a radical translation from existing low-throughput worm motility assays to a truly high-throughput, whole-organism assay for testing multi-drug compounds against nematodes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is to provide a powerful lab-on-a-chip assay system for biological studies on whole-animal models with unprecedented high throughput. The system will uniquely combine automated generation and modulation of drug-coded pharmacological droplet libraries, guided movement stimulation, locomotion assay, and electrophysiological recording for single organisms inside droplets. This research is transformative because the system can provide unique details of neurophysiological changes in nematodes with drug exposures, facilitating experiments that are impossible by current techniques. The proposed technology is generic because the system can be adapted to test a wide range of important nematodes and drug compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research will help answer fundamental questions in diagnosing, controlling and predicting drug resistance in nematode parasites, thereby unraveling complex mechanisms of host-parasite interactions. This research will generate broad educational opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, and benefit curriculum development for a new Undergraduate Bioengineering Minor Program of the Iowa State. Women and minority students, and middle school students will be attracted into science and engineering through open-lab tours, and in-class presentations. High school science teachers will be collaborated to develop K-12 instructional materials in the topics of micro/nanotechnology and bioengineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of drug resistance in various nematodes has spurred a great demand for high-throughput techniques for screening multiple drug compounds against targeted parasitic nematodes. Existing molecular mechanisms for detecting altered genotype associated with drug resistance are time-consuming and do not easily translate to observable changes in phenotype. Overall, this research has led to the development of on-chip assays for screening of drug resistance of nematode pathogens. The developed microfluidic devices are capable of measuring different parameters (motility, electrophysiology, and biomechanics) in high-throughput manner, allowing for deep and accurate phenotyping of parastic nematodes.  This research resulted in a flexible droplet-based testing ground to study how nematode parasites respond to different drug conditions. The platform is capable of not only encapsulating single worms into droplets, but also generating drug coded droplet libraries with identical volumes and different drug combinations and concentrations (Figure 1).  This research resulted in a new approach to arraying and immobilizing worm-containing droplets by introducing the droplets into a fluidic network containing an array of droplet traps. Immobilization of droplets during tracking worms has made it more accurate and reliable to detect worm locomotion parameters (Figure 1). The testing result has shown that our assay device is advantageous as it provides a large number of data sets in each dose response curve by automated generation of various different concentrations and exposure of worms to these unique environments (Figure 2).    This research resulted in core-shell stimuli-responsive microcapsules and nanofibers to control drug release within the nematode-containing droplets. These materials are manufactured by electrospray process. Controlled release of real anthelmintic drugs into liquid droplets has been realized (Figure 3).  This research resulted in a microelectrodes-based locomotion tracking system to characterize chemicals-influenced locomotion parameters of nematodes (Figure 4). An image reconstruction and locomotion parameter extraction program was developed to track nematode locomotion behaviors. A multi-parameter extraction method was developed to characterize modes of paralysis in nematodes over an extended time period.  This research resulted in a reliable method to detect and record electrophsiological signal or electropharyngeogram (EPG) of nematodes. A microfluidic trapping method was developed to immobilize worms for measurement of EPG signals (Figure 5).  This research resulted in a fiber-optic device for measurement of nematode's musuclar force in response to different drug environment. The ability to quantify the muscular forces of small nematode worms provides a new approach for screening mutants at single animal resolution (Figure 6).   This research provided ample opportunities to train five PhD students and six undergraduate students who were partially involved in the development of the microfluidic devices. One student already received his Ph.D. degree in 2012 on the topic of controlled release of chemical compounds, which was part of the project. The other student is completing his Ph.D. thesis in which microfluidic drug screening is a main part.  Two African-American undergraduate students were involved in the project. One of them was recruited from Tuskegee University (Tuskegee, Alabama) as a summer internship student through the George Washington Carver Summer Research Internship Program at Iowa State University. The student not only studied using microfluidic devices and programmable microscope to screen pathogenic cells and their strains, but also participated in weekly educational seminars, and social and cultural activities at Iowa State.  A female undergraduate student was recruited from Luther College (Decorah, Iowa) as an summer internship student. The small college is in the rural area and does not...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
