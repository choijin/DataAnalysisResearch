<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to investigate last glacial maximum through Holocene glacial change on the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula, an area distinguished by dramatic ice shelf collapses and retreat of upstream glaciers. However, there is a lack of long-term context to know the relative significance of recent events over longer time scales. The PIs will obtain data on former ice margin positions, ice thicknesses, glacier retreat and thinning rates, and Holocene glacier change in the James Ross Island Archipelago and areas near the former Larsen-A ice shelf. These data include maximum- and minimum-limiting 14C and cosmogenic-nuclide exposure dates integrated with geomorphology and stratigraphy. Understanding the extent, nature, and history of glacial events is important for placing current changes in glacial extent into a long-term context. This research will also contribute to understanding the sensitivity of ice shelves and glaciers in this region to climate change. Records of changes in land-terminating glaciers will also address outstanding questions related to climate change since the LGM and through the Holocene. The PIs will collect samples during cooperative field projects with scientists of the Instituto Anta&amp;#769;rtico Argentino and the Korea Polar Research Institute planned as part of existing, larger, research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed work includes collaborations with Argentina and Korea. The PIs are currently involved in or are initiating education and outreach activities that will be incorporated into this project. These include interactions with the American Museum of Natural History, the United States Military Academy at West Point, and undergraduate involvement in their laboratories. This project provides a significant opportunity to engage the public as it focuses on an area where environmental changes are the object of attention in the popular media.</AbstractNarration>

First, we found our multi-fold dating approach worked far better than in other areas around the Antarctic continent, to obtain robust chronologies. Given lack of fossil material, Antarctic glacier deposits are notoriously difficult to date with carbon-14, the method more commonly used world-wide; however, we found a plethora of fossil shell and bone material associated with glacier sediments, which allowed us to obtain one of the most comprehensive 14C datasets in Antarctica. Second, we found there are times in the past when glaciers are not extensive, for example, after the end of the last major Ice Age, after 11,000 years ago. By comparing with findings of other studies elsewhere around the Southern Hemisphere, we conclude that this was a time of widespread warmth and minimal glacier size, due to the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies being in a far southward position. The important point is that predictions of the future behavior of the Westerlies in a warmer world foretell a far southward position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies &ndash; our results imply that in the past this was not favorable for glaciers, and by implication ice shelves. Third, after the warm period ended, by 5,000 years ago, glaciers started to expand again with hemispheric-wide cooling.

Part of our aim was to place into context these recent changes, by improving coverage of observations and understanding of former ice sheet, glacier, and environmental changes, and by implication ice shelves, in this warmest sector of Antarctica.  Two of the most important interrelated objectives of this award include the following. The 1st objective was to carry out two highly successful major field campaigns in remote areas around the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Central to the success, the PI became fully integrated with Argentina's Instituto Antartico Argentino and collaborated with Argentine colleagues, including graduate students. With use of Argentine Air Force helicopters and semi-permanent base camps, we reached several areas not focused on by other groups and we obtained a unique set of samples for laboratory work. The 2nd objective was to obtain several unique datasets on the cryospheric history of this area.  The intellectual merit of the project stems from the fact that our knowledge of how glaciers and ice shelves have changed in Antarctica before the 20th century is still uncertain. Such knowledge is needed, though, because it offers unique insight and teaches us about the range of natural variability of present and past behavior of the glaciers and climate. Moreover, we focused on several chronologic approaches to date the glacier and climate changes including radiocarbon, cosmogenic exposure, and optically stimulated luminescence measurements.
