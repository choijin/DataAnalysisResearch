<AbstractNarration>The use of cloud computing services---services that host infrastructure on &lt;br/&gt;which third-parties can run applications and store data---has skyrocketed in &lt;br/&gt;the last few years. However, despite the growing number of cloud services, most &lt;br/&gt;applications are deployed today on a single cloud service.  This status quo has several&lt;br/&gt;drawbacks---availability and performance offered by an application are limited&lt;br/&gt;by the cloud service on which the application is deployed, and cost borne by&lt;br/&gt;an application provider to meet performance goals is limited by the types and&lt;br/&gt;pricing of resources offered by that service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will enable distributed applications to obtain better&lt;br/&gt;availability and performance at lower cost by planning and managing application &lt;br/&gt;deployments that span multiple cloud services.  Recognizing the fact that different&lt;br/&gt;components of an application have different characteristics, this project will&lt;br/&gt;enable cost-effective multi-cloud deployments by matching the heterogeneity of&lt;br/&gt;an application's components with the diversity of resources offered by&lt;br/&gt;different cloud services.  The research in this project involves three main&lt;br/&gt;tasks---1) the development of algorithms to choose cost-effectively among the &lt;br/&gt;myriad candidate configurations for deploying an application across cloud &lt;br/&gt;services, 2) the design and implementation of a distributed measurement and &lt;br/&gt;monitoring framework to dynamically reconfigure an application's deployment as&lt;br/&gt;the state of cloud services and of the Internet change over time, and 3) the&lt;br/&gt;development of tools and techniques that enable legacy applications &lt;br/&gt;implemented for deployment on a single cloud service to be easily ported to &lt;br/&gt;multi-cloud deployments.  The research will involve significant&lt;br/&gt;systems-building and experimentation with the proposed techniques applied to&lt;br/&gt;deployments of popular applications on real cloud services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;In spite of the increasing popularity of cloud services, there remain several&lt;br/&gt;concerns about their use.  The algorithms and software systems developed as&lt;br/&gt;part of this research may transform the ways in which application providers&lt;br/&gt;use cloud services, thus easing concerns with respect to availability and&lt;br/&gt;performance.  The project also has a significant education component with the&lt;br/&gt;introduction of new graduate and undergraduate classes, and public talks to&lt;br/&gt;increase awareness about cloud services among small and non-profit businesses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
