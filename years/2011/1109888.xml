<AbstractNarration>The PI and his team work on the scientific outcomes from the large and systematic survey for precision stellar elemental abundance analyses that is set out to map the spatial variations in the chemistry across the Milky Way Galactic disk. They employ the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III survey, which is a large-scale, near-infrared (H-band), high-resolution (R ~ 30,000), high signal-to-noise (&gt;100) spectroscopic survey of Milky Way stellar populations. The survey covers wavelengths from 1.51-1.68 microns which is a region that includes useful absorption lines from about 15 chemical elements, including alpha, odd-numbered, and iron peak elements. A three-year bright-time observing campaign from 2011-2014 will enable APOGEE to observe about 100,000 giants stars across the Galactic bulge, disk and halo, with the vast majority of these stars in the disk. This large catalog of chemical abundance data for stars all across the Milky Way from APOGEE is used to address a number of key questions related to the chemistry of the Galactic disk.&lt;br/&gt;The analysis of the data from the APOGEE pipeline gives the stellar parameters (e.g., effective temperatures, gravity, metallicity) and abundances for about 15 elements which are used to deduce additional stellar properties (star-by-star extinctions, distances, ages) that are needed to map the abundances in the disk and to constrain models of Galactic chemical evolution. These maps provide the three-dimensional distributions represent an order of magnitude improvement in what has been achieved before in terms of numbers of stars included, numbers of chemical elements probed, homogeneity in the collection, reduction, and calibration of the data, and spatial coverage, including vast regions of the disk never before probed because of the limitations from dust. &lt;br/&gt;As part of this work, the team plans to release a value-added APOGEE catalog of extinctions, distances and age estimates, along with the APOGEE data on abundances of about 15 chemical elements for about 100,000 stars from the thin and thick disks, and the reduction of these data into multidimensional maps of elemental abundances. These data should have significant value to the wider community of Galactic chemical evolution modelers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to support automated stellar spectroscopic analysis resulting from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS III) program entitled the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE).  APOGEE, to date, has observed more than 150,000 primarily Galactic red giants via near-infrared high-resolution spectroscopy over the wavelength of ~1.5 - 1.7 microns.  These spectra can be used to derive stellar kinematics (radiual velocities) to high accuracy, along with the fundamental stellar parameters of effective temperature (Teff), and stellar surface gravity, as well as detailed chemical abundances from up to 15 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni).  The APOGEE results are providing the most detailed kinematic and chemical maps of our home Galaxy, the Milky Way.    In order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances for such a large number of stars, APOGEE relies on automated software called the APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline (ASPCAP); such automated routines have never been deployed before to analyze high-resolution stellar spectra in such detail.  In this project, we concentrated on two main efforts to support the development and testing of ASPCAP: 1) helped to construct and then test, on standard stars, the spectral linelist that is used to generate the theoretical spectra, which are then matched to the observed stars in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances, and 2) perform manual abundance analyses of red giant members of well-studied star clusters as a way of testing and calibrating ASPCAP.  The APOGEE spectral line list has been extensively studied and improved and it now provides theoretical spectra that are excellent matches to the observed red giants.  Analyses of stellar cluster red giants demonstrate that the spectra, model atmospheres, and spectral line list can result in chemical abundances accurate to some 20%, which is excellent for high-resolution spectroscopic analyses of such a large sample of stars.  In addition to the two main efforts described above, our group has worked so that red dwarf stars can be analyzed using ASPCAP.   In its original form, ASPCAP was fine-tuned to analyze red giants, whose spectra differ considerably from those of red dwarfs.  Towards this goal, we have added an extensice and accurate H2O line list to the APOGEE line list (this amounts to some 26 million H2O lines within the APOGEE window).  In the future, we will continue to improve the line list as it applies to cool dwarfs by adding FeH.  The support provided to APOGEE and ASPCASP through this proejct has helped lead to a very robust set of derived stellar parameters and detailed chemical abundances.  This result is illustrated nicely by Figure 1, which displays the APOGEE red giants, color-coded by metallicity (closely related to the iron abundance) and superimposed upon a stylized, but accurate, image of the Milky Way.  This illustrates indeed that APOGEE has provided the most extensive and detailed chemical map of our home Galaxy.       Last Modified: 10/13/2015       Submitted by: Verne V Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
