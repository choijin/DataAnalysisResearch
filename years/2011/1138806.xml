<AbstractNarration>This award supports a special symposium at the 2011 American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR) annual conference.  The symposium will address the linkages between precipitation and other atmospheric processes, such as nucleation, and formation of cloud droplets and ice crystals, as well as the effect of changes in aerosol particles due to human activities on precipitation, the radiative and dynamic properties of clouds, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide travel support for four early career scientists to attend and present as invited speakers at the symposium, including several women.</AbstractNarration>
