<AbstractNarration>The University of Northern Iowa has been granted an NSF award to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site (REU): The Interdisciplinary Research Experience in Hyperspectral Imaging (IDREHSI). The goal of this project is to introduce young scientists to a highly interdisciplinary research environment with a unifying theme of fundamental and applied research in hyperspectral imaging (HI) in eight different STEM disciplines. Recent technological developments and the increased availability of laboratory, satellite, and airborne-based HI imagery has led to a growing demand for HI-related jobs which calls for greater learning, understanding and use of hyperspectral imaging for various applications. Given the advantages of HI, REU students will have opportunities to engage in HI-based research in geographic information science, earth science, environmental science, physics, biology, computer science, and atmospheric science for different applications such as mapping and modeling of land use/land cover, minerals, soils and geologic features, water resources, wetland, forestry, and precision agriculture. The participants will: (1) be exposed to existing scientific approaches and experimental methods in HI, (2) develop skills that make students competitive in academic and professional environments, (3) be involved in faculty-mentored scientific investigations that prepares them for graduate studies and/or professional careers, (4) operate in highly interdisciplinary research settings and work across disciplinary boundaries in problem-based research, (5) improve their capability for learning independently, and (6) provide opportunities to discuss ethical issues related to collection and use of data, experimental design, and professional standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>

The <em>REU Site &ndash; Interdisciplinary Research Experience in Hyperspectral Imaging (IDREHSI) </em>program at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) is an 8-week summer school that has trained 32 young undergraduate scientists to a highly interdisciplinary research environment with a unifying theme of fundamental and applied research in HI. Student participants engaged in HI&shy;-based research projects with faculty mentors from various STEM fields including physics, biology/environmental sciences, geographic information science, computer science, and geology/earth science. New and unique HI datasets were collected using the state-of-the art equipment such as the Hyperspectral Imaging System<em> </em>and the Hyperspectral Radiometer, new HI data collection methods were established by incorporating various devices including the biological microscope and the Raman spectrometer, new HI image processing approaches were developed by creating new specialized HI image indexes,<em> </em>new HI image analyses were carried out with integrated field and ancillary data, and new HI applications were conducted in vegetation science, environmental hazards, geology, Arctic and cryosphere, hydrology, urban mapping, public health, nanotechnology, and image processing and interpretation where the use of HI used to be impeded by the limited access to HI devices and datasets and the demanding computer processing required. These projects were carried out at either lab-based (involving spectral analysis of minerals, chemical contamination in plants and soils, and human cancer cells at the microscopic level and of graphene, aerogel, nanocellulose, and nanopartical at the nanoscale) or field-based (allowing outdoor data collection for shadow detection and correction in HI images, monitoring and estimation of water quality, soil and sediment mapping, invasive species mapping, evaluating the impact of wind turbines on crops, disease detection in trees, urban material mapping, and wildfire, sea ice, and supraglacial features detection and modeling in the Artic and cryosphere). The potentials of HI were substantively explored in various aspects of characterizing the chemical and structural properties of a given target spatially and spectrally, which otherwise would be difficult or impossible with traditional imaging and spectroscopy systems.&nbsp; </span></p> <p><span>As the first and the only REU Site at UNI and the state of Iowa in the field of Earth Sciences, IDREHSI successfully created a highly interdisciplinary research environment by involving 7 faculty mentors (3 were women) who are from two colleges and multiple disciplines, 2 research centers, and 6 laboratories at UNI, 1 peer university, 2 state agencies, 1 major research facility, and 1 private enterprise. Since 2012, the program was successfully reached out to 32 students with a wide subject background including those traditional (e.g., computer science, geography, physics, and biology, etc.) and non-traditional (e.g., nursing, English, and Theatre Design, etc.) STEM majors. Student participants were from home institutions ranging from private colleges to historically black colleges and to public universities, and from all academic grades with a slight emphasis on the junior level.&nbsp;90% of students were outside of the host institution and nearly 40% were women or other underrepresented groups. The tracking of post-REU students indicated that, after leaving the IDREHSI program, at least 10 (30%) REU students applied to participate in one or more other research-oriented programs and graduate schools in a STEM discipline. By involving student mentors, the REU program also trained 9 graduate students (1 was a woman) in the field of HI in its highly interdisciplinary research setting.</span></p> <p><span>All research projects and results were shared at professional conferences in the host institution, the region, and in the nation. Before leaving the program, all students presented their research in both oral and poster format at the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>UNI</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>College of Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Conference.&nbsp;</em>After returning to their home institutions, students received continued supports from the program team. Based on their REU projects, 13 students gave presentations at the local (3%), regional (9%), national and international (40%) conferences, 1 student published his paper on an online depository, 1 student won the undergraduate research award from her institution, 1 student won the undergraduate research competition at a conference,&nbsp;and 6 students are preparing manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals. In addition, research projects conducted in the IDREHSI program were incorporated as a critical component in developing an advanced remote sensing course &ndash; GEOG 4380/5380: Satellite Image Processing &ndash; offered in the Geography Department at UNI. Experiences and lessons learned from running the REU program were shared at one professional workshop and presented at two international conferences<span>&nbsp;</span>and as a public lecture.
