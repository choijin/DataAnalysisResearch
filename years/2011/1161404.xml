<AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed research is to develop the foundations for resource allocation in femtocell networks, and evaluate the performance of the solutions using real testbeds.  Wireless resource allocation in femtocell-based networks is particularly challenging due to four main reasons: (1) interference between femtocells and between femto- and macro-cells; (2) variable and unpredictable delays in signaling and data communication between each femtocell and the operator's network; (3) limited bandwidth for signaling over a wireless channel to a large number of femtocells; and, (4) involvement of three parties with differing priorities: the operator, the users, and the femtocell owners.  The specific research tasks in this project are: (1) For legacy systems, develop distributed solutions for both downlink and uplink scheduling and handover under co-deployment of macro- and femto-cells that do not require any changes to existing hardware and standards; (2) Develop distributed, adaptive and self-organizing solutions (unconstrained by legacy requirements) for resource allocation by using a powerful tool from statistical physics, called Glauber dynamics; and (3) Design mechanisms to facilitate offline truthful auctions in practical settings involving the end-users, the femtocell owners, and the operator.  The solutions will be implemented and evaluated on two testbeds under development at University of Michigan and at Ohio State University.  The proposed research has the potential to significantly impact the cellular industry and end-users. Given the high penetration rates of cell-phones worldwide, this research has an immediate and widespread impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  New algorithms were developed to dramatically improve the quality of service experienced by users in wireless networks. These novel algorithms were designed for the purpose of better assigning spectrum resources to multiple competing users. In addition to improving user experience, a recurring theme in the project was to ensure that the algorithms were not too complicated for implementation in real systems. Towards this goal, we also studied tradeoffs between user experience and the complexity of implementation of our algorithms.  Specific accomplishments include the following: (i) The development of a scheduling algorithm which explicitly takes into account the amount of time that a user has been waiting in service, (ii) game-theory based models for sharing the spectrum among many competing users, (iii) algorithms to improve the fairness of resource sharing between competing users in a wireless network, and (iv) economic models for pricing and sharing resources in a wireless networks.  Broader Impact:  The algorithms developed in the project have the potential to improve the performance of future wireless networks. Students and post-docs trained in cutting-edge wireless technology graduated after spending time on this project. Participation in the project helped to improve the presentation of course content by the principal investigator in courses on communication networks and game theory.
