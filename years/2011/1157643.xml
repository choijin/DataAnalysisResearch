<AbstractNarration>This award supports a planning visit for PI Emi Uchida from the University of Rhode Island to initiate interdisciplinary research and an education partnership between the U.S. and Tanzania on the dynamic linkages between mangrove ecosystem services and poverty traps. The planning trip will bring together experts and university students from the U.S. and Tanzania to identify research gaps and innovative educational opportunities where potential for collaboration is the greatest. The planning trip will feature a series of interdisciplinary discussions led by experts in mangrove ecology, ecohydrology, development and environmental economics, and sociology and experts from local nongovernmental organizations with experience in coastal management in Tanzania.  The planning trip and the collaborative preliminary data collection by the U.S. and Tanzanian graduate students will provide the participants with opportunities to develop a strong network for advancing international collaborative research that transcends disciplines in natural and social sciences. The research proposals will address sustainability issues of a critical importance to coastal Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions where mangrove forests provide critical benefits to the poor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the visit is to develop collaborative research and education proposals to be submitted to NSF programs.</AbstractNarration>

We have six project outcomes:     1) New research framework   Based on the field observations and discussions, the research team concluded that some ecosystem services (e.g., wave attenuation, fish and shrimp habitat) may have more significant roles in coping with and managing risks in the coastal communities. Field observations also revealed significant diversity in the types of mangroves and soil properties, implying that the supply of ecosystem services from mangroves varies significantly across coastal communities.

Combined, the field observations suggest that the supply and demand for mangrove ecosystem services have variation across villages, which in turn implies that different conservation strategies are needed.  The research team developed a new conceptual framework linking sources of poverty trap and mangrove ecosystem services at multiple spatial scales.    2) New data on properties of mangrove sediment in Tanzania Mangrove sediment samples revealed some similarities as well as differences across the four sampled sites. Overall, the high bulk density values and low organic matter content observed across all sites suggest the influence of river-dominated settings and strong tidal amplitude in this region (Table 1). Soil N density varied from 0.3 &plusmn; 0.02 mg cm-3 (Kajanjo) to 0.8 &plusmn; 0.05 mg cm-3 (Porokanya-2). Soil P concentrations indicated low P fertility conditions in Ushongo (0.07 &plusmn; 0.01 mg cm-3) compared to the other three mangrove sites. Soil C storage (and ecosystem service) integrated in the top 30 cm of soils indicated considerable differences among mangrove sites.    3) Mangrove use and management institutions  Focus group interviews revealed a variety of uses of mangroves, different ways of managing mangrove forests, and complexity of the local mangrove management institutions. The main uses of mangroves in the four villages include firewood, housing construction poles, and boat construction. Some subvillages indicated other non-use benefits from mangroves including tourism and protection from coastal erosion. Household indicated preferences for specific mangrove species for each type of use. Each subvillage has a committee in charge of managing mangroves and also has management plans and rules. However, the specificity of the rules and the extent of the committeesÆ activities varied widely across subvillages.     4) Perceptions of shocks related to natural resources and weather  Preliminary findings from 2014 survey suggest that over the last twenty years, the coastal communities have been most affected by the large decline in fish, drinking water, shrimp and mangroves. They are also vulnerable to drought, coastal erosion, coastal flooding, hurricanes and salt water intrusion on their crops. Over half of these households were affected by decline in fish populations, and a nearly half were affected by sharp declines in drinking water. To cope with these shocks, households spent more effort extracting fresh drinking water or reduced their household consumption in response to an increase in drinking water scarcity. Many households believed both of these environmental shocks are out of their control and consequently took no action to remediate them.     5) A new NSF proposal   The planning trip, workshop and the subsequent communications among the investigators led to development of a new conceptual fr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
