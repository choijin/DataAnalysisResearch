<AbstractNarration>The Action + Persistence + Leadership + Understanding = Success (A-PLUS) Scholarship Program is selecting forty academically talented, financially needy community college students working to transfer to baccalaureate degree programs in engineering, the sciences, or mathematics. Scholars are being supported by academic and professional development programming; a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) service learning course; faculty mentors; and transfer advisement. Scholars are being recruited through local events, faculty outreach, student services, and electronic communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The college is a Hispanic-Serving Institution educating a significant number of women, minority, low-income, and first-generation college students. The objective of this project is to increase persistence, success, timely transfer, and professional skills, especially among underrepresented STEM students. Scholarships reduce the hours students must work to financially support themselves or their families, allowing them to complete their studies within three years, transfer to earn a baccalaureate degree, and enter the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is founded upon best practices in engagement and persistence, specifically tailored to the local student population. The project is achieving its goals by using faculty mentors who lead student cohorts, success programing and industry visits, dedicated support from student services, and a STEM centered service learning course. The service learning course is based on a substantial literature base on the positive effects of service learning on underrepresented students. The project team is academically well-qualified and experienced to implement the project, representing all STEM disciplines plus student services. In addition, industry and community partners are actively involved in the project and have committed support.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is creating a replicable model scholarship program that utilizes transfer and industry partners to help STEM students succeed, especially underrepresented groups. Findings are being disseminated locally and nationally via webinars, a college hosted workshop, and the web. The project is to increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women achieving STEM degrees and entering the workforce, thus bolstering the competitiveness of the United States in a global economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Award 1154666 Outcomes     National Science Foundation Award 1154666, an S-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) A+PLUS award, was provided to Bakersfield College for the purpose of assisting underrepresented students with academic promise and with financial need.  The goal, over the time frame of the award was to assist forty academically talented, financially needy community college students to transfer to Bachelor?s degree programs in the STEM field.  Eighty one students entered the program over the course of the award and 68 were able to meet the qualifications and to transfer to four year institutions to earn a Bachelor?s degree.  Transfer destinations include California State Universities, University of California Universities as well several schools outside of the state of California.   Twenty four of the community college Scholars who transferred from the program have earned their Bachelor?s degrees as of this report.  All of the Scholars entering the program declared STEM majors their first year in the program.   The breakdown by major area of study was as follows:  58% (47 students) in Engineering or Computer Science; 22% in Biological Sciences (18 students); 4% (3 students) in Mathematics; 16% (13 students) in Physical Sciences (includes Chemistry, Physics, and Geological Sciences).     The underrepresented groups that the scholarship program funded included women, low-income, first-generation, and Hispanic students. Of the 81 Scholars, those who were identified as ethnic minorities, specifically Hispanic were 53% (43 Hispanic). First-generation students 56% (45 students).
