<AbstractNarration>This project considers the impacts and consequences of non-border policing and immigration enforcement by non-federal law enforcement agencies (LEAs) in the U.S. South.  U.S. immigration authorities have historically focused on the U.S.-Mexico border as a priority enforcement site, but today immigration policing extends deep into the U.S. interior. Indeed, since the late 1990s and especially since 2001, non-border policing has emerged as a mainstay of U.S. immigration enforcement. Moreover, experimental federal initiatives to devolve immigration enforcement to non-federal LEAs such as municipal police and county sheriffs through the 287(g) and Secure Communities programs have become standard practice.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The growth of U.S. immigration enforcement in non-border spaces is particularly acute in the U.S. South, which has been fundamentally transformed by the large-scale recruitment of new immigrants into a wide range of labor markets over the past two decades.  The 'nuevo New South' comprises a disproportionate share of immigration enforcement initiatives by non-federal LEAs and as such produces a disproportionate share of detention and deportation cases, relative to traditional immigrant destination sites in the U.S. Southwest and Northeast. Critics argue that the devolution of U.S. immigration enforcement in the U.S. South is rolling back new immigrants' civil rights, employment and education opportunities, access to housing, and physical mobility. Despite this is little social science research on non-federal immigration enforcement practices and its effect in the region. This project starts to fill this gap by a) exploring the genesis and mechanics of non-federal immigration in the U.S. South; b) analyzing the effects of 287(g) and Secure Communities on new immigrant populations in the U.S. South; and c) examining the political mobilization of immigrant rights groups in the region in response to non-federal immigration enforcement. The research site comprises all 287(g) and Secure Communities jurisdictions in the Atlanta GA metropolitan statistical area. Methodologically, the project employs archival research, public records analysis and mapping, interviews, and in-depth ethnographic fieldwork with police and immigrant rights groups. The project draws on the PIs' prior fieldwork in the U.S. South on 287(g) and race, immigrant integration, and political mobilization in new immigrant destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research promises two major contributions. First, it will advance scholarship on local immigration enforcement by providing spatial and ethnographic contexts to 287(g) and Secure Communities enforcement. To date research on this topic has centered on litigation and legislation, and as such does not explain how context, i.e. agency-specific police practices, local legal and political contexts, and community experiences and impacts, shape and are shaped by programs such as 287(g) and Secure Communities. Second, it will also advance scholarship on Latinos in the U.S. South, which is mostly descriptive research on migration patterns and experiences, by exploring the racialized practices related to local immigration enforcement that structure Latinos' social, political, and economic exclusion. The PIs will consider how the historical and contemporary political, economic, and cultural logics of race in the region are shaping and are shaped by the implementation of programs such as 287(g) and Secure Communities, as well as the role of immigrants in challenging and reworking racialized power relations in the region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research Problem   Over the past decade U.S. immigration enforcement has undergone an important transformation. Federal initiatives have devolved immigration policing to non-federal law enforcement agencies, such as city police and county sheriffs, giving them the power to detain individuals on federal immigration charges.  This research focused on two such initiatives, 287(g) and Secure Communities, in the Atlanta, Georgia area, to:  Explore the genesis and mechanics of immigration enforcement at the county level; Analyze the effects of such enforcement on new immigrant populations; and Examine the political mobilization of immigrant rights groups in response.   Findings  Our research substantiates the deleterious effects of non-federal immigration enforcement on Latino communities. While 287(g), Secure Communities, and related state-level policies of policing immigrants in the U.S. interior do little to enhance national security or remove violent offenders, they do ensure that "everyday" spaces away from national borders have become sites of immigrant surveillance and regulation. Such practices have created a climate of fear that inhibits Latino communitiesÆ abilities to work, care for themselves and their families, and lead productive lives as members of their communities. While this study did not find evidence of "self-deportation" as a result of immigrant policing, it does document how these tactics of immobilization negatively impact the lives and livelihoods of immigrants and their families, including access to healthcare, education, worksites, and even church.  We find there is a strong relationship between changing strategies of immigration enforcement and mass incarceration in the United States. The proliferation of traffic policing as a means of immigration enforcement has resulted in an explosive increase in the number of undocumented migrants in detention. By 2013 this number had nearly doubled from a decade prior. Yet efforts to get a handle on precisely how this statecraft is operating are thwarted by an opaque, remote, and hostile detention and deportation regime. Our research on Stewart Detention Center, the largest immigrant detention center in the country, leads us to argue that immigrant detention centersÆ geographic isolation, detainee transfers, privatization, and intense militarization are fundamental to the operations of the system as a whole.  Our research also suggests that immigration enforcement by sheriffs and police can be quite difficult to substantiate through ethnographic fieldwork. While law enforcement agencies use traffic enforcement and policing roadblocks to scrutinize driversÆ legal status, these practices are so ordinary, state record-keeping so limited, and policing practices so guarded that they are challenging to witness in practice.

Our findings document some of the creative ways undocumented immigrants are forging community and affecting policy change despite the barriers they encounter.   Intellectual Merit  There is very little sustained, fieldwork-based research into how non-federal immigration enforcement operates and to what effect. This reflects, in part, a general reliance on immigration law scholarship. Although the latter usefully reviews the legal/legislative details and likely civil rights issues related to 287(g) and Secure Communities, it generally does not take int...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
