<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will develop a means to measure engineering students' ability to function in a global workforce.  The project uses a technique based on situational judgment tests to determine global competence.  By creating a means to measure global competence then widely distributing the measurement instrument, the project can help engineering degree programs to develop effective courses and curricula that prepare students for current, global engineering practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises through the need of engineering degree programs to develop cost effective ways of preparing students to function in a globalized workforce.  By helping program evaluate students' competence, this research can eventually lead to improvements in the US engineering workforce.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
