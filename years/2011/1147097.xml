<AbstractNarration>In the real world, visual objects commonly block, or occlude, each other from view.  Very little is known about how the brain makes up for the missing information about an occluded object and recognizes it nonetheless.  This project will help elucidate the mechanisms by which the brain recognizes occluded objects using neurophysiological methods and will determine what individual cells in the relevant brain regions do when the brain recognizes an occluded object.  The study will also help characterize which tell-tale features in the visible portions of an occluded object the brain uses for this purpose, and how it uses them.  For example, someone's eyes may serve as a dead give-away for them, thus the brain may use this information about the eyes to recognize that person, even when the rest of the face is occluded.  Given the ubiquity of occluded objects in the real world, understanding how one perceives occluded objects is critical to understanding, in a larger sense, how the brain works.  This research will also facilitate the development of better machine-vision tools, so as to help computers better recognize objects of interest in the real world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also has a significant educational component.  For example, classroom courses and hands-on research experience opportunities will not only impart scientific knowledge, but also help students develop an active interest in pursuing careers in science and technology. Undergraduates and graduate students from the Investigator's institution as well as from many other local colleges and universities will participate in this project, providing additional opportunities for students.  The results, resources, and tools generated by this project will be made publically available on the Investigator's website at http://www.georgiahealth.edu/medicine/discovery/bbdi/hegde.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Principal Investigator (PI) had made substantial progress toward both of the Specific Aims of the project under difficult circumstances for animal research at the PI's university, Georgia Regents University (GRU; soon to be Augusta University) in Augusta, GA.      However, the PI was unable to complete this project, for the following reason:  One of the monkeys enrolled in the NSF-funded study died on January 7, 2014 apparently due to an overdose of a narcotic painkiller administered by a GRU veterinarian following a routine, successful surgery. The PI continues to strongly believe, and now has strong evidence to prove, that the relevant documents were falsified, presumably in order to make the animal's death appear non-reportable to federal regulators. The falsifications included, but were not limited to, forgery. The PI was advised by legal experts that he was legally obligated to blow the whistle about these wrongdoings, and he therefore did.     In what PI firmly believes to be clear-cut retaliation, GRU took a series of measures over the ensuing eighteen months or so that ultimately led to the premature termination by the NSF, at the specific request by GRU, of the PI's NSF grant in question.     It is important to emphasize that PI has done nothing wrong whatsoever in this case, nor has he been accused of any wrongdoing whatsoever.  The PI is disclosing this episode herewith solely because he believes he is legally obligated to do so.     The PI strongly believes that this case illustrates, among other things, the Pyrrhic costs of whistleblowing to the whistleblower, especially when the whistleblower is an individual researcher.
