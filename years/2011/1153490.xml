<AbstractNarration>This scholarship project from Oregon State University is recruiting 16 academically talented and financially needy students into Water Resource Science and Engineering. Recruitment efforts focus on underrepresented minorities and first-generation college attendees and therefore diversify the STEM workforce educated in water resources. The program is to transition students into graduate degree programs and ultimately into the STEM workforce. The funding is being used to enhance the experience of students and ensure their success. The program provides mentoring (peer and professional), cohort building and annual retreats to the students. Partnership with potential employers facilitates graduate placement in the workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Project Outcomes Report  The  major goals for this project were:  to recruit talented      students with financial need into the Water Resources Science (WRS) and Water Resources      Engineering (WRE) graduate programs at Oregon State University, to provide these      students with an excellent education, research experiences, and a support network      including professional and peer mentors, and  to help our      graduates enter the work force.   One of the specific objectives of the award was to use these scholarships to help increase diversity in the professions of Water Resources Engineering and Water Resources Science.  First generation college students, as well as Black, Hispanic American, and Native American students are highly under-represented in both graduate engineering programs and graduate programs in the physical sciences (such as hydrology).  The availability of NSF STEM scholarships and associated tuition remission scholarships provided by the Graduate School at Oregon State University helped diversify our graduate program such that in the past three years of the program, over 20% of students enrolled in the WRE and WRS degree programs were members of underrepresented racial minorities and/or first-generation college students.  To date, ten students have completed their degrees, and another eleven students are continuing to work towards their PhD (six students) or Master of Science (five students) degrees. We anticipate that seven more students will complete their degrees in the 2018-2019 academic year, and  four more doctoral students will complete their degrees by 2020.  Our major activities have focused on recruitment of eligible applicants to the Water Resources Science and Water Resource Engineering degree programs, and engagement of the students in earning their graduate degrees.
