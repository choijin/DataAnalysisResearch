<AbstractNarration>This project is creating hands-on biomedical engineering experiments and course materials with a focus on artificial organs.  These modules are being implemented in freshman engineering courses and in core and elective courses in chemical, mechanical and electrical engineering to expand the biomedical engineering workforce. The modules are also being adapted for Grade 6-12 teachers and students, which will expose more students to biomedical engineering careers. Each module is being introduced with a medical case study which provides context to motivate students and present ethical issues. Teams of students are engaging in guided discovery through hands-on laboratory investigations, which maximizes learning and enables them to discover underlying engineering principles to inform their design of an artificial organ. The project's focus on social relevance and teamwork is designed to increase diversity in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit: Chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineers play an important and expanding role in the burgeoning field of biomedical engineering because the core principles of each discipline are critical to biomedical mainstays such as the design of artificial organs. While the number of biomedical engineering degrees granted annually is increasing, many practicing biomedical engineers have a background in a traditional discipline with some specialized biomedical training. Engineering programs in these traditional disciplines struggle to squeeze bio-related topics into their already-crowded curricula, yet undergraduate engineering students are rarely exposed to real biomedical topics through their coursework. To provide students with the skills directly relevant to the evolving needs of the biomedical industry, this project developed and integrated applied biomedical course content and experiments throughout the Rowan Engineering curriculum.   Artificial organs provide a unifying theme for the development of biomedical curicular materials that were integrated at different levels of the undergraduate curricula in Chemical, Mechanical, and Electrical and Computer Engineering. These materials were developed within the How People Learn framework using pedagogical approaches to increase motivation and enhance student learning. Teams of students engaged in the scientific discovery process through hands-on laboratory investigations exploring multidisciplinary engineering concepts, which were then applied to their design of an artificial organ.   Artificial organs were used as the basis of a creative and socially relevant introductory freshman course that introduces engineering principles in the context of artificial organ design. The cohort of first year students who participated in this project showed significantly higher gains in their positive perception of classroom climate, interest and confidence in biomedical engineering, confidence in engineering, confidence in writing, and perception of engineers' contribution to society.  Broader Impacts: A salient feature of this project is the creation of multidisciplinary, scalable and transferrable biomedical course content and laboratory experiments. Scalable modules were implemented in courses at different levels throughout the traditional Chemical, Electrical and Computer, and Mechanical Engineering curricula. The cost-effective modules were tested at another institution and shown to be readily transferable.  This project has resulted in the participation of about 30% of our undergraduate engineering student population in biomedical education and has contributed to producing a pipeline of students who are well trained in a traditional engineering discipline and are prepared to enter the biomedical workforce or pursue graduate studies in a biomedical field.
