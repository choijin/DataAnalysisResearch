<AbstractNarration>During the funding period a systematic reduction of the equations of motion for the cochlear amplifier will be carried out.  The objective is to derive an effective surface approximation for the partition, after which multiple-scales will be used to derive an asymptotic approximation of the nonlinear waves propagating in the cochlea.  The objective is to be able to achieve quantitative agreement with the known properties of these waves, including the apical shift in the tuning curve at low intensity levels, the decrease of the relative contribution of the amplifier with increasing stimulus level, the odd-order distortion tones, the observation that the temporal position of the zero-crossings on the basilar membrane remain largely unaffected by stimulus intensity, and the dearth of harmonic distortion in the basilar membrane response to pure tones at low to moderate sound pressure levels in the basal portion of the cochlea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental open question in understanding how we hear concerns the role of a nonlinear feedback  mechanism known as the cochlear amplifier.  One of the reasons why progress in delineating the exact mechanism responsible for amplification is so slow is that it requires the solution of a three-dimensional, coupled, nonlinear, time-dependent system.  The PI proposes to develop approximation methods that can be used to help study this problem, both the mechanistic basis for amplification as well as its effects on wave propagation in the cochlea.  The results from this study will provide a rigorous framework to help answer the amplifier question.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The fundamental open question in understanding how we hear, and the central question of the supported research project, concerns the role of a nonlinear feedback mechanism known as the cochlear amplifier.  To address this question, we concentrated on the response to a pure tone stimulus. During the funding period we derived, and then analyzed, a mathematical model for the transduction of a pure tone in the cochlea. This required the incorporatation of the contributions of what are known as the outer hair cells, which are responsible for the feedback.  We also included the complex geometric structures that facilitate the feedback.  One of the key outcomes of this work was to show how to construct an accurate asymptotic approximation for the 3D nonlinear wave in the cochlea. Moreover, the mechanism we have proposed is simpler than what others have used, and has the significant characteristic that it is based simply on the geometry and material properties of the system (i.e., the other models require interactions that have little or no supporting experimental evidence).  In terms of intellectual merit, a detailed study of the traveling wave, and its coupling with the electromechanics of the cellular process in the partition, has provided an important foundation for theoretical studies of organ of Corti function. This understanding is necessary in order to determine how mechanical energy stimulates the inner and outer hair cells, how outer hair cells generate high frequency selectivity and sensitivity in the normal inner ear, and to understand the role of the structural dynamics of supporting cells in the organ of Corti.  As for broader impact, with the establishment of a cochlear amplifier as an integral component in determining the properties of the wave propagating along the partition, the mathematical problem for the transduction mechanism in the cochlea becomes significantly more difficult.  Specifically, it is necessary to solve a three-dimensional, coupled, nonlinear, time dependent problem. This is one of the reasons why progress in delineating the exact mechanism responsible for the amplifier has been so slow.  The results from this study provide a rigorous framework for studying the nonlinear response, and for a better understanding of how the geometric and material components of the cochlea work together to generate, and then use, the feedback for sound resolution.
