<AbstractNarration>1153140/Fountain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports an investigation into the feasibility of using high-resolution satellite stereo imagery in combination with historic topographic maps to estimate volume change of alpine glaciers around the perimeter of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.  The contribution of glacier mass loss in Antarctica (exclusive of the ice sheet) is not well known. However, modeling suggests that it accounts for the 39% gap between observed and estimated sea level rise from the world-wide melting of glaciers and ice caps. The combination of recent advances in satellite resolution (sub-meter) and newly available photogrammetric software that can construct digital elevation models without ground control points potentially provides a cost-effective approach for evaluating glacier volume change in remote regions.  The fundamental idea is to subtract the current topography (digital elevation model) based on satellite imagery from the topography based on historic maps thus providing changes in elevation and consequently glacier volume.  Uncertainty is derived from on the apparent elevation differences of bedrock exposures.  If successful, this application will be a powerful tool to quantitatively estimate ice mass loss in remote regions around Antarctica and significantly increase the accuracy of estimated glacier contributions to sea level rise.  Several challenges are posed by this approach that justifies the EAGER program: 1) typically cloudy weather in many areas along the Antarctic coast that precludes imagery acquisition; 2) construction of DEMs of sufficient accuracy to detect change; and 3) availability of accurate historic topographic maps.</AbstractNarration>

High resolution satellite stereo imagery of glaciers can be used to develop topographic maps of 2m resolution vertical without any ground control. This is particularly important for mapping surface topography in remote areas that are expensive to visit. For our particular goals it is a cost-effective means of assessing glacier change around Antarctica which is expensive to visit and difficult weather can make it hard if not dangerous work.  2. The US Geological Survey topographic maps of the McMurdo Dry Valleys are off by over 100m, vertical, across large regions.  The valleys have to be remapped. This is an important finding because many scientific studies use elevation as a benchmark (e.g. temperature change with elevation) and errors in elevation makes such relationships false.

The extent of the outlet glaciers that flow from the Transantarctic Mountains into the Western Ross Sea forming ice shelves have been changing over time. Some glaciers have advanced, others have retreated.  However, we find no trend over time or spatially (north to south) since the late 1950s when our data collection begins.  This study was initiated because the glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula are retreating rapidly.  While we knew the glaciers of the Transantarctic Mountains were not retreating rapidly, we wondered if there was a spatial or temporal pattern to be found.  Our hypothesis was that the glaciers furthest north would be retreating slowly and further south the glaciers would be in equilibrium and not changing.
