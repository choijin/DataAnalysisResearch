<AbstractNarration>The "Deaf STEM Community Alliance: Supporting Postsecondary Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Students in Science, Technology,Engineering and Mathematics," is led by the Rochester Institute of Technology's National Institute for the Deaf with two parterning institutions: Cornell University and Camden County Community College.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's goal is to establish a model for a Virtual Academic Community that will increase graduation rates of Deaf and Hard of Hearing STEM majors in postsecondary education in the long term.  Two objectives support progress toward this goal: 1) Document and disseminate a description of the process of creating the Virtual Academic Community in order to create a scalable model that can be replicated to fit the needs of other students with disabilities in STEM majors; and, 2) increasing the grade point averages and retention rates of Deaf and Hard of Hearing postsecondary students in STEM majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An independent external evaluation of the work is being conducted by Dr. Babara Lee Gelesko McKee.  Results from the work will be available to the public on the project website, at professional presentations and in professional journals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Problem Addressed</strong></p> <p>Deaf or hard of hearing students (DHH) are unlikely to major in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in higher education, or to have STEM careers. DHH students face barriers to a successful STEM education: 1) insufficient preparation and background information; 2) lack of role models and peer socialization with those who are both DHH and have mutual STEM interests; and, 3) lack of access to information about STEM innovations. The project addressed these barriers, creating an online infrastructure enabling tutoring, mentoring, and information sharing about STEM innovations. 70 DHH postsecondary students enrolled from three Northeast campuses: a two-year school (Camden County College, Blackwell, NJ, n=8), a master?s-level university (Rochester Institute of Technology?RIT, Rochester, NY, n=58), and a doctoral-level, Ivy League university (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, n=4). RIT was the lead campus. The <em>goal</em> of the project was to establish a model for a Virtual Academic Community (VAC) that will increase graduation rates of DHH STEM majors in postsecondary education in the long term. Two <em>objectives</em> support the goal: (1) documenting and disseminating a description of the process of creating the VAC in order to create a scalable model that can be replicated to fit the needs of other students with disabilities in STEM majors; and, (2) increasing the GPAs and retention rates of D/HH students in STEM majors.</p> <p><strong>Activities and Accomplishments</strong></p> <p><em>Establish a model Virtual Academic Community (VAC)</em>.

Faculty/graduate students with both content knowledge and communication skills created online synchronous and asynchronous tutoring with students. 174, 60-minute-average length synchronous sessions were held with Google Hangouts or Zoom. Faculty created 474 asynchronous videos for developmental mathematics courses that were captioned, signed in ASL by the instructor, and often displayed the TI graphing calculator. The videos were viewed 3,848 times. Additionally, a biochemistry/chemistry instructor created 13 videos reviewing general chemistry problems. These videos are now used in an RIT-funded research project. Data collection continues.</p> <p><em>Role models and peer socialization</em>. DHH students lack DHH STEM professionals as role models and experience isolation from others with common STEM interests. Twenty-one DHH STEM professionals were recruited as mentors. Mentors and students were paired for career interests and, in part, by communication preference. The mentors communicated with their mentees approximately 81 times through email, text, and videophone (e.g., FaceTime). Project members socialized through private Google+ (Currents) and Facebook platforms with community-building posts (e.g., birthdays, achievements) and accessible STEM content. Mentors contributed 199 posts, 431 comments, and 1,082 responses. Students made 314 posts, 408 comments, 521reactions, and 5,903 views.</p> <p><em>Providing accessible information about STEM innovations</em>.
