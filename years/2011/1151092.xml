<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, supports the proposed research and educational plans of Professor Timothy B. Clark of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of San Diego. The project aims to develop substrate-directed C-H borylation reactions, which result in selective formation of carbon-boron bonds. The proposed research plan focuses on the design and development of catalysts that selectively functionalize C-H bonds into C-B bonds. Ultimately, the catalysts will be modified to be used in the C-H borylation of non-aromatic substrates, providing valuable intermediates in organic synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The carbon-boron bond is versatile and can be used to access a number of functional groups that are common in biologically relevant compounds such as pharmaceuticals. This work will simplify access to a variety of derivatives and could be used to facilitate the discovery of new materials for diabetes testing. The bulk of the research performed will be carried out by undergraduate students, providing valuable experiences for students interested in pursuing careers in the area of catalysis or related fields. The proposed educational activity aims to introduce high school students to applications and careers in chemistry through providing an authentic research experience for high school teachers and subsequently engaging their students in various activities such as visiting USD Science building and field trip to local chemical R&amp;D facility.  The involvement of high school teachers in an authentic research experience will also allow them to incorporate research concepts into their curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two main objectives were set forth for the proposed project, develop amine-directed C-H borylation using iridium catalysis, and to develop a multi-faceted outreach plan that involved research experiences for high school teachers and subsequent outreach to their classes to provide information on careers in STEM.  Intellectual Merit:  At the outset of the project, directed C-H borylation (replacing and unreactive carbon-hydrogen bond with a reactive and versatile carbon-boron bond) was limited to &lt;15 reports and amine-directed C-H borylation was even more sparse. The goal of the project was to use readily available catalysts and ligands to afford amine-directed C-H borylation and to use the resulting boron-containing compounds to access material- and biologically-relevant types of molecules. After the first report on amine-directed C-H borylation, a follow-up study was completed and reported that found improved ligands for increased yield and selectivity. In addition, three different reactions using the carbon-boron bond were reported. The role of the adjacent amine was important in unveiling new reactivity that had not been shown before involving the carbon-boron bond. The new methods developed with amine-directed C-H borylation has also initiated new directions in phosphine- and amide-directed C-H borylation, includiing an international collaborative project.  Broader Impacts:  This grant funded research opportunities for ten undergraduates, two high school students, two high school teachers, and two post-doctoral research associates. The high school students and teachers were funded through the educational plan that provided research experiences to high school teachers (two summers, full-time for 6 weeks each summer) to provide them with additional insights into research that could be taken into the classroom. The research experiences were followed by three outreach events with those teachers' chemistry classes. The multi-faceted outreach plan was assessed and shown to improve student knowledge of the educational and career paths in STEM fields. The program concluded with a book chapter published with the PI and the two high school teachers, with the goal of sharing best practices for this type of outreach.
