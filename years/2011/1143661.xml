<AbstractNarration>Bess Koffman will travel to Cornell University and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University for the purpose of exploring possible postdoctoral research with two potential sponsoring scientists.  Dr. Natalie Mahowald (Cornell) is an atmospheric dust modeler and Dr. Steven Goldstein is an isotope geochemist.  The travel, which includes four days at each institution will help Ms. Koffman choose between the two different approaches to address research questions about dust transport, atmospheric circulation and climate in the southern hemisphere, as she works to establish her future research directions in paleoclimate science.</AbstractNarration>
