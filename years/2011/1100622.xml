<AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) Program award provides funding for developing a new method for continuous film coating of nano-sized drug particles to produce large amounts of individually coated particles having a desired layer of a biodegradable polymer coating. The coating method utilizes hollow fiber membrane devices employing either cooling crystallization and/or antisolvent crystallization. Both designs will enable controlled precipitation of a dissolved polymer from solution onto nanoparticles in suspension by heterogeneous polymer nucleation. A model system consisting of silica nanoparticles will be suspended in an organic solvent containing the dissolved polymer such as Eudragit or PLGA. Such a solution, with or without other additives such as surfactants to prevent agglomeration, will be subjected to polymer precipitation onto the nanoparticle surface to form an appropriate film coating. The hollow fiber devices should allow continuous processing of polymer coating of the model systems and will be tested with pharmaceutically relevant systems supplied by the industrial partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS).  The polymer coatings will be characterized by SEM, EDX and TEM-EELS electron microscopic techniques; mathematical models will be developed to predict the heterogeneous nucleation-driven coating processes.  The polymer coating enables the drug release in a sustained/controlled manner, improves drug bioavailability and patient compliance by reducing the drug administration frequency, allows nano-sized drugs particles to overcome a mucus barrier and target specific body organs, and prevents immune cells (macrophages) from engulfing and eliminating nano-sized drug particles in the bloodstream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will develop a continuous, scalable, nanoparticle coating system that can produce large quantities of polymer-coated nanoparticles while operating at temperatures and pressures far closer to ambient than those relying on supercritical fluids. Such a process should find widespread application in the pharmaceutical and other industries. Working in partnership with BMS, these processes will be scaled-up and commercialization possibilities will be explored.</AbstractNarration>

Drug delivery systems are of particular interest in controlled release of drugs. In many drug delivery applications, drug nanoparticles have to be coated with a polymer to protect fragile drugs such as proteins against, for example, stomach acids. In other applications, a dense polyethylene glycol coating improved penetration of polymeric nanoparticles within brain tissue in cases where the blood-brain barrier is compromised. Silica nanoparticles can often be used as a model or surrogate for drug nanoparticles. In fact, silica nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have also attracted considerable attention for a variety of reasons.     Intellectual Merit: Currently, no technique is available to continuously film coat ultrafine drug particles with a polymer to produce large amounts of free-flowing coated particles. Fluidized bed coaters work well for micron sized particles but cannot be used to coat submicron or nano-sized particles due to the strong interparticle forces between the ultrafine particles. Two novel crystallization methods, Solid Hollow Fiber Cooling Crystallization (SHFCC) and Porous Hollow Fiber Antisolvent Crystallization (PHFAC), have been developed to coat ultrafine particles in a continuous manner.

Controlled cooling of the polymer solution leads to polymer nucleation on the particle surface. The precipitated polymer forms a thin film around the particles; the film thickness can be varied by varying the operating conditions.  In the PHFAC method, a suspension of the silica particles in an acetone solution of the polymer is continuously pumped through the shell side of a hollow fiber membrane module. The anti-solvent (water) flowing in the porous hollow fiber lumen is forced through the membrane pores into the shell side liquid generating intense mixing with the flowing suspension leading to rapid precipitation of the polymer and film coating of the particles. The PHFAC method was used to continuously synthesize polymer-coated drug crystals of Griseofulvin (GF) coated by a thin layer of the polymer Eudragit RL100. An acetone solution of the drug GF containing the dissolved polymer was passed through the shell side; the anti-solvent water was passed through the lumen of the porous hollow fibers creating an extremely high level of supersaturation and immediate crystallization of the drug. The GF crystals were formed first and serve as nuclei for the precipitation of the polymer Eudragit which forms a thin coating around the GF crystals.  A variety of characterization techniques were used to determine the coatings around the ultrafine silica particles and drug crystals. The results indicate that a uniformly coated and free-flowing product can be achieved by both methods. Spectroscopic and dissolution tests performed to study the properties of the coated GF crystals showed that the polymer coating did not alter the intrinsic properties of the drug; further the polymer coated drug crystals can be used for controlled release.  Broader Impacts: The novel SHFCC and PHFAC crystallization methods described above provide two different ways to continuously coat ultrafine particles including drug particles with different polymers.
