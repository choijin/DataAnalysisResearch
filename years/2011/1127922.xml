<AbstractNarration>Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems &lt;br/&gt;Proposal  #1127924&lt;br/&gt;Proposal  #1127922&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems sites at the University of Cincinnati and the Missouri Institute of Science and Technology.  Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601.  The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prognosis of industrial systems and the management of their health based on system data typically requires significant analysis and design prior to implementation of an effective detection and management system.  The proposed work seeks to accelerate the process of collection and assessment of data in order to reduce the life cycle of Prognosis and Health Management (PHM) research.  The work plans to explore a framework with unified systematic methods to ensure the precision of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimations that are essential for effective health management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work promises to significantly improve methods to estimate the usable lifetime of industrial equipment, thus enabling efficient maintenance of operating production systems and reducing overall cost. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio by virtue of the framework to be established by the work.  The center will involve graduate students, teachers and undergraduates in the work emphasizing involvement of minority and female students.</AbstractNarration>
