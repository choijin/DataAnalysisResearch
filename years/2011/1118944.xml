<AbstractNarration>Marine plants and animals live in an environment where chemical signals are often more important than visual signals.  Waterborne chemicals provide marine organisms with critical information about the quality of their environment and the location of food, predators, and mates.  However, when the tide is out, intertidal plants and animals spend large amounts of time exposed to air, where waterborne chemical signals are unavailable but airborne chemical signals may be important.  Preliminary data has shown that when they are being consumed by grazers, some intertidal plants release dimethyl sulfide, an airborne chemical that can cause nearby plants to produce additional defenses against grazers.  This use of airborne signaling chemicals by marine plants is a new and potentially important mechanism of communication among marine intertidal organisms.  Because dimethyl sulfide can be detected by animals, it may serve as a signal to other grazers and to their predators about the presence of food or enemies.  Thus, the release of dimethyl sulfide has the potential to affect interactions throughout marine food webs.  This project will use biochemical methods to measure the release of dimethyl sulfide by marine plants under a variety of environmental conditions and its subsequent movement throughout the environment.  A variety of behavioral, physiological, and ecological assays will then be used to determine the effects of airborne dimethyl sulfide on defensive responses and growth rates of nearby plants as well as the responses and feeding rates of herbivores and predators.   The results of this study will provide fundamental information about how marine food webs function.  Because dimethyl sulfide is important in the global cycling of sulfur, this study will also contribute to knowledge of sulfur movement from the oceans to the atmosphere.  At least eight undergraduate students will help conduct this work; therefore, the project will contribute to the training of the next generation of marine scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intertidal habitats are transitional areas between the terrestrial and marine environments.  The seaweeds, plants, and animals that live in these habitats are fundamentally marine; however, when the tide is out, they are exposed to air and functionally are terrestrial organisms.  Intertidal communities are affected by a host of natural and human-caused environmental factors, such as changes in air and sea temperatures, nutrient pollution, light availability, salinity, and desiccation.  The organisms that inhabit these communities can include juvenile and adult stages of commercially important species as well as species that provide important economic and ecosystem services.  Therefore, it is important to understand how these communities function, how organisms within them interact with one another, and how changing environmental conditions affect these interactions.   The goal of this project was to explore how airborne chemical signals alter the chemistry of intertidal seaweeds and the foraging behavior of invertebrate herbivores to better understand the basic processes that govern the dynamics of these important transitional communities. Both plants and animals release signaling chemicals that cue a variety of responses in the organisms detecting them. For example, marine consumers can use waterborne chemicals released by potential prey to forage more efficiently.  Prey should be able to use chemicals released by potential predators or prey being consumed by predators as a signal to act in ways that reduce the risk of consumption.  For mobile animals, these actions might include running and hiding; but for more sessile organisms, such as sessile or slowly moving animals, plants, and algae (including seaweeds), they might include producing higher concentrations of defensive chemicals.  Because they are functionally terrestrial during low tide, we hypothesized that sessile or slowly moving intertidal organisms should be able to detect and respond to airborne signaling chemicals released by their neighbors as well as waterborne signaling chemicals.   Work on this project focused on the volatile sulfur molecule, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a chemical that gives many green seaweed blooms their distinctive sulfurous odor, and its precursor compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which, when broken down, helps protect seaweeds from grazers and chemical damage caused by environmental stresses. The release of DMS into the atmosphere is also thought to be involved in cloud formation and possibly localized climate regulation.  We found that green seaweeds on the shores of Washington State?s Salish Sea produce copious amounts of DMS, particularly when they are physically damaged by grazers or when physiologically stressed, such as by drying during low tides. In fact, the amounts of sulfur transferred from the oceans to the atmosphere by small "green tide" blooms, growths or accumulations of ulvoid green seaweeds on the shore, were generally higher per square meter than for other marine habitats.  On windy days, released DMS is rapidly dispersed; however, on calm days, DMS only travels about a meter. Some neighboring seaweeds exposed to DMS then increase concentrations of DMSP, which may help protect them from future grazing or environmental stresses.

The volatile compounds released by seaweeds also affect the dynamics of trophic interactions among intertidal organisms. Marine herbivores can detect volatile compounds released by green algae and use them to more efficiently locate preferred foods.  They also can detect the scent of damaged plants more readily than undamaged plants, suggesting that the increased occurrence of more extreme environmental conditions may alter the dynamics of interactions between algae and animals by altering the production of algal signaling compounds.           The  funding provided  by this project supported research training for thirteen undergraduate students and three graduate students.  Nine of the students were women, and seven were from groups that are underserved or underrepresented in the marine sciences.  Twelve of the students presented research results at regional or national scientific meetings, and nine were co-authors on papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
