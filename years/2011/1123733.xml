<AbstractNarration>The role of atmospheric CO2 as a greenhouse gas, and its impact on today?s global temperature, is well established.  Based on models and geochemical proxies, researchers propose that during Earth?s history, CO2 concentrations may have been orders of magnitude higher than today?s levels.  This coupled with measurements of d18O carbonate minerals formed in shallow marine settings representing 100?s of millions of years of Earth history, has been used as prime evidence for an exceedingly hot Earth with ocean temperatures in excess of 50 Â°C.  A fundamental assumption of these studies, however, is the constancy of the d18O composition of the seawater.  Rather than requiring an Earth with unrealistically high surface temperatures,an alternative hypothesis is that the composition of seawater has varied through the span of geologic time (billions to millions of years) and that the d18O record of carbonate reflects such changes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The purpose of this study is to test this hypothesis:  Is the d18O marine carbonate record primarily controlled by temperature, or alternatively, by first-order shifts in marine water composition.  The analytical approach will utilize a newly developed paleothermometer which is based on the abundance of uniquely bounded isotopes of 13C and 18O (clumped isotopes) that are present in carbonate minerals precipitated from water.  Unlike the conventional d18O paleothermometer, the clumped isotope measurement of temperature is independent of the water composition, and thus, allows simultaneous calculation of both water temperature and composition.  A unique approach of this study is the use of crystalline carbonate that forms beneath the freshwater table, and as such, records the mean annual air temperature of a region.  These carbonates are chemically and mineralogically stable and should preserve a consistent and reliable record which can be used to reconstruct past temperatures over the broad spectrum of geologic time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If the findings of our research indicate that exceeding high CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are not directly coupled to Earth surface temperature, this will have a significant impact by modifying the reference frame of how we predict changes in Earth?s future temperature based on computer simulations.  Other researchers have suggested such a decoupling of CO2 and temperature in deep geologic time and this study provides an empirical test of this hypothesis.  Resetting of this reference frame for climate modelers would directly affect their estimates of the magnitude of future climate change in response to the rising concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases caused by the continuing use of fossil fuel energy sources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reconstructing the history of past climate change remains a challenging endeavor, yet with the advent of new methodologies, it is becoming possible to provide accurate estimates of Earth?s surface temperature with increasing accuracy.  The refinement of the carbonate mass-47 clumped isotope thermometer is provides a proxy of such temperatures with a minimum of assumptions.  However, this approach is still relatively new and because of its infancy requires rigorous refinement and testing to ensure the accuracy of its calibration and the limitations on what materials can be reliably utilized.

The effects of reaction temperature and analytical procedures were investigated; the controls of primary mineralogy of the carbonate phase on mass-47 enrichment were evaluated; and the reliability of the temperature record after materials were naturally-heated during burial was tested. Based on our research, we suggest the mineralogic effects have minimal effect on the mass-47 enrichments, and that laboratory procedures can be corrected for, and as a result, a uniform temperature calibration has been constructed that can apply to all carbonate phases (Defliese et al., 2015).  Critically, however, for materials that have undergone heating at or above 100&ordm;C during burial, primary temperature record is generally compromised (Winkelstern and Lohmann, 2016).  This has precluded application to many of the deep-time sequences where high surface temperatures have been postulated.  Given these analytical refinements and restrictions, our research was applied to shallowly buried carbonate shell materials representing the late Cretaceous time, the period just prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs. A temperature record was reconstructed for Antarctica which demonstrates episodes of warming, with associated extinctions, that were coincident the volcanic eruptions of the Deccan Traps (Petersen et al., 2015).  Eruption of these large igneous provinces likely led to increases in atmospheric CO2 which resulted in global scale climate warming prior to the massive end-Cretaceous extinction with was ultimately caused by a bolide impact.  In addition, temperature records have been reconstructed for this period for central North America when a massive interior seaway existed from the Gulf of Mexico region to the Arctic (Petersen et al., 2016).  Our study provides estimates of the temperature gradient, and marine water composition and salinities for this region during an interval of ice-free conditions.  In testing the applicability of our approach using carbonate shells, large marine snails were examined from sequences deposited 125,000 year ago on the island of Bermuda, the last time of when global temperatures were greater than today?s and sea levels were significantly higher (Winkelstern et al., 2017).  As Bermuda is anomalous warm today, given its higher latitude, because of heat transport by the Gulf Stream, it provides a potential record of the response of ocean circulation to global temperature rise.  We observed that despite a global rise in temperature at this time, Bermuda temperatures decreased 7 to 10&ordm;C.  In effect, during global warming, Bermuda experience periods of cooling.  Based on our mass-47 clumped isotope analysis of the snail carbonate, we were able to demonstrate that this coincided with a significant decrease in ocean water saltiness or salinity. We interpret the combined decrease in salinity and temperature to reflect a disruption of the Gulf Stream circulation in response to a meltwater pulse derived from the melt-back of the Greenland ice sheet.  Importantly, such disruption of the Gulf Stream thermal transport may have led to cooling of the region of Northern Europe, a phenomenon that may occur in future years as Greenland warming continues.   It has been demonstrated that application of carbonate mass-47 clumped isotope analysis to studies of ancient deep-time sequences can potentially provide critical data on changes in Earth?s surface temperature during past times of global climate change.  While there remain caveats on which materials retain faithful records of paleo-temperature, and what natural processes might alter these primary signals, select samples are available in the geological archive that provide us with an accurate vision of Earth?s history.
