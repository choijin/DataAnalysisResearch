<AbstractNarration>Throughout their history, both humans and nonhuman animals experienced dark nights. This started to change ~120 years ago with the development of electrical lighting which illuminates our nights and most recently has led to urban and suburban light pollution. Normal physiology and behavior display a circadian organization that depends on clear light and dark signals, but the presence of light at night potentially disrupts temporal organization. Because of the convenience of electric lights, little thought has been given to their biological effects. This project will examine the effects of dim light at night on immune function in hamsters. By using established physiological, molecular, and genetic tests of immune function, the effects of night-time light on the immune system will be established. The project will train high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees of both sexes from diverse cultural and historically-underrepresented backgrounds during the conduct of this project. All experimental results will be made easily accessible to the general public through publications, websites, popular press, and presentations at professional societies, community forums, colleges, and universities. An interactive website where scientists and lay people can upload light-at-night illumination levels to get a finer-grain appreciation of light pollution than typically provided by satellite maps will be established and maintained. The results will provide insight into how vertebrates may respond to global change in the near future, how emergent diseases may arise as immune regulation changes, as well as provide unique insights as to how environmental control mechanisms evolved and how they are potentially disrupted by unintended light pollution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Life on earth has evolved during the past 3-4 billion years under dark skies and bright days.  The primary goal of this project was to assess the effects of unnatural light at night on immune function, a proxy for survival, from two perspectives.  First, many small animals use day length to determine the time of year; this information is used to time critical adaptations such as body mass, hibernation, reproduction, and immune function in time for winter.  We examined how light at night might interfere with the ability to discriminate between long and short days.  Second, we examined the enduring effects of disruption of circadian rhythms by exposure to light at night on immune function among young and developing individuals.  These studies broadly address the health and survival issues for all animals exposed to light at night, including humans.  As a result of the experiments conducted in this project, we have determined that light at night has a profound effect on both peripheral immune responses, as well as on neuroinflammation.  We established that exposure to dim light at night disrupts short-day responses in rodents.  Indeed, dim light at night interferes with the development of the short-day phenotype and impairs cell-mediated immunity.  We also established that even brief exposure to dim light at night increases body mass, alters metabolism, and shifts core body temperature circadian rhythms.  Furthermore, exposure to dim light at night exaggerates inflammatory responses to an agent that stimulates immune function, namely lipopolysaccharide.  These findings suggest that light at night disrupts the normal circadian organization of immune function, which might compromise some aspects of immune function, but exaggerate other aspects and thus put individuals at risk for autoimmune responses.  Importantly, we established that these effects occurred in the absence of disordered sleep by using nocturnal animals that typically sleep during the daylight hours.  We also investigated the effects of light at night in developing animals.  Exposure to dim light at night during development, especially prior to puberty, impaired adult immune function.  Remarkably, if parents were exposed to dim light at night, but then offspring were only exposed to dark nights throughout their lives from conception, then these individuals displayed impaired immune function as adults. Thus, we established that the physiological effects of dim light at night and disrupted circadian rhythms are transmitted across generations.   This project also has additional broad impacts via the educational value it has had on students participants.  Work supported by this project led directly to three doctoral dissertations, all authored by underrepresented individuals in science, and also supported a fourth student's dissertation work, as well as provided life-altering research experiences for many undergraduates (mostly underrepresented individuals), technical personnel, and three high school students working in the lab.  We established a website (light-at-night.org) which received favorable comments from the public. This project also enhanced the research infrastructure at Ohio State, leading to support for additional research equipment and maintenance that has, indirectly, supported a broad variety of research projects and initiatives.
