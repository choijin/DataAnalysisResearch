<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to develop a Vent-Time Series Submersible Incubation Device (Vent-TSSID), a robotic micro-laboratory for routine application by the oceanographic community for measuring rates of relevant metabolic processes at hydrothermal vents at both in situ pressures and temperatures. Knowledge of the in situ metabolism of microorganisms carrying out CO2-fixation at deep-sea hydrothermal vents is very limited. Particularly lacking are studies measuring rates of autotrophic carbon fixation in situ, which is a measurement ultimately needed to constrain production in these ecosystems. Although recent data suggests that nitrate reduction either to N2 (denitrification) or to NH4 + (dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium, DNRA) might be responsible for a significant fraction of chemoautotrophic production, NO3 --reduction rates have never been measured in situ at hydrothermal vents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vent-TSSID developed from this proposed work will be made available to the research community for use at other deep sea vents. This grant would fund 2 graduate students, one at WHOI and the other at Brown University. The PIs also have involved undergraduates in their research programs and plan to continue to do so. Dr. Sievert currently participates in the WHOI Science and Technology Education Partnership, and Dr. Rich has been an active participant in the Brown Environmental Fellows program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Deep-sea hydrothermal vents, first discovered in 1977, are exemplary ecosystems where microbial chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis is the primary source of organic carbon. Chemosynthetic microorganisms use the energy generated by oxidizing reduced inorganic chemicals contained in the vent fluids, like hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen gas, to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into cell material. By doing so, they effectively transfer the energy from a geothermal source to higher trophic levels, in the process supporting the unique and fascinating ecosystems that are characterized by high productivity - oases in an otherwise barren landscape. While this general view of the functioning of these ecosystems is well established, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the microbiology and biogeochemistry of these systems. Particularly lacking are studies measuring rates of autotrophic carbon fixation in situ, which is a measurement ultimately needed to constrain production of these ecosystems. However, measuring rates of carbon fixation in situ at deep-sea hydrothermal vents represents a formidable task for a variety of reasons, ranging from the design of an instrument functioning at high pressure and in the presence of reducing chemicals, to the question under which condition(s) carbon production should be measured. There is a large range of environmental conditions that must be considered, in particular with regard to temperature.     To overcome these issues and to execute these studies in situ we have developed and successfully tested a Vent-Submersible Incubation Device (Vent-SID), a robotic micro-laboratory for routine application by the oceanographic community for measuring time series rates of relevant metabolic processes at hydrothermal vents under in situ pressures and temperatures. The Vent-SID was designed and fabricated by incorporating the functional capabilities of sea-tested instrumentation to enable time series incubation studies, microbial sampling and preservation, and collection of particulate samples and filtrates, while adding the new capability of controlling the temperature of the incubation chambers.  Developments unique to the Vent-SID included: 1) Twin temperature-controlled incubation chambers to conduct two simultaneous multiple isotope tracer incubations mimicking the physical conditions within warm water hydrothermal vent fluids being sampled at the sea floor and which likely exist deeper within the vent system. 2) Development of a modified incubation chamber piston that allows quasi-steady state introduction of dissolved oxygen gas and/or, if desired, dissolved hydrogen gas into the incubating sample to maintain low levels of these components to compensate for microbial consumption. 3) Development of a new electronics hardware for powering &amp; regulating incubation chamber heating and measurements of oxygen concentration within the incubation chambers via oxygen optodes. 4) Development of "Command Line" software code for executing the electromechanical functioning required for incubation chamber heating and conducting repeated (time series), time-course incubations. 5) Development of a thermally insulated umbilicus for transport of vent fluid samples to the Vent-SID with minimal change in temperature. To facilitate shipping of the instrument, the Vent-SID is assembled in two bolt-together sections, the Vent-SID Section and a lower elevator section to which four deep-sea batteries (for powering incubation chamber heating) are mounted and serves as a stable instrument platform on the sea bottom. For relevant molecular studies on community structure and metabolic function the Vent-SID also has incorporated newly developed fixation filter units, that allow in situ preservation of samples on a time scale relevant to gene expression studies of collected particulate samples.  The Vent-SID was successful deployed during the Nov. 2014 R/V Atlantis / HOV Alvin cruise to the 9&deg;N hydrothermal vent...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
