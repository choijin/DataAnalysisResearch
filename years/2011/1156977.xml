<AbstractNarration>This funding renews a successful CISE Research Experiences for&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Texas at Dallas.&lt;br/&gt;This site focuses on Software Engineering research related to&lt;br/&gt;Software Safety.  Students will evaluate the strengths and&lt;br/&gt;weakness of existing methodologies and current practices for&lt;br/&gt;safety assurance, as well as investigating issues such as how&lt;br/&gt;the introduction of software safety requirements may affect&lt;br/&gt;the software lifecycle and how software processes, methods&lt;br/&gt;and tool support should be adjusted.  In addition to research,&lt;br/&gt;students will take field trips to industrial partners and attend&lt;br/&gt;mentoring workshops on technical writing and oral presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will allow students, especially those from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups or universities with limited research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities, to experience cutting-edge research in software&lt;br/&gt;safety --- critical to the prevention of catastrophic accidents&lt;br/&gt;and safe operation of software-dependent systems. It will also&lt;br/&gt;encourage these students to continue into graduate programs and&lt;br/&gt;careers in science and technology research. Students will gain&lt;br/&gt;proficiency in a broadly applicable skill set including oral&lt;br/&gt;and written communication, research methods, critical thinking,&lt;br/&gt;and problem solving.</AbstractNarration>
