<AbstractNarration>Populations of the Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) inhabiting urban estuaries have rapidly and repeatedly evolved tolerance to extreme pollution stress, yet the genetic changes that enabled this adaptive tolerance are unknown.  This grant will facilitate sequencing the full killifish genome, and re-sequencing of genomes from many sensitive and tolerant populations, to enable discovery of the genetic changes that facilitated tolerance to human pollutants, and address whether there are a few or many genetic variants that confer tolerance or sensitivity to pollution among the many different populations inhabiting polluted sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major ambition of both evolutionary biology and medical genetics is to identify the genetic variants within and among populations that contribute to an individual's tolerance to stress or disease.  For example, human individuals vary in their sensitivity to disease and environmental pollutants, and a portion of this variation has a genetic basis.  Studies of the genomic changes in killifish exposed to pollutants provide an excellent opportunity to discover the genetic basis of individual sensitivity to common environmental pollutants in a vertebrate animal that shares many traits with humans.  This research could identify genetic variants that contribute to human sensitivity to environmental pollutant exposures and also offer detailed insight into fundamental mechanisms of the evolutionary process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Populations of the Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) that live in urban estuaries have rapidly and repeatedly evolved dramatic tolerance to extreme pollution stress.  This is a rare and extraordinary example of evolved adaptation to human-altered environments.  The genetic changes that enabled this adaptive tolerance are unknown.  The goal of this project was to sequence the full killifish genome and sequence genomes of many individuals from several sensitive and tolerant populations, to enable discovery of the genetic changes that facilitated this extreme tolerance and address whether the genetic variants that confer tolerance or sensitivity to pollution in one population are the same as in other populations.  We produced a reference genome sequence plus 48 additional whole genome sequences from one population of killifish, thereby contributing a new model system for evolutionary genetics research.  The Atlantic killifish is a superb study system because its populations are very large, so that natural selection can be very efficient, and they are locally adapted to a wide variety of environments.  By comparing genetic variation within and between populations, we discovered genes that may be important for the killifishÃ†s remarkable physiological flexibility that underlies their ability to thrive in dynamic and often stressful estuarine environments.  We found a surprisingly high level of genetic diversity among individuals &ndash; higher than for almost any other vertebrate species.  We found that high-diversity and low-diversity genes differ in their functions, and also differ in the number of functional connections they have with other genes.  These findings offer insight into how protein functions and gene networks are related to the evolutionary forces that constrain or enable their evolution and ability to adapt to changing environments.
