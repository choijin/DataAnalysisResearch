<AbstractNarration>This proposal provides undergraduate student training and support in Documentary or Field Linguistics for the academic year and summer of 2010-2011. The planned workshops and training sessions will expose students to a rapidly growing subfield of linguistics, and provide a means for us to train students in basic field techniques which are not currently covered in the curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two workshops will be held during the spring term, in early January and mid-March after spring break. Workshops will be open to undergraduates at University of Rochester and advertized through electronic means to other institutions in the Western NY area. The workshops are in response to an increasing demand and strong interest in the subfield of Field Linguistics.</AbstractNarration>
