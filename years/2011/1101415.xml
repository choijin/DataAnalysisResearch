<AbstractNarration>Two of the most important equations in several complex variables  are the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the induced  tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations. The understanding of these equations have been the focal point of research in complex analysis in the past few decades. The problems addressed in this project include &lt;br/&gt;the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the tangential Cauchy-Riemann complex on complex manifolds, especially on   complex projective spaces (which is compact and with positive curvature)  and negatively curved manifolds.  Understanding the  geometric aspects of these equations under the  curvature  conditions  and their relations with  function theory in complex manifolds   are some of the most  challenging and important  problems  in complex analysis and geometry. The study of several complex variables in a geometric or non-smooth  setting has provided interesting new questions   with fresh insight to problems in   topology,   foliation theory, complex dynamics,  algebraic   and complex geometry. Complex geometric   theory  has only just begun to develop and   Shaw will continue her efforts in this direction. She will also continue her research on applying  the geometric measure theory and harmonic analysis to several complex variables for non-smooth domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the pioneering work of Poincare and Hartogs more than a century ago,  the field of  several complex variables has played a major role in modern mathematics. The use of  partial differential equations has been  the main tool  for studying  several complex variables, as well as complex geometry  in the past few decades. The broader impacts  from the proposed activity  are that  these problems are at the intersection of analysis,  geometry and topology  with applications  in applied mathematics and physics.  Other than the mathematical areas described in the proposal,  recent progress in the Dirichlet and Neumann problem on nonsmooth  domains has found applications in other disciplines like physics and engineering. The Hodge theorem is an extension of the classical  Dirichlet Principle, the canonical solution to the energy minimizing problem arising  from the heat transfer problem. Recent applications of the theorem on domains with corners and wedges have been used  in electrokinetics  and other fields in engineering and physics. The PI will use all of these ideas in her work mentoring students and the writing of a text that makes some of these partial differential equations topics more accessible to a wider range of mathematicians, especially those working in geometry and complex analysis.</AbstractNarration>
