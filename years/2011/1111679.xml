<AbstractNarration>The primary objective is to further the development of a vertical vision for research on the role of non-volatile memory technologies in data-intensive computing systems. It is essential that researchers at each level of the system stack be aware of the needs, challenges, and opportunities associated with the other levels. The workshop will give researchers in relevant fields the opportunity to gain a broader understanding of what is needed to move NVM-based storage technology forward, to learn from each other, and to establish relationships and collaborations that will provide the basis for further scientific and engineering advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This workshop will address fundamental problems in the science, engineering, and application of high-performance data storage systems based upon non-volatile memories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The exchange of knowledge and the generation of novel ideas that result from the workshop will have significant impact on the computing and data storage industries, both vitally important to the national economy. The educational component of the workshop will benefit student researchers, as well as more senior participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 2011 Non-Volatile Memories Workshop  (NVMW 2011)  On March 6-8, 2011, researchers from the University of California, San Diego hosted the 2nd Annual Non-volatile Memories Workshop (NVMW 2011) on the UCSD campus in La Jolla, California. Like its predecessor (NVMW 2010), the second workshop covered a range of topics related to non-volatile memories, including basic memory device technologies; data encoding for reliability, persistence, and security; computer system architectures; and applications to communications, green computing, personalized medicine, and enterprise storage.  Emphasis was placed upon the following organizational objectives:  (1) active encouragement and support of workshop participation by students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty members;  (2) establishment of a diverse Technical Program Committee to evaluate submitted presentation abstracts, ensuring a technical program that was broad in scope and exceptional in quality;  (3) an invited tutorial session on a technical topic, presented in a manner that was accessible to all workshop participants, and invited keynote addresses on both days of the technical presentation sessions.   The NVMW 2011 program began with a comprehensive tutorial entitled "Phase Change Memory &ndash; Fundamentals, Opportunities and Challenges," presented by Dr. Moinuddin Qureshi and Dr. Bipin Rajendran of IBM Watson Research Center and Prof. Sudhanva Gurumurthi of the University of Virginia. The technical program, assembled by a 20-member Program Committee, featured two sessions each on diverse topics in Devices, Error-Control Coding, Architectures, and Applications, with 32 presentations overall. An additional 21 submissions were represented in the poster session.  The keynote addresses that opened each day of technical sessions were another highlight of the meeting. Prof. Jehoshua (Shuki) Bruck of Caltech spoke on "Rank Modulation for Flash Memories" and Dr. C. Mohan of IBM Almaden Research Center examined "Implications of Storage Class Memories on Software Architectures."  The workshop attracted 227 registered participants, almost 75% more than attended the 2010 workshop. There were representatives from 34 universities, 30 industrial R&amp;D labs, and 5 national research organizations. More than 60 graduate students and post-doctoral researchers participated, and 43 of them requested and received travel grants, thanks to the support provided by this NSF Grant (CCF-1111679).
