The annual meetings of the Engineering Research Centers (ERC), Industry / University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC), and Emerging Frontiers of Research Innovation (EFRI) programs brought together the program grantees to share their research activities, seek out potential collaborations, and exchange ideas and best practices for managing and sustaining research endeavors.  In the Spring of 2012, ABA determined that it was time to "pass the torch" to another consulting firm or internal team, so that Ann Becker could focus more time on designing and hosting experiential learning trips to Central America. Also about this time, NSF was directed to reassess its meetings and events to make sure they were productive, efficient, and a responsible use of federal funds. Within this context of transition, ABA has provided hourly consulting at NSFÆs request to help the ERC, I/UCRC, and EFRI programs transition to a new meeting and event structure.   ABA has provided tools and guidance to the ERC program and its new subcontractors to ensure a smooth transition for the annual meeting attendees. For the I/UCRC program, meeting planning was transferred internally; ABA ensured the continuation of program planning efforts involving two other subcontractors to NSF.
