<AbstractNarration>Oaks (the flowering plant genus Quercus) include some of America's most ecologically and economically important trees. The approximately 255 oaks of the New World oak lineage dominate North American and Mexican woody plant biomass, biodiversity, ecology, and nutrient cycling. Despite the significant ecosystem services provided by oaks, the biodiversity of this genus is poorly understood. In this project, collaborators from The Morton Arboretum (IL), the University of Notre Dame (IN), Duke University (NC), University of Minnesota, and Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México will undertake a comprehensive systematic study of the oaks of the New World. The project will integrate next-generation genomic (DNA) sequencing, plant physiology, and direct study of plants in the field and museum collections to gain insights into the oak tree of life and the basic question of how oak traits, distributions, and diversity evolve in response to changes in habitat and climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding of how oaks respond to shifts in climate and habitat is essential to conserving forest biodiversity and healthy forest ecosystems for future generations. The project will broadly disseminate findings and increase biodiversity awareness and understanding across diverse audiences in several ways: strengthening of an international oak collaboration among U.S., Mexican, and European researchers; training of undergraduate through postdoctoral biodiversity researchers; training K-12 teachers and their students in biodiversity science; and public outreach through museums, botanical gardens, and online venues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Virentes are small group of evergreen oaks are distributed across the temperate and tropical dry regions in North America, Central America and Cuba.  As the climate changes, temperate oaks will face the challenge of adapting to warmer and , in some locations, drier climates.  The Virentes have already accomplished this.  Understanding the interaction of ecosystem drivers and genetic background in the Virentes will shed light on the potential of the more temperate oaks to adapt to the changing conditions anticipated in the future.  We have contributed to this goal by genotyping 338 individual trees distributed within the native ranges of seven Virentes species.  We have used 20 EST-SSR markers with known positions in the oak genome. The markers are informative in all seven species (Quercus brandegeei, Quercus geminata, Quercus fusiformis, Quercus minima, Quercus oleoides, Quercus sagraeana, Quercus virginiana).  We have also sequenced portions of four genes known to be important in inducing dormancy, breaking dormancy and freezing tolerance, for many of these same trees: Dormancy Associated MADS Box 2, Ethylene Response 1, Highly expressed under osmotic stress 1 and Inducer of CBF1.  We added two putative housekeeping genes as comparators: Chromatin Remodeling Protein 11 and Glyceraldehyde Phosphate Dehydrogenase subunit B.  We are now in the process of analyzing our results.       Last Modified: 05/04/2016       Submitted by: Jeanne Romero-Severson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
