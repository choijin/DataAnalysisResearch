<AbstractNarration>Carbon monoxide (CO) is considered a highly poisonous gas often associated with tragic loss of life.  Nonetheless, CO occurs naturally at relatively low concentrations in the atmosphere and in geothermal environments.  Remarkably, certain bacteria, the CO oxidizers, thrive on CO using it as an important source of energy for their metabolism.  Some CO-oxidizing bacteria can be found in soils, where their metabolism helps regulate CO concentrations in the atmosphere.  Other CO-oxidizing bacteria occur in geothermal systems, such as hot springs and volcanic environments.  These bacteria survive under harsh conditions, including high temperatures and low (acidic) pH.  Little is known about these extremophiles, but they likely include many novel species, some of which might represent relatively ancient life forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research conducted in the unique geothermal environments of Kilauea volcano (Hawai'i) and hot springs in Yellowstone and Lassen Volcano National Parks will establish the biodiversity of thermophilic oxygen-dependent CO oxidizers, discover new thermophilic CO-oxidizing species, and establish the factors that determine the geographic distribution of these organisms.  Results of this study will create a new understanding of the evolutionary history of all oxygen-dependent CO-oxidizing bacteria and provide new insights that will aid research on CO oxidizers in soils and in the oceans.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major activities supported by this award included isolating and characterizing novel thermophilic microbes that use carbon monoxide (CO) as an energy source.  Isolates were obtained from a unique microbial mat growing in the Puhimau thermal area (Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii) and from the geothermally heated soils adjacent to the mats. CO uptake  activity as a function of temperature was also assessed for mats and soils at the Puhimau thermal area, and for a hot spring mat in the Alvord Basin. In addition, microbial mats were characterized using "next generation"16S rRNA gene based sequencing. A transect across a geothermal field was used to assess biogeographical patterns in mat microbial communities. In addition, a cloning and sequencing effort was used to characterize the diversity and phylogeny of genes for CO dehydrogenase. Finally, A pilot study of novel CO oxidizers in brines was also initiated.     Our molecular-based assays of Puhimau microbial mats revealed a surprisingly rich  diversity in a unique, geothermally-heated acidic system (pH 4) dominated by  Acidobacteria. Although the Acidobacteria did not harbor CO oxidizers, a second  dominant phylum did: Chlorflexi (class Ktedonobacteria). Both cloning and sequencing  analyses of large subunit CO dehydrogenase genes (coxL) as well as results from a  metagenomic analysis revealed that the CO oxidizers were dominated by members of  Ktedonobacteria, with some representation by members of the Proteobacteria and  Actinobacteria. Thus far, these mats are the only CO-oxidizing system known to be  dominated by members of the Ktedonobacteria.     Efforts to enrich and isolate novel thermophilic CO oxidizers resulted in discoveries  of Thermogemmatispora carboxidovorans and Thermomicrobium carboxidovorans. We  also isolated and characterized six novel CO oxidizers in the genera Burkholderia and Paraburkholderia, an extremely halophilic CO oxidizer (Haloferax namakaokahaiae) and a member of a novel genus within the Chlorflexi, Thermorudis peleae.     Analyses of temperature responses of CO oxidizers in intact mat communities revealed optima in a thermophilic range (&gt; 50 oC), which was consistent with the temperatures observed in situ and with the characteristics of the major mat populations. We also conducted an analysis of the impacts of oscillating temperatures which the mats experience (from ambient to elevated). Our results showed that thermophiles could tolerate relatively low temperatures an maintain activity, while mesophilc CO oxidizers had essentially no tolerance or survival capacity at elevated temperatures. The similarity of mat communities across a transect along with the observed temperature responses suggested mat temperature regimes are likely the most important feature shaping CO oxidizer biogeography in the Puhimau system.     The award for this study supported and provided training for two PhD students, a research associate and 6 undergraduate students, one of whom completed an Honors thesis based on project research.  Research results have also been communicated to the public through a TEDx talk, several popular scientific articles and blogs.
