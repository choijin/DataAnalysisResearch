<AbstractNarration>This project supports the maintenance and development of the Cooperative Computing Tools. This software package is designed to enable non-privileged users to&lt;br/&gt;harness hundreds to thousands of cores from multiple clusters, clouds, and grids simultaneously. The main components of the software package include Parrot, a virtual file system that interfaces with multiple distributed storage systems, and Makeflow, a workflow engine that interfaces with multiple computing systems. This project will develop, maintain, and support the software across a wide variety of operating systems and national scale cyberinfrastructure in support of high impact scientific applications in fields such as bioinformatics, biometrics, data mining, high energy physics, and molecular dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large scale computing systems such as cluster, clouds, and grids now make it easy for end users to purchase large amounts of computing power at the touch of a button.  However, these computing systems are difficult to harness because they each present a different user interface, principle of operation, and programming model.  This project addresses this problem by supporting the development of the Cooperative Computing Tools, a software package that makes it possible for ordinary computer applications to move seamlessly between different service providers. The software is primarily of interest to researchers in scientific domains that require large amounts of computation.  It is currently used by researchers in the fields of bioinformatics, biometrics, data mining, high energy physics, and molecular dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the development of the Cooperative Computing Tools, a software toolkit used for building applications that can harness thousands of computers simultaneously to work on problems of very large scale.  This capability is important for research in fields such as high energy physics, bioinformatics, and molecular dynamics, where research is limited by the scale of computing power.  While large clusters of machines are readily accessible to researchers in these fields, they are often very difficult to use.  This toolkit simplifies the process of scaling up an application from a single laptop up to thousands of machines in an orderly manner, making it much easier to write applications to run on very large clusters.  Intellectual Merit -  This project took software which was prototyped in an earlier research project and developed it to work reliably across many different operating systems, computing environments, and applications at very large scale.  The Makeflow workflow system was scaled up to support more than 1 millions tasks; the Work Queue execution system supported more than 25 thousand cores in a single application; the Parrot virtual filesystem was used on computing sites around the world to enable global software access.  Broader Impact - The software created in this project was made available in an open source format and continues to be used by communities in high energy physics, molecular dynamics, and bioinformatics, making use of commercial clouds, campus clusters, and NSF computing infrastructure such as Blue Waters, Jetstream, and XSEDE.  The work was largely accomplished by graduate and undergraduate students who received valuable practical training in software engineering and distributed system design, which contributed to the development of the post-graduate workforce.
