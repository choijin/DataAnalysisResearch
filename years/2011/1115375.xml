<AbstractNarration>Location is a type of information that can be used by various applications to provides new opportunities for business and commercial success, and at the same time may be misused. This proposed research aims at developing a multi-model architecture with privacy-enhancing techniques for countering location spoofing attacks while respecting location privacy of mobile users. The multi-model architecture promotes the parallel use of alternative positioning models and multi-beacon methods to make it harder to launch consistent location spoofing attacks. A pseudo-identity obfuscation technique is incorporated into the multi-model defense architecture based on mobility-aware mix-zones to address the legal, social, and ethical implications of continuous location verifications. In this technique, mobile users may customize the settings of mix-zones in order to meet their personalized privacy preference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research includes a transformative approach that advocates privacy-aware and customizable defense architecture and algorithms to detect and filter out compromised mobile nodes. This detection and filtering is based on the amount of inconsistency between the client-claimed location and the system-determined location as well as the amount of inconsistency among multiple beacons. The broader impacts of this research are two-fold. First, the development of a systematic and privacy enhancing approach for countering location spoofing threats will help enabling a wide range of subscription-driven location based services, such as location-based advertisements, location-based content dissemination and billing, and location-based entertainment. Second, the technical results and the proof-of-concept prototype will be disseminated to a broader audience through educational activities and involvement of women and minority in the proposed research.  The unique combination of location spoofing countermeasures with a location privacy awareness is a direct contribution to the multi-disciplinary efforts aimed at meeting the security and location privacy challenges with technical, legal, social, and ethical considerations, and increases the societal confidence in the cyber infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project addressed fundamental questions at the intersection of location privacy and location security in mobile computing and the emerging field of Internet of Things (IoT). The main outcome in this year includes two original developments: (1) The StarCloak system is a utility-aware and attack resilient approach to privacy preserving location queries for mobile travelers on road networks. It addresses the two known problems associated with the existing solutions: (1) the loss of location utility, such as the increased query cost associated with using spatial cloaked location, and (2) the vulnerability against background knowledge based spoofing and replay attacks, preventing wide deployment of privacy preserving location query systems. StarCloak can effectively integrate spatial and temporal location utility constraint, anonymous query processing cost, and complex location inference attacks with high query cost-efficiency and strong attack resilience for scaling anonymous location queries. StarCloak is novel in three aspects: (a) StarCloak incorporates spatial and temporal location utility constraints as an integral part of its location anonymization model, ensuring the query utility of anonymized locations. (b) The privacy-preserving location query algorithms in StarCloak strives to minimize the additional end-to-end latency introduced due to anonymous query processing. (c) StarCloak embeds robust defense capability in its location anonymization to protect spatially cloaked locations against sophisticated attacks based on background knowledge, such as correlation based replay attacks and query injection based attacks. (2) The development of differential location privacy optimizations to address the inherent problems in existing main stream location obfuscation mechanisms. Concretely, geo-indistinguishability and expected inference error are two popular privacy notions that define location privacy from different perspectives, each notion has its individual strength in the context of protecting location privacy. This work proposes a location obfuscation mechanism that dynamically combines both privacy notions by utilizing the implicit relationships between two notions. This mechanism performs location obfuscation dynamically and adaptively, taking into account both adversary?s current prior knowledge and mobile users? specific privacy requirements at different locations and times. Evaluation using real-world datasets demonstrates that this mechanism can efficiently guarantee location privacy in terms of two privacy notions simultaneously. We are working on public release of these two systems and technical papers produced under both developments are under submission.
