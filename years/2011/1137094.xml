<AbstractNarration>This award from the Chemical Synthesis Program will support a "Workshop on Synthetic Chemistry."  This workshop has the dual purpose of providing an effective forum for informal discussion among young academic and industrial scientists on current research in topical areas of Chemical Synthesis, and assisting the Program staff in identifying emerging areas and researchers.  This process, in turn, will aid the Program in long-range planning.  The specific goals of the workshop include:  1) Providing an environment for the dynamic exchange of ideas in organic synthesis, organometallic chemistry, inorganic synthesis, natural products, bio-organic and bio-inorganic chemistry with a synthetic emphasis; 2) Encouraging an attitude of cooperation among individuals working in related areas, and thereby avoiding duplicative efforts; 3) Stimulating participants to study new problems and methods in synthetic chemistry; 4) Improving awareness of potentially valuable applications of new methods and strategies in synthesis; 5) Increasing diversity at high-level meetings; 6) Creating an atmosphere in which the scientific and social interaction among participants will be both stimulating and pleasant; 7) Creating a constructive environment that fosters mentoring relationships among participants.</AbstractNarration>
