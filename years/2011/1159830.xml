<AbstractNarration>CBET-1159830&lt;br/&gt;Karabacak, Tansel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology stands unprecedented as one of the most promising alternative energy systems for an environmentally friendly, sustainable energy economy. PEM fuel cells can operate with various types of energy carriers including hydrogen, ethanol, and methanol. However, conventional PEM fuel cell electrodes, which are comprised of carbon supported platinum catalyst nanoparticles, suffer from several key limitations that include sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and high Pt loadings at the cathode, agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles, oxidation of carbon support, separation of carbon over time from the membrane, and poor catalyst-carbon support stability. To overcome these limitations of the traditional cathode catalyst, Prof. Tansel Karabacak of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock proposes to employ a new nanostructured PEM fuel cell electrode design comprised of single layer carbon-free catalyst nanorod arrays with extremely low Pt loadings, controlled porosity, ideal alloy compositions, and with preferred crystal orientations for enhanced ORR electrochemical activity. Karabacak will use a combination of recently developed small angle deposition (SAD) and glancing angle deposition (GLAD) techniques for the fabrication of the nanorod PEM fuel cell electrodes.The proposal offers a method of material production that is based on very specific catalyst preparation methodology. It combines synthesis and fuel cell performance measurements in a useful manner.The electro-catalysis experimentation will be done in conjunction with an expert at Argonne National Labs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The area of fuel cell electro-catalysis is one of considerable importance in the overall national energy endeavor. The proposed work can lead to the development of new nanoscale electrode catalyst structures which enhance ORR activity, have improved durability, can be utilized with ultra-low platinum loadings, and can maximize the power/effective surface area of the catalyst, thus reducing PEM fuel cell cost. This approach can avoid the issues associated with conventional carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles, unsupported Pt-black, and polycrystalline continuous Pt thin film approaches. Therefore, this work has the potential to result in a significant advance in fuel cell catalysis and electrode development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal also incorporates the plans for a mentoring and outreach infrastructure for energy related research through UALR. This plan includes an educational collaboration and interaction among the students, faculty, teachers, and parents at UALR and the LISA Academy Charter School. It outlines an organized system of student education and mentoring, equipment and knowledge share, preparation towards science competitions, dissemination of research activities, and channels of increasing the awareness of public in energy research in the area of central Arkansas. In addition, UALR educates more minority students than any other institution in Arkansas. Hence, the proposed effort has a strong potential of benefiting the students coming from underrepresented groups, where the project will employ minority and female undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

PEM fuel cells can operate with various types of energy carriers including hydrogen, ethanol, and methanol. However, conventional PEM fuel cell electrodes, which are comprised of carbon supported platinum catalyst nanoparticles, suffer from several key limitations that include sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and high Pt loadings at the cathode, agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles, oxidation of carbon support, separation of carbon over time from the membrane, and poor catalyst-carbon support stability. In order to overcome these limitations of the traditional cathode catalyst, PI Dr. Karabacak&rsquo;s group developed <strong><em>a new nanostructured PEM fuel cell electrocatalyst structure that comprised of a single layer, carbon-free, core-shell nanorod arrays with extremely low platinum (Pt) loadings and ideal alloy compositions for enhanced ORR electrochemical activity.</em></strong><em> </em>The main electrocatalyst design involved base metallic nanorods made of low cost elements with good durability and strong adhesion to Pt conformally coated with a thin layer of Pt or Pt-alloy film. PI employed a combination of recently developed &ldquo;small angle deposition (SAD)&rdquo; and &ldquo;glancing angle deposition (GLAD)&rdquo; techniques for the fabrication of core-shell nanorod arrays. As illustrated in Figure 1, GLAD involves an obliquely incident flux of incident atoms depositing on a titled and rotating substrate that results in the formation physically self-assembled nanorod arrays. Then, SAD is introduced by simply re-orienting the substrate at small tilted angles toward Pt or Pt-alloy source(s), which allows the conformal coating of nanorod cores with the catalyst shell. The overall process is simple, low-cost, and scalable. The PI&rsquo;s group also demonstrated that SAD-GLAD nanorods can easily be integrated to a PEM fuel cell electrode, for example by depositing nanorods directly on the gas diffusion layer and pressing it to the membrane (Figure 2). In addition to detailed material and electrochemical characterization tasks of the project, Monte Carlo simulation codes were developed to better understand/optimize the nanostructure growth by the SAD-GLAD technique.</p> <p>As one of the major achievements of the project, PI&rsquo;s group showed that SAD-GLAD Pt-Ni/Ni nanorod arrays can achieve exceptionally high mass activity (i.e. current per Pt-weight) and specific activity (i.e. current per active catalyst surface area) that were about ~5-6 folds larger than the 2020 DOE targets, among the highest top few, and are the highest for Pt-Ni alloy catalysts prepared without any special sample treatment reported in the literature to the best of PI&rsquo;s knowledge. These results demonstrated that, simple and cost-effective SAD-GLAD fabrication process provides an unprecedented capability of producing exceptionally active catalyst electrodes for PEM fuel cells. In addition, replacing the nickel core with tungsten carbide (WC) nanorods and incorporating a new design of stacked Pt-Ni/WC structure by a successive SAD-GLAD process further improved the electrochemical durability of the catalyst layer. The results of these and related work have led to about 50 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers and ~60 presentations in professional meetings.</p> <p>The project also involved several educational and outreach activities. PI developed a mentoring and outreach infrastructure for energy related research to serve the students, faculty, and teachers at University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR) and a local high school. The infrastructure involved an organized system of student education and mentoring, equipment and knowledge share, preparation towards science competitions, dissemination of research activities, and increasing the public awareness in energy research in central Arkansas. For that purposes, PI&rsquo;s group developed a new website named &ldquo;ARKansas ADvanced Energy Systems (ARKADES)&rdquo; (Figure 3<a href="http://ualr.edu/energy/"></a>). The mentoring infrastructure has led to hosting about 30 high school students at UALR laboratories, of which about half were from minority/underrepresented groups. These students won several awards in regional, state, and national science competitions. Furthermore, PI initiated a new educational club titled &ldquo;Education Pioneers&rdquo; at UALR that took a leadership role in organizing a new annual AR-STEM Festival (Figure 4) for middle and high school students to demonstrate their science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) projects. Three festivals held so far attracted about 7,000 students with more than 500 STEM project demonstrations. The club also organized several presentations in local high schools and summer camps with a focus on the role of nanotechnology in energy applications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/26/2017<br>      Modified by: Tansel&nbsp;Karabacak</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1159830/1159830_10200509_1509045617316_Figure1_SAD-GLAD--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1159830/1159830_10200509_1509045617316_Figure1_SAD-GLAD--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Growth of SAD-GLAD Nanorod Arrays"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1159830/1159830_10200509_1509045617316_Figure1_SAD-GLAD--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Growth of SAD-GLAD Nanorod Arrays"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure1: Schematic of GLAD and SAD system that was developed for the fabrication of SAD-GLAD nanorod array catalyst electrode materials.
