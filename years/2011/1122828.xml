<AbstractNarration>The LivePhoto Physics Group is creating and evaluating the use of a series of "Interactive Video Vignettes" - short single-topic video expositions that incorporate experimental measurement and analysis activities. These web-based vignettes are being developed as exercises to supplement textbook reading and/or serve as pre-lecture or pre-laboratory activities. Each vignette combines narration, a real-world video segment, and video analysis tools to enable students to master concepts while learning how to collect and analyze data. The video analysis methods can range from simply viewing the spacing between lines on a video frame to applying sophisticated data collection and analysis techniques. By providing an interactive experience outside the classroom, students are able to confront common conceptual difficulties and learn how scientific knowledge is constructed through observation and experimentation. Since Interactive Video Vignettes represent a new genre of learning materials, this group is conducting research on the impact of vignette use on student learning and attitudes. One focus is to identify efficient course management techniques that motivate students to use vignettes productively with a minimum of instructor time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactive Video Vignettes are to serve as a model for other STEM web developers as they create interactive materials involving student use of real-world observations in many venues. These include supplements to classroom work, laboratory experiences, on-line courses, and hands-on science museum experiences. In addition, the project is developing new methods for automated collection of data about how students interact with web-based materials. Such data can assist other developers in automating and streamlining their educational research techniques while engaged in formative and summative research on how students can most profitably interact with web-based materials. These techniques provide new tools for research on how different student populations acquire the conceptual, mathematical, and epistemological knowledge that is essential for understanding science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A collaboration of faculty members and students at Rochester Institute of Technology and Dickinson College, along with a consultant at the University of Cincinnati, developed and tested a series of Interactive Video Vignettes (IVVs) on physics topics. The goal of each vignette is to enable students to overcome learning difficulties identified by Physics Education Research.  Introductory physics students typically take only ten minutes or less to complete a vignette online. Still, research conducted at the University of Cincinnati, Dickinson College and RIT shows that the majority of student users have been able to learn key concepts in mechanics and electrostatics that are known to be difficult.  The following finished vignettes can be viewed and downloaded from ComPADRE (http://www.compadre.org/ivv/), an NSF sponsored website:  Projectile Motion &ndash; Independence of vertical and horizontal motion. Newton?s First Law &ndash; Sliding objects with less friction slow down less, so without friction an object would not slow down at all. [Includes video analysis] Newton?s Second Law &ndash; Acceleration of different carts by the same force. [Includes video analysis] Newton?s Third Law &ndash; Forces in a collision. Bullet-Block (with Derek Muller http://veritasium.com/) &ndash; Conservation of momentum in an inelastic collision. Circular Motion &ndash; Centripetal Force. Electrostatics I &ndash; Electric Charge &ndash; The nature of electric charge. Electrostatics II &ndash; Positive and Negative Charge &ndash; How can we tell which charges are negative and which are positive? Electrostatics III &ndash; Charges Interacting &ndash; How charge transfers from one object to another.   Vignette Studio, the free, open-source software developed in this project for authoring vignettes, can be downloaded from the ComPADRE site.
