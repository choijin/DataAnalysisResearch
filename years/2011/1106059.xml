<AbstractNarration>The Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) project seeks to detect hyperfine emission from neutral Hydrogen (21 cm rest wavelength) in the intergalactic medium about 100 million years after the Big Bang (redshifts 16-40). A detection would deliver the first observational constraints on models of structure formation and on the formation of the first stars and black holes in the Universe. LEDA will develop and integrate signal processing instrumentation into the new first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). This comprises a large-N correlator serving all 512 dipole antennas of the LWA-1, leveraging a packetized CASPER architecture and combining FPGAs and GPUs for the F and X stages. Iterative calibration and imaging will rely on warped snapshot imaging and be drawn from a GPU-enabled library (CUWARP) that is designed specifically to support wide-field full polarization imaging with fixed dipole arrays. Calibration techniques will include correction for ionospheric refraction and direction dependent dipole gains, and exploration of pulsar data analysis to improve performance. Accurate calibration and imaging will be crucial requirements for LEDA, necessary to subtract the bright foreground sky and detect the faint neutral Hydrogen signal. From the computational standpoint, LEDA is a TeraFlop per second challenge that enables a scalable architecture looking toward development of radio arrays requiring power efficient 10 PetaFlop per second performance. Stage two of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA2) is one example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When did the first stars form? These stars are expected to be much more massive than the stars that are around us today. Did supermassive black holes form at the same time, earlier, or later? One of the great challenges of cosmology today is the study of these first generation objects. Their formation is widely hypothesized to have begun about 100 million years after the Big Bang, but no data are available to test this theory. The only available means to study the Universe at so young an age (just 1% of what it is today) is via electromagnetic radiation from the intergalactic medium between the stars and black holes. Today, this is hot and ionized plasma, but in the early Universe it was a vast reservoir of cold neutral Hydrogen gas that fed the formation of the first stars and black holes and radiated long wavelength radiation copiously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LEDA project seeks to apply frontier radio astronomical techniques to make the first detection of this signal. LEDA will build a "radio camera" for deployment on the Long Wavelength Array, a radio telescope in New Mexico whose first 100m-diameter aperture was recently completed. The LEDA camera will combine several innovative technologies and data analysis techniques, giving students and young scientists the opportunity to join in cutting-edge science and development of the most advanced tools. In particular, LEDA will harness the massive computing power and flexibility of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) - the engines that power video games - to make instantaneous images of nearly the whole sky at up to 10 meters wavelength (10 million times longer than visible radiation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From these images the light of our and other galaxies will be subtracted with high accuracy, enabling a search for signals from the dawn of the Universe. LEDA will push the frontiers of cosmology while contributing groundwork for future radio astronomical facilities where massive computing and signal processing systems will be lynchpins. Cross-disciplinary outgrowths of the LEDA effort will benefit astronomical, computational and solar sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Science &ndash;  Following the Big Bang, the universe comprised a vast "sea" of dark matter and ordinary matter (chiefly Hydrogen), and radiation of all wavelengths, which streamed away leaving the matter behind.  Over the first tens of millions of years of cosmological expansion and cooling, initially small fluctuations in density grew under the action of gravity.  After about 40 million years, a mere third of a percent of the current age of the universe, simulations predict that the first stars formed within some of the densest and coldest clouds of gas.   The name "Cosmic Dawn" refers to the next era and the first appearance of stars throughout the universe, ending with the formation of proto-galaxies, ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from which ionized carved huge cavities, ultimately destroying the natal reservoir of primordial Hydrogen.        Models of Cosmic Dawn remain virtually unconstrained by observations, unlike the succeeding epoch (Reionization), during which there were developed galaxies and quasars, some of which have already been detected.  Is the consensus cosmological model as to when stars began to form correct?   Were there sources of heating in the universe before stars?   These questions are fundamental and represent a grand challenge in cosmology &ndash; to characterize with hard data the universe before galaxies reshaped the "landscape."  Astronomers are racing to detect the radio signatures from the primordial Hydrogen using a new generation of antennas and arrays of antennas groups to form monolithic telescopes (a.k.a. interferometers).  Most target the later period, which is closest to us in time, but is also marked by widespread galaxy formation, which is poorly understood and thereby complicates interpretation of data. Merit &ndash; The LEDA project (AST1106059) has been one of the earliest dedicated to the study of Cosmic Dawn, when the dominant processes may be described using relatively fewer parameters, and for which it may be possible to constraint a linear model that can be extrapolated into the Dark Age, when the temperatures of radiation and matter reflected a basic thermodynamics.     At any redshift, the Hydrogen signal will have two components, a "DC"  term reflecting a global average over the sky and an "AC" term  reflecting spatial structure due to the distribution of star formation  and finite propagation of radiation. Both vary with redshift.   LEDA focused on detection of the former while demonstrating architectures needed to build instruments to study the latter.  Ultimately, study of  the two components will constrain different Cosmic Dawn parameters, which together  will enable  "complete" 3-D reconstruction of the structure of early universe.  The predicted Cosmic Dawn signal is about one million times fainter than foreground radio emission, including that from the Milky Way galaxy.  For that reason, sources of systematic error must be controlled to very high degree, which at the low frequencies to which the Hydrogen signal is redshifted (probably about 60-90 MHz, though perhaps as much as 50-120 MHz) is very difficult.   Key sources of error are uncertainty in broadband models of sky brightness, gain patterns of antennas and variations related to the environment (e.g., moisture in the upper few meters of the ground), refraction in the ionosphere, and small defects in the performance receiver-antenna combinations (e.g., radio noise from receivers, partial reflection of power at the input to components, ambient temperature sensitivity).  With these in mind, the design adopted by LEDA sought to leave as little to chance as possible.  The experiment was designed to be self-contained, so that calibration would rely on celestial data taken in situ more so than assumptions and external models.  Five radiometric antennas were constructed, to enable comparisons among data that should be identical in an effort to assess sources of systematic error.  These antennas were incorporated into a station of the Long Wavelength Array first in New Mexico and then California were LEDA undertook construction of one of the largest correlators in the world at the time (c.2014) to enable both collection of sky-averaged spectra from which the Cosmic Dawn signal would be extracted, and calibration data for gain patterns and the ionosphere based on wide-field interferometric imaging. (The LWA instantaneous field of view is about a full hemisphere.)  As data were analyzed and new limits in performance were reached, new hardware was designed, fabricated, and deployed for further data reduction.  In its final year, LEDA achieved an upper limit on the Cosmic Dawn signal on the order of 0.4K, which is about 1000 times fainter than the sky and 40 times above what is required to make a detection, assuming commonplace simulations are approximately correct.  Impact &ndash;  In the process, the project contributed to training of two undergraduates, two graduate students, and seven postdoctoral fellows.  As well, the LEDA correlator has been the first to demonstrate application of commercial networking and GPU technologies for massively parallel correlation of arrays with on the other 1000 antennas.
