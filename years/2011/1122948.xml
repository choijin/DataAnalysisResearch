<AbstractNarration>Dr. Holly R. Cashman (University of New Hampshire) will undertake research on language dominance, maintenance, and shift.  Traditional research on language choice relies primarily on a nuclear-family based model of language and ethnic identity transmission. In contrast, Cashman's research will focus on language and identity among people who have strong community identities that do not conform to the nuclear family model. The research will be carried out in Phoenix, Arizona, among speakers of Spanish and English. Research methods include discourse and conversation analysis of materials acquired through formal interviews and participant observation. The researcher will engage graduate and undergraduate students, as well as community members in the research, and will disseminate findings beyond the traditional academic settings and publication venues.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The major goals of the&nbsp;project are to better understand the lived experiences of bilingual LGBTQ Latinas/os in a major metropolitan area in the southwestern U.S. at a time of dizzying social changes and demographic shifts through a careful and thorough study of language and identity practices of a diverse group of participants. I specifically sought to answer the following questions: (1) how do gay and lesbian Latinos/as see the relationship between their ethnic and sexual identities? (2) how does this vision affect and how is this vision affected by linguistic practice, specifically the maintenance of Spanish versus shift to English? and (3) how are Latina/o, gay and lesbian identities constructed in interaction? We find that the relationship between ethnic and sexual identities is complex, but that coming out as gay, lesbian or bisexual, or transitioning from the sex assigned at birth, does not necessarily result in a break with family ties or ethnic communities and does not always result in a shift from Spanish to English for Spanish-speaking LGBTQ immigrants. In fact, we find bilingual LGBTQ Latinas/os in Phoenix display the full continuum of bilingualism, from Spanish-dominant to English-dominant, and LGBTQ Latina/o participants' relationships with family and ethnic communities ranged from almost total estrangement to extremely close-knit. We further find that in interaction a wide variety of resources are used to co-construct, resist, or negotiate LGBTQ and ethnic identities. These resources include, but are not limited to, constructed dialogue (reported speech), affective keys (expressions of emotion in interaction), identity labels, and pronouns. The outcomes of this project are twofold: a sociolinguistic ethnography of LGBTQ Latinas/os in Phoenix, Arizona, and a community art project (mural) in downtown Phoenix depicting themes emerging from the research. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2015<br>      Modified by: Holly&nbsp;R&nbsp;Cashman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1122948/1122948_10113380_1448885939362_Mariposa--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1122948/1122948_10113380_1448885939362_Mariposa--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mariposa"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1122948/1122948_10113380_1448885939362_Mariposa--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mariposa"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Detail of the Somos Family Mural, a community art project aimed to disseminate research results beyond an academic audience.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Holly R.
