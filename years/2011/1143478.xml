<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop miniature optically actuated and instrumented tools that can be used during Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) interventions to make them faster and more precise. The initial focus is an active steerable biopsy needle prototype that uses laser heating conducted via optical fibers to a low temperature (50C) shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator located inside the needle. The prototype employs optical fiber sensing of the needle shape and temperature, for control. In contrast to previous "point and shoot" approaches for needle insertion, a physician will be able to stand outside the scanner bore, guiding an MRI compatible needle through the perineum and steering it to the target in the prostate with visual feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research include minimally invasive MRI compatible needles, catheters, and apparatus for ablations and brachytherapy. Following development of the active needle, the IFOS team plans integration with MRI scanning software to significantly reduce time and cost, and increase the precision of MRI guided interventions such as biopsy and brachytherapy. Combined optical actuation, temperature profile and shape monitoring can add still more versatility, allowing IFOS to address the sizeable image guided surgery market. IFOS intends to leverage existing products and strategic partnerships to reduce the technical risk and offer its technology in interdisciplinary fields across the image guided medical industry. This research involves the work of a diverse group of researchers, industrial product developers, surgeons and business people with commercial acumen.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I/IB project was to demonstrate the feasibility of developing and using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-compatible optically-actuated active needle based on a shape memory alloy (SMA) for guided percutaneous surgery and biopsy procedures.  The envisioned final products resulting from this research can be used in applications and procedures involving not only MRI, but also ultrasound (US), and Computerized Tomography (CT).  Active bending of the needle during insertion allows the needle to be accurately guided to even relatively small targets in an organ while overcoming undesirable deviations away from the planned path due to unforeseen or unknowable tissue interactions.

A key impact of this innovation to image assisted surgery is to add a steering degree of freedom in an MRI compatible disposable 18 gauge needle and producing predictable deflection of the distal end without resorting to electrical or magnetic means.  The optically actuated SMA approach represents a potential breakthrough that could lead to a class of needles that provide optimal routing to tumors, shorten procedure times and are safer and more controllable than passive beveled-tip needles available today.  The Fiber Optic (FO) delivery technology lends itself well to additional sensing functionalities leading to a single multifunctional fiber-instrumented needle adaptable to a large variety of medical interventions.  The innovation in the proposed concept is the needle stylet design, which uses fiber optically delivered infrared (IR) laser radiation to efficiently heat an internal force-inducing part (e.g., actuator) made from a shape memory alloy (SMA), thereby producing predictable deflection of the distal end without resorting to electrical or magnetic means, which would require electrical wiring. The absence of conductive or magnetic materials makes the needle MRI compatible, immune to fields generated by MRI devices, and less prone to cause artifacts in the imaging system.  Use of a flexible fiber optic (FO) distributed light-delivery system results in a miniaturized (&lt; 1.5 mm diameter), steerable needle system comprised of low cost components compatible with the practical issues of disposability and reimbursement.
