<AbstractNarration>Up to 30 students will receive travel grants to attend the 2011 Wireless Innovation Forum Conference on Communications Technologies and Software Defined Radio, to be held in Washington DC, November 29th - December 2nd. The grants will provide partial support for travel, housing, and conference attendance. Software-defined radio technology will become increasingly important as the foundation of wireless communications, and attendance at the conference will expose students to many technical and practical aspects of the technology.</AbstractNarration>
