<AbstractNarration>The Notch signaling system is a cell-to-cell communication mechanism that is found in virtually all multicellular organisms and allows developing cells to acquire their specialized cellular types (neuronal, muscular, digestive, reproductive, etc.). This system has many components, two of which are the main focus of this proposal.  These are the Notch signal receptor molecule and the Serrate ligand that is capable of interacting with and affecting Notch receptor activity.  The Serrate ligand can activate the receptor when these molecules are expressed on adjacent cells leading to the formation of different cell types.  Serrate can also inhibit the receptor when these molecules are co-expressed on the same cell, preventing such cells from receiving a Notch signal and forming distinctive cellular types. This proposal investigates the specific regions and properties of the Serrate ligand that are responsible for inhibiting the Notch receptor hence investigating a crucial mechanistic aspect for controlling cellular specialization. The work utilizes targeted molecular-genetic mutation of the Serrate molecule with subsequent expression of these mutated forms in the fruit fly to investigate their effects on Notch signaling.  The outcomes are expected to fully define and characterize the regions of Serrate that confer the inhibitory property of the ligand onto the Notch receptor and potentially define regions essential for Notch activation. The evolutionarily conserved nature of Notch system components allows for very broad applicability of the findings of this study to the homologous molecules in vertebrates. Further, this study will extend the understanding of cellular differentiation control in multicellular animals including stem cell differentiation mechanisms. The study will be conducted by undergraduate researchers providing these students with a strong background in molecular and genetic tools for subsequent professional training and development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Notch signaling system is one of a small number of genetic networks that function to allow cells to communicate with one another as an animal develops so that the proper number and types of cells are specified and an animal develops with all of the proper cell types and functions. Mutations of Notch pathway components are foundational causes of many developmental disorders of the skeleton, musculature, circulatory and nervous systems in humans.  Additionally, numerous forms of human cancers have been linked to Notch pathway abnormalities. There are many components to this system but the two most essential for cellular communication are the Notch receptor and the molecules (ligands) that function to turn the receptor on or off.  The research conducted in this study has been on the Notch ligand known as Serrate.  The research has been conducted in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, due to the availability of genetic and molecular tools in this organism as well as the high degree of conservation for both the form and function of the Notch receptor and the Serrate ligand in flies and humans.  Serrate has the property of being an activator of the Notch receptor and can cause the receptor to signal to a cell to alter its cellular differentiation.  Interestingly, Serrate can also function to inhibit the receptor and block its ability to signal (see Figure 1B).  We have traced the differences in the outcome of these interactions to specific regions of the Serrate protein (see Figure 1A).  We identified the region that inhibits Notch activity to 3 protein segments called EGF-like repeats in the extracellular portion of the Serrate molecule.  If any or all of these three repeats are deleted, Serrate can still function to activate the Notch receptor but it can no longer inhibit Notch (See Figure 1C).  We have found that the location of this region in its normal site within Serrate is essential for this activity and these findings implicate the role of this region to directly counter the effects of the adjacent activation region previously identified in the ligand.  We have further identified another region of Serrate that is located just external to the membrane of this molecule (termed JM; see Figure 1A).  The function of this region appears to be crucial for Serrate to be able to activate the receptor but appears to have minimal effects on the ability of the ligand to inhibit Notch. Thus, this region appears to operate in a manner opposite to that of the NIR described above.  If the region is disrupted or removed, Serrate loses its ability to activate the Notch receptor but remains fully capable of inhibiting its functions (see Figure 1D).  When added back to a non-activating form, this region restores the ability of the construct to activate Notch (Figure 1E &ndash; compare to Figure 1D). We have delimited this region to a small segment of the protein that encompasses about 65 amino acids.  We are continuing to characterize this region by comparative protein structural analyses as well as engineered mutational analyses to determine the exact site(s) of action for this region.  Our examination of these functional regions of the Serrate receptor have initiated an area of research that has the eventual promise of determining causative roles for the ligand in both activating and inhibiting the Notch receptor.  Because the human disorders described above all have inadequate or inappropriate Notch signaling underlying their mechanistic causes, this research is likely to eventually allow for the discovery of therapeutic strategies to help counter the effects of misdirected Notch signaling.
