<AbstractNarration>At six year intervals since 1998, members of the evolutionary biology community have convened to discuss future research directions in the discipline. In recent years, evolutionary biology has grown at an enormously accelerating rate. The discipline is now awash in comparative genomic data, and major conceptual and empirical advances have been made in several areas. In June of 2011, the American Society of Naturalists, the Society of Systematic Biologists, and the Society for the Study of Evolution will hold a two-day workshop to discuss future directions in evolutionary biology. The goal of the workshop will be to outline important areas for future research directions, and how scientific societies and the field at large can act to advance such research. This workshop will be the first of such society-sponsored events that will allow an ongoing dialog within the evolutionary research community on the assessment and development of focal areas for research.</AbstractNarration>

In the context of the importance of evolutionary biology, future areas of importance include the development of new theory that can accommodate the new sources of data now available from genomics and other areas, increasing the ability to analyze and understand the enormous quantity of data now obtainable, studying the evolutionary processes responsible for genetic and phenotypic variation in populations, understanding how the earth has change through time and how biodiversity has evolved.
