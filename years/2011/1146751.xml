<AbstractNarration>Tree species distributions can shrink over time through reduced regeneration and subsequent adult mortality or they can expand via seedling establishment beyond current distribution boundaries.  Therefore, a critical component of our ability to predict future species distributions is an understanding of the mechanisms of seedling establishment, which requires a fundamental knowledge of seedling physiology.  The water pathway from the root to the leaf is critically important for maintaining leaf water status and allowing stomata to stay open, resulting in carbon capture through photosynthesis.  However, water transport in the plant is vulnerable to desiccation-induced changes, including vascular tissue embolism (i.e. air bubble formation).  The overall objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms responsible for prevention of hydraulic failure (i.e. catastrophic embolism) in tree seedlings, thereby ensuring adequate photosynthesis for their survival and establishment.  Survival, growth, physiology and anatomy of growing seedlings will be measured to assess desiccation tolerance and the impacts of drying on photosynthesis, and to determine when structures that regulate seedling water loss develop.  Results from this research can be directly used in modeled predictions of vegetation responses to climate change because seedling survival is likely a primary determinant of species distributions.  These findings will also be of interest to policy makers and land managers who are interested in potential drought impacts on productivity and distributions of certain species.  They will also be of interest to tree and woody crop breeders concerned with identifying traits associated with survival and adequate productivity in given environments.  In addition, the ideas and methodology of measuring young seedling hydraulic parameters will be of interest to the plant science community and could provide a springboard for a new area of research activity.  The project includes training of two graduate students, several undergraduate students and high school students.</AbstractNarration>

First, we focused on differences in the ability of tree seedlings in their first year of growth (germinants) from two populations each of two conifer species to tolerate drought and heat stress. The populations differed in the climate where their parental trees had been growing, with one population of each species coming from a hotter and drier habitat than the other population.

At the other end of this continuum of stringency are more "anisohydric" species that keep their stomata open during water stress, which causes their leaf water potentials to reach more extreme values. There has been much interest in the physiological differences among species that lie along this continuum because the different strategies may have implications for species? ability to survive drought stress.  For each of the two major activities listed above we conducted specific projects. Below, we have listed specific objectives for each activity as well as a brief description of how that objective was carried out and results from the experiments.  1. Determine if germinants of ponderosa pine from populations that differ in climate vary in their ability to tolerate drought stress. To test this we conducted a common garden experiment on germinants from two populations of ponderosa from contrasting environments. We examined a variety of physiological and anatomical traits. Ponderosa pine germinants from the drier, hotter environment exhibited a much more conservative suite of traits, including gaining more carbon dioxide per water lost, smaller biomass, and earlier budset in the fall.    2. Assess thermotolerance in germinants of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir from populations that differ in climate. This experiment was conducted in a greenhouse and parameters such as the health of the light absorption machinery, the integrity of the cell membranes, gas exchange of carbon dioxide into and water out of the leaves, and components of the non-structural carbohydrate pool were measured. Species-level differences were observed in the metrics of thermotolerance. For example, detached needles of Douglas-fir germinants had healthier photosynthetic machinery and had better cell membrane integrity under heat stress than in ponderosa. Whole germinants exposed to heat treatments exhibited an increase in glucose + fructose concurrent with a decrease in starch in both species, whereas total non-structural carbohydrates and sucrose were not affected by heat treatment.
