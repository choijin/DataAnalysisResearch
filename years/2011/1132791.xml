<AbstractNarration>Understanding the history of life on Earth and the emergence and evolution of biological function constitute fundamental challenges of biological research. One major goal is to characterize the origin, evolution and structure of complete repertoires of proteins (PROTEOMES) in the viral world and compare it to the repertoires of the cellular world, mapping their function, and studying how structure and function evolve along the branches of a truly universal TREE OF LIFE (ToL). The current ToL depicts the branching history of inheritance (phylogeny) of cellular lineages but does not incorporate the viral world. To integrate viral and cellular knowledge at global level, we here request funding to catalyze a 3-partner international collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), the Korean Bioinformation Center (KOBIC), and the Pasteur Institute (Paris). This Evolutionary Genomics Collaborative (EGC) initiative will involve visits of UIUC team members to Korea and France to seed collaborative research and enhance educational opportunities for UIUC graduate students and early career personnel. We will integrate research and education through (i) mentoring experiences for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers that foster bioinformatics in the U.S. and abroad, (ii) undergraduate research and mentoring experiences to U.S. students, (iii) bioinformatics outreach programs, and (iv) research experiences in bioinformatics for Middle School teachers to enhance STEM in the classroom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Synthesis is an essential component of scientific inquiry. Here we use molecular survey, history reconstruction, and computational analysis to integrate research related to evolution of the modern macromolecular world and of life. The direct linking of structure and function in macromolecules provides manifold benefits, both basic and applied, and is key to our understanding of cellular functions and how these evolve. For example, metabolism is responsible for the energetic demands of biological complexity, yet we know little of how it originated or evolved. The project broadens educational opportunities by exposing postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, undergraduates, and schoolteachers to international frontier research in evolutionary genomics and systems biology. Research will also impact the community through scientific meetings and conferences, public workshops, and other activities.</AbstractNarration>

This stems from numerous philosophical and technical limitations, including an experimental focus on single genes. Moreover, many genes exhibit high mutation rates (e.g. in RNA viruses) that complicate reconstruction of relationships of viruses and ancient groups of organisms, especially when using sequence-based phylogenetic analysis. In fact, homologous proteins often diverge beyond recognition at sequence level with increasing evolutionary time. In such cases, traditional sequence-based homology searches such as BLAST and alignment software perform poorly. To overcome limitations, our research has focused on the 3-dimensional atomic structure of structural domains, the modular end evolutionary units of proteins. We also focus on their associated functions. When compared to sequences, domains and their functions are highly conserved. Their genomic census provides a window into deep evolutionary history. Taking advantage of initial links established between the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign), the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (Daejeon) and the Pasteur Institute (Paris), we have seeded international collaborative research and enhanced educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and early career personnel.

We took full advantage of the wealth of structural, genomic and functional data available in thousands of contemporary cellular organisms and viruses with genomes that have been completely sequenced. First, protein domain structures were assigned using hidden Markov models of structural recognition. Domain structure was defined at the fold superfamily and family levels of SCOP structural classification. Second, we developed a comparative proteomic and functionomic inferential framework for genome evolution that reveals vertical evolutionary traces capable of resolving the tripartite division of cells and sketching their history. Evolutionary inferences were derived from the spread of conserved molecular features in proteomes and functionomes, such as folds and functions defined by Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. Third, we used phylogenomic methods to study the evolution of structure and function along the branches of a truly universal tree of life (ToL), a branching history of inheritance (phylogeny) that describes how viral and cellular lineages on Earth diversified from a primordial ancestor.
