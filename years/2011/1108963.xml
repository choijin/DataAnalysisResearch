<AbstractNarration>This award will support an observational project that combines infrared interferometric imaging with spectroscopic techniques to probe the latitude dependence and size distribution of spot/spot groups on active stars.  Observations will be performed using the Georgia State University (GSU) Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) interferometer, an NSF-supported six-telescope optical array on Mt. Wilson, California.  This group will make use of the Michigan Infrared Combiner (MIRC), a facility instrument built by this group that will be upgraded from 4-beam to 6-beam operation in time for this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is expected to shed light on the relationship between rotation, magnetic fields, and stellar activity in cool stars.  Such phenomena are well-studied on the Sun, but have not been investigated in great detail in other stars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[While Galileo used to the newly-invented telescope to view dark spots on the Sun just over 400 years ago, imaging spots on other stars have proven impossible due to the great distances between stars in our Galaxy.  That is, until researchers at the University of Michigan (UM), led by Professor John Monnier and graduate student Rachael Roettenbacher, turned the power of the Georgia State University CHARA Array towards zeta Andromedae, an extremely magnetically-active giant star located about 181 light years from Earth.  In a series of papers funded by the National Science Foundation, these UM astronomers were able to map out the complex patterns of dark spots on a number of stars and found that they defy a straightforward explanation based on the extensive understanding of our Sun.  This new insight gives us a possible glimpse into how our own Sun might have looked when it was very young and so magnetically hyper-active that the development of life on early Earth might have been at risk.  In order to reach this conclusion, Rachael Roettenbacher organized weeks-long observing campaigns that allowed her to watch the spots rotate around the surface of these rapidly-rotating stars.  This allowed a full-3D picture of the spots to be reconstructed, once Professor Monnier wrote custom software that could fold together data taken at the different rotation angles in order to create a single temperature map of the whole surface that best fit the data.  Not only can 3D spinning movies of the stellar surface be made to show audiences or internet readers, 3D printing using a "color sandstone" process can bring these stars down to size and fit into the palm of one's hand.    The ability to "zoom in" on the surfaces of distant stars is only recently possible thanks to the development of infrared interferometry, a technique where light beams from many small telescopes are mixed together to generate the imaging power of a telescope larger than three football fields.  The NSF-funded CHARA Array has the finest angular resolution in the world and is outfitted with a Michigan-built instrument called MIRC, which was needed to image complex sources like spotted stars.  NSF has supported key aspects of the hardware, software, and observational advances needed to reach these new breakthrough imaging discoveries.  The infrared detectors that make this work possible for astronomy also are now available in commercial "thermal infrared" cameras that allow museum goers to see how everyday objects emit heat.  This NSF grant has continued to support a long-standing partnership between UM Astronomy and the Ann Arbor Hands-on Musuem to create infrared camera exhibits that have been seen by over 300000 visitors since 2010, allowing kids -- and their parents -- to really "see" an important part of the electromagnetic spectrum normally totally invisible to human eyes.
