<AbstractNarration>This Research Coordination Network will employ a series of workshops, seminars and other capacity-building activities to build out a "lightweight" (i.e., minimally burdensome or constraining, widely accessible and appreciated) network organization whose participants seek to advance the design, adoption and impact of digital technologies through sociotechnical research.  A key product associated with the network will be a cyberinfrastructure that enables deposit and retrieval of useful assets (e.g., ideas, documents, data) for studying, designing and managing sociotechnical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The community-building and research-initiating goals of the RCN are to be achieved through at least 33 workshops across five years of the effort. The workshops will engage scholars and practitioners from a wide range of fields and professional societies that address sociotechnical issues in knowledge sharing. The workshop conversations will enable diffusion of state-of-the-art findings and tools across disciplines and domains. They will also encourage communities of researchers to collaborate across academic silos and to address questions related to pressing problems in sociotechnical practice. Thus, broader impacts will include both a shared research cyberinfrastructure and enhanced evidence bases for improved sociotechnical practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how technologically mediated work is best accomplished, which is the focus of this RCN, is of great importance both to the scientific community and to nurturing a national innovation ecosystem that will enhance national competitiveness and security. Scholarly research in this domain is currently fragmented so could benefit greatly from integration and from diffusion of knowledge, techniques and tools across disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Digital Societies and Technologies (DST) Research Coordination Network (RCN) provided the means to support the development of a transdisciplinary community of sociotechnically-oriented (sociotech) scholars. Sociotechnical scholars come from a number of disciplines to include computer science, organization studies, information science, communication and media studies, psychology, human-computer-interaction, sociology, and science and technology studies.  The principles of sociotechnical systems that draw these scholars together: a commitment to studying, evaluating and designing systems that reflect the mutual interdependence of people and technologies; the situated nature of the uses of digital systems, and the social nature of computing &ndash; where the norms of uses and shared understanding of these uses and their consequences are the source of much of their effect (for positive and negative).  The six-year effort of the DST RCN focused on supporting and expanding an explicitly transdisciplinary and trans-community mission to build connections among individuals, institutions, and scholarly spaces for the purposes of increasing the scale, scope, and impact of sociotechnical systems research. The three goals of the RCN effort were:  #1: To strengthen trans-community and trans-disciplinary sociotechnical community by increasing its size, interconnectedness, collective identity, and external visibility.  #2: To support the emerging sociotechnical community by increasing the availability of shared data, research practices, and professional development resources.  #3: To stimulate sociotechnical scholars to undertake large scale, high-impact research projects which directly engage critical economic, technical, and social challenges.  And, in pursuing these, we worked to build lightweight networking and communication structures to support cross-community connections among both sociotechnical scholars and potential students, along with external stakeholders such as academic administrators, policy makers, media organizations, and industry representatives.  To achieve these goals, the RCN provided support to host a series of workshops &ndash; of various kinds as noted below, leadership meetings, and infrastructure planning. The DST RCN support, building on the work done prior to the start of this effort, has resulted in 378 people being able to participate in one of the 11 sociotech summer research institute for young investigators, six of which were held during the period of the grant (accounting for 245 of the 378 participants).   The DST RCN specifically supported two types of workshops that were co-located with the sociotech summer institute: infrastructure planning and catalyst development. Infrastructure planning workshops served to both advance community needs and expectations for what is possible and to bring together scholars who sought to develop infrastructure projects. Catalyst workshops brought together and supported scholars who were looking to advance shared research plans and ideas. Across six years, we were able to run eight infrastructure workshops and 13 catalyst workshops.  These workshop efforts have led to multiple projects being started and proposals being funded.  Funds from the DST RCN were used to help sponsor one-day workshops ahead of major academic conferences, with the threefold goal of drawing together sociotech scholars in these intellectual communities and sharing the theories, models, methods and design guidance that was being developed and advancing these relative to the phenomena and interests of the particular community being served.  We saw these one-day pre-conference workshops as an integration of community building and scholarly development.  Across the six years of the DST RCN we supported more than 20 of these across multiple communities.  Our estimate is that nearly 700 people attended one or more of these workshops, and several of these had more than 100 attendees (most had 30 to 60).  The DST RCN also allowed us to hold seven leadership meetings.  Three of these involved the nine members of the steering committee. The other four involved more (including nearly 40 people in 2017). The growth of the leadership effort reflects both the strength of this community and an explicit goal to build leadership capacity and to ensure that the community of sociotech scholars were able to self-organize and sustain the intellectual momentum provided by DST RCN support.  We are delighted the RCN provided the opportunity to support leadership capacity development.  Taken together, the DST RCN supported community development, leadership capacity-building, scholarly project initiation, and the planning for shared science infrastructure. Funds directly and indirectly touched nearly 800 people across six years.  And, the DST provided the foundation for the transdisciplinary community of sociotech scholars to be able to move forward into the next phase with strong leadership as a product of the community building enabled from this grant. More broadly, the work done by socioech scholars is leading to greater insights into the ways in which digital technologies are bound up in, and helping to shape, work, community and civil engagement.
