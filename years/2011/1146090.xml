<AbstractNarration>The seeds we depend on for our food are products of double fertilization. This essential process in plant reproduction requires delivery of sperm cells by the pollen tube to the egg and central cells of the embryo sac (female gametophyte). Although double fertilization was discovered more than a century ago, the controlling molecular mechanisms and genes remain poorly understood.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We identified the Arabidopsis LORELEI (LRE) gene as critically important for an early step in reproduction. In lre mutants, pollen tubes do not arrest growth in the female gametophyte prior to releasing the sperm cells and consequently fail to complete double fertilization. We found that LRE encodes a putative membrane-anchored glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein and is, therefore, an excellent candidate for mediating some aspects of signaling between the pollen tube and the female gametophyte. In this current project, molecular, genetic, and cell biological experiments will be conducted to elucidate the role of LORELEI protein in inducing pollen tube growth arrest in Arabidopsis female gametophytes. Specifically, we will determine the subcellular localization of LORELEI protein in the synergid cell and whether the LORELEI GPI anchor in is essential for its function in the synergid cell. The mechanism of LORELEI function in inducing the arrest of pollen tube growth will also be examined, and additional genes that function with LORELEI in this important signaling event will be identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive molecular understanding of seed formation may help generate tools to manipulate plant reproduction and increase seed yield. Consequently, this project could have a major impact since seeds are a source of staple food, fiber, nutrition, industrial products and biofuels. Additionally, this project will also have a major human resource impact. Undergraduate students will carry out some experiments and two post doctoral fellows and a research technician will be trained in experimental procedures, data analysis, and scientific data presentation.</AbstractNarration>

This work showed that <em>LRE </em>expression in the fertilized ovule is imprinted, making it a rare imprinted gene functioning immediately after double fertilization. Our results also pointed to an atypical regulation of imprinted <em>LRE</em> expression because DNA or histone methylation pathways that regulate maternally-expressed genes do not control imprinted expression of <em>LRE</em>. Contrary to the predictions of the parental-conflict hypothesis, loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <em>LRE </em>allele, revealed a growth-promoting role for LRE in fertilized ovules, as loss of expression from the matrigenic <em>LRE</em> allele resulted in delayed early seed development (manuscript underwent a favorable first review and is under revision in Plant Physiology).</p> <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Biochemical studies:</span></em> Our goal was to demonstrate that LRE is a GPI-anchored membrane protein (GPI-AMP). A typical GPI-AMP will be released from the Triton-X-114-detergent resistant membrane (DRM) fraction when treated with Phospholipase C. We expressed LRE-cYFP from a RBSC1A mesophyll promoter and succeeded in isolating LRE-cYFP protein in the DRM fraction (Fig. 1). Then, we treated the DRM fraction with phospholipase C enzyme and showed that it can be seen in the soluble phase. Without treatment, the LRE-cYFP protein is in the insoluble phase (Fig. 2). SKU5, a known GPI-anchored membrane protein was used as a positive control in these experiments [<a title="Sedbrook, 2002 #1281" href="#_ENREF_31">31</a>]. In addition, we used this assay to show that GPI anchor addition domain mutants in LRE disrupted its localization in the DRM fraction (data not shown).

Structure-function analysis using LRE-cYFP showed that the role of LRE in pollen tube reception requires the modified 8 cysteine motif, but not the domains required for GPI anchor addition. Consistently, LRE-cYFP-TM, where GPI anchor addition domains were replaced with a single-pass transmembrane domain, fully complemented the pollen tube reception defect in <em>lre</em> female gametophytes. Ectopically expressed and delivered LRE-cYFP from pollen tubes to the synergid cell surface could non-cell-autonomously complement the pollen tube reception defect in <em>lre</em> female gametophytes, only if they expressed FERONIA. Additionally, pollen tube-expressing LRE variants lacking domains critical for GPI anchor addition also rescued <em>lre</em> female gametophyte function. Therefore, LRE and FERONIA jointly function in pollen tube reception at the interface of the synergid cell and pollen tube. This work has been published (Liu et al 2016, Plant Cell).</p> <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader impacts:</span></em> During the previous funding period, the PI supervised 2 postdoctoral fellows, 1 graduate student (NSF GRF recipient) and 15 undergraduates (11 female and 4 male; 5 Hispanic students). Three of the undergraduate students are authors in a published paper from his lab (Liu et al 2016). Importantly, 8 of these students are currently in graduate school and 4 are aspiring medical school or graduate school students.
