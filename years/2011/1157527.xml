<AbstractNarration>This RAPID project will study storm surge sediments deposited by Hurricane Irene in coastal marshes along the east coast of the United States. Questions to be addressed by the study are:&lt;br/&gt;1. What is the magnitude and regional distribution of Hurricane Irene storm surge sedimentation?&lt;br/&gt;2. How does the orientation of the hurricane track in relation to the coastline affect storm surge&lt;br/&gt;sedimentation?&lt;br/&gt;3. What is the contribution of Hurricane Irene to long-term sedimentation in coastal marshes?&lt;br/&gt;4. Are the storm surge deposits preserved in marshes?&lt;br/&gt;Methods to be used include field surveys of the thickness, inland penetration, volume, mass, spatial distribution and structures of Hurricane Irene?s storm surge deposit.  In addition, samples will be collected to determine background sedimentation rates against which to compare the hurricane sedimentation and thus its overall role in coastal marsh evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to improve our understanding of how hurricanes contribute to the formation of coastal marshes. The relative importance of such high-magnitude events in the overall evolution of these coastal landscape features remains the subject of debate.  The project will also contribute to the field of paleotempestology, which provides assessments of the recurrence interval of hurricane strikes and associated hurricane risk. By providing information on the characteristics of a fresh hurricane deposit, the project will help constrain interpretations of past events that are preserved in the geologic record.</AbstractNarration>
