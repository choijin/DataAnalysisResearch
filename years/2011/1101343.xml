<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to develop new explicit relationships between different cohomology theories on algebraic varieties, generalize existing relationships between Betti and de Rham cohomology (Hodge theory), and between etale and de Rham cohomology (p-adic Hodge theory). One particulra project is a description of the etale fundamental groups of nonarchimedean analytic spaces; this will lead to better understanding of period domains and period mappings in p-adic Hodge theory. Other potential results include links between de Rham cohomology and algebraic K-theory, explicit descriptions of etale cohomology suitable for machine computations, and variants of de Rham cohomology giving rise to spectral interpretations of L-functions by analogy with crystalline cohomology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the technical side, this project is potentially quite transformative, bringing together areas of research that have historically proceeded in parallel but lacking a coherent synthesis. In the long run, these methods may lead to new techniques for attacking classical question of number theory, such as the distribution and aggregate properties of prime numbers. As evidenced by the PI's prior investigations, they are also likely to lead to improvements in computational and numerical methods in number theory, which may have impacts in areas of application of number theory to computer science (notably information security).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Number theory is one of the most ancient branches of mathematics, as it includes questions about integer solutions of algebraic equations that date back millennia. In modern times, it is often studied in conjunction with algebraic geometry, the study of solutions of algebraic equations from a geometric point of view, thus forming the hybrid field of arithmetic algebraic geometry.  Much of arithmetic algebraic geometry in general, and the PI's work in particular, involves close analogies between centuries-old methods of calculus and number-theoretic variants introduced in the 20th century. These mostly involve use of p-adic number systems, in which one picks a prime number (called p) and declares two integers to be close together if their difference is divisible by a large power of the chosen prime.  In this project, the PI has focused on p-adic Hodge theory, which amounts to a p-adic analogue of the theorem of Stokes from multivariable calculus. Since its introduction in the 1980s, p-adic Hodge theory has rapidly been adopted as a key ingredient in much recent work in number theory, including the work on modularity of Galois representations triggered by the resolution of the Fermat problem by Wiles.  While numerous results have been obtained by the PI, the most pivotal is a series of foundational results adapting p-adic Hodge theory to a new geometric framework. This involves certain exotic new objects known as "perfectoid spaces", for which much of the basic theory needed to be established from scratch. It is anticipated that the foundations established in this work will lead to an improved understanding of the local Langlands correspondence, one of the key organizing principles in arithmetic algebraic geometry (sometimes likened to the standard model of particle physics).  In addition, the PI has supervised several PhD theses and delivered instructional lectures suitable for graduate students at a variety of venues around the world.
