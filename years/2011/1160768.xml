<AbstractNarration>1160768 &lt;br/&gt;Russell &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides seed-funding for a visit to India for Dr. Ann Russell to catalyze a collaborative research project with scientists at Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) focusing on the Complex Interactions of Ecological and Socioeconomic Factors that Drive the Sustainability of Ancient South Indian Agro-Ecosystems. The collaborators are Dr. Russell, Department of Natural Resource Ecology &amp; Management, Iowa State University and Drs. Mohan Kumar, Dean of the College of Forestry and Indira Devi, Professor of Environmental Economics at KAU.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning visit will provide the foundation for new research that will explore the ecological and socioeconomic underpinnings of the 4000-yr-old agricultural systems in Kerala as well as facilitate the development of a proposal for the Catalyzing New International Collaborations solicitation.  The findings from this exploratory work will provide the necessary background for a subsequent proposal to be submitted to the CNH (Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human&lt;br/&gt;Systems) Program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding will make it possible for the PI to organize a multi-disciplinary team to begin new research on the coupled effects of biogeochemical and socioeconomic factors in relation to the sustainability of South Indian agricultural systems.  The ultimate goal of this series of projects is to develop a conceptual framework that advances understanding of the controls over sustainability for a broad array of agricultural systems.  The inclusion of graduates and undergraduates in these projects will also provide unique international research experiences for US students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Agricultural land-use change is widespread, but the drivers of change and consequences for coupled natural-human systems are not well understood. The homegardens in the state of Kerala, India provide a unique setting for exploring this topic. Although these agroforestry systems have been in existence for &gt;4,000 years, the last decade has witnessed conversion to other land uses at a seemingly high, yet un-quantified, rate. This 18-day long international planning visit was intended to foster development of a newly formed multi-national, multidisciplinary group of scientists aiming to study the ecological and socioeconomic underpinnings of sustainability of the Kerala homegardens. The intellectual merit of this future research is that it will lead to an improved conceptual framework for understanding the drivers and consequences of change in agricultural systems in general.  The objectives were to organize our group of researchers within Kerala Agricultural University (KAU), to determine arrangements for institutional support and appropriate funding sources for Indian colleagues, and to begin drafting a proposal for the future research on the natural-human coupled systems that sustain the Kerala homegardens. To achieve the objectives of this planning visit, Dr. Russell conducted meetings with potential research collaborators, university administrators, and directors of funding agencies in Kerala, Bangalore, and New Delhi. She organized and participated in 19 meetings at 10 different institutions over the 16-day period in India, discovered appropriate funding sources for the Indian colleagues, and began drafting a proposal for the NSF proposal solicitation "Catalyzing New International Collaborations." She also gave three presentations, two on the new proposal ideas, and one on her research to students at KAU.  The health and well-being of our nation depend on sustained productivity of its agricultural systems. The future research that was planned during this planning visit to India will benefit society by providing a means for revealing critical points in natural and human cycles at which agricultural systems decline, and by providing guidance towards a pathway for repair and sustainability. This research is designed to inform land-use planning and policy with respect to the socio-economic and biological underpinnings that sustain agriculture, food security, social capital, and regional economic development.
