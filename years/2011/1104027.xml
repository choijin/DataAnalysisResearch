<AbstractNarration>1104027     &lt;br/&gt;This project supports a cooperative research planning project by Dr. Robert Peters, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and Dr. Mohamed Darwish, Alexandria University, Egypt, with participation from  Misr University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Cairo, Egypt. They plan to study issues and to explore possible research areas aimed at improving water quality in Egypt. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits:  The PI lists a number of tasks including prioritizing the pollutant loads/impacts of wastewaters from different industrial sectors; identifying specific industrial sectors that contribute significant quantities of  pollutants to wastewaters and surface waters; identifying techniques to collect and analyze the chemical constituents and wastewater characteristics of wastewaters being emitted by various industrial firms; targeting pollution prevention assessments/audits of selected industrial firms, and presenting the results in workshops in both the U.S. and Egypt.  There is the potential to conduct needed research with an appropriate emphasis on sustainability issues including considering the production of methane from organic wastes.  Because of the large and growing population in the major cities, water quantity and water reuse may be of importance as well.  Preliminary analysis of water samples collected at various several strategic points in Egypt will be performed and results will be used to identify pollution prevention remedies and low-cost treatment technologies. The plan of the research is well constructed, the statement of work is clear and expected progression of tasks are planned well to match objectives. The key personnel demonstrate training, experience and knowledge in the field, awareness of the dimension of the problem. The analytical methods and approaches have been adequately identified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The objective of the proposal is to improve water quality in Egypt through collaborative research between UAB in the U.S. and Alexandria University and  MUST in Egypt. The project has the potential for a significant impact on developing countries, and could improve quality of life in Egypt.  It will likely result in significant advancement in the water purification field in Egypt, and if successful, will greatly improve the environmental water quality in Egypt. Results will be presented in at least two workshops, one in Birmingham, Alabama, and the other in Egypt for Egyptian researchers, industrial managers and regulatory personnel.  Proceedings will be prepared and submitted to the U.S.-Egypt Joint Board. The project will result in increased collaboration and interactions between UAB and Egyptian researchers, and enhance their educational outreach activities, especially undergraduate/ graduate student programs.  The research may also result in significant improvement of industrial processes from the emphasis on pollution prevention and environmental management systems.  The proposal addresses a real environmental issue of serious concern in a practical and achievable way.</AbstractNarration>
