<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Complex electron systems (CES) such as cuprate high-temperature superconductors exhibit unconventional phenomena emerging from the interplay and competition among the charge-, lattice- and spin-degrees of freedom.  Unraveling the details of this interplay will foster understanding of the physics at play behind the functionality of complex materials.  The impossibility of establishing cause-effect relationships among the degrees of freedom hampers understanding their interplay.  This Proposal discusses a unique experimental approach promising the overcome of this challenge.  It is based on the extension of ultrafast measurement techniques to Angle Resolved Photoemission experiments using femtosecond lasers as photon sources.  The time resolution allows disentangling the coupling of different degrees of freedom in CES by exciting them on timescales shorter than the underlying correlations, and to sort out these interactions by probing their time response as the correlations develop.  A time hierarchy among different degrees of freedom is established based on the dynamical response of the excited electron states.  The proposed science and supporting infrastructure at the University of Tennessee provide an excellent setting for the education and training of young students.  Our educational plan exploits the availability of these resources in a concrete effort to integrate research and education based on creating new research opportunities for undergraduate students and a detailed plan to reach high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;In complex electron systems (CES), electrons interact among each other via their charge, lattice, or spin, giving rise to spectacular and unconventional phenomena such as high temperature superconductivity.  A major challenge in the study of CES is the problem of being unable to establish a cause-effect relationship among the interactions, thus hampering a sound understanding of complex materials.  This Proposal discusses a unique experimental approach promising the overcome of this challenge.  It is based on inducing electrons emission, with ultra-short (less than a billionth of a second!) pulses of ultraviolet radiation.  Analyses of the emitted electrons provide important information about how electrons interact in a material. These pulses can excite electrons so quickly so as to instantaneously destroy their interactions.  Electrons are then monitored following these initial excitations.  When the interactions start to re-form, it will be possible to observe their signature in the electronic spectra.  The interactions will thus be disentangled by probing the response in time of the excited electron states, with the possibility of establishing a time hierarchy among them.  The proposed science and supporting infrastructure at the University of Tennessee provide an excellent setting for the education and training of young students.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Complex electron systems denote materials in which electrons are strongly interacting with each other, and organize themselves in collective behaviors that challenge their correct theoretical description.  For example, materials classified as high temperature superconductors are complex electrons systems.  The premise of this Career Award is that one can achieve considerable insights into the behavior of complex electron systems by trying to isolate the motion of electrons, in order to concentrate on their reciprocal interactions.  In complex electron systems, this is in general a difficult task, since electrons interact also with the crystal structure during their motion.  Another aspect of this challenge is also the fact that when different types of interactions are present, it is often impossible to establish a cause-effect relationship among them.  Part of the intellectual merit of this award consists in the realization that the motion of electrons can be studied separately by using measuring techniques that sample the system on very short times, in essence comparable to the time taken by electrons to move from atom to atom.  These times are very short, less than a picosecond = 10-12 s (i.e. less than a millionth of a millionth of a second!).  On these short times, electrons can move around, while the atoms forming the crystal are essentially static, because they are much more massive than electrons.  Put differently, there is no time for the atoms to interact with the electrons, whose motion and interactions can thus be studied separately.  Our work supported by this award unfolded into different paths.  On the one hand, we were able to gain considerable insights into the physics of some complex electron systems by studying their response upon absorption of an x-ray photon by specifically studying how electrons were emitted, a methodology known as Photoemission.  This is a very fast process, about 100 times shorter than one picosecond.  Through a study of the collected electrons (the spectrum), it was possible to gain precious insights of how electrons move in materials such as Fe-based high temperature superconductors, chiral helimagnets (materials with magnetization that swirl like spirals), and titanium dioxide doped with nitrogen and chromium (a material with interesting properties for harvesting sun light).  On the other hand, this award allowed us to develop new measuring methodologies that combined ultrafast optical technology and Photoemission using femtosecond lasers to produce ultraviolet light needed to extract electrons from a material.  Since femtosecond lasers produce light pulses that are about 10-20 times shorter than a picosecond, this approach allows for the investigation of the electron dynamics in complex electron systems on a timescale that is short compared to that of atomic vibrations.  With this methodology, a visible light pulse impinges on the sample and promotes electrons to excited states.  A second pulse, first converted from visible to ultraviolet, strikes the sample and emits electrons.  By varying the delaying between the two pulse, one can monitor with the electrons produced by the second pulse how electrons go back to equilibrium.       The fundamental idea underlining this approach is that electrons interaction are destroyed when the first pulse strikes.  When electrons progressively go back to equilibrium, interactions start to form again, but now they can be disentangled by probing their time response as they develop.  In other words, different electronic interactions have different ways to go back to equilibrium, and therefore can be separated by monitor how long it takes for equilibrium to set in.  The new setting at JIAM provides the opportunity for students of different disciplines to interact with each other, contributing to expand the breath of their knowledge.  In my group, graduate students work in close collaborations with a research scientist, Dr. Paolo Vilmercati, Research professor C. Cheney, and also interact with other research scientists in charge of the experimental stations where we perform at synchrotron-based experiments.  As stated in previous reports, graduate student Dr. Sirica spent four months in Milano Italy (April &ndash; July 2015) in the group of Prof. Cerullo.  This was an invaluable professional experience for Dr. Sirica.  He worked extensively, and learned much of the know-how in ultrafast techniques.  This opportunity has been clearly of utmost importance, as Dr. Sirica was able upon his return to Knoxville to set up optical pump-probe and laser ARPES experiments.  Now Dr. Sirica is a Seaborg Fellow at LANL under Dr. Rohit Prasankumar?s supervision.       Last Modified: 05/10/2018       Submitted by: Norman Mannella]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
