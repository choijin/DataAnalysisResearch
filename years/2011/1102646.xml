<AbstractNarration>This proposal deals with three topics in stochastic partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations (SPDE).  The first question deals with uniqueness.  &lt;br/&gt;Unless SPDE have unique solutions, they are useless for modeling.  Recent work &lt;br/&gt;by the proposer, L. Mytnik, and E. Perkins settled a longstanding question &lt;br/&gt;about uniqueness of SPDE related to the heat equation.  Using these newly &lt;br/&gt;developed tools, the proposer will attack uniqueness questions for other types &lt;br/&gt;of equations, and study uniqueness among nonnegative solutions.  The second &lt;br/&gt;question deals with traveling waves, which occur widely in physical systems.  &lt;br/&gt;Recently the proposer, L.  Mytnik, and J. Quastel have solved a problem raised &lt;br/&gt;by Brunet and Derrida, involving the asymptotic speed of traveling waves when &lt;br/&gt;the noise term is small.  The proposer will would like to extend this analysis &lt;br/&gt;to other equations, and related particle systems.  The third topic involves &lt;br/&gt;stochastic wave equations.  The most commonly studied SPDE are variants of the &lt;br/&gt;heat equation, but others such as the stochastic wave equation are receiving &lt;br/&gt;increasing attention.  With D. Geba, the proposer will like to study &lt;br/&gt;stochastic wave equations involving null forms.  Using some function spaces &lt;br/&gt;introduced by Bourgain, the proposer's goal is to study short-time existence.  &lt;br/&gt;The ideas developed should be relevant to other classes of equations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of SPDE is rapidly expanding.  As technology moves towards the micro &lt;br/&gt;level, the effect of random noise becomes more and more important.  Since the &lt;br/&gt;most important mathematical modeling tools we have are ordinary and partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations, the study of SPDE is becoming essential in many &lt;br/&gt;applied fields.  Even though SPDE is now several decades old, the area has &lt;br/&gt;only recently received widespread attention.  There is still a need for &lt;br/&gt;pioneering work to establish a toolbox for the area.  This proposal deals with &lt;br/&gt;three types of problems in SPDE.  The proposer believes that through the study &lt;br/&gt;of such specific examples is the right way to generate methods and further our &lt;br/&gt;understanding, for both theory and applications.  In summary, the proposer &lt;br/&gt;believes that SPDE will play an essential role in future applications of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics.  He wishes to develop the theory and help to train graduate &lt;br/&gt;students so that this area can fulfill its potential.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For at least a century, partial differential equations (PDE) have been a key tool in science and engineering.  Indeed, the mathematical formulation of physical laws usually involves PDE.  One has only to pick up a textbook on physics or electrical engineering to see the ubiquity of PDE.           In recent years, scientists have studied ever more detailed properties of the natural world, such as in microbiology and microelectronics.  In such tiny systems, the effects of noise play an essential role.  Thus, there has been ever greater awareness that it is important to study PDE in the presence of noise.  We call such noisy PDE "stochastic partial differential equations", or SPDE for short.  Compared to PDE, many properties of SPDE are still poorly understood.                                               The main goal of this grant has been to study properties of solutions of SPDE, with regard to two questions.  The first question has been to study uniqueness of solutions to SPDE.  Uniqueness means that a given equation has only one solution.  An equation with more than one solution cannot give us well defined predictions about physical systems.  One of the main outcomes of this grant has been a uniqueness criterion for a broad class of equations often used in practice:  stochastic heat equations.  Such equations arise in population biology, the study of heat flow, and many other situations.  The uniqueness criterion involves the roughness of the coefficient of the noise.  The second question involves the study of random polymer or random string models.  Polymers are long strings of atoms, and they play an important role in cellular processes and in many other situations.  Due to their small scale, polymers are strongly affected by noise, but many basic questions about random polymer dynamics remain unanswered.  Two important properties of solutions involve hitting and multiple points.  If the polymer hits a catalyst, for example, it could break into pieces.  Likewise, multiple points of a polymer, where two parts of the polymer occupy the same position at the same time, can be excluded as physically impossible.  Such questions are hardest to study in the critical case, where varying a parameter by a small amount may have a drastic change on the outcome.  The main result of this part of the grant has been to develop a method of studying questions of hitting and multiple points for SPDE in the critical case.  This promises to answer several unsolved questions, and to bring a unified approach to this subfield.          Last Modified: 08/02/2015       Submitted by: Carl E Mueller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
