<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the grant period, the PI pdroduced five research publications in leading journals in the fields of geometric representation theory, quantum groups, and non-commutative geometry, and undertook a significant and on-going collaboration with his post-doctoral mentor, David Ben-Zvi.  He has initiated no fewer than six related on-going collaborations.  Additionally, the PI supervised the completion of three projects by Ph.D. students, and initiated another three.  All of this research is directed towards a further understanding of "quantum algebra" and "quantum topology", a field which combines ideas from topological field theory, algebraic topology, representation theory, and non-commutative algebra to produce algebraic invariants of manifolds.  This interaction is crucial for a modern mathematical approach to basic questions in theoretical physics, and has been a central tenet of much mathematical research since pioneering work of Atiyah, Segal, and Witten on topological field theory, of Drinfeld, Reshetikhin, and Turaev on quantum groups, their representation theory, and its relation to geometry in dimension three and four.  The field has developed in recent years to a more structural/systematic pursuit, in works of Lurie, and Francis, around which much of the PI's efforts have been based.  Because of the crucial role of geometry in dimensions three and four to our physical reality, these a priori mathematical developments carry a physical resonance, whose full extent will remain unclear until they are fully developed.  Already the importance of the flow of information between these once distant fields cannot be understated.  The NSF support provided by this fellowship enabled the PI to focus intensively on his research program, which has comprised of roughly three main directions:  Development of classification tools for tensor categories. "Cyclic extensions of fusion categories via the Brauer-Picard groupoid", co-authored with P. Grossman and N. Snyder. Development of relations between quantum difference operators and topological field theory.  "Integrating quantum groups over surfaces", co-authored with D. Ben-Zvi and A. Brochier; "Fourier transform for quantum D-modules via the punctured torus  mapping class group", co-authored with A. Brochier, "Quantizations of multiplicative hypertoric varieties at a root of unity" authored by I. Ganev, supervised by PI. Development of non-commutative algebraic geometry via lower central series.  "An algebro-geometric construction of lower central series of associative  algebras", co-authored with H. Orem; "Formal Geometry for Noncommutative Manifolds", authored by H. Orem, supervised by the PI.        Last Modified: 09/01/2015       Submitted by: David A Jordan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
