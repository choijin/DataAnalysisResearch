<AbstractNarration>This travel grant supports USA participants to the workshop on "Modeling, Simulation, and Visual Analysis of Large Crowds" in November 2011 at 13th International Conference on Computer Vision. This is a multi-disciplinary workshop that addresses challenges related to visual analysis and simulation of large crowds. The workshop engages complimentary viewpoints from different areas including computer vision, computer graphics, physics-based simulation, and evacuation dynamics to develop additional insight into crowd analysis, modeling and simulation problem. This grant partially supports the travel of invited speakers and participants, especially from computer graphics, simulation, and pedestrian dynamics. The final proceedings of the workshop along with speaker slides would be made available via WWW.</AbstractNarration>
