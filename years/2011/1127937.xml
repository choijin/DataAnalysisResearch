<AbstractNarration>Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1127937 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) located at the University of Missouri-Columbia.Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;Sustainable energy sources are a critical component of our nations future and security. One critical aspect of realizing the potential of biomass energy is the logistics component. To date biomass energy is not being realized due to the high costs of biomass logistics systems. This proposal will address this problem and allow for the development of a multi-stage biomass supply chain and logistics model that addresses uncertainties, such as those in the biomass availability, process performance, and final product demand / price to name a few. The model will also support dynamic decision making and address a broad mix of inherent problems in biomass logistics. Using the results of the research, alternative scenarios will be evaluated and decision support tools will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this project is successful then biomass based sources would become viable and biomass based energy sources would reduce carbon emissions, lead to rural economic development, reduce dependence on foreign sources of energy, increase energy security, increase the likelihood for cost effective energy, and influence policy. Participation by students, including continued recruitment of students from underrepresented groups, will be emphasized by the PI. The project provides benefits for CELDi by positioning both the university members and industry partners in a leadership position for biomass based energy. In addition, the industry partners stand to benefit from an early view of the results that will allow them to develop and implement biomass based energy sources and develop possible market strategies and products.</AbstractNarration>
