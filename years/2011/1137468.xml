<AbstractNarration>The West Virginia State University (WVSU) Planning Grant for STEM Program Evaluation and Improvement is an 18-month, two phase planning process designed to 1) identify critical areas for improvement within the institution's undergraduate STEM programs and 2) develop an institutional plan for addressing those needs. The planning project represents the most comprehensive review of WVSU's STEM programs in recent years and presents an opportunity to develop a plan to transform the institution's offerings to better prepare students for work and further study in STEM fields. The evaluation phase of the project includes several data gathering activities designed to characterize student and faculty perception of program strengths and weaknesses, characterize program successes and challenges as demonstrated from historical student outcomes, identify previously unrecognized barriers to student retention and success, and compare current programs against benchmarks of success observed in STEM programs at other HBCUs. In addition, the evaluation phase includes an extensive review of regional STEM workforce needs that will inform the planning phase. A report on regional STEM workforce needs and a report on evidence-based approaches for improving STEM programs will be made available to HBCUs, other institutions, and the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project were to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at West Virginia State University. This study included gathering information from students, faculty, stakeholders, and alumni. This information was collected through a series of surveys, focus groups, and finally a conference attended by employers, educators and government representatives in the area.  Major Activities:  The first conference including government, academia, industry, and K-12 schools was conducted in November 2012. Suggestions and discussions generated information on how each of the agencies can work to improve the services provided to the other groups.  Significant Results:  The data collected from the survey series was compiled by a member of the Department of Political Science to provide a clear and concise list of deficiencies, strengths, and recommendations to improve the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.  The focus group studies were conducted by a member of the Department of Sociology.  Key outcomes or other achievements:  The information that was gathered and compiled in the attached reports was used to answer reviewersÃ† questions for the NSF STEP grant program. WVSU was awarded the competitive grant in the fall of 2012 to try to address some of the deficiencies discovered in the study.  This grant took information from area employers, professional schools, and graduate schools on the shortcomings of employees and new students respectively. The stakeholders then provided details on how undergraduate institutions can alter their curricula and practices to overcome these shortfalls and improve the preparation of these employees and professional and graduate students.              To date the one presentation has been made regarding the study results off campus, at the February 2013 Spring National American Chemical Society meeting. At this convention a full summary of the reports were available to participants from across the country. Smaller summary reports were provided to outside institutions and organizations that took part in the workforce conference and focus groups.  The results of the conference, surveys, and focus groups will be compiled, summarized, and prepared for publication in journals like the Journal of Chemical Education and others to disseminate the results.
