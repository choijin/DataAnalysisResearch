<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This proposed three-year REU site renewal proposal is focused in the area of sustainable energy. This REU site builds upon the success of an REU site in sustainable energy at Kansas State University from 2009 through 2011. The core of the program is the research the students will conduct on sustainable energy. These research projects will involve faculty mentors from chemistry, chemical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, biological and agricultural engineering, and grain science. In these projects, students will acquire research skills and become aware of the technical skills required for addressing challenges in sustainable energy. Students will orally present the results of their research to their peers and the co-PIs once during the summer and through a poster presentation at a concluding research symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to their research, students will participate in weekly seminars on sustainability and professional development. The sustainability seminars will cover topics such as triple bottom line, climate change, carbon taxes and carbon trading, wind energy, solar energy, biofuels, sustainable transportation systems, energy efficiency and conservation, water, land, sustainable indoor environments, population, and sustainable food systems. These seminars will be part of a formal course, ChE 670 Sustainability Seminar, for which the students will receive one hour of academic credit. The professional development seminars will include topics such as laboratory safety, laboratory research notebooks, data management, writing a scientific paper, technical presentations, graduate education, and career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A final key component of this project will be the inclusion of a team outreach project related to sustainability. In this project, groups of students will interact with the public (at the Flint Hills Discovery Center) or K-12 students (at on-campus summer camps) about a topic on sustainability of their choosing. Students will be trained in how to present technical information to a non-technical audience by the head of the Center for Science Education at Kansas State. This team project will enhance student communication skills, allow students to see the broader implications of their research, and see how they can positively impact society through research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The socialization amongst the students is important in solidifying the research experience and reinforcing the diversity of the program.  To facilitate these interactions a series of social activities will be planned to build community among the REU students and faculty mentors. These will include weekly brown bag lunches on campus, field trips to unique sites at and near Kansas State (ethanol plant, hydroelectric plant, wind farm), and evening activities such as a hike on a nearby prairie.         &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The proposed REU site will provide a rich research experience focused on the personal and professional development of the participants. Students will gain not only the technical abilities required to conduct research in sustainable energy, but will also become aware of the social and political issues associated with sustainable energy. By being involved in a team outreach project on sustainable energy, students will learn to communicate their research to broad audiences and about how their research fits into society. The REU site will also enhance the participation of students from underrepresented groups in research and in graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Forty-four undergraduate students from multiple universities representing several science and engineering disciplines took part in the "Earth, Wind, and Fire: Sustainable Energy for the 21st Century" Research Experiences for Undergraduates from 2012-2014. The program had four primary objectives for the participating students:  To develop and apply knowledge and skills in the area of mathematics,   science, engineering, and research methods. To develop an understanding of sustainability as an applied   multidisciplinary field encompassing economics, science, technology, and   social, political, and ethical issues facing contemporary societies. To develop a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in   life-long learning by increasing the capacity for self-directed learning   and original investigation. To develop skills for communicating scientific and engineering   concepts to the public and to K-12 students.       Towards meeting these objectives, students participated in a variety of activities including a faculty-mentored research project, field trips to local facilities related to sustainable energy (wind farm, ethanol plant, solar panel installations), professional development seminars, a seminar series focused on sustainability, and a group outreach project related to sustainability.  The primary activity was a research project that focused on some theme of sustainable energy.  Some examples of research conducted include projects on wind energy, biofuels, batteries, solar energy, and solar charging stations for electric cars.   Each of these projects led to new knowledge that was reported in international conferences (eleven conference presentations) and in peer-reviewed journals (six publications). We illustrate the research activities with a description of progress in one area of research, the development of new knowledge and applications related to solar powered charging stations for electric vehicles. Solar powered charging stations are one of the important developments related to the electrification of transportation.  The number of parking lots with solar panels that generate electricity is increasing because of their value and convenience. The most common design allows the electricity that is generated to flow into the local electrical grid. The solar panels provide shade in the parking lot, and the charge station is connected to the grid such that power for charging electric vehicles is available at all times.  At some sites there are batteries for electrical storage also.    REU students research investigated the potential for solar charging stations to impact society, and evaluated the potential environmental impact of these charging stations. Student calculations suggested that the amount of power that flows from the solar panels over a parking space depends on location, area of the panels, and efficiency.  In Kansas a reasonable estimate was 16 kWh/day for one parking space.  If 200 million parking spaces are covered with solar panels, 3.2 billion kWh/day could be generated, which can be compared to 11.2 billion kWh of electrical power generated in the United States on an average day. The available land for solar panels, the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and the reduced use of water compared to alternatives are metrics that favor using parking lots for the generation of electricity with solar panels. Based on student research results, three papers have been published in peer-reviewed journals on solar charging stations.  In addition to their research projects, students were involved in a sustainability project. In these projects, students researched some aspect of sustainability, developed a presentation, publication, or activity based on this research, and delivered this product to the general public. For example, REU participants developed outreach projects that were included in local efforts to promote science and engineering to middle school students, while others develope...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
