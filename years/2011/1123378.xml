<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;There have been a number of recent controversies surrounding vaccine adverse events (VAE) (e.g., measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism).  There has been speculation that the typical vaccination promotion message, with its focus on individual risk of vaccine-preventable disease, may have the unintended effect of reinforcing parents' concerns about the risk of their child experiencing a VAE.  There has also been speculation that a message that emphasizes the societal benefits of vaccination may not have this effect. In this project the co-Principal Investigator will use a framing paradigm to investigate which kinds of messages effectively convey the importance of childhood vaccination and community immunity in the promotion of children?s health and, ultimately, healthy child development. The effects of individual- and community-framed vaccination messages on people?s attitudes toward both vaccination uptake and vaccination policy will be compared and the ways in which individual characteristics, like cultural worldviews and parenting attitudes, interact with the message frames to produce particular attitudes toward vaccination uptake and vaccination policy examined. The goal of this research is to contribute to efforts to align personal decision-making about vaccination and vaccination policy with the current scientific understanding of vaccination and its importance to health child development.&lt;br/&gt;This research will establish a critical link between existing theory of risk perception and existing understanding of how parenting attitudes influence child development. In terms of broader impacts, findings from this research will have implications for efforts to promote vaccination decision-making and policy in a manner that reflects the scientific consensus on vaccination.  More broadly, this research can inform the development of communications that promote the well-being of children and families.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The capacity of developmental science to inform effective policies and decision-making on behalf of children depends, in part, on the public messages that accompany these issues.  Increased understanding of the importance of how scientific evidence is presented has led to a growing alliance between experts in strategic framing and developmental scientists. One developmental issue for which strategic communication may play a particularly important role is that of childhood vaccination. Over the last two decades, increased skepticism about the safety and necessity of vaccines has led to decreases in vaccination uptake and increases in vaccine-preventable disease. The fact that parents are refusing vaccinations for their children has been a major cause for concern among scientists and healthcare providers, for whom the benefits of vaccination are generally unassailable.  With this in mind, the aim of this dissertation research was to go beyond demographic factors in trying to understand the mechanisms &ndash; including message frames, parenting attitudes, and cultural worldviews &ndash; that might explain peopleÆs attitudes toward both individual vaccination uptake and vaccination policy. Participants completed an online survey about "childrenÆs health and well-being" and were randomly assigned to one of three message groups: no message, community-oriented thematic message or family-oriented episodic message. After reading a message about vaccination, participants answered questions about their support for individual vaccination decisions and vaccination policy. Participants also completed items that assessed their parenting attitudes and cultural worldviews.  Findings from this research suggest that there was no effect of experimental message frame on vaccination attitudes, as there were no significant differences in support for vaccination decision or for vaccination policy among the message conditions. However, structural equation analyses do suggest that both parenting attitudes and cultural worldviews play an important role in shaping vaccination attitudes, through direct and indirect pathways.

Furthermore, it adds to the relatively small existing literature on message framing in the context of vaccination, presenting a novel investigation of the influence of episodic (family-oriented) and thematic (community-oriented) message frames. Finally, this research adds a critical developmental perspective to the vaccination decision literature. Vaccination decisions are made by parents on behalf of their children, and these decisions reflect parentsÆ beliefs about not only healthy development but also about their roles as parents. This research establishes an important link between existing theory of risk perception and existing understanding of how parenting attitudes influence child development.  By illuminating some of the factors that influence peopleÆs attitudes toward vaccination, this research has the potential to contribute to communications efforts that help bridge the gap between scientific and public opinion and that ultimately promote childrenÆs healthy development.
