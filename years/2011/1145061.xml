<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Thomas Wenzel of Bates College and his undergraduate student researchers will be supported to synthesize and characterize new kinds of chiral NMR shift reagents.  The kinds of reagents that Prof. Wenzel and his students create will enable chemists to rapidly determine the enantiomeric purity of newly synthesized compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiral molecules are molecules that have "handed" symmetry.  They differ in structure from each other only in the sense that they are mirror images of each other.  Since they have identical chemical structures, except for their handedness, it is difficult or impossible to use analytical techniques like NMR to assess the enantiomeric purity of mixtures of these compounds.  Professor Wenzel and his students are interested in designing reagents that will interact with different optical isomers to different extent, which will cause differences in the NMR spectra for the different isomers.  This work has important applications in the analysis of pharmaceuticals.  The undergraduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in carrying out the physico-chemical characterization of these interesting molecules, and they will be prepared for further study in the chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many molecules exhibit the property of "handedness" in which, like a person?s left and right hand, the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. This phenomenon, which is referred to as chirality, is important because living systems have a remarkable ability to distinguish the handedness of many molecules. The result can be that one form of the molecule is active in a person whereas the other is inactive or even toxic.  Over half the pharmaceuticals on the market today are chiral.  Therefore, the ability to analyze mixtures of such compounds to determine the percent purity and whether the compound is right or left handed is essential to chemists.  One way to distinguish compounds with this property is to use host molecules into which one of the forms fits better than the other. For example, your right foot fits better into your right shoe, whereas your left foot in your right shoe feels awkward. This project involved the development and study of host compounds that are the equivalent of right or left shoes. The different environment of the two mirror forms of a compound encapsulated in a host can often be distinguished using a technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).  The particular host cavity compounds we explored are known as resorcinarenes, cyclodextrins and crown ethers.  Water- and organic-soluble resorcinarenes were examined.  Water-soluble cyclodextrin derivatives with negatively or positively charged substituent groups were found to be especially effective for positively or negatively charged analytes, respectively.  A particular crown ether, (18-crown-6)-2,3,11,12-tetracarboxylic acid was found to be especially effective for the study of diamines and beta-amino acids.  Other work involved the synthesis and examination of diamagnetic lanthanide tris beta-diketonate complexes as chiral NMR shift reagents.  These complexes were found to be effective for the analysis of a wide range of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing compounds.   All of the research was completed in collaboration with undergraduate students.  A total of 16 students participated in this work during the award.  A significant numbers of these students were from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.  Seven undergraduate collaborators had the opportunity to present their research at the 27th International Symposium on Chiral Discrimination in 2015, a conference that was chaired by the Principle Investigator (PI).  Nine of the students either are or will be coauthors on peer-reviewed publications that describe their work.  The educational experience that these undergraduates achieved through participation in the research is especially significant.  The PI?s recognition in the field of NMR shift reagents and chiral discrimination resulted in an invited review article, three invited book chapters and a forthcoming book on the entire field of chiral analysis using NMR spectroscopy, all of which were completed or started during the period of the award.  Research made possible through this award has resulted in improved ways of utilizing certain commercially available chiral NMR shift reagents. Research made possible through this award has also resulted in the development of new chiral NMR shift reagents that facilitate the analysis of a wider range of compounds than was previously possible.
