<AbstractNarration>CombinaTexas 2011&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CombinaTexas: a Combinatorics Conference in the South-Central United States, is an annual regional conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Computing. It is dedicated to the enhancement of both the educational and the research atmosphere of the community of combinatorialists and graph theorists in Texas and surrounding states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CombinaTexas 2011 will be held at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas on April 16-17, 2011. The special focus of CombinaTexas 2011 will be algebraic combinatorics. The following researchers have agreed to participate as invited speakers: Federico Ardila (San Francisco State University), Chris Godsil (University of Waterloo), Gregg Musiker (University of Minnesota), Michael Orrison (Harvey Mudd College), Rosa Orellana (Dartmouth College), Bernhard Schmidt (Nanyang Technological University), and Catherine Yan (Texas A&amp;M University).  CombinaTexas 2011 will also include several contributed talks by faculty, postdocs and graduate students and a poster session by undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

CombinaTexas, a combinatorics conference in the south-central United States, is an annual regional conference on combinatorics, graph theory, and computing. It is dedicated to the enhancement of both the educational and the research atmosphere of the community of combinatorialists and graph theorists in Texas and surrounding states.  The aim of the CombinaTexas series is to increase communication between mathematicians in the region, promote the research of the regional combinatorics community, and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the developments in the field of combinatorics.  The 12th meeting of the CombinaTexas Conference Series took place at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, TX on April 16-17, 2011. This conference focused on algebraic combinatorics.

We had a total of 72 registered participants, 43% of them came from under-represented groups, 67% of them were undergraduate students, graduate students, postdocs, or junior faculty.  Below we list the plenary talks at this conference.  Chris Godsil (University of Waterloo): Graph spectra and quantum state transfer Federico Ardila (San Francisco State University): Combinatorics of CAT(0) cube complexes Catherine Yan (Texas A&amp;M University): The symmetry between crossings and nestings in combinatorial structures Gregg Musiker (University of Minnesota): Linear systems on tropical curves Michael Orrison (Harvey Mudd College): Algebraic voting theory Rosa Orellana (Dartmouth College): Kronecker coefficients Bernhard Schmidt (Nanyang Technological University): Circulant weighing matrices of small and large weight   The National Science Foundation, National Security Agency, and Sam Houston State University supported CombinaTexas 2011.
