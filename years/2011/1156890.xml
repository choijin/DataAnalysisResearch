<AbstractNarration>The students in the REU Sites program at Central Michigan University will be presented with open questions in several areas of mathematics, including algebra, analysis, geometry, matrix theory, and statistics. Only a modest mathematical background at the sophomore level will be needed to understand research projects that will be investigated by teams of two or three students in collaboration with a faculty advisor. We provide a brief overview of several of the project topics. In the area of Combinatorial Matrix Theory, there is a natural way to associate graphs to symmetric or Hermitian matrices. The general problem is to determine the minimum rank among various classes of matrices associated with a given graph. In the area of Linear Algebra, we present a project called "Frames in Finite Dimensions." Frames are redundant spanning sets. The open question is to find a method to construct frames with desirable properties such as symmetry or sparsity or a given distribution of their angles and lengths.  A project in geometry studies the relationship between a surface and its associated graph, as well as properties of its embedding into a projective space. A project in statistics aims to classify the hazard flexibility of parametric lifetime distributions based on total time on test transform curve and to rank the well known one- and two-shape parameter lifetime distributions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will learn mathematics beyond what is needed for their research work.  For example, students will be exposed to some of the applications of frames.  When a signal is transmitted over a channel it is possible that some information may be lost during transmission and the original signal cannot be recovered. The redundancy in frames makes it possible to "reconstruct" the original signal.  In the geometry problem students will come to know the deep connection between Riemann surfaces, which are difficult to understand, and combinatorial objects such as graphs, which are easier to understand. Statistics projects will help students understand how to model data and how to estimate certain parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this REU site is based on the challenging mathematical problems students will attempt to solve. The students will tackle unsolved problems whose solutions (or partial solutions) will improve human understanding of the very structure of mathematics and its applications. Eleven faculty members will be active in the three-year program. Four faculty mentors will coordinate the effort each summer. Students will work in groups of two or three with one faculty mentor. Students will make presentations of their progress during weekly seminars. Each student will submit a written report at the end of the program. Students will be encouraged to publish their work and make presentations at professional meetings. The broader impact of the proposed REU site include training undergraduates in research in fundamental mathematics, increasing the participation of women and minorities in science and math activities, and involving undergraduates as young professionals in the broader disciplinary field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2012-2014 REU site at Central Michigan University (CMU) provided talented U.S. undergraduate students the opportunity to work on challenging mathematical problems.  The programÆs goals were to give these students experience with and perspective on mathematical research, help them develop teamwork and presentation skills, and to encourage them to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences or in fields that use and value mathematics and mathematical thinking.  Each summer, four faculty mentors guided teams of two or three students in original research.  A total of 12 students participated in the REU during 2012 and 11 students in each of the years 2013 and 2014.  Female and minority students were particularly encouraged to apply; 18 female students and three minority students participated in the program.   The participants came from public and private colleges and universities of many different types and from across the country.     At the CMU REU site students worked both individually and in teams on their chosen research problem.  Problems were carefully selected by the faculty mentors that were unsolved and challenging while still understandable and approachable by the undergraduates during the eight-week timeframe of the program.  The students were required to learn new mathematics in a variety of areas in order to tackle their chosen problems.  Faculty mentors presented research strategies and discussed other practical aspects of mathematical research and publication. The research projects covered many important areas of mathematics including Abstract Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, Applied Mathematics, Combinatorics, Complex Analysis, Graph Theory, Linear Algebra, and Statistics.  Some research findings have potential applications in actuarial science, signal processing and water conservation.  Students interacted on a daily basis with their teammates and faculty mentors, learning how to work collaboratively and share research ideas and results.  Since the students worked on previously unsolved mathematical problems, their research findings represent entirely new mathematics, and their results are of interest to the mathematical community at large. The students practiced giving research presentations to their own team and to other teams at the CMU REU site in preparation for required presentations at national and/or regional conferences.   There was also a one-day conference each summer for students from all the REU sites in Michigan where the students were able to present their work.  The students were also expected to disseminate their research in print.  Each team wrote a final report containing their findings, but most teams also submitted their results to peer-reviewed professional journals. Seven peer-reviewed journal articles resulting from the 2012-2014 CMU REU teams are at various stages in the publication process.  All the results obtained in the projects add to the existing knowledge on the subject and also point the way for future research.   The 2012-2014 CMU REU site gave 34 undergraduates professional experience in mathematical research, helped them develop teamwork and presentation skills, and made significant progress on pure and applied unsolved mathematical problems.
