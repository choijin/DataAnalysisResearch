<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop algorithms and rules that will allow actuated traffic signals, free of any fixed cycle length, to form green waves by communicating with signals at neighboring intersections. Algorithms and rules will be developed for transit priority, to deal with oversaturated conditions, to provide  more efficient multilane gap-out, and to make best use of the slack inherent in lagging left turn phasing. Algorithms will be coded in C++ and tested using the traffic microsimulation software VISSIM. Actuated traffic signal control, in which changes in signal state (red, green) respond to vehicle detections, has many advantages - it reduces delay, especially for pedestrians, improves safety, and is readily adaptable to giving priority to public transportation. However, it is sparingly used on urban arterials because it lacks mechanisms for coordinating with neighboring intersections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will create incremental improvements that can be applied in existing signal controllers  as well as a whole new paradigm for traffic signal control that will improve safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These new control methods will reduce delay for all traffic users by being more responsive to traffic detection. Pedestrians and public transportation will benefit the most, thus promoting sustainable modes of transportation. Self-organizing logic will reduce the cost of maintaining traffic signals because unlike standard signal timing plans, it does not need to be updated every few years. Outreach activities will take advantage of the strong public interest in traffic through presentations at high schools and public meetings, and through instructional videos posted on the web illustrating the principles of self-organizing traffic signal control.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It has long been known that a way to improve traffic flow on an urban or suburban arterial is to coordinate traffic signals, so that traffic released from one intersection is likely to arrive at the next intersection facing a green light. However, the standard means of coordinating traffic signals &ndash; using a common, fixed length cycle at all intersections with offsets chosen to provide good progression from intersection to intersections and actuated control for minor movements &ndash; has many drawbacks. It leads to long cycles, which in turn result in large delays for pedestrians, cross-street traffic, and vehicles turning left turn off the arterial. Those long cycles also promote speeding because they often result in long intervals within each cycle in which vehicles arrive at full speed facing both a green signal and little or no traffic ahead.  Transit service, especially, suffers long delays under traditional coordinated control, because the stops they make to serve passengers take them out of the green wave. And while standard transit signal priority (TSP) tactics &ndash; holding signals green when a bus is approaching, and starting a green early when a bus is waiting &ndash; can be very effective when traffic signals are fully actuated, they are far less effective when imposed on top of traditional coordinated control, partly because of long cycles, but mostly because the rigid schedule of coordinated control means that interruptions to favor transit have large negative impacts on general traffic, and so only small transit priority interruptions are permitted.  This research developed a new set of algorithms for traffic signal control in which coordination arises organically, rather than being imposed externally. We call this method self-organizing traffic signals. There is no fixed cycle or requirement for a common cycle. Each intersection operates on its own, efficiently serving its traffic demands following standard rules of actuated control, but with some new rules added that create coordination mechanisms. Self-organizing control is expected to be a better platform on which to add transit signal priority because the system is self-healing, meaning it will automatically and easily recover from interruptions. That allows transit priority to be more aggressive.  The most important control rule developed is secondary extension, in which, under certain conditions, a traffic signal will hold an arterial signal green for a platoon of vehicles that will be arriving imminently. Rules were also developed for preserving capacity during periods of oversaturation, avoiding spillback at closely spaced intersections, avoiding pocket lane overflow, more efficiently detecting the end of saturation flow ("gap-out") on multilane roads, and transit signal priority.  Tests using traffic microsimulation show that the new algorithms create the intended results: cycle lengths are reduced, there is less wasted green time, and traffic signals along an arterial show a moderate degree of coordination. Full-scale traffic microsimulation tests were applied for three settings: a four-lane arterial in the Boston area with 10 signalized intersections and light rail in a median reservation, a four-lane arterial in Arlington, VA with 19 signalized intersections and frequent bus service, and a six-lane arterial in the Phoenix area with 9 signalized intersections and whose regular intersection spacing lends itself well to traditional coordination.  In the three settings, in comparison to conventional coordinated-actuated control, self-organizing control was found to reduce traffic delay between 8 and 14 percent, while also improving level of service for pedestrians by reducing cycle lengths.  When tested on peak periods with temporary oversaturation, self-organizing signals were found to reduce delay by 8 to 45% compared to coordinated-actuated control.  When applying transit signal priority (TSP) along with self-organizing control, the tests uniformly found  substantial delay reductions for transit with no added delay to general traffic (compared to a base case of coordinated control without TSP). They also found that TSP was far more effective when overlaid on self-organizing control than when overlaid on coordinated-actuated control, achieving double the delay reductions for transit and avoiding the 8-16% increases in delay to general traffic that accompany traditional coordinated control.  Overall, the project was successful in enabling the creation of new rules for traffic signal control that reduce delay, improve safety, and facilitate transit signal priority.
