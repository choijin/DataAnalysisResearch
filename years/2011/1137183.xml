<AbstractNarration>This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at the University of Texas at Arlington in the summer of 2012 on the topic of mathematical methods of computed tomography. The principal speaker will be Professor Peter Kuchment from Texas A&amp;M University. This award will support 30 participants at different stages of their careers. Computed tomography techniques used for medical imaging aim to recover the internal distribution of various important tissue parameters such as density, water content, oxygenation, hemoglobin content, electrical conductivity, optical properties, and mechanical properties. These are parameters are used by medical practitioners for diagnosis of many types of conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will survey mathematical techniques, results, and open problems in the actively developing and important field of computed tomography, aiming to encourage both established and more junior mathematicians to begin research in this field.  The speaker will address both classical tomographic modalities, such as x-ray computed tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, electrical impedance tomography, ultrasound tomography, and optical tomography, and novel hybrid methods currently being developed, such as thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography, magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography, acousto-electric tomography, acousto-optical tomography, and magnetic resonance elastography.</AbstractNarration>
