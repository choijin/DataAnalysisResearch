<AbstractNarration>The International Conference for Supercomputing (ICS) brings together experts from diverse fields, including parallel application writers, libraries and tools developers, compiler developers, computer architects, and programming languages experts. The conference solicits papers  on all aspects of research, development, and application of large-scale, high-performance experimental and commercial systems. In 2011 the conference will be held May 31 - June 4, 2011  in Tucson,  Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to offer up to 10 NSF-sponsored student travel and junior faculty (without travel support) grants for a total budget of $10,000. Applications will be solicited via email mailing lists, personal contacts, and the conference web site. The selection process will consider the applicant?s level of participation in ICS, followed by how closely the student?s research interests match areas covered by ICS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was awarded to fund domestic travel for students to attend the 25th International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS), held May 31st to June 4th, in Tucson, Arizona.  The monies enabled funding a total of 15 graduate students from various universities in the US to travel for the conference.  The students included one female student and one student from underrepresented minority (Latino).  All the funded students were co-authors on papers (either at the main conference or an associated workshop) or posters at the conference.  All, except one, were also presenters of their paper or poster, at the conference.  The funding helped students get exposure to a highly reputed international conference in high performance computing and gain experience in making formal presentations before a group of experts.  A total of 31 students applied for travel support.  Preference was given based on the minority status (preferred) and years in program (junior students preferred).  In the end all 31 were offered some support.  Of these, 14 were supported fully by the NSF travel grant, eight were supported by a grant from ACM SIGARCH, and one was supported partially by NSF and ACM.  Four students either refused support or changed their plans and did not attend the conference.  The grant made it possible to maintain a high level of travel support for domestic students.
