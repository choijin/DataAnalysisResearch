<AbstractNarration>This Track 1 project is a proof-of-concept initiative to assess the effectiveness of a Native American geosciences education system modeled on a successful Native American Business Administration (NABA) curriculum that has built native student participation and success at Idaho State University.   This system focuses on native-focused mentorship, tutoring and tribal community coordination and facilitation.  Coordinated through the Indigenous Nations Institute (INI), this geosciences education and outreach project is developing effective educational engagement between Idaho State University and Tribal Colleges and their geosciences programs, focusing on collaborations with geoscience professionals at Stone Child College and Great Basin College, as well as with regional Tribal communities including the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes and Northwestern Band of Shoshone Nation.  In these engagements, the project is recruiting three highly qualified and motivated students for geosciences training and education at Idaho State University.  Students are receiving ongoing dialog and mentorship from INI native professionals and geoscience advisors, as well as robust tutoring in key technical course work.  With support from INI, the students act as ambassadors to their Tribal communities and colleges to promote increased awareness and opportunities in geoscience education.   Principal goals of this project are to implement and assess the effectiveness of the NABA Model for geoscience education, and to increase awareness of about the geosciences in Indian Country.   Expected outcomes of this project include validation of the NABA student success model for geoscience education, creating a framework for a new Native American geoscience education center of excellence, developing collaborative education relationships with Tribal Colleges, and creating increased awareness of the geosciences among Native American students and communities, as well as career opportunities that are available in the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to address the disproportionate lack of participation by Native American students and their communities in the geosciences, including a lack of awareness of the relevance of the field to their cultural framework and the spectrum of career opportunities that the geosciences can offer.   The original objectives of this project were to (i) assess the viability of a geoscience mentorship and student success model previously demonstrated to be highly effective in business education, (ii) recruit three top Native American undergraduate students via a scholarship program to attend Idaho State University with Geology as a major, and (iii) develop a student-led public awareness campaign directed to Native American students that highlights the relevance of the geosciences to their communities and the career options that area available.  Despite a succession of unforeseen obstacles, including the departure of the project's Principal Investigator to lead the First Nations University in Canada and the tragic passing of its Co-Principal Investigator less than two years later, objective (ii) and parts of objective (i) and (iii) were realized.  However, it became apparent to the non-Native project personnel who remained to direct the program at that point, that Native leadership was essential if the program were to realize substantive successes. To this end, the project's objectives were re-evaluated and modified in Year 5, in order to assist with the creation of a new mentorship and student success model being developed by one of our original project collaborators, Dr. Larry Murillo, a registered member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes in Idaho.   Dr. Murillo's concept behind the Tribal Learning Center (TLC) is based on multiple strategies to engage, retain, and stimulate academic success in Native American students and to develop pathways for future success and professional growth:  &bull; Education motivated by success &ndash; a foundation for engaging students and for promoting economic development within their communities  &bull; Incorporating cultural values &ndash; a framework for grounding STEM curricula in the real world  &bull; Develop career pathways &ndash; a means to grow and maintain interpersonal and inter-tribal professional, entrepreneurial and academic networks that encourage students to contribute to their communities? economic development from within and outside the workforce.  &bull; Tribal college development &ndash; to promote, expand and network with technical organizations that can work in collaboration with the TLC to build on its K-12 academic mission.  These revisions to the original OEDG project objectives, as approved by NSF for Year 5 and 6 no-cost extensions, have provided technical, academic and limited financial support directed toward the establishment of the Tribal Learning Center's initial program objective to adapt the Alaska Native Student Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) teaching model to Idaho. By introducing students to college-preparatory STEM course work at the middle-school and high school levels, the goal is to build self-confidence through academic excellence and thereby maximize success at the college / university level. With its focus on building motivation via academic success, coupled with a culturally-inspired curriculum, the TLC approach exposes Native students of all aptitudes to careers and professional-development pathways they may not have been aware of, either in the geosciences or in other STEM fields.  Specific outcomes from our project's financial assistance in support of the fledgling Tribal Learning Center, include:  (1) a four-person site visit to observe a session of ANSEP's Middle-School Academy and learn from its organizers;  (2) a $10,000 donation secured from the Idaho National; Laboratory's STEM-development program;  (3) preparation of an application for 501.c.3 non-profit status; and  (4) a detailed business / organizational plan created by Dr. Manley Begay, Applied Indigenous Studies Department, Northern Arizona University.  Dr. Begay's business plan includes articles of incorporation, bylaws, and program objectives to guide the TLC's phased development. Its first-year objectives are:   &bull; Contract two development professionals and one public relations staff member for the start-up  &bull; Create development and marketing strategies  &bull; Cultivate fundraising sources (primarily from Tribal, industry, and private sources nation-wide) with the goal of securing $1M to launch the program  &bull; Increase donor list funding to $2M in years 2-3  &bull; Create an endowment fund to maintain stability of the Tribal Learning Center  &bull; Recruit / hire /train 15 professionals and staff in preparation to launch the program  &bull; Recruit 50 students for an inaugural 10-week middle school-level summer program.
