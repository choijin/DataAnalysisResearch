<AbstractNarration>Black carbon (BC) in snow and ice has been identified as one of the largest uncertainties in estimates of global radiative forcing for climate change. In this project artificial snowpacks will be made by freezing of water droplets produced by a snowmaking machine in an open field, using water with and without added quantities of a commercial soot, in concentrations about 100 times natural soot levels so as to obtain a large signal on albedo. The reason for conducting the experiment outdoors rather than in a laboratory is to obtain uniform illumination, to avoid elimination of edge-effects, and to be able to measure albedo rather than narrow-field-of-view reflectance. The optically effective snow grain size will be determined from the measured near-infrared albedo; matching the measured visible albedo will then require addition of BC to the radiative transfer model. The BC content of the artificial snowpacks will be measured by filtering the meltwater; the filters will be analyzed by a laboratory spectrophotometer as is done for filters from samples of natural snow. The BC from the filter measurement will be compared to that inferred from the albedo measurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of experiments will be carried out, varying (a) the type of soot, to investigate different size distributions; (b) the amount of soot, to investigate the nonlinearity of albedo reduction; and (c) the grain size of the artificial snow, because the albedo reduction by a given concentration of soot is predicted to be greater in coarse-grained snow than in fine-grained snow. In conjunction with the experiments, parameterizations will be developed for use in climate models, using soot properties consistent with the experimental results. For models that resolve layers of the surface snow, single-scattering quantities will be parameterized for three spectral bands. For models in which snow albedo is a specified lower boundary condition for the atmospheric model, average albedos will be computed as functions of snow grain size and BC concentration, for the two broad bands commonly used in general circulation models (GCMs), as well as the total solar albedo, for incident solar spectra under both clear sky and cloudy sky. Simple analytical functions will be fit to the model results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work are in the potential to advance our understanding of the radiative forcing of BC in snow and its climatic consequences and to improve the representation of this process in models used for climate and mitigation studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Small light-absorbing particles of black carbon (BC) are produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels or biomass.  The particles are often carried for several days by the atmosphere before being removed in raindrops or snow crystals.  Computer calculations indicate that even small amounts of BC (several parts-per-billion) can reduce the albedo (reflectivity) of snow significantly. The result is a warmer snowpack, earlier snowmelt, and warmer air near the snow. Climatically-significant concentrations of BC are found in snow throughout the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.  However, the predictions of reduced snow albedo have been based solely on computer calculations, which include some uncertain assumptions.  Experimental verification of these calculations is therefore desirable.         In natural snow the albedo reduction by BC is at most a few percent, and even with accurate measurements, attribution of the albedo reduction is ambiguous because snow albedo depends on other variables as well, particularly snow grain size.  In this project artificial snowpacks were made by freezing of water droplets produced by a snowmaking machine in an open field, using water with and without added quantities of BC, in concentrations about 100 times that typically found in midlatitude snow, so as to obtain a large signal.  The BC content of the artificial snowpacks was measured by filtering the meltwater; the filters were analyzed by a laboratory spectrophotometer.  The BC from the filter measurement was compared to that inferred from the albedo measurement; they agreed within the measurement uncertainty.        In conjunction with the experiments, parameterizations were developed for use in climate models, using BC properties consistent with the experimental results.  Average albedos were computed as functions of snow grain size and the concentrations of BC and mineral dust, for two broad wavelength bands commonly used in climate models, as well as for the total solar albedo, for incident solar spectra under both clear sky and cloudy sky.  Simple analytical functions were fitted to the model results.  The albedo &shy;&shy;reduction by BC is less if the snow contains dust, a common situation on mountain glaciers and in agricultural and grazing lands.  The effect of dust on snow albedo at visible wavelengths can be represented by an "equivalent BC" amount, scaled down by a factor of about 200.        Observational data on vertical profiles of light-absorbing impurities and snow density were then used, together with computer model calculations, to quantify the albedo reductions over large regions of the Northern Hemisphere.  The albedo reduction is muted for the situation of thin snow, which is common in the Arctic, in Inner Mongolia, and in the U.S. Great Plains.  The different contributions to lowering of albedo relative to pure deep snow by (a) finite depth, (b) BC, and (c) non-BC impurities (principally mineral dust and organic carbon) were quantified.        Albedo differences were computed to show how the effect of BC on albedo is smaller if the snowpack is thin or if non-BC absorbers are also present.  The sensitivities of snow albedo were examined across each of three regions (North America, China, Arctic).  The impact on snow albedo of biases in snow thickness and impurity concentrations were quantified using sensitivity studies to mimic the possible range of scenarios in different climate models.  The importance of taking into account the spatial variability of snow depth was assessed by comparing the area-average albedo computed for the distribution of depths with that computed for the average depth; it turned out that use of the average depth caused only small errors within the studied region.        In addition to these project outcomes, personnel on this project also (1) contributed to a comprehensive review of BC in the climate system, (2) assessed the difficulty of detecting BC in snow by remote sensing, (3) identified several contributors to the ongoing darkening of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and (4) modeled the effect of snow grain shape on snow albedo.  Broader impact:        The results of this work will increase the reliability of climate-model assessments of the radiative forcing of BC in snow and its climatic consequences.  Because the assessments will be more robust, they will be useful to policymakers designing strategies for mitigation of global warming.        The project supported the Ph.D. work of a graduate student.  Results of the research were incorporated into the curricula for undergraduate and graduate courses on climate, glaciology, and radiative transfer.
