<AbstractNarration>This award supports a new international collaboration between Prof. Eduardo Soto-Bustamante at the University of Chile and the Principal Investigator at the University of Maryland, College Park. The project is focused on studying the interactions of nanoparticles or nanorods with polymer liquid crystals. Specifically it will address the question on whether the ordering of the liquid crystals depends on how the liquid crystal polymer is formed and whether it can be independent of the nanoparticle arrangement. Possible applications of the products are in various technologies, including photovoltaics electro-optics, and in medicine.&lt;br/&gt; The project aims to combine the strengths of the participating researchers.  The principal investigator and her group are experienced in studying the interaction of liquid crystals and nanoparticles, measurements of their electrical and magnetic properties, and structural characterization of these composites. Prof. Eduardo Soto-Bustamante, from the University of Chile, is a chemist who specializes in the synthesis of ferroelectric liquid crystals and polymeric liquid crystals, and is interested in including nanoparticles into polymeric liquid crystals to investigate their applications. &lt;br/&gt; This project will expose the participating students to part of the larger international community involved in liquid crystal research. The students will learn how to communicate between different disciplines, including materials science, physics, and chemistry. The collaboration will expand the reach of the PI?s international collaborations, and will increase the diversity in her group.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award was obtained to organize a series of visits to the University of Chile, with the purpose of starting a collaboration between Prof. Eduardo A. Soto-Bustamante from the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharm. Sciences at the University of Chile in Santiago, Chile and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, USA. The purpose was to observe and study the interactions of azo-liquid crystal polymers with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles for future applications in photovoltaics. Two monomers were tested: M6R8, which polymerizes and I6R8, which does not. Both are azo-compounds and have a preferred group to attach to the nanoparticles via hydrogen bonds, as shown in Figure 1. The liquid crystal polymers were obtained by the process of electropolymerization with the nanoparticles already included in the mixture.This process can produce polymeric materials with a high degree of alignment. The liquid crystals were measured both before and after the polymer was formed. In forming the polymer, the nanoparticle seemed to migrate from the end of the polymer to the center part of the liquid crystal, which is rich in double bonds available for charge transfer. This is shown in Figure&nbsp; 2. This migration was confirmed via X-ray scattering, by comparing both monomers to the resulting polymer, as shown in Figure 3. This project is international in nature, and allowed the PI to expand her interactions to South America. In addition to the work on the liquid crystals, she was able to to teach two minicourses, one in nanocomposites and the other on techniques of X-ray Scattering. The second was based in a course she teaches at the University of Maryland. She served in one of her collaborator&rsquo;s student&rsquo;s thesis committees. &nbsp;Both she and her collaborator have presented the results of this work in two international meetings and she has been able to present it at invited talks in Argentina, Chile, and Germany.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/04/2014<br>      Modified by: Luz&nbsp;J&nbsp;Martinez-Miranda</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2014/1157589/1157589_10197167_1415110156938_FIgure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2014/1157589/1157589_10197167_1415110156938_FIgure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Monomers with nanoparticle attached"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2014/1157589/1157589_10197167_1415110156938_FIgure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Monomers with nanoparticle attached"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
