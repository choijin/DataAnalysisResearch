<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop, implement and evaluate problem-based (PB) laboratory experiments linked to process-oriented guided-inquiry learning (POGIL) activities for student learning of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in analytical and physical chemistry. The POGIL activities focus on student understanding of key IR spectroscopic concepts.  The PB laboratory experiments provide students with hands-on opportunities to explore fundamental techniques and measurements, including attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy, as well as investigate advanced topics such as the characterization of surfaces. The FTIR with ATR accessory acquired through this grant is available for Agnes Scott College's undergraduate research program.&lt;br/&gt;                &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project stems from the development and evaluation of new materials that integrate active-learning in-class activities and problem-based laboratories. Self-contained modules are designed to be used in any upper-level undergraduate course utilizing active learning methods to study FTIR spectroscopy. All activities and laboratory experiments are peer reviewed and classroom tested, which adds to the strength of the evaluation plan. &lt;br/&gt;                &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact includes the development of novel resources for upper-level undergraduate courses for any practitioner wishing to use active learning methods to study FTIR spectroscopy and/or fundamental principles illustrated by FTIR spectroscopy. Materials are disseminated on the POGIL website, a national repository for curricular materials employing this pedagogy, and through publications and workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focuses on developing new active-learning curriculum materials for upper-level undergraduates to enhance student understanding of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, an important technique used in qualitative and quantitative analysis of samples.  The materials utilize problem-based learning (PBL) and process-oriented guided-inquiry learning (POGIL) pedagogies to guide student learning about the instrument as well as various physical properties that can be measured using this technique.   The analytical chemistry POGIL activities (1) introduce the FTIR instrument?s components and require students to compare and contrast the instrument with an UV/Vis absorption spectrometer, and (2) lead students to a conceptual understanding of how attenuated total reflection (ATR) is used to obtain FTIR spectra. The physical chemistry modules integrate in-class POGIL activities with PBL laboratory experiments.  The first module is an adaptation of a traditional laboratory that studies vibrational/rotational spectra of diatomic molecules such as HCl and DCl and requires students? to predict how vibrational frequencies are affected by reduced mass and bond strength in-class and then test their hypotheses given well-chosen molecules in gas and liquid phases in lab.  The second module uses the novel ATR accessory of the FTIR instrument to study the kinetics of the interaction of biological molecules with nanoparticles, an important topic the field of nanotoxicity.  In addition, a PBL analytical laboratory has been created to investigate the presence of artificial sweeteners (ASWs) in ground or surface water, a potential environmental issue due to the failure of ASW?s to be effectively removed from wastewater before it is released back into our streams and rivers. Students investigate the detection limits and linear range of ASWs in reagent-grade water and then determine the amount of ASW in a given ground/surface water sample.  These materials add to the body of peer-reviewed, in-class POGIL activities that have been developed for analytical and physical chemistry.  They also provide students with inquiry-based laboratory experiences linked to in-class activities that help students make important connections and develop their investigative skills and expertise.
