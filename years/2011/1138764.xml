<AbstractNarration>Dr. Dorothy Zolandz and Dr. Katherine W Bowman of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences is supported by the Division of Chemistry, the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Division of Materials Research of the NSF to convene a study to assess the importance and impact of glycomics and glycosciences research and the status of such research in the U.S.  It will examine strategies to enhance or develop the workforce, tools, and capabilities needed to advance glycosciences and glycomics in order to build on knowledge from genomics and proteomics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rapidly increasing amount of research is being undertaken on glycobiology and glycochemistry, and many of the techniques and lessons applied to one cell type and system may be applicable to the study of others.  The fields are poised to benefit from the development of a strategic vision for glycoscience and glycomics that crosses boundaries of funding agencies and research fields, including tools for characterization and analysis, databases and data management, and other fundamental infrastructure.  The proposed activity will advance US research in areas such as the conversion of biomass to fuel, biomass for material application, and cell-cell communication and recognition.  The proposed activity will also help build the infrastructure for chemical, biological, and materials research.</AbstractNarration>

This capability will broaden access of glycoscience data to the entire scientific community.  Glycoenzymes An expanded toolbox of enzymes and enzyme inhibitors would help scientists produce, degrade, and study the function of glycans of interest, driving progress in many areas of science.
