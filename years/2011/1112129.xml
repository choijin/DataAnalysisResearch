<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor Melikyan of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University-Northridge to study the behavior of organic free radicals and cations being supported on a metal-organic species.  Specifically, the PI will continue his work on propargyl systems in which the triple bond is "capped" by a cobalt hexacarbonyl group, to study how these "protected" propargylic systems can be manipulated for new bond constructions at the formal radical or cationic center.   Among the major research objectives are the development of sequential alpha,alpha'-functionalization of polyunsaturated systems and the exploration of intramolecular radical cyclizations yielding topologically diverse carbo- and heterocyclic compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts involve training a cadre of undergraduate co-workers in modern organometallic synthesis methods, and broadening participation through the inclusion of members of groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.  Plans are included to integrate the research results and methodology into the chemistry curriculum, and to widely disseminate research results via publication in main line sub-disciplinary journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[PROJECT  OUTCOMES  REPORT  FOR  THE  GENERAL  PUBLIC PI: Professor Gagik Melikyan Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, California State University Northridge (CSUN) RUI: Novel Radical and Ionic Reactions in Cobalt-Alkyne Series NSF award: CHE #1112129  The NSF-funded project titled "Novel Radical and Ionic Reactions in Cobalt-Alkyne Series" allowed us to advance knowledge in the scarcely studied field of organometallic radical chemistry. Novel reactions, concepts, strategies, and synthetic algorithms have been discovered, tested, developed, evaluated, and widely disseminated. Throughout the history of organic chemistry, radical propargyl chemistry has never been a "method of choice" for synthetic chemists given their inherent limitations and poor selectivity parameters. Now, due to NSF funding (2011-2015), the field of transition metal-mediated radical chemistry, in particular, chemistry of propargyl systems can successfully rival ionic reactions by the level of chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity. The PIÃ†s latest review in the ACS-published journal "Accounts of Chemical Research" titled "Propargyl Radical Chemistry: Renaissance Instigated by Metal Coordination," further highlights the level of fundamental transition that this research area has gone through over the last several years.  The support of the NSF allowed the PI to significantly increase the productivity of his group by completing 8 papers and publishing them in the reputable, peer-reviewed journals, such as Organometallics. Other research products include the PIÃ†s presentations at the ACS national meetings (7), the PIÃ†s presentations at the academic institutions (3), chairing sessions at the ACS national meetings (4), undergraduate and graduate student presentations at the local, state, regional, and national conferences (23), undergraduate and graduate students awards (11), and graduate MS theses (2). The PI was also heavily involved in the public outreach effort, delivering 23 presentations for the general public, making radio (9) and TV (3) appearances in an ongoing effort to educate the public with respect to the toxicity of chemicals that their bodies are exposed to on a daily basis.  Scientifically, among the most notable achievements are the following:  (1) for the first time, propargyl cations were synthesized in the absence of strong acids, thus increasing the functional tolerance and achieving a long sought after compatibility with acid-sensitive functionalities (Image 1);  (2) the new concept of "sequestered" propargyl radicals was introduced to explain disparity in diastereoselectivity in radical coupling reactions;  (3) the first radical reaction of propargyl acetals in organic chemistry was reported (Image 2);  (4) the novel, highly efficient method for the syntheses of compounds with contiguous quaternary carbon atoms was developed (Image 3);  (5) over the last four decades, the first radical reaction of 1,4-diynes was reported (Image 4);  (6) the novel phenomenon of "chiralization by metal complexation" was discovered and the new term was introduced.  The NSF-funded research and scientific achievements thus acquired represent not only contributions to the field of chemistry, but also to adjacent fields such as medicinal chemistry, materials science, computational chemistry, natural product syntheses, and analytical chemistry. Novel methods and methodologies for controlling radical reactions will allow us, and others, to (1) develop novel therapeutic means for treatment of crippling diseases such as cancer; (2) conduct targeted syntheses of drug candidates and lead optimizations; (3) create libraries of biologically and enzymatically active compounds; (4) develop new fundamental concepts of the reaction site projection; (5) characterize conceptually novel types of reactive intermediates; (6) expand parent reactions toward new types of unsaturated structural units (dienes, arenes, diynes, enynes) and transition metals (iron, chromium, molybdenu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
