<AbstractNarration>Dr. Zinn and his team study the accretion history of the halo of the Milky Way galaxy. This work tests the accretion paradigm and the dual halo picture. If the halo was built up over billions of years through the accretion and tidal disruption of many dwarf satellite galaxies, it will contain streams of stars from disrupted galaxies that are detectable as regions of enhanced stellar density (halo substructures) and as stars moving together through space. The outer halo may consist primarily of stars from tidally destroyed satellite galaxies, whereas the inner halo may have originated in situ from accreted gas or within the very first objects that merged to form the Galaxy. It is recognized that the halo has two major components that differ in stellar kinematics, spatial distribution, and metallicity distribution. However only a small fraction of the halo has been surveyed, and properties of some known halo substructures are poorly determined. The different sub-structures and streams in the halo are traceable with RR Lyrae stars. These pulsating stars are easily recognized by their half-day periods and about one magnitude amplitudes. This research will provide better distances and sizes of previously detected halo substructures and look for new substructures in yet to be surveyed areas of the sky. This work uses RR Lyrae stars found in the LaSilla-QUEST survey up to about 60 kpc from the Sun. Spectroscopic observations are used to identify if suspected substructures are real groups of co-moving stars, as expected for remains of accreted satellite galaxies. Radial velocities and metallicities are measured for about 150 RR Lyrae stars in the inner halo to test whether RR Lyrae stars separate into two components, or are instead concentrated in the accreted halo. This project trains graduate and undergraduate students in the techniques of optical photometry and spectroscopy. As part of the outreach activities, a show on the evolution of the Milky Way galaxy will be created for Yale's Leitner Family Observatory and Planetarium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spiral galaxies, such the Milky Way, are enveloped in roughly spherical halos of very low stellar density, which extend to typically 10 times the radii of their disks.  Through primarily observations of the stellar halo of the Milky Way and computer simulations of galaxy formation, a paradigm for the formation of stellar halos has been developed in the past few decades.  According to this accretion paradigm, the halo of the Milky Way was built up over billions of years by the tidal destruction of dwarf satellite galaxies, and the number of destroyed dwarf galaxies may number in the hundreds.  The major trust of this NSF funded project was to look in greater detail for evidence of this dwarf galaxy accretion.     The largest part of this project entailed a search of the Milky Way halo for RR Lyrae variable stars.  RR Lyrae stars are roughly 10 billion year old stars that are about 100 times more luminous than the Sun.  They pulsate with very regular periods of about 0.5 day and have light amplitudes of from 0.3 to 1.2 magnitudes.   Because of the characteristics of their light variations, they are easily recognized by making 15 or more observations spaced out in time.  RR Lyrae stars have the very important property that their mean luminosities are well-known and vary very little from star to star.  Thus, RR Lyrae variables are excellent "standard candles", whose observed brightness can be immediately translated into distance.  As part of this NSF project, approximately one-quarter of the sky was searched for these variables, and more than 5000 were discovered.  Hundreds of these stars are more than 200,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way, where relatively few of these stars were known previously.   Our catalogue of RR Lyrae stars is being used to search for evidence of stellar streams and clouds in the halo.  These "over-densities" are predicted to exist by the theoretical simulations of the tidal destruction of dwarf galaxies, and indeed several of them have been previously discovered.  Our new survey for RR Lyrae stars has provided so far improved information on the so-called Virgo Over Density (VOD) and the Pisces stellar stream, and it has provided a catalogue of the RR Lyrae variables in the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way which will ultimately undergo tidal destruction.       As a follow up to the RR Lyrae survey, spectroscopic observations of more than 200 stars in the VOD were measured for radial velocity.  The stars making up a real halo over-density will have nearly the same value of radial velocity.  Consequently, measurements of radial velocity allow one to separate real structures from chance coincidences in distance.  Our spectroscopic observations have shown that the VOD is not one large structure, but is made up instead of several apparently unrelated stellar streams.      The most luminous satellite galaxies of the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies contain massive star clusters that are called "globular clusters".  The properties of some of the globular clusters in the halo of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, M31, strongly suggest that they formed in satellite galaxies that were tidally disrupted.   Computer simulations suggest that a small fraction of the globular clusters that originated in destroyed satellites will be placed on very large orbits that will take them far from the major galaxies in the "Local Group", the Milky Way and M31.  These hypothetical clusters are called "Intergalactic Globular Clusters" (IGCs), and their discovery would be a powerful confirmation of the accretion paradigm.   The very first survey for IGCs in the Local Group of galaxies was conducted as part of this NSF project on halo substructures.  Only candidate IGCs were found in a survey of roughly one-third of the sky, which indicates that IGCs must be rarely formed.  More than 20 new globular cluster in M31 were discovered during this survey, and several of them are among the most distant ones from the center of M31.           The current outcomes of this NSF project has provided new information on the accretion paradigm for the formation of stellar halos around large galaxies such as the Milky Way.  The data that have been acquired will be the starting point for several more investigations in the years to come on the stellar halos of the Milky Way, M31, and the constituents of the Local Group.
