<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ross Sea is believed to contributes a huge portion (~1/3)  of the primary productivity of the Southern Ocean and is home to a similar large portion of the top predators (e.g. 38% of Adelie, 28% of Emperor penguins) of the Antarctic sea ice ecosystem. The trophic pathways in this system are complex in both space and time. One scenario for the Ross Sea ecosystem is that diatoms are grazed by krill, which are in turn the preferred food of fish, penguins and other predators. Phaeocystis colonies, on the other hand lead to grazing by pteropods and other organisms that are a non-favoured food source for top predators. Remotely sensed chlorophyll, indicating all phytoplankton, is then suggested to be a relatively poor predictor of penguin foraging efforts. This is also consistent with notion that algal species composition is very important to penguin grazing pressure, mediated by krill, and perhaps resulting in selective depletion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative research sets out to use an autonomous glider, equipped with a range of sensors, and informed by satellite chlorophyll imagery to be combined with 3-dimenisonal active penguin tracking to their preferred foraging sites. The effect of localized grazing pressure of krill on the appearance and disappearance of algal blooms will also be followed. Overall the objective of the research is to reconcile and explain several years of the study of the foraging habits and strategies of (top predator) penguins at the Cape Crozier site (Ross Island), with the dynamics of krill and their supporting algal food webs. The use of a glider to answer a primarily ecological questions is subject to moderate to high risk, and is potentially transformative.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Marine food webs are structured or organized by top-down (predation) and bottom-up (production) forces, but while bottom-up processes are often studied the effects of predation in open-water systems have rarely been assessed. It is much easier to determine how much food there is than it is to assess how predators change the availability of their prey either by consuming it or chasing it out of reach. In the Ross Sea, Antarctica, we used an acoustically equipped autonomous glider (a 3m long torpedo with wings that propells itself, and possesses a recording 'fish finder') to assess changes in the preyscape and environment; that is,  availability of crystal krill and silverfish, the two main prey species of penguins and whales in that area. The glider was controlled via satellite link from a location in the USA, as its position was continually plotted on a chart showing the coast and sea ice (we didn't want it to crash into the beach, nor become lost under an iceberg or sea ice). At the same time, miniature satellite-linked time-depth recorders were attached to Ad&eacute;lie penguins, which along with censuses of co-foraging cetaceans, assessed foraging pressure (depth and distance from the colony). Simultaneously the glider also assessed food availability for the prey species, using chlorophyll concentration as a proxy, i.e. the krill fed on diatoms. Our results indicated that this is "wasp-waist" food web, apparently controlled in the middle food web levels by the availability of krill and fish. While there was more than enough food for krill and fish to eat, their depth and abundance were uncoupled from the phytoplankton, but were strongly altered by the level of predation. This was a collaborative effort among engineers, biological oceanographers and wildlife ecologists; several beginning investigators were involved.<strong></strong></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/17/2015<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Ainley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1141948/1141948_10209351_1442442757704_m11394AinleyFApic--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1141948/1141948_10209351_1442442757704_m11394AinleyFApic--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Foraging penguins and autonomous glider"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1141948/1141948_10209351_1442442757704_m11394AinleyFApic--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Foraging penguins and autonomous glider"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An autonomous glider, here poised off Ross Island, was used to quantify how the level of predator (penguin, whale) foraging altered the availability of their krill and fish prey.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ainley, Smith</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Ainley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Foraging penguins and autonomous glider</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
