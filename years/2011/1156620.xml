<AbstractNarration>This award supports an international Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site which will bring 8 undergraduates to Paris each summer to conduct collaborative researc with faculty at the University of Michigan's Center for Ultrafast Optical Sciences (CUOS) and several Parisian research institutions: Ecole Polytechnique, Ecole Nationale de Techniques Avancées (ENSTA), the Institut d'Optique Graduate School, Université Paris-Sud 11, and Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan. The students will be put into research teams that include the student, a faculty member at UM and a faculty member in one of the Parisian institutions. The students will spend one week in Ann Arbor followed by 9 weeks in Paris. Each student will keep weekly on-line research diaries to aid in communication. The research in all projects will involve the use of ultrafast lasers to discover very current, state-of-the art phenomena in a wide range of fields including relativistic optics, plasma physics, materials spectroscopy, nano-machining, art restoration and conservation, patterned biological cell templating, high power fiber lasers, plasma x-ray sources, dynamics of nano-magnetic materials, terahertz imaging,  biomedical imaging with shaped pulses, fatigue life studies of materials, and similar projects.  The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project outcomes  Intellectual Merit:  Students gain a deep understanding of what research is like at a World class laboratory Students learn what research is like outside of the United States in a European Union nation, France.   Broader Impacts:  Students are immersed in a diverse group to navigate a foreign culture. Students from schools where research is not the primary focus are given a chance to conduct research at the highest levels with World class researchers Fifty students have had an opportunity to work in a world class research laboratory in France for 2 months during the past four years.  The vast majority (84%) of the students are either in graduate school or plan to attend graduate school soon. 50% of the participants were women, 24% of the students were underrepresented minorities, and 80% of the students attend undergraduate schools where research is not a primary focus of their programs.    Each year students travel to Ann Arbor for the first week of the program to attend an optics boot camp, get safety training, attend a Responsible Conduct of Research and Scholarship Program, participate in an acculturation program and spend time with each other before traveling to France.   The travel to France Friday evening with a faculty member from UM and spend the weekend in Paris dealing with jet lag and learning how to navigate the Paris Metro and find great food.  The faculty member takes them to the labs of their research mentors on the next  Monday and Tuesday.  The students maintain electronic blogs during their 2 months of research in Paris and are visited the last week of the program by the PI of the grant.  Students give presentations and exit interviews to the PI and discussions with the French administrators are held to prepare for next yearÆs program.  The PI also talks to the French research mentors if they are still in town.                Last Modified: 06/27/2016       Submitted by: Steven M Yalisove]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
