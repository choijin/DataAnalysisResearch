<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program and the Chemical Measurements and Imaging Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation support Professor Dennis Lichtenberger of the University of Arizona, for photoelectron spectroscopy studies of Fe-S clusters as related to solar fuels (H2) production.  The goal of this work is to understand the fundamental principles of electron transfer reactions of such catalysts, synthesized in the PI's laboratory and in others.  Evaluation of Marcus theory parameters for these reactions will lead to a better understanding of catalyst structure and function at the molecular level, and develop criteria for higher efficiency solar fuels generators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include driving innovation in solar energy applications, and contributing to scientific infrastructure by developing next-generation instrumentation and methods for photoelectron spectroscopy of large molecules.  The Lichtenberger laboratory will provide access to these capabilities for other researchers, and develop curricula for undergraduate education. This laboratory has had significant success in recruiting undergraduate students, women, and underrepresented minorities into the program, including those from the Hispanic and Native American populations in the Tucson area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  One of the grand challenges facing society today is to discover the basis for an energy economy that is efficient, clean, cost-effective, and sustainable. Sunlight is our ultimate source of energy and this energy has been caught and collected over geologic time in combustible fossil fuels (i.e. oil, natural gas and coal) that currently account for the vast majority of our energy consumption, but with well-known drawbacks.

This project seeks an understanding and approach to optimization of these electron transfer processes through unique probes of the energetics associated with the mechanisms and dynamics of electron transfer catalysis at the level of molecular geometric and electronic structure.  The initial focus of this project was on compounds containing the butterfly [2Fe-2S] cluster core as inspired by this cluster in the active sites of [FeFe]hydrogenase enzymes that produce molecular hydrogen in Nature.  We have produced synthetic catalysts containing this butterfly core structure that (1) produce hydrogen 1000 times faster than the [FeFe]hydrogenase enzymes based on the amount of iron, and one million times more efficiently based on mass, (2) use weak acids with 16 orders of magnitude less driving force than the strong acids required by most other synthetic catalysts, and (3) operate at lower voltages ("overpotential") than other catalysts, and in some cases the same voltages as the expensive platinum used in commercial electrocatalysis.
