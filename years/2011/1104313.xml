<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for "Micro-Submersible Lake Exploration Device (MSLED)- Development of first-generation propelled slim-hole device for subglacial lake (&amp; aquatic environments) exploration" from the Antarctic Integrated System Science within the Office of Polar Programs. Subglacial environments represent one of the last unexplored habitats on Earth. To get to subglacial environments one must first drill through the ice. Drill holes are typically limited in diameter to approximately 30 cm (~ten inches), and all subglacial explorations are currently limited to slim equipment that will remain directly beneath the drill hole.  The proposed MSLED will be the only piece of equipment to "swim" away from the hole in a subglacial environment, thus greatly increasing the range of exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The award provides funding for development of a swimming camera and sensor platform that is small enough to be deployed down a slim borehole. The MSLED will have a camera, and also be equipped with a limited suite of chemical sensors to include temperature, salinity, pH, and pressure. While the current award is only for development and initial field testing of the MSLED through the sea ice, it is envisioned that the MSLED will be very useful for recent projects that NSF has funded within the Pine Island Glacier and Whillans Ice Stream areas.  Understanding subglacial dynamics in the Antarctic is critical for improving predictive models of land-ice loss that in turn is critical for understanding how fast sea level may rise in the next century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Exploring new environments has great inherent interest.  Cameras are a great tool to provide a quick look at totally unexplored locations, and imagery from such explorations is a great way to engage the public. The development of the MSLED draws heavily on design contributions from students (both graduate and undergraduate), and will bring a student to Antarctica.</AbstractNarration>
