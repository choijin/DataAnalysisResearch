<AbstractNarration>The current ways of assessing the impacts of climate change on watershed systems are inadequate: they are based on ad hoc selection of climate models; they focus on metrics at very coarse scales detached from the reality of human activities and ecosystem services at the local (often the stream reach or floodplain) scales; and they do not yield any assessment of uncertainty associated with watershed modeling and projections into the future. This research will bridge the multi-scale, space-time connectivity of watershed systems and address uncertainty associated with their predictions through a comprehensive program of inter-disciplinary modeling and field observations and outdoor, lecture, and lab educational activities. The project will focus on the state of Michigan, where a number of observed metrics already demonstrate trends consistent with a warming climate, including shorter winters, higher mean annual temperatures, and higher frequency of heavy precipitation events. In the research component of the project, a number of case studies will be developed throughout the state along the south-southeast ? north-northwest climatic, hydrologic, and agricultural activities gradient. In addition to a synthesis of a large array of existing data sets, in situ monitoring of climatic forcing and characteristics of flow regime will be carried out to provide data for model evaluation. Multi-model ensembles of climate change projections from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project will be downscaled using ?fossil-intensive?, ?mid-?, and ?lower-level? future emission scenarios of carbon dioxide (defined according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The inferred probabilistic information will be used to assess climate change impacts on watershed systems for early (2010?2039), mid- (2040?2069), and late century (2070?2099) periods. Specifically, changes in essential characteristics of hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes will be investigated for the case study basins using a multi-scale, physically-based framework of modeling watershed surface/subsurface processes and flow hydrodynamics, integrated through a capability of Nested Dynamics Modeling. The total uncertainty associated with biases of climate projections and inaccuracies of a watershed model will be quantified. An extensive data set of downscaled climate projections and outputs of hydrologic and hydrodynamic modeling generated in this research will provide a comprehensive volume of information required in climate change compensation and mitigation planning. The outreach component of the project will implement educational activities focusing to enhance the science class program of 7th graders in Title I schools and increase awareness of the consequences of human activities on watershed processes. The emphasis of educational activities of a week-long summer-school will be placed on underserved and underrepresented groups of students of Native American youth of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota tribes. Through the integration of research and outreach programs, the project will benefit the hydrological sciences community, middle-school, undergraduate, and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global climate models are the tools used for exploring how earth?s climate will evolve in future under different scenarios of human activity. Outputs of these models are used in climate impact studies. The typical applications of these studies concern large-scale hydrologic variables for areas of hundreds-to-thousands of square miles; very rarely they can provide the associated uncertainty; currently, there are no studies that can address future impacts on flow hydrodynamic characteristics or floodplain inundation. Yet, most of climate change compensation and mitigation strategies require information that is relevant to scales of human activities and ecosystem services, which typically focus on watersheds, streams, agricultural fields, etc. They also require an estimate of uncertainty associated with projection into the future to make better informed decisions in conditions of climate projection inaccuracies. Responding to these societal needs, this research will use maximum available information on climate change in the form of multi-model projections and develop methodologies that will infer uncertainty of climate change predictions. In contrast to previous studies, the project will synthesize a range of hydrologic/hydrodynamic models and observational data to create capabilities for propagating information on climate signals through the entire watershed system: from headwater (source) areas to stream channels, and to the details of flow characteristics. To ensure that the issues of model applications are addressed specifically and that research findings make a practical impact, case studies will be developed throughout the state of Michigan. Furthermore, this CAREER project will integrate educational activities focusing to enhance the science class program of underserved/underrepresented student groups (low income families and Native Americans) targeting to empower their mind-sets to become future leaders and pursue science and engineering as their career choices</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> This project responded to the need of assessment of climate change and its impacts at scales relevant to human activities and ecosystem services that typically focus on watersheds, streams, agricultural plots, etc. By simultaneously using outputs from many climate models, this research has relied on maximum available information to apply methodologies that infer the uncertainty of climate change projections. We used ensembles of outputs from models that are central to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports to adjust output inaccuracies through a process known as &lsquo;downscaling&rsquo;. Focusing on several case study locations in the state of Michigan and around the world, we quantified climate change signal and partitioned the associated total uncertainty for a range of meteorological variables vital in hydrology and agriculture, highlighting basic science and practical implications.</p> <p>In contrast to previous studies, the project also focused on synthesizing hydrologic and hydrodynamic models and observational data to create capabilities for propagating information on climate signals through the entire watershed system, from headwater areas to stream channels. We developed two variants of a comprehensive model that connects watershed hydrology and stream reach hydraulics as well as permits a description of the processes of hillslope erosion and sediment transport: the TIN-based Real time Integrated Basin Simulator &ndash; Open Flow Model (tRIBS-OFM), and Flow, Erosion and Sediment Transport (tRIBS-FEaST). Using downscaled climate information, we represented conditions of historic and future periods that served as inputs to tRIBS-OFM or tRIBS-FEaST. These climate inputs then followed &ldquo;cascade&rdquo; propagation through modeled watershed and streamflow processes and offered the capability to study how input climate signal and its uncertainty can impact hydrologic outputs.</p> <p>This project also addressed geomorphic response of watershed systems and discovered large uncertainties underlying estimates of erosion from headwater areas. Our research suggested that this was because of inherently high variability of soil erodibility: we used the developed tRIBS-FEaST model to discover that soil initial condition prior to a rainfall event can exert a highly strong control on erodibility. Our research established this to be a current knowledge gap, as all commonly used assessment methods associate site soil loss potential with a single value, ignoring the plausibility of conditions leading to large deviations away from the &ldquo;likeliest expected&rdquo; value. This research contended that a change in erosion assessment paradigm is necessary to shift the focus from the mean characteristic to metrics of probabilistic description of erosion. This research will likely broadly impact the disciplines of hydrologic and agricultural engineering, geomorphology, and soil resource sustainability.</p> <p>To further emphasize the practical aspects of this project, we developed a new vision for the problem of flood forecasting in urban environments. &nbsp;In our latest research, we recognized that the data stream from various remote sensing platforms as well as the development of detailed geospatial databases have offered an unprecedented level of detail for these sensitive flood impact areas. We carried out research that enabled detailed modeling of flood wave propagation in urban environments along with robust and computationally efficient uncertainty quantification. We thus demonstrated that flood assessment is feasible at the street and building scales, and therefore has the potential to be suitable for decision-making during flood propagation through areas of high population density.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> Project participants used conference and seminar series opportunities to inform broader, interdisciplinary community on project approach, and specific accomplishments. &nbsp;The PI convened sessions on related topics at various conferences, including the initiation of a permanent session at the International Conference on Computational Methods in Water Resources. The project has resulted in 13 articles published as a direct consequence of project research, the PI contributed his expertise to 6 other papers in related areas, and over 20 conference presentations were made. We ensured that all project data were shared with the broader community. One paper was highlighted as &ldquo;Featured Article&rdquo; and received the &ldquo;2014 Editor&rsquo;s Choice Best Paper Award&rdquo; in the journal of Water Resources Research.
