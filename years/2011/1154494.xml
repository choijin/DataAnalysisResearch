<AbstractNarration>Allan Hancock College, a Hispanic-serving community college on California's central coast, offers two-year scholarships to STEM students of high academic ability but financial need.  Students in engineering, biology, chemistry, geological science, physics, mathematics or computer science are freed to undertake full-time course loads, and are supported thoroughly to ensure academic success and retention in challenging STEM disciplines through their two years at the college.  Built on a series of NSF- and federally-funded initiatives, the infrastructure is in place to support the scholars and facilitate their transfer to four-year institutions to complete their bachelor's degrees.  Though the students study a wide variety of STEM disciplines, many of the foundational courses are common to several disciplines, so the program has a coherence that supports the student efforts.  Active mentoring, monitoring of progress, and opportunities for networking with professionals in industry and academe are also integral parts of the program.  With scholarship size set to meet most of the demonstrated need, the pipeline of underrepresented minority scientists and engineers is thereby opened wider.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><em>Scholarships in Engineering, Science, Mathematics and Computer Science</em></strong> (SESMC, &ldquo;seismic&rdquo;) was an NSF S-STEM (Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) project at Allan Hancock College (AHC), a community college in Santa Maria, California. SESMC was funded at $599,929 for five-years. The first set of scholarships was awarded during academic year 2013&ndash;14, and the final set during 2017&ndash;18. Applicants were awarded scholarships based on a combination of academic potential and financial need. Scholars included STEM students in the following majors: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Geology, Mathematics, and Physics. Of the 77 individual scholars, 42 (55%) were Hispanic, and 28 (38%) were female.&nbsp; Seventy-three (95%) had at least one of the following attributes: Female; Hispanic; First-Generation Student; or had an Estimated Family Contribution of less than $1000 (based on FAFSA, Free Application for Federal Student Aid).</p> <p>Project activities were based on four foundation blocks that support student success: <em>Financial</em>, <em>Academic Skills</em>, <em>Involvement</em>, and <em>Commitment/Motivation</em> (Figure 1). Each scholar was awarded up to $6,000 per year, for up to two years. Scholars were required to attend group study sessions, workshops, guest speaker talks and other activities. Scholars met at least twice per semester with a faculty mentor in their discipline (or in a related discipline). Scholars were provided field trip opportunities, were encouraged to apply for internships, and were provided with a membership in a professional organization of their choice (for example: American Society of Mechanical Engineers; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; Society of Women Engineers). During the last two years, winter reading assignments were introduced to help scholars develop the tools they need to succeed and persist (such as: a growth mindset, time management, effective study habits).</p> <p>The primary objectives can be summarized as follows:&nbsp;</p> <ol> <li>to reduce the need to work in order to focus on academics;</li> <li>to improve academic skills and study habits;</li> <li>to increase interactions among students, their peers and faculty; and</li> <li>to improve motivation and commitment to career and academic goals.</li> </ol> <p>Based on end-of-academic-year student surveys, SESMC scholars were able to reduce their weekly working hours by 54% &ndash; from an average of 21.2 hours to an average of 9.5 hours, or nearly 12 hours per week (Figure 2). Students reported that this reduction in outside work commitment not only helped them focus on their coursework, but also allowed them time to grow as individuals. In key STEM courses (such as calculus, engineering physics, chemistry, biology, computer science and engineering), SESMC scholars succeeded at an 86.5% rate, compared to 66.5% for all students, and 77.1% for white male students not receiving the community college system&rsquo;s Board of Governors fee waiver.</p> <p>The mentoring component allowed SESMC scholars and faculty mentors to better connect with each other outside the classroom, and to help scholars learn about their next steps in their education and careers. Many scholars are first-generation students. According to the US Census 2016 American Community Survey (5-year estimate), of the population 25 years and older, 13% of Santa Maria residents have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher (compared to 32% for the state, and 30% for the nation), so it is critical for these promising students to get pertinent advice relevant to their major from someone who has already walked the path the scholars are on. Common themes in mentor meetings included study and work skills, class performance, transfer, and career planning. Many students met with their mentors more than the required minimum, and others expressed that there should be more than just two required meetings per term. Both scholars and mentors felt the mentoring component was very useful and worthwhile. As one student noted: &ldquo;I have someone who has experience in the engineering field who can guide me in the right direction, not just academically but in my personal life as well.&rdquo;</p> <p>Start-of-the-semester meetings, field trips and guest speakers helped bring scholars together. However, the most frequent suggestion for improvement on the end-of-the-year surveys was more group-meetings &ndash; where scholars could discuss with each other and the staff their challenges and successes. Having more group meetings and cohort-building activities is something that will be incorporated into future programs as well as in AHC engineering courses in general.</p> <p>Over the five-year period, there were 77 individual scholars. Of this number, 60 (78%) have transferred (or have been accepted to transfer) to a four-year intuition as of July 2018. Eleven more (14%) have finished their award with the end of the grant, and are on track to transfer in the near future. One changed majors away from STEM, one voluntarily withdrew, and four lost eligibility, having failed to meet program requirements. The SESMC team will continue to track students who have not yet transferred, as well as conduct a survey of students who have already transferred.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/23/2018<br>      Modified by: Dominic&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dal Bello</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1154494/1154494_10163541_1532377543555_foundation_of_student_success_imageonly--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1154494/1154494_10163541_1532377543555_foundation_of_student_success_imageonly--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Foundation Blocks of Student Success: Finances, Academic Skills, Involvement, Motivation/Commitment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1154494/1154494_10163541_1532377543555_foundation_of_student_success_imageonly--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Foundation Blocks of Student Success: Finances, Academic Skills, Involvement, Motivation/Commitment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
