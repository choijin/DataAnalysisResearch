<AbstractNarration>The lead PI has been working on th inversion of the refraction arrivals from all multi-channel seismic data from Atlantis Massif which is now complete. They are funded to incorporate these velocity models of the shallow crust in a re-examination of the reflectivity, extending the prior MCS analyses by other investigators. There are reflectors within the Oceanic Core Complex at Atlantis Massif at depths below the paths of the refracted waves. Incorporating these events in new tomographic inversions will extend current models into the core of the massif. The PIs also hope that the study will advance knowledge beyond current depths and will determine what type of experiment(s) can obtain seismic constraints across the full depth range necessary to truly test the models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts include postdoctoral training, enhancing the outcomes of IODP drilling investments in igneous oceanic lithosphere, and development/sharing of tools for seismic analysis of shallow lithospheric structure. The work will also support two current IODP proposals under consideration for scheduling. Insights obtained on the seismic properties of intrusive ocean crust may feed into research/planning for a deep crustal and mantle penetration (MoHole) by the next ocean drilling program.</AbstractNarration>

Progressing downwards, the crust is thought to consist of pillow lavas and sheet flows; a sheeted dike complex; and an intrusive section of predominantly gabbro.

At slow spreading ridges, the dominance of magmatism or tectonics varies in space and time. Accretion can switch between being symmetric, similar to fast-spreading ridges, at the center of a ~50-100 km long spreading segment, to being asymmetric at its ends.

On the conjugate, eastern side of the axis, the structure is also a linear gradient but velocities are considerably slower. With...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
