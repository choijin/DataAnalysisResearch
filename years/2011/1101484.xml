<AbstractNarration>The main thrust of the research project is the continuation of the joint work of the PI with T. Hausel and E. Letellier on the geometry of certain character varieties, the moduli space of representations of the fundamental group of a Riemann surface to a reductive algebraic group. These spaces have a rich geometry. In other incarnations they parametrize certain Higgs bundles on the surface, a space which arose in connection to theories in Physics. The main conjecture of the PI and his collaborators describes the mixed Hodge structure of the character varieties and involves the Macdonald polynomials of combinatorics. In a separate project the PI will continue to investigate the theoretical and computational aspects of the L-functions attached to hypergeometric motives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hard to predict how current pure Mathematics will impact life outside its discipline. But overall, it largely does sooner or later. Arithmetic geometry in particular, has become crucial in a world of ever increasing digital communication and data manipulation. Geometry over finite fields, for example, once a subject of specialists, is now needed for many widely used algorithms for encryption and electronic transmission of information. In this project the PI uses finite fields in the other direction: as a probe to study the geometry of some spaces of relevance in Mathematics and Physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At its core this project is about the interaction between Geometry (the continuous) and Number Theory (the discrete). Historically, Geometry deals with forms and shapes that come from the world as we experience it. We use it to solve practical problems involving angles, distances, curves, surfaces, etc. On the other hand, Number Theory deals with more discrete data, the natural numbers, and properties such as divisibility or algebraic relations between them. These questions seem unrelated to everyday experience. However, the world is increasingly governed by the discrete. We communicate text, images or music in small chunks of data that gets encoded or encrypted. The encoding and encrypting is ultimately based on mathematical theories often developed purely for their own sake and where Number Theory plays a crucial role. In fact, the continuous and the discrete are closer to each other than one might think. The shape of continuous geometrical spaces, arising in physical theories for example, is reflected in the number of points these spaces have in their finite discrete incarnations. Concretely, quantities that describe features of geometrical spaces can be extracted by counting. The two main research topics of this project involve making this statement precise, performing the actual counting and eliciting the corresponding geometric information. In the first topic the spaces are known as the moduli space of Higgs bundles, arising in modern Physics. Together with our collaborators we succeeded in counting the number of points on the finite version of these spaces. This yielded some geometrical  information but more importantly suggested a conjectural formula for the most interesting quantities: the Betti numbers. This conjectural formula gives the right answer in the few previously known cases and it is the first to go beyond these. It has spawned a series of related work by other researchers and provided a key ingredient in our proof of a 30 year old conjecture by V. Kac. The second topic involves counting solutions to certain algebraic equations connected to the classical theory of hypergeometric functions. These functions are among the oldest special functions and have been studied in detail for more than a hundred years. They play a central role in many areas of Physics and Engineering.

This project allowed us and our collaborators to compute explicitly and completely L-functions of a very general sort going way beyond what had been previously achieved.
