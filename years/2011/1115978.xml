<AbstractNarration>The need to numerically solve initial value problems for large stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) arises in an overwhelming majority of scientific and engineering fields.  Traditionally implicit solvers have been used to overcome the stability restrictions on the time step and improve computational efficiency compared to explicit schemes. Recently, however, exponential integrators emerged as an efficient alternative to commonly used techniques.  While several of such integrators have been proposed, significant research efforts are needed to construct, analyze and optimize these integrators. The PI proposed a class of new exponential propagation iterative schemes of Runge-Kutta type (EPIRK) which are designed to maximize computational efficiency for solving very large stiff systems. The research sponsored by this grant will produce new EPIRK methods designed to have good scalability on parallel high-performance computing platforms. The study of the new integrators will produce methodologies for construction of efficient exponential schemes and explore properties of these methods.  An important part of the project is the development of adaptive versions of the algorithms and implementation of new integrators as a general-use software package for both serial and parallel platforms. The software will be used to study several application problems in plasma physics and biomodeling and will be made widely available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a variety of scientific and engineering applications researchers want to predict behavior of complex systems which evolve on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Such systems, for instance, arise in many geo-engineering applications such as storing greenhouse gases, extraction of oil and gas from highly porous and fractured media or managing groundwater resources. Another example of a multiscale problem is modeling magnetic reconnection, one of the most fundamental processes in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas that governs such important phenomena as solar flares, magnetic substorms in the Earth?s magnetosphere and dynamics of magnetic fusion experiments. Computer modeling has become an essential tool in studying such systems. However, in order to be able to simulate the behavior of these systems on a computer advanced mathematical tools that offer exceptional efficiency on high-performance computing platforms have to be developed. The numerical techniques that will result from this project will allow prediction of the behavior of a wide range of complex systems of scientific and engineering interest over the parameter regimes inaccessible to standard methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computer models have become essential tools in studying a wide range of scientific and engineering problems alongside of theory and experiments.  With the ever increasing scale and difficulty of the problems of interest there is a continuous challenge to develop advanced computational methods that offer desired efficiency and accuracy.  In particular, an overwhelming majority of scientific and engineering problems require development of computational models of phenomena that is changing in time.  An airflow around an airplane or a complex chemical process involved in combustion occurring inside a car engine are just some examples of problems that require accurate and efficient computational models of a time evolution of a complex process.  These applications also serve as examples of so-called stiff systems in which time dynamics is occurring over a wide range of temporal scales.  Stiff systems are especially difficult to model computationally.  It is particularly important to develop algorithms that have good scalability on parallel, high-performance platforms.  As a result of this project we have developed several new classes of numerical time integrators for stiff systems of exponential-type.  These new methods offer significant computational advantages compared to current state-of-the-art time integration techniques.  The methods are general and can be used for a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.  We have also built a set of theoretical tools that enable construction, analysis and efficient implementation of these methods.  The new techniques can extend the parameter regimes accessible to current computational methods as well as enable practitioners to increase the complexity of systems that need to be simulated on a computer.  In addition, we created a software package Exponential Propagation Integrators Collection (EPIC) which implements the most efficient methods we developed for serial and parallel computational platforms.  We have used the package for simulating large scale dynamics of plasmas and demonstrated computational advantages of the new approach compared to current state-of-the-art methods.  Both the new techniques and the EPIC package have broad applicability in many scientific and engineering fields and we started collaborations with several research groups to explore this potential in applications such as weather and climate predictions, plasma physics and biomodeling. The project also included a significant educational component and provided training and professional development to students and senior personnel          Last Modified: 12/01/2015       Submitted by: Mayya Tokman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
