<AbstractNarration>Under this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project, Oklahoma State University High Performance Computing Center (OSUHPCC) will acquire, deploy and maintain an HPC cluster supercomputer, to be named Cowboy, that will support computing-intensive research and research training across a broad variety of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. As a campus-wide shared resource, Cowboy will be available not only to all of OSU's faculty, staff, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates, but to researchers across Oklahoma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many areas of Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDESE) research will be facilitated by the proposed system by collaborating research teams with an expected doubling of the number of users every 12 months based on experience to date. Projects include: mechanics of granular materials and fracture simulations in nuclear clad materials; discovery genes for canine hip dysplasia; improvements to performance per Watt of many-core systems; transcriptional profiling of determination events in adult and embryonic murine stem cell lines; genomic, metagenomic and proteomic approaches to decipher host- pathogen interactions, complex carbohydrate metabolism and cellulosic bioenergy; modeling geophysical fluids; computational chemistry; simulations of nanostructured materials; simulation of the growth of carbon nanotubes; simulating gas-phase and condensed-phase materials; seismic characterization of surface geology; computational optimization; optimal error-control coding and compressive sensing techniques; charge, spin and heat transport; molecular phylogeny of the Asteraceae; evolutionary genetics of morphological diversification and domestication in grasses (Poaceae) and mustards (Brassicaceae); robust electromagnetic field testing; phylogenomic analyses of the extremophile red alga Galdieria sulphuraria; integrating data in evolving social networks; computational and combinatorial methods in commutative algebra; microbes associated with non-cultivated and cultivated plants; intensity-modulated radiation therapy planning software; and phylogenomics of milkweeds (Asclepias, Apocynaceae). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oklahoma users are at 24 institutions, including 11 of Oklahoma's 13 public universities. The Oklahoma Supercomputing Symposium (MRI PI Brunson is 2011 Conference Co-Chair), the only event of its kind held annually in an EPSCoR jurisdiction, in 8 years has had over 2000 attendees from 92 academic institutions in 24 states and Puerto Rico (including 33 in Oklahoma and 26 in 12 other EPSCoR jurisdictions), 97 private companies, 31 government agencies and 14 nonprofits.  This project includes seven women senior personnel who serve as role models and are creating interest and excitement about computational science and engineering. This project also includes participation of two researchers at Langston University, Oklahoma's sole Historically Black University. Research projects include 80 graduate students and 29 undergraduates, including 29 women, an African American, three Native Americans and three Hispanics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Oklahoma State University (OSU) has acquired, deployed and is maintaining  a HPC cluster supercomputer,  named Cowboy, that supports computing-intensive research and research training across a broad variety of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  OSU High Performance Computing Center's (OSUHPCC) provides resources, education and expertise to undergraduate students, graduate students, staff and faculty not only at OSU, but to all non-commercial entities across Oklahoma, as well as their collaborators from outside Oklahoma.  OSU also co-leads the OneOklahoma Cyberinfrastructure initiative (OneOCII), which to date has served over 100 academic and nonacademic institutions and organizations.   Through 2015, Cowboy has over 550 users including 60 undergraduate students and 290 graduate students from over 30 academic departments.  This includes 145 new users in the past year with 45 of those from outside OSU-Stillwater.  OSUHPCC has installed over 200 user applications and provided hands-on user training sessions regularly to assist those new to HPC.  OSUHPCC has facilitated over 100 publications in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Botany, Chemistry, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Geology, Industrial Engineering and Management, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, and Zoology.  PI Brunson meets regularly with new faculty candidates resulting in  several new computational scientists joining OSU including including  Christopher Fennell, Mario Borunda, Jindal Shah, Ashlee Ford Versypt,  and Charles Chen.   OSUHPCC joined the XSEDE Service Providers Forum at Level 3 in  October, 2014 and PI Brunson became chair of the Level 3 Service  Providers in January 2015.  She also continues to be on the leadership  team for XSEDE Campus Champions and is also the Regional Champion for  region four. Additionally, PI Brunson and Henry Neeman at University of Oklahoma have  been asked to co-lead XSEDE's Campus Engagement program.  In Spring 2015, PI Brunson offered the for credit  XSEDE graduate class "Applications in Parallel Computing."  Twelve  graduate students from Geology, Math, Chemistry and Industrial  Engineering Management completed the course and have applied their new  skills to their projects.  Several other existing courses at OSU have  incorporated HPC into their work including bioinformatics, chemistry,  physics and computer science.  Co-PI Hoyt held another weeklong  bioinformatics workshop in August 2015 which made significant use of  Cowboy as well as iPlant.  OSUHPCC hosted a Software Carpentry  workshop in May for 80 learners and OSU Libraries has recently become a  Software Carpentry Partner which will allow us to train local  instructors who will provide significantly more opportunities for  researchers to gain skills for computational and data-intensive work.  Since the beginning of the project period in 2011, OSUHPCC has gone from  one full time person to five including the cost share funded (and then  institutionally funded) Manager of Operations who provides operations and  maintenance for Cowboy.  Additionally, three new institutionally funded  positions: Research Cyberinfrastructure Analyst whose responsibilities  include the new cloud system and informatics support to Oklahoma's 2013  EPSCoR RII track 1 award; a Program Coordinator who supports the HPC  team, coordinates education, outreach and training activities, and  supports communications including website, newsletters, etc; and a  Bioinformatics Specialist who provides collaborative support for  bioinformatics projects and is the XSEDE domain champion for genomics.   These new institutionally funded positions have enabled OSUHPCC to  provide significantly more support for computational and data-intensive  research than ever before.  Additionally, PI Brunson, Director of the  OSUHPCC has recently been named Assistant Vice President for Research  Cyberinfrastructure.  OSUHP...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
