<AbstractNarration>The Collaborative Research Proposal: Maplets for Calculus is a student oriented electronic study guide collection of over one hundred applets for precalculus, single and multivariable calculus. These highly pedagogical applets balance the development of understanding and technical skills by posing questions, guiding the student through the solution process, checking intermediate results, and providing timely hints.  Instructors use the applets as lecture demonstrations, as a source for quiz questions, or in a lab setting where students can talk to each other about solving them.  Users access an endless supply of randomly generated questions or enter their own problems.  The applets enhance comprehension through many 2-D and 3-D graphics and animations.  Students have been instrumental throughout the development of this project: initial development of many applets was done by Honors calculus students; the web interface for the project was designed by a high school student; and the adaptation to mobile devices is done by a staff of undergraduates.  A Ph.D. student in secondary education is studying the use of Maplets for Calculus with high school students in precalculus and calculus courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the initial CCLI project the number of applets grew from 70 to 129, and the collection is growoing to over 200 under the current TUES funding. User ratings have been incorporated for each applet, and surveys are being developed and administered at several universities to assess the effectiveness of the applets.  The results from ratings and surveys are being used to improve the effectiveness of the applets, and the applets are being adapted to mobile devices, incorporating them into on-line texts and translating them into other languages. General software tools and techniques for creating the interface for mobile devices will remain in the public domain, whereas the pedagogical materials must be purchased as individual or site licenses at MYMathApps.com.  Dissemination efforts, including publications, presentations, workshops and sales, will ensure sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to develop digital-based materials to help students learn calculus. Our previous grant developed Maple-based applets, the Maplets for Calculus, (M4C) that build conceptual understanding, guide students through many standard problems and serve as lecture demonstrations. All problems are randomly generated and most require algorithmically checked, formula answers, rather than multiple choice. For this grant, we (1) enlarged to over 200 maplets, (2) completed coverage for single-variable calculus and added maplets for precalculus, multivariable calculus and differential equations, (3) improved the quality and uniformity of existing and new maplets, (4) added a grading capability to 175 maplets (5) added a student/faculty five-star rating system, (6) assessed students&rsquo; attitudes toward M4C and (7) began writing a textbook.</p> <p>Here are descriptions of a few maplets: Figure 1 shows the part of the M4C contents for applications of derivatives which includes six max/min problems. There are actually many more since problems are algorithmically-generated. &nbsp;Textbooks have one problem maximizing the area of a rectangle in an ellipse. The maplet below has the ellipse change and the rectangle fit in a whole, half (shown), or quarter ellipse. Students learn the solution process: Write a formula for the maximized function; find relationships to eliminate all but one variable; find the critical point and substitute back. Students must enter full answers which are checked using Maple. If wrong, helpful feedback and hints are available. In a lab/homework setting, students work on a different problems; they cannot copy, but they do discuss how to solve the problem.</p> <p>Figure 2 shows the intuition-building maplet on one-sided and two-sided limits and continuity. For incorrect answers, the hint gives the relevant definition. Instructors frequently assign this before discussing limits. Their feedback indicates students develop an intuitive understanding and are ready for algebraic computations. There are buttons to start grading or rate the maplet. When grading, show buttons are disabled.</p> <p>Figure 2 also shows the maplet for computing a volume of revolution which contains a 3D animation showing the region revolving, a slice revolving into a disk/washer/cylinder and the accumulation of slices producing the volume as computed by the integral. One frame appears in the maplet with four more below. Users can rotate the animation with their mouse. Students identify disk/washer/cylinder, set up the definite integral and evaluate it. The algorithmic generation uses many base regions, revolves about the x- or y-axis and selects an x- or y-integral. This one maplet subsumes about four dozen problems in a typical text. Users can even enter their own problems.</p> <p>We have assessed student opinions about the M4C through pre/post-course surveys. There is strong consensus that hints and feedback are beneficial to learning. While most students do not enjoy the laboratory component of their course, they prefer labs using M4C over those using Maple or MATLAB directly.</p> <p>Changing technology had a detrimental effect on the M4C. Maplets are Java-based, rendering them unusable on most mobile devices. We started converting the maplets into browser-based versions, called MYMathApps Lessons/Tutorials, &nbsp;also replacing Maple (https://maplesoft.com/) by Sage (http://www.sagemath.org/) which easily links from a browser. A student, L.Collins, designed five prototype Lessons using Sage&rsquo;s Notebook connection. Then Sage replaced the Notebook connection by a Cell connection. In the last two years, another student, M.Weihing, has written three prototype Tutorials using the Cell connection and incorporated some graphics written in Three.js (https://threejs.org/) which allows more interactivity than the Maple graphics. Figure 3 shows the Tutorial on computing the average values and the Lesson on finding traces, tangent lines, partial derivatives and tangent planes. Weihing plans to continue this as his Senior Thesis.</p> <p>These browser-based apps use HTML5 and JQuery (https://jquery.com/) for text and screen layout, JavaScript for interactivity, Maple and Three.js for 2D/3D static/animated graphics, Latex and MathJax (https://www.mathjax.org/) for displaying mathematics and Sage for computer algebra. One component was missing: a way to enter mathematical responses. Most graphical mathematics input has problems. Latex and MathML are too complicated. For his Senior Thesis, Matthew Barry developed MathLex (http://mathlex.org/), a linear input system, which parses an input expression into a tree diagram and translates that into Latex and Sage or another language. It is now available with a non-commercial open source license. Figure 4 shows a MathLex Demo.</p> <p>Students and teachers expressed a desire to have the M4C incorporated into a calculus text. Yasskin has worked with D.Allen and M.Stecher on the WebCalc calculus text. Meade is working with S.Stein revising his calculus text. In the last two years of this grant, they have started writing MYMathApps Calculus (MYMACalc) with layout designed by students, A.Crenwelge and J.Martinsen, MYMACalc2 (integral calculus, see Figure 5) and MYMACalc3 (multivariable calculus, see Figuer 6) are nearing completion while MYMACalc1 (differential calculus) has just been started. All of MYMACalc except M4C can be viewed on any mobile device with any browser.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/11/2018<br>      Modified by: Philip&nbsp;B&nbsp;Yasskin</p> </div> <div
