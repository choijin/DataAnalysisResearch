<AbstractNarration>New and emerging solid-state non-volatile (NV) technologies such as NAND Flash and Phase Change Memory create a new class of high-speed storage devices, both as traditional I/O systems and as extensions of system main memory. To make best use of these technologies in tomorrow's computers we need to be able to model and understand their behavior in such systems, and create algorithms and architectures which leverage their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work (a) investigates models and algorithms for system behavior of solid-state persistent memory technologies, to achieve performance, reliability, and functionality not possible with today's techniques, (b) examines alternate models for OS-to-storage interfaces to make best use of NV technology characteristics, and (c) researches new operating system algorithms for managing the novel memory model presented by mixing NV and DRAM technologies at the main-memory level within a system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coming transition from disk to low-latency solid-state storage as the primary persistent media in computer systems presents an opportunity for transformative changes in the way applications make use of storage; the goal of this research is to achieve such changes, rather than the incremental improvements possible via the disk emulation strategy used with these technologies to date. Research results will include open-source software and hardware; the project also involves development of curricula for undergraduate operating systems education and student involvement at the secondary, undergraduate, and graduate level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Flash memory has become ubiquitous, replacing traditional magnetic disk in all but the most cost-sensitive and high-volume applications today. Although typically much faster than disk, flash systems have complex internal algorithms and wear-out behavior not found in disk, and which were poorly understood even as flash was being rapidly incorporated into computer systems.   This research was aimed at deepening our understanding of the behavior of flash memory systems, to allow designs for high-performance, long-lived storage systems to be engineered rather than discovered via trial and error, and in doing so to educate future engineers and researchers in this field. The work spanned the range from theory and mathematical analysis to practical implementation and reverse-engineering of commercial devices. An outgrowth of this research has been the application of similar models and techniques to newly-introduced SMR disk devices, which incorporate translation layer algorithms similar to those in flash systems, but hampered by the larger size and lower performance of the underlying disk mechanism.  Discoveries and techniques resulting from this project include:  new methods for efficiently and accurately predicting the performance of flash translation algorithms (e.g. SSDs) for varying workloads improved algorithms and architectures for flash memory systems new translation layer algorithms for SMR disk drives novel methods of reverse-engineering algorithms embedded in both SSDs and SMR drives   Industry contacts report wide knowledge of the SSD performance modeling work, while some of the techniques developed in our SMR research have become standard industry practice.  This project educated and trained at least 9 graduate students and produced one PhD dissertation; open source software released as part of this work has been a key component of a dissertation at another institution. Research from this project has resulted in two best paper awards, and results have been incorporated into the OS curriculum and into a textbook available under a creative commons license.
