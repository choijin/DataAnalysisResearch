<AbstractNarration>Dr. Cynthia M. Friend of Harvard University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to chair a workshop on defining critical directions for the future of chemical catalysis.  The workshop will be co-chaired with Dr. Hector D. Abruna of Cornell University and Dr. Melanie S. Sanford of the University of Michigan.  The workshop will draw together a diverse group of established and emerging leaders in catalysis in order to articulate the grand challenges and future directions in this area of research.  The workshop will address the role of catalysis in advancing the national need for sustainability.  Chemical catalysis plays a central role in energy, such as in the production of renewable fuels, manufacturing, such as in the synthesis of chemical, pharmaceuticals and materials, and environmental sustainability, such as in carbon dioxide conversion, pollution control and remediation.    The workshop proceedings and conclusions will be disseminated to the scientific community through a website and a workshop report.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Catalytic chemistry plays a vital role in the world economy  since it is a key technology for chemical and materials synthesis,  fuel production, energy generation, and conversion  and environmental remediation. Catalysis research is a major  driver for the development of sustainable processes for  fuel production and for synthesis of materials and chemicals.  Among the critical technologies that rely on catalysis  are effi cient synthesis of chemicals and pharmaceuticals,  biomass conversion to fuels and platform chemicals, and  production of materials for solar energy utilization, storage,  and energy-effi cient consumer and building products.  Fundamental understanding of all areas of catalysis&mdash;homogeneous,  heterogeneous, biological, photochemical, and  electrochemical&mdash;is needed to develop more sustainable  processes.  The new alignment of programs within the Chemistry  Division at the National Science Foundation (NSF) recognizes  the central role of catalysis by establishing a new  program to keep our nationÆs effort at the forefront of  catalysis research. Senior program offi cers in the Chemistry  Division at NSF proposed having a workshop in conjunction  with the American Chemical Society (ACS) meeting  held in Denver, Colorado in August 2011 of leaders in the  fi eld of catalysis to identify future challenges and new opportunities  for this fi eld. Through a series of presentations,  extended discussions and working group meetings, the  workshop attendees made the following recommendations  for the Catalysis (CAT) program and Chemistry Division  at NSF.  Recommendations Derived from the Workshop:  1. Robust funding for the NSF CAT program is critical  to maintaining the nationÆs competitiveness. Th e  workshop participants strongly endorsed having  this programÆs funding refl ect the full breadth of  research areas in catalysis and focus on support of  fundamental research.  2. NSF CAT program should support postdoctoral fellowships  that will allow researchers to gain experience  across the areas of catalysis and provide supplemental  funding to grants in the program to promote  collaboration across the program.  3. An annual Catalysis Workshop sponsored by the  NSF should be held in conjunction with one of the  American Chemical Society (ACS) national meetings  to further build stronger ties across the catalysis  community.  4. Funding by the NSF Chemistry Division of 1-3  Regional Instrumentation Centers ($20 M capital  investment, $5 M/yr for operational support) that  would off er needed state-of-the-art instrumentation  to support catalysis research for the nation is proposed.  5. Given that catalysis plays such a vital role in many  key processes, the workshop participants suggested  the NSF CAT offi cers continue to work across divisions  and directorates at NSF, such as any new sustainability  initiative, to garner additional support for  activities including postdoctoral fellowships or joint  workshops.  With strong support for basic research in catalysis, U.S.  leadership in this essential fi eld will continue to advance.  Th e investment in students associated with this eff ort is  also crucial to the development of the next generation of  well-trained chemists in this area who represent the future  scientifi c capital for the country. Th ese recommendations  focus on ensuring U.S. leadership in this intellectually exciting  fi eld that is technologically and economically vital to  the nation.
