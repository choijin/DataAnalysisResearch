<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to establish a systematic asymptotic theory for estimates of large dimensional covariance matrices in time series; a fundamental problem in high-dimensional inference. In particular, the investigator plans to study properties of sample covariances and sample covariance matrices for stationary processes; deal with consistent estimation of covariance matrices of stationary processes and its applications in prediction and other problems; and explore non-Gaussian features of random processes by estimating higher order cumulant tensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Covariance matrices play a fundamental role in various fields including environmental science, engineering, economics and finance. Estimation of covariance matrices is needed in analyzing, testing, monitoring and predicting of seismic, economic and financial and other time series. Results developed from this project can provide a theoretical foundation for estimation of covariance matrices and can potentially improve time series processing algorithms that are used in various applications.</AbstractNarration>

The proposer investigates properties of sample covariances and sample covariance matrices for stationary processes; deals with consistent estimation of covariance matrices of stationary processes and its applications in prediction and other problems; and explores non-Gaussian features of random processes by estimating higher order cumulant tensors. The obtained results are published at leading journals in probability and statistics including Annals of Statistics, Annals of Probability,  Electronic Journal of Statistics, Encyclopedia of Environmetrics, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Statistica Sinica, among others. While working on research problems described in the project, Ph.D. students received rigorous training which lay a solid foundation for their tenure-track positions at US universities.   The developed theory will be useful for analyzing and prediction of high-dimensional sptial-temporal processes that involves estimation of second and high order statistics.  As broader impacts, the PI disseminates the research results through teaching, invited seminars, conferences, publications in leading journals; educates future statisticians on the theory and practice of high dimensional covariance matrix estimation in time series; interacts with researchers from other disciplines and provides assistance to students and researchers in other regions and countries on similar research topics.
