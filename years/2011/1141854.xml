<AbstractNarration>The geological activity that manifests itself so dramatically at the Earth's surface ultimately originates from processes in the deep interior. To improve our understanding of the interior dynamics and structure of the Earth, it is necessary to combine geophysical observations such as those from seismology with direct experimental measurements of the physical properties of the relevant geological materials. The aim of this study is to measure the sound velocities of minerals at high pressure and to use the results in combination with seismic data to construct improved models of the composition and structure of the Earth's upper mantle.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Using Brillouin spectroscopy we will carry out new measurements of the high-pressure elastic properties of major phases of the upper mantle including olivine and its high-pressure polymorphs. The elastic properties of minerals are essential for the interpretation of seismic data for the Earth. The bulk and shear moduli along with density determine compressional and shear wave speeds which can be directly compared to seismic data. In combination with our previous work on hydrous olivine polymorphs, these studies will yield new understanding of how iron and hydrogen affect the elastic properties of the major phases of the upper mantle. In particular, our studies will shed new light on the velocity crossover between hydrous and anhydrous forsterite observed in our previous work. Another goal for this project is to develop and apply techniques for Brillouin spectroscopy at simultaneous high pressures and temperatures (to as high as 600oC) using an externally heated diamond anvil cell. This work will provide the first experimental constraints on the high P-T elastic tensor for some key mantle minerals. Lastly, we will undertake a comprehensive synthesis of our current understanding of chemical and structural controls on mineral elastic properties and their importance for interpreting seismic data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The elastic properties of minerals are of central importance for interpreting seismic data for the EarthÆs crust, mantle, and core.   Mineral elasticity data also have more general applications towards understanding interatomic forces, material strength, and how minerals respond to the high pressures of EarthÆs deep interior.  Single-crystal elastic properties are the most generally useful as they provide complete information on the anisotropy of elastic properties, sound velocities, and compressibility.   Over the course of this project, we have carried out measurements of the elastic properties of key minerals of the EarthÆs mantle and crust.  For example, our measurements of the elastic properties of quartz have resolved a long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment in the high-pressure behavior of this fundamental mineral.   We have also carried out measurements at high pressures and temperatures on the mineral known as hydrous ringwoodite. This material is very important for understanding the role of water in the EarthÆs deep transition zone at 520-660 km depth below the surface.  Even in small quantities the presence of water can have dramatic effects on seismic and other properties of the deep Earth. Our new measurements enable firm constraints to be placed on the water content of the deep transition zone. Specifically, comparing our results with seismic observations, we find that the observed seismic velocity anomalies and related depth depression of the 660-km seismic discontinuity could be attributed to thermal variations together with the presence of ~0.1 wt.% H2O in the mantle.  We have also developed a comprehensive and up-to-date database of single-crystal elastic properties of minerals Single-crystal elasticity data have broad impact across a range of disciplines. In geophysics, single-crystal elastic properties provide key information of seismic wave velocities, seismic anisotropy, and other mechanical properties.
