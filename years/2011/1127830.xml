<AbstractNarration>The University of Florida (UF) has developed the intellectual property for a novel visible light activated transparent antimicrobial coating. NanoHygienix LLC, a UF spin-off company headed by a UF business school graduate, is interested in commercializing this technology for preventing surface-mediated infections in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, etc. The proposed research program will leverage the expertise in materials science, environmental engineering, chemistry, entrepreneurship, finance, marketing and business management. The PI has expertise in engineering and scale-up of particulate systems and their translation to various industry sectors including chemical, mineral, microelectronics, nano and biotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of infections in hospitals and other healthcare settings. The PI is committed to recruit students from underrepresented groups through well established college and university programs such as SEAGEP and LSAMP. This project will promote innovation ecosystem infrastructure development across campus by bringing together engineering and business students and faculty. Project outcomes will include invention disclosures/patents, peer reviewed journal publications, dissertations, and presentations at professional society meetings. Ultimate benefits of the proposed activity will be best practices for commercializing the university innovations resulting in spin-of companies that will provide jobs and contribute to the economic well-being of the nation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hospital acquired infections (HAIÆs) have gained significant attention in the last decade owing to high incidence rates and increased healthcare costs. Diseases caused methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile have been marked as urgent in CDCÆs list for drug resistant pathogens. Transmission via touch has been shown as a major route for said pathogens to infect humans in hospital environments.  The NSF-AIR æVisible light activated antimicrobial coatingsÆ project addresses the issue of pathogen transmission by designing a product that can inactivate such bacteria on touch surfaces. The product, PhotoprotectTM has shown potential as a photocatalytic coating to kill these bacteria over long periods of time using visible light and has been formulated to address market requirements like:  Transparency:  The coatings are transparent and can be applied on any surface without masking its appearance. Activity: The coatings have shown capability to kill more than 60% of human pathogens over a 12 hour period. Beta facility testing also indicates a drop in infection rates by 54% over a period of 6 months. Longevity: The coatings have been shown to be active and keep microbial concentrations to benign levels for a period of at least 12 months.  Ease of application: Commercial sprayers can be used to apply the coatings on surfaces, enabling quick and easy application on surfaces. Visible light Active: These coatings require only visible light for inactivation of pathogens of surfaces, a source that is available plenty in healthcare environments   Such technology finds promise for application in fabrics, paints and other surfaces that could be potential bacterial accumulation sites. Overall, such coatings have shown promise to reduce touch mediated infections, thereby improving the general health and hygiene of people in healthcare facilities, and also in home and work environment.
