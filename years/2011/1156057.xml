<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:   "Collaborative Research: The Economic Origins and Ramifications of the Great Migration"&lt;br/&gt;PIs:   Marianne H. Wanamaker and William J. Collins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the origins and ramifications of the internal migration of southern-born U.S. workers between 1900 and 1940. Social scientists widely view the "Great Migration" of southerners, especially the high rate of migration by African Americans, as one of the most important events in American economic and social history. A key aspect of the project is the development of new datasets that link individuals across census years in the early 20th century, greatly improving the ability to observe and analyze internal migration for both white and black workers.&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on four main areas of inquiry that have been limited by shortcomings of existing datasets: 1) identification of early-life factors, both household and location-specific, that raised or lowered the likelihood of migration and affected occupational choice; 2) measurement of the economic gains that accrued to inter-regional migrants, including differences by race and skill; 3) identifying the role of migration in fostering intergenerational mobility and racial convergence in labor market outcomes; and 4) estimating how social networks, geographic distance, environmental shocks, wage differences, and other factors influenced migrants' selection of destinations.&lt;br/&gt;The results and datasets of the project will allow deeper documentation and analysis of American labor markets in the early 20th century than was previously possible. This, in turn, will facilitate comparisons with other times and places, where different institutional and technological contexts prevail (e.g., internal migration in China or the E.U.). It will also demonstrate at a micro-level how migration fueled the structural transformation of the American economy, as agriculture declined in importance, cities grew rapidly, and the South began its economic convergence on the rest on the U.S. Finally, analyses produced in the project will shed light on the economics of discrimination, human capital, intergenerational change, and migration in this important period.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project has built new datasets using census records to study the origins and ramifications of the Great Migration from the South, which began on a large-scale during World War I.  A major challenge to historical studies of migration and intergenerational mobility is the lack of existing datasets that follow individuals over time.  By linking individuals over census dates (10 to 20 years apart), this project provides a new perspective on questions about the characteristics of migrants compared to non-migrants, the economic gains that accrued to migrants, the migrants' choices of destinations, and the interaction of migration with intergenerational changes in economic status or occupations.  So far, three major papers have built upon these datasets, and we hope that several more will follow.  We also hope that other scholars will use the datasets the project has created.  The first dataset we built consists of African Americans observed in 1910 and 1930, covering the earliest decades of the Great Migration.  The paper is focused on measuring the income gains associated with inter-regional migration in this period.  Because we can observe the same person before and after the move, we can do far more than previous studies to address measurement issues associated with "selection" into migration (e.g., if the "best and brightest" migrate, then comparisons of migrants to non-migrants gives a misleading measure of the gains from migration).  We find that the income gains to migrants in this period were large, even after adjusting for selection and cost of living differences.  Consequently, migration helped narrow the black-white income gap between 1910 and 1930, albeit slightly.  The next dataset was similar to the first but covered a group of white southerners.  White migration was sizable in this period but has attracted less attention than African American migration.  Southern white migrants also form a natural comparison group for southern black migrants when studying migration patterns.  The second major paper documents substantial differences in white and black migration patterns, even after adjusting for "initial conditions" such as location and background variables.  We find differences in how responsive black and white migrants were to destination-specific characteristics such as distance, labor demand conditions, and the prevalence of manufacturing.   The third major paper, still a work-in-progress, builds on four different linked datasets that the project created.  We see black and white father-son pairs starting in 1880 and (in separate samples) 1910.  Then, we see the sons as adults 20 years later, in 1900 and 1930 respectively.  In this paper we are investigating intergenerational changes in economic status and how such changes interacted migration and early life conditions.  A particularly useful feature of this paper is that it begins in 1880, with the first set of young men born in the post-Civil War era.  It will provide a new long-run view of how the labor market evolved between the Civil War and the Great Depression, how occupational changes and geographic mobility were linked, and what the implications were for intergenerational changes in economic status.
