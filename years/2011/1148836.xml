<AbstractNarration>This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Rochester is to study the noncovalent self-assembly of amino acid derivatives into polymer-like fibrils that can induce hydrogelation of the aqueous medium in the bulk state. The relationship between self-assembly and hydrogelation phenomena of amino acid-derived fibrils is poorly understood. The research objective of this proposal is to elucidate the fundamental structural and functional basis for the self-assembly and hydrogelation of low molecular weight amino acid derivatives in order to facilitate the rational design of next-generation biomimetic materials. Current hydrogel development relies on empirical approaches and serendipitous discovery. Fundamental first principles will be applied to the creation of novel biocompatible, scaffolds for the growth of cells. The use of these materials as next-generation, three-dimensional media for regenerative medicine will be explored. The integrated educational goals of this proposal will focus on providing advanced instruction in both teaching and research laboratory environments at the interface of chemistry, materials, and biological sciences. Specifically, laboratory experiments that provide instruction in state-of-the-art rheological analysis of bulk materials will be developed for laboratory courses in chemistry and chemical engineering. Research experiences for undergraduate and high school students will also be provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrogels are an important class of material for applications in regenerative medicine. Healthy cells can be grown outside the body in three-dimensional hydrogel scaffolds and then implanted to wound sites to facilitate healing. Hydrogels that are created by the spontaneous self-assembly of simple molecules dissolved in water without any chemical or physical intervention represent exciting next-generation materials. The development of these types of hydrogels has been hindered by a lack of understanding concerning the fundamental principles that explain both self-assembly and hydrogelation. The purpose of this research is to elucidate the underlying physical principles that lead to hydrogel formation by simple, inexpensive molecules so that next-generation materials can be developed. This work promises to have far-reaching impacts in materials science that will enable the creation of sophisticated materials for biomedicine, justifying public support. Outreach and education efforts will broaden participation of groups currently underrepresented in science. These efforts will include summer research experiences for undergraduate students and participation as a faculty representative for a new program, the University of Rochester Summer Research Experience program that provides research experiences for high school students.</AbstractNarration>

Students served by the Kearns Center have demonstrated financial need and will be first-generation college students. The course, "To Gel or Not To Gel: The Science of Slime," is an exercise in experiential learning teaching concepts of chemistry and materials science in the context of hydrogel materials.
