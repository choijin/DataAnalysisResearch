<AbstractNarration>Recent studies suggest that an internal biological clock (circadian clock) modulates several aspects of learning and memory including acquisition, retention, and recall such that the ability to form and/or recall new memories may be quite different at one time of day than another. Neither the mechanisms by which the circadian system regulates these processes nor the extent and functional importance of their circadian regulation are well understood. The goal of this project is to evaluate the role of the circadian clock in regulating the formation and recall of associative memories, comparing memories formed by classical (Pavlovian) conditioning with those formed by operant (instrumental) conditioning. Preliminary studies indicate there are major differences in the role of the clock in regulating memory formation and recall for the two types of conditioning, and the project will address both functional significance and mechanism underlying these differences. The results of the experiments will provide new insight into our understanding of how animals learn and of processes that regulate the ability to learn. The project will also provide exceptional opportunities for research training of graduate and undergraduate students, and for engaging high school students and the general public in the research enterprise though several outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit.  The project was designed to address fundamental questions about the regulation of learning and memory processes by the circadian system.  Previous studies had shown that the circadian (biological) clock could regulate either memory acquisition, retention, or recall depending on the species and the nature of the learning task. It was clear that the circadian system can have widespread effects on aspects of learning and memory, but one of the problems with sorting out the various results to come to a clear understanding of underlying principles is that the experiments had used various species, various conditioning paradigms, and various stimuli for reinforcement.  Thus it was unclear whether differences in results reflected fundamental differences in the role of the circadian system in learning and memory, or reflected species and methodological differences that obscured any "general principles". Our studies on olfactory learning in the cockroach have shown that the role of the circadian system varies with the type of training. With classical (Pavlovian) conditioning, the circadian system regulates memory acquisition such that the animals are much better at learning the task at some times of day than others, but once they learned the task they could recall the memory at any time of day.  In contrast, with operant conditioning to the same task animals could learn at any time of day, however, there were daily cycles of the ability to recall a learned memory. These findings were the first compelling support for the idea that the impact daily cycles on learning and memory processes is critically dependent on training procedure.

Broader Impacts.  This project provided the opportunity for several undergraduates and two high school students to be exposed to and participate in the scientific process from the formulation of  hypotheses, to experimental design and execution, to analysis and dissemination of results (four of the undergraduates were co-authors on scientific journal articles and two completed their Honors Thesis).   We have also made an extensive effort to take advantage of the public's fundamental interest in circadian rhythms and in learning and memory processes (e.g., Alzheimer's) to engage and educate non-scientists on the significance and importance of basic research in neuroscience.
