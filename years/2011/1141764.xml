<AbstractNarration>In the higher elevations of the western U.S., seasonal snow accumulation provides the primary source of water input to the terrestrial ecosystem.  Recent changes in climate and vegetation cover (e.g. fire suppression, beetle infestation, fire) have potentially large, yet unrealized implications for water availability and ecosystem health.  Forest structure has profound effects on snow accumulation and snowmelt via interception, attenuation of solar radiation, and other processes.  We currently lack the mechanistic understanding needed to address the impacts of annual, decadal and long-term forest dynamics on snowmelt dynamics and water resources. This project targets this knowledge gap via an integrated observing and modeling approach focused on rates of snow accumulation and snowmelt in open versus sub-canopy conditions across an elevational gradient.  Distributed hydrologic instrument clusters spanning an elevational gradient in the Colorado Front Range will be used to explore interactions between snow and vegetation, and improve predictions of snow-vegetation interactions associated with climate and vegetation change.  Detailed analyses of canopy radiative transfer using hemispherical photography will be used to explain observed differences in snowpack dynamics and to develop robust forcings for detailed snowmelt simulations.  The distributed instrument clusters represent the first comprehensive network of co-located snow, soil, and vegetation water use measurements spanning a continental elevational gradient.  The combination of the measurements with new modeling capabilities will enable new understanding of ecohydrological feedbacks and have the potential to fundamentally change our ability to predict ecosystem response to climate change.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mountain snowpack is the primary water source for 60 million people in the Western U.S. and one billion people globally.  Recent changes in climate and vegetation cover (e.g. fire suppression, beetle infestation, fire) have potentially large, yet unrealized implications for snowmelt and water sustainability.  Patterns of snow accumulation and snowmelt are highly variable in mountainous regions, varying with topography, climate, and vegetation.  In mountain forests, the ecological impacts of potential changes in snowmelt and water availability are poorly known.  The proposed research targets this knowledge gap using measurements of snow depth and other water-related variables in different types of mountain forests.  The measurements will be used to improve models that estimate solar radiation and snowmelt, providing the tools needed to predict ecosystem response to changes in climate or land cover. In this regard, the project will improve understanding of the linkages between snowpack processes and land cover changes.  The mountain snowpack is one of the most sensitive hydrologic states to changes in climate.  Hence, the improved characterization of snowmelt will broadly address societal vulnerabilities to climate change.  The new levels of understanding achieved in this research should have dramatic impacts on the research of others and the conceptual model by which snow covered forested systems are studied.  For example, many biogeochemical and ecosystem models have parameterizations which represent the processes studied here.  Hence the proposed work will broadly extend to collaborators working at the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site and other highland systems.  Further, the distribution of snowmelt in these systems dominates water inputs and therefore exerts a strong control on the rate of soil erosion and mineral weathering, affording collaborations with the earth surface and geomorphology communities via NSF?s Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network ? with implications for cross-CZO research. Data from this project will be made available to these communities through multiple portals providing a direct link to these other activities.  Another important impact of the proposed research will be the educational opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objectives of this project was to evaluate relationships between snowmelt, forest water use, and streamflow production in different mountain environments.  The following three hypotheses were tested:   1. The relative speed of snowmelt will be greater in open areas relative to under trees.   2. Differences in snowmelt timing lead to differences in snowmelt rate, soil moisture, and streamflow production.   3. Relationships between snowmelt and soil moisture vary with climate and elevation and largely control differences in streamflow production.   Cross Site Comparisons in Snow-Vegetation Interactions  Using a multi-year data set from co-located observations of snow depth and soil moisture, we evaluated the influence of trees on snow accumulation and melt, and the influence of snowmelt on the timing and relative magnitude of soil moisture response at Boulder, Colorado, Jemez, New Mexico, and a high and low elevation sub-site at Wolverton, California. These three sites are part of the NSF Critical Zone Observatory Program.  At these three NSF Critical Zone Observatory sites forest canopy controls on snow accumulation led to 12 to 42 cm greater peak snow depths in open versus under-canopy positions.  Differences in accumulation and melt across sites resulted in earlier snow disappearance in open positions at Jemez and earlier snow disappearance in under-canopy positions at Boulder and both Wolverton sites.  Irrespective of net snow accumulation, we found that peak annual soil moisture was nearly synchronous with the date of snow disappearance at all sites with an average deviation of 1, 2, and 11 days at Jemez, Boulder, and Wolverton sites, respectively.  Our results imply that the duration of water stress may increase as regional warming or forest disturbance lead to earlier snow disappearance and soil moisture recession in subalpine forests.  Snowmelt Controls on Soil Moisture at the Regional Scale  To reveal the sensitivity of peak soil moisture timing with respect to regional warming and associated shifts toward earlier snowmelt, we compared the timing of snow disappearance and the timing of peak soil moisture based on observations from 260 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations across the Western U.S.; these stations measure snow and climate and are managed by the US Natural Resource Conservation Service.   In this area of our project we have identified the spatio-temporal dependencies of peak soil moisture with respect to the day of snow disappearance (i.e. the date the snow completely melts in spring). All Western U.S. ecoregions showed significant linear relationships (p&lt;0.001) between the timing of peak soil moisture and snow dissapearance. In this regard, a 5 day change in snow dissapearance timing led to a 4 day change in the timing of peak soil moisture.  The sensitivity of peak soil moisture timing to snow dissapearance was highly variable across the different mountain ecoregions.  Empirical relationships used to estimate future peak soil moisture timing under scenarios of 1 &ndash; 4 &deg;C temperature increases showed that peak soil moisture timing occurs 1.6 &ndash; 4.3 days earlier each 1 &deg;C of warming.  Scenarios evaluating temporal shifts in peak soil moisture with 10% &ndash; 40% reductions in maximum snow accumulation indicated that peak soil moisture timing occurs 1.2 &ndash; 3.6 days earlier with each 10% reduction in maximum snow accumulation.  Hence, estimated changes in the timing of peak soil moisture based on warming estimated for the middle and end of the 21st century ranged from 1 &ndash; 9 days and 6 &ndash; 17 days among ecoregions, respectively.  This work suggests that shifts toward earlier snowmelt will have uneven, but significant, impacts on soil moisture and vegetation water stress. Snowmelt Timing and Runoff Production  In order to close the loop on the aforementioned research with regard to streamflow, our project explored the impacts of changing snowmelt timing on runoff efficien...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
