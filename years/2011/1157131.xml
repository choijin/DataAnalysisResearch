<AbstractNarration>1157131 &lt;br/&gt;Pellegrino&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel stipends are requested for a total of ~15-18 participants made up of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early career academics, and a few invited speakers from the United States to present their research and participate in the Engineering Conferences International (ECI) conference entitled "Water treatment and reuse III and the water-energy nexus" to be held January 8-13, 2012 in Cancun, Mexico.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will have at least 8 technical sessions covering the spectrum of leading-edge fundamental and applied separation science and technology as applied to water processes. Among these, there will be 3 sessions dedicated to the nexus between water and all facets of energy technology and policy. The meeting will feature at least two plenary lectures and ~8 keynote lectures (one in each session) to broaden the attendees' awareness of both the cutting edge technical hurdles and the connections across disciplines. It is important to note that the sessions are intended to foment disruption of the attendees' initial perspectives and challenge the conventional notions of how technology, policy, and economics should "connect water and energy" in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting co-chairs will produce a white paper based on the presentations, posters, the question and answer periods, and dedicated discussion periods. This white paper will be framed to address the question of whether strategic new initiatives need to be considered. For example, perspectives about the relative emphasis on novel materials science versus sensors and process engineering versus manufacturing advances to make novel unit operations, will specifically be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the NSF support for the meeting will be the interaction between internationally renowned and up and coming researchers. The anticipated attendance for the meeting is 100-130 researchers from all parts of the world representing industry, government and academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We obtained support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to provide travel stipends for a total of ~10 participants&mdash;made up of 3 graduate students, 3 early career academics, and 4 invited speakers, all from the United States, to present their research and participate in the Engineering Conferences International (ECI) conference entitled "Water treatment and reuse III and the water-energy nexus".   The conference produced 5 manuscripts published in Separation Science and Technology which will form the basis of a virtual special issue. A separate review article/white paper is also being prepared by the conference co-organizers to detail and summarize the results of the workshop that was conducted over the full-course of the meeting. The workshop's goal was to address the question of whether (and what) strategic new initiatives need to be considered surrounding the conventional notions of how technology, policy, and economics should "connect water and energy" in the future.  The working title of the workshop's white paper is "Transformational opportunities at the water-energy nexus". The overarching themes that were extracted from the workshop included:  genetic engineering of organisms specifically for water treatment and infrastructure; water systems development and integration, multiscale systems analysis and enabling technologies (for the person, in the house, in the community, in the region, in the country....);  economic pricing links between demand and use, that is, tune the system to provide the water at the appropriate price, and quality, for the uses in the supply chain.    This latter point makes the analogy to the petroleum industry, in that it was felt that we (as a society) should consider regional water refineries that take in the different quality water(s) available and then processes them appropriately to the unique demands that are existing in the local "societal and business environment".  At present, the same quality of water is created for every use. This can lead to higher energy consumption and economic inefficiencies in the system.  The participants agreed that much of the strategy covered in these overarching themes are complex and require major shifts in many stakeholders' perspectives. Nonetheless, it was felt that the role of science and technology R&amp;D (research and development) was to create the enabling tools which could be used to implement these shifts.
