<AbstractNarration>This project is focusing on scale literacy, one of four common themes previously identified by the American Association for the Advancement of Science for scientific literacy. The primary objective is increasing the scale literacy of general chemistry students and is establishing the correlation of their success in chemistry with their level of scale literacy.  To achieve the objective the project is correlating scale literacy with conceptual understanding of specific chemistry content, is creating and deploying integrated scale-themed instruction in a variety of contexts (lecture, laboratory, supplemental instruction), and is determining how incorporation of concepts of scale in foundation courses leads to success in other courses.  The intellectual merit of this project is the determination of the correlation between increases in scale literacy with conceptual understanding, both in the short and long terms, when explicitly included in the general chemistry curriculum.  Based on preliminary findings that scale literacy is a better predictor for success in an introductory chemistry course, this project is also establishing how integrating scale-themed instruction leads to improved performance both overall, and within specific content areas.   The broader impacts of this project include a general increase in students' scientific literacy even within large enrollment introductory chemistry courses.  More directly, the project is distributing novel, scale-themed instructional materials for General Chemistry as well as faculty professional development activities to allow students across institutions to benefit.  Further, since scale is not unique to chemistry, students in other college science courses are benefiting as the outcomes of this research are adopted and implemented across disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spatial scale can be defined as the ability to understand and use the sizing of objects to comprehend concepts in science.  This project specifically targets the sizing and understanding of objects that are smaller than what we can see without magnification (about the width of a strand of hair or smaller) and how this understanding of scale (or scale literacy) relates to studentsÃ† understanding of basic chemistry concepts.  In this project, course materials for undergraduate general chemistry students were developed comprising (1) supplemental instruction, (2) laboratory experiments, and (3) lecture material.  In addition, assessments were developed and analyzed for validity that measured both studentsÃ† ability to use various scaling skills and their perceptions or conceptions with regards to scale.  Models were built using these assessments as well as standardized test scores and placement test scores.  The models were used to measure gains in student learning from the implementation of the three components of instruction.  The impact of the experiments was measured by predicting the studentsÃ† performance based on the various assessments and then examining the difference between this prediction and the studentsÃ† actual score. When the average student score is greater than predicted, the learning gains associated with the experiment suggest that the treatment was successful.  Analysis of the data and outcomes from this project included examining the learning gains of each treatment, developing a scale learning progression, examining the relationship between specific scaling components and core chemistry concepts, and evaluating the efficacy of the implementation of the instructional materials using quizzes, surveys, and exams.  Overall, incorporating scale as a theme into instruction using more interactive methods showed the greatest increase in studentsÃ† chemistry content knowledge. Confirming what was observed on a smaller scale, students in the class-wide experiments were found to have a higher scaling ability by making size comparisons within the range of 0.001 m (or 0.04 inches) to 1000 m (or 0.6 miles) or within three orders of magnitude of their own bodies (~1 m).  When students were asked to give the relative sizes of a virus, bacterium or cell, less than 50% of the students could perform this successfully; however, for students in the treatment group, which included scale-themed lecture material, their performance increased to almost 60%. Scale was found to correlate significantly with many topics within general chemistry for both algorithmic and conceptual assessment item formats.  Additionally, instructional components that engaged the students showed the greatest learning gains.  This was particularly evident when these components were tested together (with the greatest learning gains when laboratory and supplemental instruction were combined for the treatment).   The value of this project to the community is primarily the development of curriculum that supports larger themes in science.  Because experts in a variety of fields (both science and non-science) have stated the value of a well-developed sense of scale, the concurrent understanding and development of curriculum that support both scale literacy and science concepts can support the increase in the learning of both.  A well-developed understanding of scale is important because of the increasing demand for skilled scientists and researchers to create advancements at the threshold of sizes from investigating galaxies to new discoveries at the molecular level.  With this greater understanding, students will be better prepared to continue their education in science fields and ultimately be better prepared to enter into the scientific workforce.
