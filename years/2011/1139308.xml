<AbstractNarration>GreenTECH is a three-year project focusing on green technology and careers at the high school level. Partners are: Solar One, a Green Energy Arts and Education Center; MOUSE (Making Opportunities for Upgrading Schools &amp; Education), a youth development program that prepares young people to serve as technology experts; the Wallerstein Collaborative for Urban Environmental Education at New York University, and the New York City Department of Education (DOE).  Over three years, the GreenTECH model will reach over 600 students and 30 teachers in grades 10 and 11, and will combine the successful methodology of the Solar One Green Design Lab program with the highly effective approach of MOUSE Technical Squads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GreenTECH is a program that engages students in creating sustainable school buildings. Students develop solutions and recommendations to sustainability issues, and develop workforce skills through participation in MOUSE Technical Squads. Students who successfully complete the program earn a Specialist Badge in sustainable technology. This project uses: hands-on study of the school and surrounding community; intensive technical training of high school students along with development of youth led projects; career development and planning for technology careers, particularly in green industries; and professional development for teachers.  The GreenTech curriculum introduces students to real-world career skills designed to meet environmental challenges such as water infrastructure, sustainable architecture, and solar design.  Two theoretical frameworks guide the program: Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and place-based education.  Project-based activities with a strong design component engage students and teachers in the construction of solutions that require knowledge of the science concepts and how technology can be used to address environmental problems.  Place-based education is fundamental to the GreenTech curriculum, as it uses the school building as the unit of study.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greentech curriculum employs design-thinking strategies and creative problem solving to address the need for improving energy efficiency and sustainability in school buildings. Students use their newly acquired STEM skills to solve local environmental challenges in their school and community. The curriculum then connects these STEM skills to career pathways, with the intent of preparing students for emerging green STEM jobs. GreenTECH has the following goals: 1) impacting students' understanding, knowledge, and decisions about pursuing STEM careers; 2) increasing self-efficacy and decisions about future STEM education and careers through place-based lessons; and 3) increasing students' interest and motivation in pursuing future STEM education and careers. GreenTECH is an important model for enhancing students' STEM skills and enthusiasm for STEM-related careers and will:  increase students' knowledge, skills, and persistence with respect to the technologies, careers, and STEM content of renewable energy and sustainable design; build young people's capacity to serve as specialists in the technologies essential to sustainable design; create leadership roles for young people to use those technologies at their school site; and test whether a strategy that uses the school building and its environs as the focus for learning leads to increased interest and persistence in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

The goals of the program were to: 1) develop high school students&rsquo; knowledge, interest, and self-efficacy in STEM; 2) increase interest in STEM-related careers in energy conservation, environmental science, and green technology; and 3) empower students to be sustainability activists in their schools and communities.&nbsp;&nbsp; The project team also included the Wallerstein Collaborative for Environmental Education at New York University&rsquo;s Steinhardt School of Education. The four high schools receiving the program included: &nbsp;A. Philip Randolph Campus HS, Bronx Design and Construction Academy, Baruch College Campus HS, and Queens Vocational and Technical HS.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>The Solar One component offered weekly hands-on lessons in the CleanTech curriciula at the four participating schools facilitated by Solar One educators alongside classroom teachers. Through four curricular units &ndash; Energy, Materials, Water and Food &ndash; developed under the grant, students the CleanTech curriculum engages students in the rapidly evolving clean technology sector through STEM-focused hands-on activities and student-led investigations that emphasize problem-solving, design, innovation and pathways for career exploration. &nbsp;In support of the place-based strategy, CleanTech uses the school building as a learning laboratory, giving students the opportunity to assess the building and take action to reduce the school&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p> <p>MOUSE coordinated the other curricular component, the GreenTECH Specialist badge, developed under the grant to expand students&rsquo; knowledge and skills in green-related technologies. The badge, delivered through MOUSE&rsquo;s network of MOUSE Squads, includes 3 levels of hands-on activities, a web app to visualize carbon footprint data and reduce their school&rsquo;s impact, and videos that profile engineers and designers who work in the energy field.</p> <p>In addition to the in-classroom focus on careers, Wallerstein Collaborative facilitated career development activities including field trips, presentations by experts in the field of green technology, job shadowing opportunities, and a website that links students to a green jobs database.</p> <p>The audience for the project was students in grades 9-12 from predominantly underrepresented communities. Solar One reached 859 students and 17 teachers in the four participating schools. While MOUSE delivery of the GreenTECH badge was uneven at a number of the schools, MOUSE succeeded in disseminating the program to MOUSE Squads at 14 other schools.&nbsp;</p> <p>The three-year evaluation findings indicate that the GreenTECH program achieved its goals to: develop high school students&rsquo; knowledge, interest, and self-efficacy in energy conservation; motivate students to pursue STEM-related careers in energy conservation, environmental science, and green technology; and empower students to be sustainability activists in their schools and communities. The GreenTECH program also achieved its objectives to develop a high quality, activity-based Solar One curriculum for science classrooms and MOUSE Squad Specialist Badge curriculum for MOUSE Squad activities; and provide professional development to teachers and MOUSE Coordinators that prepared them to teach the curriculum.</p> <p>Findings show the difference in pre-/post- knowledge was extremely statistically significant (p&asymp; .0000), indicating students increased their knowledge about energy after participating in the CleanTech program. For the pre/post attitude survey, findings indicate statistically significant increases in the domains of <em>Knowledge about Energy</em> (3 of 4 schools), <em>Environmental Action</em> (3 of 4 schools), <em>Attitude about Energy</em> (2 of 4 schools), <em>Knowledge and Skills related to Environmental Science and Technology</em> (4 of 4 schools, and <em>Education and Careers</em> (3 of 4 schools).</p> <p>The GreenTECH program has made a considerable contribution to the fields of environmental science education and engineering education by developing and delivering a program that engages students in sustainable design, problem solving, and innovation through hands-on learning around emerging green technologies.

GreenTECH encourages learning that reaches beyond the classroom, motivating students to take action and be a part of creating a sustainable future. Using the school building as both the center of learning and subsequent influence is an innovation that can be replicated across schools nationally. &nbsp;Much of what was created under the grant &ndash; the curriculum, video and other online resources &ndash; will remain beyond the funding period.</p> <p>In addition to the 4 participating schools in this project, Solar One delivered the program to another 4 NYC high schools, reaching an additional 816 students and 25 teachers. Solar One also provided CleanTech professional development training to 328 teachers in NYC and additional teachers in Newark, Boston, Philadelphia, and San Diego.
