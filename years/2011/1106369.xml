<AbstractNarration>Technical: This research project investigates growth and properties of dilute nitride GaNP core/shell nanowires and studies their potential for efficient solar cell applications. The dilute nitride GaNxP1-x is unique among the common semiconductors in that it has a large bandgap bowing and its bandgap can cover a wide range of solar spectrum for relatively small concentrations of nitrogen. Photons are absorbed in both the core and the shell of the GaNxP1-x/GaNyP1-y core/shell nanowires, and photogenerated electrons and holes are separated by the type-II staggered band alignment of the core and the shell, relaxing the requirement of long minority carrier lifetime in a planar solar-cell device. The GaNP-based coaxial nanowires can potentially be a viable alternate to the current triple-junction technology because of its less stringent requirement on material quality (due to spontaneous electron hole separation), simpler processing (due to only one junction), and lower materials cost.&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The research, if successful, can have significant impacts on solar-cell development using nanoscience and nanotechnology. The research activities promote interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students in growth and characterization of novel compound semiconductors and in solar cell design, fabrication and testing, as well as written and oral presentations. The PI is the Director of the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) residential summer program for more than 100 high school students. The results of this research can be incorporated into the curriculum and extend to the high schools through the Teacher Fellow program of COSMOS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have been working on a new III-V compound semiconductor material, gallium nitride phosphide GaNP, as an absorbing material for solar power.  The aim is to create a suitable top cell to boost the performance of silicon-based solar cells.  Gallium phosphide GaP is one possibility, but it is an indirect-bandgap semiconductor, like silicon (Si), which makes for poor conversion of light to electricity.  GaNP, on the other hand, is a direct-bandgap semiconductor with only 0.5% nitrogen, and it is lattice-matched to Si with 2% nitrogen.  With a proper bandgap of the top cell, a dual-junction III-V/Si solar cell can have a theoretical maximum conversion efficiency of 45%.     Since growing GaP or GaNP on Si presents another set of challenges, we first investigate GaNP (2% nitrogen) solar cells grown on GaP substrates.  We find that we can achieve efficiencies up to 7.3% without a window layer and without an antireflection coating.  This efficiency is 3x higher (and &frac14; of the absorber thickness) than the most efficient GaP solar cell to date.  It is also significantly higher than other solar cells with similar direct bandgap and thickness (3.89% for indium gallium phosphide and 4.8% for gallium arsenide phosphide).  Our results have generated widespread interest at the recent North American Molecular Beam Epitaxy Conference in October, and they are also reported in the October 28, 2015 issue of Semiconductor Today.  http://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2015/oct/ucsd_281015.shtml Our next project is to fabricate a two-junction, lattice-matched GaNAsP/Si solar cells.     For this project we continue to investigate the GaNP/GaP system.  Arrays of coaxial core/shell radial-junction microwires or nanowires have garnered much attention recently as an alternative to planar solar cells to enhance solar efficiency. The array configuration and microwire/nanowire geometry can be independently adjusted to allow multiple passes of light through the microwire/nanowire material resulting in enhanced light absorption over a wide range of wavelengths. The radial junction decouples the direction of light absorption (vertical) and charge carrier collection (radial), resulting in effective charge collection. Instead of nanowires (&lt;100 nm), microwires (~mm) possess the optimal diameter that is comparable to the minority-carrier diffusion length to obtain maximum solar cell efficiency.   All microwire samples are p-i-n solar cells that were fabricated by using a top-down reactive ion etching (RIE) technique to create p-GaP microwires, followed by using a step-mediated growth approach by gas-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow the surrounding i-GaNP and n-GaP shells, respectively. The benefit of utilizing an RIE approach instead of MBE vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth for cores is that the GaP microwire cores do not suffer from twining planes commonly observed in III-V semiconductor nanowires grown by VLS.  Using MBE for growth of shells is beneficial because it provides the freedom to independently control the thickness, the composition, and the doping concentration of the shells.  Systematic studies have been performed over a series of microwire lengths (L = 6 &micro;m, 8 &micro;m, 10 &micro;m), array period (P = 4 &micro;m, 6 &micro;m, 8 &micro;m), and morphology of microwire sidewalls.     The photographs show (a) p-GaP microwire core of 2.8 mm diameter fabricated by RIE, (b) smooth sidewalls exposed by wet etching, (c) i-GaNP and n-GaP shells grown by MBE, and (d) the final device consisting of microwire array (black square) and the front contact around the periphery.  The best efficiency so far is 3.2% with increased short-circuit current but decreased open-circuit voltage as compared to planar GaNP/GaP solar cells.  The smaller open-circuit voltage is primarily due to defects at the GaP/GaNP interface and in the GaNP shells.  To improve the efficiency, we need to improve the etched surface of the GaP microwires for better ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
