<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to conduct a research study to understand the impact of informal engineering learning environments on students' creativity and engagement.  The study engages both engineering faculty and experts in informal education in looking at the long term benefits of engaging in these environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to help explore ways to develop innovative and creative engineers that can have potentially large impact on the future engineering workforce.  The model proposed, if successful, may be broadly exportable to other institutions and engage a wide spectrum of engineering students.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         This report describes outcomes from a study of a group of nine undergraduate engineering students at the University of Louisville as they carried out self-directed projects at LVL1 (lvl1.org), the city of LouisvilleÆs hackerspace, in 2012 and 2013. The goal of this engineering education study was to determine how working in an unstructured environment affects engineering majorsÆ creativity and innovation. A hackerspace or makerspace is a group workshop, usually with a user community that shares their projects at meetings or online. By the start of 2015, there were more than 100 makerspaces in the US, putting this resource within reach of significant numbers of engineering schools.  Students applied to the paid semester-long internship by proposing individual projects. To determine the impact of the program on skills and attitudes, the team interviewed participants periodically. The interns got weekly feedback from a mentor in the engineering school but were in charge of their own daily activities, and had to figure out how to get to the next step.  We were especially interested in how the experience affected the studentsÆ views of their ability to switch from coursework to the project-based work that is the basis of engineering careers.  Participants expressed both excitement and concern about working in a new environment that wasnÆt as structured as school, and about working on projects using skills they had not learned in class. The students came from five different engineering departments. From a skills viewpoint, several who didnÆt consider themselves programmers knew that their projects required programming to collect data from sensors. Some students were in their first co-op internship, others were in their third and final co-op, and most were still testing whether engineering was the right career choice. In the early interviews, one student said "[having] my own project can help me decide if I really want to be an engineer," and another described the co-op as "a chance to experience engineering to decide if I like it."  The early- and mid-internship interviews revealed that the students who selected this internship over a more conventional internship at a company tended to be &shy;motivated and self-critical.

One feature of LVL1 that we think encouraged students to persist in creating was the "failure wall," a corkboard that held fizzled chips and broken tools as reminders that projects do not always work on the first try, even though the makerspace meetings and website were filled with examples of successful projects that would suggest otherwise.  In post-internship interviews, students expressed an increased sense of mastery, which they connected to the independence they had during their internships at the makerspace. Observations in the makerspace showed that only a few of the projects achieved all of their goals, but...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
