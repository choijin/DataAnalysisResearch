<AbstractNarration>Geomagnetic storms driven by solar wind perturbations are dynamic events that can cause dramatic reconfigurations of plasma in the ionosphere, plasmasphere, and magnetosphere. These events cause mesoscale redistributions giving rise to the formation of storm enhanced density (SED) plumes and polar tongues of ionization (TOI). Plasma patches are formed from the tongue of ionization and subsequently propagate across the polar cap by the prevailing E x B drift of charged particles in the Earth's magnetic field. Steep density gradients are formed along the edges of polar cap patches and the TOI and SED features; these gradients are the source region for plasma instabilities that produce cascades of electron density irregularities in the background plasma. As radio signals propagate through the irregularities, rapid fluctuations or scintillations are produced in the received radio signal amplitude and phase. Scintillation presents a considerable space weather hazard, especially for the high-precision GPS observations and navigation. Comprehensive system level studies are needed to link cause to effect through observations of SED, TOI, and polar cap patch histories simultaneously with direct polar cap scintillation data. With this award, scientists will study the formation of TOI and polar cap patches over Antarctica, and observe the relationship of SED and TOI to polar scintillation, using a combination of GPS data from multiple existing platforms and from specially equipped GPS scintillation receivers located at three different Antarctic sites. Educational opportunities will be provided through MIT Haystack?s ongoing involvement in programs like the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates, Research Experiences for Teachers, and focused high school internships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported by this grant focused on ionospheric scintillation, which is the rapid fluctuation of both the amplitude and phase of radio waves that propagate through the ionosphere in the presence of irregularities.  In the polar region (the auroral zone, and the polar cap), ionopheric irregularities are formed due to aurora dissipation and other magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions.  Because scintillation can be severe enough to interfere with both HF communication and navigation (GPS reception), it is important to understand what causes scintillation, when and where it appears.  Our research was designed to statistically define relationships between the driving / generative mechanisms of scintillation (e.g. velocity shears and density gradients).  We have recorded observations of scintillation and irregularities based on data provided by GPS scintillation receivers, SuperDARN, imaging riometers, all&shy;sky cameras.  One of the direct outputs of our research was the development of a scintillation database with scintillation observations collected from two specially equipped GPS receivers in Anarctica.  These receivers are located at the South Pole (SPA) station and McMurdo station (MCM) and data from these receivers are available on the CEDAR Madrigal database, http://cedar.openmadrigal.org/ for the years 2011-2014.  In Madrigal, for each 20 minutes, where data is available, plots overlaying the background GPS TEC data have been generated and are available for download. In addition, sigma phi(phase) and S4(amplitude) scintillation parameters for three different pierce point locations (100, 250, and 350 km) are available in the database at a time cadence of ~1 s.  One of the figures we have attached shows the sigma phi scintillation observed by one receiver during a storm enhanced density event.     This project has also contributed to the development of overlays of SuperDarn products, such as the estimated convection maps, onto the background GPS Total Electron Content maps.  A direct link to the TEC/SuperDARN interactive tools is available in the Madrigal database.  The second figure that we have attached shows an example of a SuperDarn convection map overlaid onto a GPS TEC map.    Scientific Outcomes:  There is a clear seasonal dependence is SED plumes and their associated TOI structures, including a preference for formation during or near the equinoxes. However, when the SED/TOI form during solstices, they are not as defined as during the equinoexs and may need stronger geomagnetic storm input to the geospace system in order to form. SED/TOI structures appear to forma at all longitude sectors, although data coverage is currently sparse over China/Indonesia.  The 01 November 2012 data was particularly unique in that it clearly showed that SED/TOI features can form in all longitude sectors.  The SED/TOI structures appear to be larger in general in the American longitude sector. The SED/TOI structures appear in both hemispheres.  However, the SED/TOI effects appear to be stronger in the Southern Hemisphere around 8:00 UT (data coverage may limit earlier UT observations in the Southern Hemisphere) and stronger in the Northern Hemisphere around 18:00 UT, corresponding to the American sector.   This is suggested by the theory of Heelis et al., 2009.   Training of Students:   During the summer of 2014, we worked closely with an undergraduate student, Katerina Gonzales, on this project. Her presentation at AGU was accepted as an oral presentation, and likely contributed to her acceptance into a graduate research program at Stanford in climate dynamics.   In addtion, we have continued working with a Virginia Tech graduate student on work related to this project.  He had four publications this year related to this work.  Broad Impacts:  A better understanding of scintillation and SED plumes is likely to lead to better forecast models for space weather effects on commercial communication and navigation systems.
