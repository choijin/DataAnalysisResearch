<AbstractNarration>This project is aimed to develop a novel method that enables the mass production of lipid-based affinity nanodiscs in a simple but very effective manner. Manufacturing of affinity nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery has attracted significant attention in the field of nanotechnology. One of the most widely studied nanocarriers is antibody-functionalized liposomes. However, the synthesis of drug-loaded affinity liposomes usually requires time-consuming and multiple-step process, resulting in costly mass production. Moreover, the aqueous core within liposomes is not favorable for encapsulating hydrophobic drugs. In this project, nucleic acid aptamers and hydrophobic drugs will be incorporated to the self-assembled lipid-based nanodiscs in aqueous solutions. It is expected that such vehicles have the capability of targeting specific cells and carrying a large amount of hydrophobic molecules. Preliminary studies have shown that stable nanodiscs are attainable and the aptamers are functional after chemical conjugation. Based on the compelling results, this project includes (1) synthesizing and characterizing the novel affinity nanodiscs, (2) modeling the growth kinetics and dynamic interactions of the nanodiscs, and (3) understanding the biological functions of the affinity nanodiscs. The anticipated outcomes of this interdisciplinary study are to provide insights into the kinetics and thermodynamics of molecular self-assembly and to develop a transformative method for preparing affinity nanocarriers for hydrophobic drugs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will lead to several scientific and economic impacts. First, the one-step manufacturing of the novel nanodiscs will greatly reduce the cost of mass production, making the relevant targeted chemotherapy more affordable to the general public. Second, since more than 40 percent of the new anti-cancer drugs are hydrophobic, this delivery platform will pave a new way of delivering hydrophobic drugs especially for cancer chemotherapy. Third, the data to be generated will further enrich the knowledge of nanotechnology, molecular recognition, and colloidal science. The broader educational impacts of this project will also be evident in our strong commitment to education and human resource development. First, this project will provide students with a unique interdisciplinary environment to learn nanotechnology, drug delivery, colloidal science, biomolecular engineering, kinetic analysis, and mathematical modeling. All participating students will have modularized scientific questions to study and will discuss their research findings in joint group meetings. The students will be able to not only acquire hands-on research skills, but also learn analytical, communication, collaboration, and innovation skills. In addition, the PIs will incorporate the results from this research into their teaching courses ("structural characterization of soft materials" and "drug delivery"). Second, the PIs will continuously participate in the outreach programs established at UConn. These outreach efforts will raise K-12 students' interests in science and engineering and facilitate the transfer of the novel bench work to biopharmaceutical industries. Third, the research findings will be widely disseminated through publications in peer-refereed journals and presentations at professional conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  This proposal focuses on design lipid-based size-uniform nanodiscs which can be manufactured through one-pot high-throughput synthesis and capable of targeting cancer cells. The scalable manufacturing has been achieved via self-assembly of lipid mixtures. Furthermore, the protocol has the advantages of robustness, environmental friendliness, easy operation and easy surface modification. The discoidal radius can be well controlled in the range between 10 and 30 nm with a low polydispersity in size (Fig 1).  Several important outcomes of this project are listed below.  (1)  The coalescence of nanodiscs is a diffusion-limited mechanism due to the Coulombic interaction.  (2)  Substitution of the short-chain lipid, dihexanoyl phosphatidylcholine, with the bile salt, 3-(cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio-2-hydroxyl-1-propanesulfonate, results in more stable ribbons.  (3)  The structure of nanodiscs retains and can be further stabilized after being incorporated with Polyethylene glycol conjugated (PEGylated) lipid.  They are stable not only in buffer but also in serum.  (4)  The nanodiscs can entrap hydrophobic/amphiphilic molecules, e.g., Nile red, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, hydrophobic gold nanoparticles/quantum dots, cholesterol, etc. with high molar ratios depending on the molecular morphology.  (5)  Uniform nano-sized lipid vesicles (radii of 10 ~ 50 nm) can be obtained through structural transformation of nanodiscs in a controlled manner and the transformation can be an irreversible process (Fig 2).  (6)  The effects of salinity, PEGylation and concentration on the stability of the nanodiscs are summarized in Fig 3.  (7)  The cellular uptake of nanodiscs is much higher than that of nano-sized vesicles. This phenomenon is observed in three different cell lines as shown in Fig 4. Both vesicles and nanodiscs indicate low cytotoxicity for cells.  (8)  Structural transformation from nanodiscs to lamellae upon elevation of temperature is also found (at high lipid concentration) and these lamellae in a physiologically relevant condition are alignable under a weak shear flow. The PIÆs research group collaborated with the research team at National Research Council (Canada) on designing and constructing in situ temperature-controlled shear cell for neutron scattering experiment.  (9)  Individual lipid exchange rate between NPs is enhanced by two orders of magnitude as the morphology changes from vesicle to nanodisc, although the rate is not necessarily correlated with the stability of the NPs.  The scientific outcomes have been disseminated to the public and scientific societies through 8 research papers in peer-reviewed international journals (Langmuir, Soft Matter, Journal of Biomedical Nanotechnology, Biomarcromolecules, Biomaterials, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta and Review of Scientific Instruments), a book chapter on biomembranes, 25 conference contributions to National Annual Conferences of American Institute of Chemical Engineers, Physical Society, American Chemical Society, NSF Nano Science &amp; Engineering Grantee Conference, NanoSMAT, etc. and 25 Invited presentations at universities, national/international conferences and industrial companies.  Broader Impact:  The research project also results in many events leading to broader impacts in education, science and industrial research as mentioned below.  (1)  In total, 5 Ph.D., 6 M.S. and 13 undergraduates (2 of them moving on for graduate study) were trained through relevant research projects at the PIÆs research group.  (2)  The PI has participated educational outreach activities through UCONN da vinci Program and UCONN Mentor Connection Program through which provides hands-on research experience for 10 high school students and 1 high school teacher, Mr. Philip Smith, who made a youtube video clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHQiVT2O0Sc about what he learned from the PIÆs lab.
