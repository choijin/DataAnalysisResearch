<AbstractNarration>The project is developing, implementing, and assessing an advanced interactive landform simulator that engages undergraduate students in game-like guided inquiry of the interactions between river and hillslope processes and landscape formation. It is building on the prior successful WILSIM project at Northern Illinois University, with major upgrades including 1) a shift from cellular automata to a physically based model, 2) design-based and pedagogical improvements to the GUI and output formats, and 3) a shift from hypothetical to "real-world" landscapes, specifically the evolution of the Grand Canyon over the past 10 million years. Curriculum development and testing are targeting introductory students at four-year institutions and at community colleges, and are being performed in collaboration with the College of Lake County (IL).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The landform simulator is enhancing student learning about both landform processes and approaches to numerical modeling in the geosciences. The web-based nature of the simulator allows ready adoption of the approach across institutions, and curricular materials are being actively disseminated through web portals, conferences and professional organizations. The project is also incorporating active plans for engagement of students from groups underrepresented in geoscience courses and careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Web-based Interactive Landform Simulation Model &ndash; Grand Canyon (WILSIM-GC, http://serc.carleton.edu/landform/) is a simplified version of a physically-based model that simulates bedrock channel erosion, cliff retreat, and base level change. It takes advantage of the recent developments in Java technology (e.g., Java OpenGL, Trusted Applet, and multithreaded capability) that allows for fast computation and dynamic visualization. Students can change the erodibility of the bed rock, contrast in erodibility between hard and soft rock layers, cliff retreat rate, and base level subsidence rate. The impact and interaction of these changes on the landform evolution can be observed in animation from different viewing geometry. In addition, cross-sections and profiles at different time intervals can be displayed and saved for further quantitative analysis.  The major goals of the project were: (1) to build a Web-based model for simulating the landform evolution of Grand Canyon (WILSIM-GC) that can be used as tool to facilitate students' learning of the relevant geomorphology concept and processes; (2) to develop the associated curricular materials for classroom use; (3) to test the model and the curricular materials in classroom for their effective in enhancing students' learning; (4) to disseminate the model and associated curricular materials to a wider audience.  We have achieved all the goals and the outcomes are summarized below.  (1) WILSIM-GC is fully operational. see project website http://serc.carleton.edu/landform/  (2) Curricular materials have been developed and tested and made available on line:  http://serc.carleton.edu/landform/activities.html  (3) Our initial results from classroom testing show that WILSIM-GC has many advantages over traditional paper and pencil method in teaching students the concepts and processes of landform evolution: it promotes higher level thinking; it has a larger effect size in pre to post score gain as measured by Cohen's d; and students favor the modeling approach.
