<AbstractNarration>DYNAMO is a US research program designed to identify atmospheric and oceanic processes that are important during the initiation phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).  Data will be collected across the tropical Indian Ocean and used with model experiments to accelerate our understanding MJO formation and evolution.  As part of DYNAMO, we propose a coupled modeling study of small scale mixing processes that govern SST and atmospheric convection in the equatorial Indian Ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This proposal focuses on the upper ocean component of this effort with the aim of using detailed process simulations to better understand how measured heat fluxes are controlled in the ocean boundary layer and how these fluxes interact with atmospheric convection.  Results will also help guide measurement strategies during the field program. Understanding ocean mixed layer processes is a critical step in determining the role of the ocean as a heat and moisture source for atmospheric convection that drives the MJO.  The objectives will be reached by performing sets of oceanic and atmospheric Large Eddy Simulation (LES) numerical experiments, including coupling with an ocean mixed layer model, to examine air-sea and ocean mixed layer fluxes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  MJO events can have a significant impact on tropical populations via frequent tropical storms and heavy rain events.  The proposed work will provide further knowledge of the role of the ocean in driving convection associated with MJO formation and evolution, and will thus lead to better MJO forecasts.  This project will support and train a graduate student and provide a valuable research experience for a post doc researcher.  As part of this effort, a user-friendly version of our upgraded KPP model will be made available from our department website.  We plan to include a graphical interface and sample cases for ocean conditions in the tropical Indian and Pacific oceans for use in research and teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to improve our understanding of air-sea interaction in the equatorial Indian Ocean.  We conducted two, mostly independent modeling studies; one focused on how atmospheric convection controls fluxes at the ocean surface , and a second centered on examining how strong surface winds generated by convection affect the upper ocean heat content.  In the first study, we used a high-resolution cloud model to simulate populations of precipitating convective storms or thunderstorms (although the model does not include lightning and thunder explicitly).  These storms are powered by solar heating of the ocean and atmosphere and triggered by nighttime atmospheric cooling.  Each day the sun warms the ocean surface and overlying air.  After sunset, cooling of the upper atmosphere sets up conditions where relatively warm air is underneath relatively cold air.  Because warm air rises, the atmosphere generates convective storms that move moisture and heat from the ocean surface up to the top of the troposphere.  When clouds form, they release energy through the condensation process that fuels the rising warm air.  When storms are fully developed, they produce heavy rain that evaporates as it falls and cools the air.  This cooler air forms downdrafts that spread out when they reach the sea surface, forming "cold pools" that have gusty winds and slightly lower temperatures.  We wanted to find out if these cold pools cause more energy exchange between the atmosphere and ocean.  Our model results suggest that cold pools enhance the exchange of water and heat between the ocean and atmosphere by as much as 40 percent.  Ocean observations indicate that rain from atmospheric convection often forms fresh water pools or lenses that float on top of the ocean because of the lower density of fresh water versus salt water.  There is some question about how this fresh water layer might affect surface fluxes and if changes in surface salinity could generate a feedback with the convection producing the rainfall.  We conducted experiments with and without the effects of rain lenses and determined that the fresh water layers do not affect convective development because they mix with the surrounding waters too rapidly to have a lasting impact on the sea surface temperature and air-sea fluxes.  The second main focus of this project was directed at examining how atmospheric convection, specifically during Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) convective events, controls the upper ocean structure.  We used an ocean turbulence model forced with observed wind and surface flux data taken from the DYNAMO experiment.  The ocean structure in the model was initialized using observed ocean data right before a major convective squall moved over the observation site.   Results from the model showed how wind and wave forcing generated strong vertical mixing, causing the initially warm, fresh surface waters to mix downward with the underlying cooler, saltier water.  Key processes that the model identified were the downward transport of wind driven currents, which caused instability and enhanced turbulence at the base of the surface mixed layer.    An important question we wanted to answer was how much heat loss in the upper ocean was due to upward mixing of cooler subsurface waters by enhanced turbulence at the mixed layer base relative to surface cooling by evaporation.  We found that about 1/3 of the ocean surface cooling could be attributed to mixing with the underlying ocean.  This result suggests that upper-ocean mixing can affect MJO events by lowering the SST through mechanical mixing, reducing the amount of energy available for new storm development.
