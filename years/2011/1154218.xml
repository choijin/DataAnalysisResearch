<AbstractNarration>Morgan State University, a public urban institution with about 90% of its students of African-American ancestry, provides scholarships to meet the outstanding financial needs of academically talented students majoring in Biology.  The scholarships allow scholars to devote time that would otherwise be spent working more than 20 hours per week to pay for their education to instead focus intensively on their academic and professional development.  In addition to the financial assistance, students in the STARS-1 program receive active and structured support of both their academic success and professional goals.   Students are also strongly encouraged to undertake mentored undergraduate research projects during the summer or academic year.  Through these interventions, it is anticipated that the students will persist and excel to graduation and go on to diversify the STEM workforce and graduate education programs.  This project builds on several other significant federally-funded activities and is expected to lead to similar initiatives targeting other unique populations of students majoring in a variety of STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Strategies for Transforming Access to Research and Scholarship (STARS-1) Scholarship Program was implemented at Morgan State University, Maryland's legislatively designated preeminent public urban research university, which has also been designated as a National Treasure by the National Historic Trust and whose student population consists predominantly of African Americans and other underrepresented populations.  The primary goal of the project was to demonstrate that provision of financial assistance in the form of scholarships in exchange for a reduction or elimination of working hours along with both broad and individually tailored professional developmental supports could lead to greater numbers of financially challenged underrepresented Biology majors completing their degrees in a timely fashion and being better prepared and more competitive for matriculation into graduate and professional programs or employment in STEM or STEM-related fields.  The program exceeded the initially projected number of supported students successfully completing their degrees by 40%.  All students supported benefited in one or more of the following ways 1) elimination or significant reduction in working hours while a student; 2) significant reduction in student loan debt; 3) engagement in undergraduate research or career-related internships; 4) engagement in broad and individually tailored professional development workshops and seminars.Furthermore, a higher proportion of scholars in the program engaged in such activities as students and went on to matriculate into graduate or professional programs or employment in STEM or STEM-related fields compared to the larger cohort of Biology majors.  Additionally, the program effectively leveraged resources to positively benefit a much broader cohort of STEM majors via planned events including seminars, workshops, and trips to open houses at nearby graduate and professional schools.  The STARS-1 Scholarship has not only demonstrated some proofs of principles, but provides a basis to expand the key elements out to other STEM majors and thus braoden its impact in terms of diversifying postbaccalureate STEM programs and the STEM workforce.
