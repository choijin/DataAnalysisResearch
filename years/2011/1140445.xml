<AbstractNarration>Involving undergraduate students in research is recognized as an experience that powerfully engages students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and launches students into STEM careers.  This research project examines how participation in undergraduate research impacts students in terms of the significance of the experience for the participants and explores the relationship between student outcomes and the goals and activities of these types of experiences.  Focusing on the fields of chemistry and physics, the largely qualitative study investigates commonly reported outcomes for students and their mentors to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors and common relationships between features of the research experience and student characteristics.  Utilizing an iterative analytic approach, the investigators document and analyze the structure and implementation of the research experience in relation to student attributes and previous experiences with STEM.  In addition, the multi-site study examines hypotheses about the impact of these experiences on engagement in STEM and how participation in a research experience leads to commitment to pursue a career in STEM. Findings from the study are to be published in science educational research journals and presented at meetings sponsored by professional societies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study sought to add to the foundation of understanding of the many variables that influence student outcomes of participation in undergraduate research experiences (UREs). The intellectual merits of this study rest in our investigation of commonly reported outcomes to gain greater resolution on the range of meaning they have for students and mentors. Our main research questions were: (a) What range of effects does URE participation have on students? (b) How consistent are the effects within/between participants? and (c) What experiential factors lead to the participatory effects?  Gains  Students and research mentors most commonly identified the exposure to authentic research practices as the single greatest benefit, which may be an artifact of the more confirmatory lab experiences participants may encounter in their science coursework. This was salient at research institutions where students were almost twice as likely as peers at undergraduate institutions to identify the exposure to authentic research as their greatest benefit. Students and mentors saw URE authenticity as highly related to problem originality, collaborative interactions, project ownership, and student engagement in the field. Thus, the exposure to authentic research is both a benefit and a key element in advancing student learning and career interests.  We found students and mentors reported positive gains across literacy, communication, technical, analytical and interpretive skills as well as an increased understanding of the field and process of science. Further, students commonly indicated substantial affective gains (e.g., confidence) as a result of URE participation.  With the limitations of self-report and observations to measure change, we designed a performance assessment to measure changes in students? skills based on URE participation. Longitudinal comparisons suggest that URE participation improved students? skills related to experimental problem solving and quantitative reasoning. Our findings provide initial performance-based evidence to the causal effect of URE participation on specific research skills.  Career Motivation  Most students demonstrated a high amount of initial interest in pursuing academic and career plans in the sciences that was reaffirmed or refined through UREs. While this may be an artifact of a competitive selection process, these participants often noted how the experience influenced their view of careers in the field. In particular, students frequently cited how UREs permitted exposure to research areas that clarified or confirmed their postgraduate plans. Further, students and faculty described affective gains (e.g., confidence and science identity) for participants in which they could "see themselves as scientists." In contrast to earlier accounts, both mentors and students described how participants often become engaged in these experiences in an effort to advance their career prospects (e.g., resume building, networking).  Although small in number, a group of students reported that they decided not to pursue a research-related career as a result of their experience. Earlier accounts report that such revelations are often attributed to URE participants gaining experience with the realities of science research (e.g., time investments, the potential for failure); however, our findings also suggest the likely impact of poor participant- mentor interactions on student attrition in research careers.  Mentoring  We found that mentors, administrators and students, identified UREs as an apprenticeship. Mentors and administrators reported on the importance of working "elbow to elbow" with students in teaching new tasks, building student independence, being available as a resource, and encouraging engagement in the culture and norms of the research community. Similarly, students highlighted the value of early training, effective teaching, frequent mentor interactions, and supportive and collaborative environments.  Students who reported less satisfaction with their URE highlighted the potential negative effects of mentors with extensive absenteeism. Students also described issues associated with the lack of research project organization or mentor expectations that inadequately or excessively challenged students personally and intellectually.  From our interviews and surveys of graduate student and postdoc research mentors, we found that most lacked training or guidance from their faculty advisor on how to mentor undergraduate researchers. Graduate student and postdoc mentors described how they formulated a model for mentorship largely based on their experiences as student researchers and through "trial and error."  Broader Impacts  While we continue to analyze data and disseminate results via manuscripts, we feel the main contributions of this work are in our understanding of UREs from an interest generation mechanism into an interest maintenance mechanism and the development of the survey and observation tools and performance-based instrument. With these, we are moving toward a deeper understanding of URE participant gains &ndash; which will assist us in our goal of designing assessments to more accurately evaluate student outcomes of these experiences.  Dissemination of results occurred through presentations at various national meetings and discussions with STEM faculty and administrators. Funding from this grant produced one dissertation. To date, we shared results via an AERA handbook chapter (Maltese &amp; Harsh, 2015), have one paper in press (Harsh, 2016), two in review and another in advanced stages of preparation.
