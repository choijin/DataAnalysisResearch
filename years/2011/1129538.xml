<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to foster the establishment of new scientific links between North, Central and South America among the next generation of scientific leaders in Applied Mechanics. This will be accomplished by awarding travel fellowships to young scientists from the United States to the Twelfth Pan-American Congress of Applied Mechanics, to take place in Port of Spain, Trinidad, on January 3-6, 2012. This group of young scientist will be graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and early career professors, selected by members of the organizing committee of the conference upon revision and ranking of the submitted abstract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The economic growth of some South American countries is now beginning to be reflected in their research portfolio. The conference will strengthen scientific relations between the United States and South and Central America. Additionally, a selection of papers submitted to the conference will be included in the collection "Applied Mechanics in the Americas 2012," which will be distributed to attendees and made available in an archival website. The authors of the most meritorious presentations will also be invited to contribute a paper to a special issue of the Journal of Applied Mechanics. Finally, a comprehensive website for the conference will be created as the conference approaches, and will remain there for at least two years after the conference, until the next PACAM. The website can be found at http://www.pacamxii.org, and it is being progressively enriched with information as it comes along. The entire program of the conference will be displayed there, including the submitted abstracts.</AbstractNarration>
