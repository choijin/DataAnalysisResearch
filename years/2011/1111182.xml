<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research leverages expertise of researchers at Wright State University (IIS-1111182) and Ohio State University (IIS-1111118). Online social networks and always-connected mobile devices have created an immense opportunity that empowers citizens and organizations to communicate and coordinate effectively in the wake of critical events.  Specifically, there have been many isolated examples of using Twitter to provide timely and situational information about emergencies to relief organizations, and to conduct ad-hoc coordination. However, there are few attempts that try to understand the full ramifications of using social networks in a more concerted manner for effective organizational sensemaking.    This project aims to conduct multidisciplinary research involving computer and social scientists fill this gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to leverage Twitter posts (tweets) as the primary source of citizen inputs and couple relevant content and network information along with microworld simulations involving  human role players to measure effectiveness of various organized sensemaking strategies.   To arrive at meaningful summaries of citizen input, tweet content is analyzed using a semantic content analysis by combining natural language   techniques that are suitably fused with existing knowledge bases (GeoNames, Wikipedia). Content analysis is further enhanced by innovatively combining it with the dynamic analysis of the twitter network to realize concise and trustworthy information nuggets of potential interest to organizations and citizens. The resulting summaries will be fed to a suitably designed microworld simulation involving human actors to derive realistic settings for modeling disaster situations and typical organizational structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to have a significant impact in the specific context of disaster and emergency response. However, elements of this research are expected to have much wider utility, for example in the domains of e-commerce, and social reform.   From a computational perspective, this project introduces the novel paradigm of people-content-network analysis whose application is not just limited to organized sensemaking.  For social scientists, it provides a platform that can be used to assess relative efficacy of various organizational structures using microworld simulations and is expected to provide new insights into the types of social network structures (mix of symmetric and asymmetric) that might be better suitable to propagate information in emergent situations.  From an educational standpoint, the majority of funds will be used to train the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers drawn from the computational and social sciences.   Research activities  will also be integrated with graduate course work. Participation of underrepresented groups will be encouraged. Datasets  and software developed as part  of this project will be made available to the broader research community via the project page (http://knoesis.org/research/semspc/projects/socs).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This research started with a key question--given the penetration of social media in our daily lives, can we leverage it for efficient response to critical life events such as disasters? But the challenge is how to incorporate this new information source into workflows of responder organizations. This project analyzed large-scale social streams to filter actionable information for supporting crisis monitoring and management organizations. Our significant focus was on the design of a cooperative system between citizens and organizational actors, identifying and localizing resource needs/availabilities and individuals or groups to engage. Resulting technology detects and leverages coordinated communication behavior to identify actionable content for organizational actors such as where and who needs resources (seeking intent) and who has availability (offering intent), and facilitation of matchmaking coordination (see Figure 1: Automatic Matching for Coordination). Our resulting research platform, Twitris, provides a variety of comprehensive multi-dimensional analyses Figure 2: Twitris capabilities for emergency management and coordination for efficient organizational sensemaking. This research and technology has been evaluated with a large number of real world crisis responses. Besides high impact publications reporting on research outcomes, the techniques and tools developed in this project have been used in real world applications worldwide and extensively reported in major media. These include their use during major international crisis response such as J&amp;K Floods relief initiative Figure 3: Tool used for Jammu-Kashmir Floods Rescue, Uttarakhand floods, Phailin cyclone, and Philippines typhoon.  Our research was also recognized by CDC Science Digest via selection of our journal publication on identifying psycholinguistic features from offline theories of conversations, which can assist in detecting coordination-assistive communication in the online world. Crisis mapping pioneer UshahidiÆs recent initiative CrisisNET, recognized as the fire hose of worldwide crisis data, has also integrated our technology of mining intent to serve future crisis events. Eight PhD students, in addition to several MS and bachelor students have been supported through this grant and received significant training resulting in excellent career outcomes. Our research is also embodied in a patented Twitris technology and the comprehensive Twitris platform, which is used to support significant collaborative projects sponsored by NSF, NIH and other agencies. More recently a customized version of Twitris was used for emergency simulation exercises also. Furthermore, a SOCS team researcher was also recognized by the United Nations ICT agency, ITU in the Young Innovators 2014 program, for his project on social media coordination to assist response organizations.     The attached three figures provide snapshot of concrete high impact real-world applications and deployments as mentioned above.
