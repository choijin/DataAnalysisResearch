<AbstractNarration>Victor Rivera-Monroy and colleagues at Louisiana State University will hold a workshop in La Ceiba, Honduras in conjunction with Andrea R. Sosa and colleagues at the National Autonomous University of Honduras.  The object of the workshop is to discuss a research program to establish and utilize a network of long-term ecological monitoring sites, primarily in Honduras and neighboring countries.  The objective is to assess the sustainability of water use in large watersheds in Central America compared to that in other sites in the United States, particularly in the Mississippi Delta and Florida Everglades, which already have established long-term ecological research programs.  Ecologists, hydrologists and environmental economists from the US and Central American countries, including Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, will participate.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the socioeconomic importance of marine resources to economies in Central America, the scientific and technical information needed to develop sustainable management plans for coastal zones is often lacking or inadequate.  This workshop aims to link U.S. researchers with Honduran and other Central American colleagues in a collaborative dialogue to identify timely research topics.  One of the workshop activities is to select tentative Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites on both Caribbean and Pacific coasts.  These sites will be used to develop research initiatives and promote international research collaborations in Central America and the Caribbean region. A priority of the workshop is the inclusion of US and Central American students and early-career scientists in the workshop and subsequent international research collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main objective of this project was to organize a five-day workshop to advance the development of a network of long-term ecological monitoring sites in North and Central America to implement comparative studies assessing the sustainability of water use in large watersheds in Honduras and the USA (Louisiana and Florida). In the workshop we formulated potential research projects and educational initiatives that could (1) address Honduran national and USA priorities with respect to water resource assessment and coastal management and (2) help to continue the development and rebuilding of educational and international research programs among research and educational institutions. We developed a research agenda to address key environmental problems of regional importance and strategic value for the country of Honduras. The discussion in a workshop setting allowed us to identify three major areas of research and education that need to be developed in the future: 1) Coastal hydrology and Eutrophication, 2) Agriculture/Aquaculture and Coastal development under an Adaptive Management strategy, 3) Societal responses to Climate Change. We&nbsp;secured four letter of intent for International collaboration between Louisiana State University and institutions in Honduras including:&nbsp; 1) FUNDACION CUERO Y SALADO Atl&aacute;ntida, Honduras, 2) FUNDACION PARA LA PROTECCION DE LANCETILLA, PUNTA SAL Y TEXIGUAT (PROLANSATE) Atl&aacute;ntida, Honduras, 3) SISTEMA NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACI&Oacute;N FORESTAL, &Aacute;REAS PROTEGIDAS Y VIDA SILVESTRE (SINFOR)&nbsp; Atl&aacute;ntida, Honduras, 4) INSTITUTO TECNOL&Oacute;GICO SUPERIOR DE TELA (ITS Tela) UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL AUT&Oacute;NOMA DE HONDURAS (UNAH). As result of this workshop we were able to collaborate with other institutions and organizations to implement two training courses for undergraduate and graduate students. One course trained 18 professionals in the evaluation of &ldquo;Blue Carbon&rdquo; in mangrove wetlands. The participating institutions included: Centro Universitario Regional del Litoral Atlantico (CURLA) de Honduras, Secretaria de Recursos Naturales y Ambiente (SERNA), Concejo Nacional de Areas Protegidas (CONAP), Instituto Nacional de Bosques (INAB) including participants from Guatemala and Nicaragua. The second course trained 17 students and instructors from the Centro Universitario Regional del Litoral Atl&aacute;ntico -UNAH in Environmental Monitoring and Molecular Microbiology methods. We are now preparing one proposal to implement a large spatial and temporal scale study comparing watersheds vulnerability to human impacts in Honduras (Cangrejal River) and Louisiana (Mississippi River).
