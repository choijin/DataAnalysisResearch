<AbstractNarration>A revolutionary new device concept that could enable the transformation of vacuum&lt;br/&gt;microelectronics from single charge carrier to bipolar devices (i.e., positive and negative charge) is&lt;br/&gt;proposed. This transformation is achieved by creating and modulating both ions and electrons&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously in a single vacuum microelectronic device (VMD) and has recently been&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated by RTI International and Duke University. This achievement represents the first&lt;br/&gt;demonstration of bipolar operation in a VMD, and the researchers believe the EArly-concept&lt;br/&gt;Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) Program provides an ideal mechanism for exploratory&lt;br/&gt;study of this new device concept, gaining a basic understanding of the new device operation and&lt;br/&gt;its ultimate potential in comparison to other electron devices. These bipolar vacuum&lt;br/&gt;microelectronic devices (BVMDs) have only recently been demonstrated for the first time, and&lt;br/&gt;thus they are at such an early stage of development that they do not fit within either existing or&lt;br/&gt;pending research programs. However, BMVDs represent a potentially transformative paradigm for&lt;br/&gt;electron devices. If this proposed EAGER program is successful, it could lead to entirely new&lt;br/&gt;fields of applications for VMDs in similar ways that CMOS technology transformed solid-state&lt;br/&gt;electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BVMD operation provides the equivalent of a field configurable bipolar junction transistor with&lt;br/&gt;all the advantages of VMDs with respect to operating temperature, radiation hardness, and high&lt;br/&gt;power/frequency capabilities. This proposal will focus first on developing a figure of merit that&lt;br/&gt;relates BVMDs to VMD and solid-state devices, followed by a detailed investigation of device&lt;br/&gt;operation across different pressure, temperature, and operational modes. The device model will&lt;br/&gt;be developed based on the COMSOL simulation platform, enabling detailed analysis of both&lt;br/&gt;electron and ion flux in the device as functions of various operating conditions (e.g., pressure,&lt;br/&gt;power, frequency). The simulations will be used to determine operational figures of merit and to&lt;br/&gt;aid in the design, development, and testing of next-generation BVMD devices. The successful&lt;br/&gt;research will enable both a better understanding of the device physics behind BVMDs and the&lt;br/&gt;ability to assess their ultimate potential.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vacuum electronic devices (e.g. vacuum tubes) have significant advantages over solid-state (e.g. silicon) in terms of speed and power, radiation tolerance, and thermal stability, however their use is limited due to size and cost.  Advances in microfabrication technologies in the 1980Ã†s renewed interest in smaller, cheaper vacuum microelectronic devices (VMDs) but their utility has still been limited, in-part, because they rely on single charge carrier (electron-only) operation.  A VMD that possessed both n-type (electrons) and p-type (ions) behavior, i.e., a bipolar VMD, would enable an entirely new class of digital logic and integrated circuits not previously possible with conventional vacuum electronics.  Here we report on the first demonstration of a VMD that utilizes both positive and negative charge states, modulated independently to achieve bipolar functionality.  A micro-electro-mechanical systems platform was used to construct pentode structures with integrated carbon nanotube field emitters for electron emission, and bias electrodes for separate electron- and ion-current modulation.  Ions were generated via electron-impact in an argon-ambient and devices were tested in both voltage-sweep and pulsed modes.  Current, greater than 2 mA/cm2 was modulated at the Anode between ion and electron collection, demonstrating levels sufficient for basic logic function.  This advance could enable a new class of integrated circuits for radiation intensive environments (e.g. nuclear power facilities and space-based communications), high temperature applications (e.g. engines or materials processing) and high power / high frequencies operation (e.g. telecommunications).  With further advances in device design and modeling, we believe this fundamental demonstration will lead to novel vacuum microelectronic devices and applications not previously addressed by present solid-state devices.
