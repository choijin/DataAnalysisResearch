<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to define a hierarchical integration architecture that allows all&lt;br/&gt;the heterogeneous components required for electrical and optical interface with neurons can be&lt;br/&gt;directly integrated on a micromachined probe substrate with a low-rise profile for high-density&lt;br/&gt;studies of neural networks in behaving animals. The implemented microsystem aims to be a&lt;br/&gt;generic platform technology for scalable, adaptable and reconfigurable hybrid integration.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is in a number of important areas, including the formation of highdensity&lt;br/&gt;interconnects to hybrid electronic chips, hermetic encapsulation of these chips on&lt;br/&gt;micromachined platforms, the use of magnetically-aligned anisotropic conductive adhesives for&lt;br/&gt;high-density lead transfers, the monolithic integration of highly-flexible parylene cables into&lt;br/&gt;probes formed using completely dry-etched process flows, and the development of hermetic,&lt;br/&gt;low-profile packages that are compatible with both the cables and the hybrid circuitry.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are in realizing tools to permit revolutionary progress in our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of neural circuits and systems. The work will also provide a platform for realizing&lt;br/&gt;improved prostheses designed to overcome disorders such as severe epilepsy, Parkinson?s&lt;br/&gt;disease, and, perhaps, paralysis. Though important these breakthroughs in health care will be, the&lt;br/&gt;impact of the work should be much broader, especially in combining MEMS-based sensors with&lt;br/&gt;embedded computing and wireless connectivity, as the next major frontier in microelectronics,&lt;br/&gt;coupling it to the non-electronic world.</AbstractNarration>
