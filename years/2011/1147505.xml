<AbstractNarration>The objective of this workshop is to explore in a transdisciplinary fashion how models of the individual, his or her social network, and of societal decision making derived from psychology, sociology, decision sciences, economics, can be applied to create intelligent applications that empower patients.  Empowerment of patients and healthy individuals is a critical aspect of individualized medicine and  includes concepts of self-efficacy and self managed behavioral change, supported by healthcare providers and payers. Technology plays a role in patient empowerment but will be most successful if implemented within through scientifically based, theory-driven systems that address the barriers that patients face to empowerment within themselves and across the health system.  To achieve this, intelligent systems need useful, computable models of patients reasoning and their social relationships and social networks. The workshop is focused on identifying the key questions underlying empowerment with a particular emphasis on the role of networking and information technology in the empowering processes.  The results of this workshop are expected to have significant impact on the practical ability to empower individuals as well as on fundamental understanding of the empowerment process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In December of 2011, experts from medicine, nursing, psychology, sociology, behavioral science, decision science, economics, informatics, and computer science explored how technologies might enrich patient empowerment during a two-day conference held in Park City, Utah. Technology is a potentially valuable tool in various aspects of patient empowerment (informing, guiding, connecting, etc&hellip;). Workshop participants described the foundations of a new technical infrastructure that would enhance the ability of all members of society to lead the fullest, healthiest lives possible, regardless of monetary or disease-related constraints, and the path toward development of that infrastructure. The foundation of discussions in the workshop were the questions,  "What does it mean to empower patients, and what is the value of empowerment for health care? ." In information systems, empowerment as a design concept, as Brennan and Safran have argued, "leads to creation of computerized information resources, management systems and telehealth innovations in a manner that ensures patientsÃ† abilities to participate as full partners in health care." Topics discussed in the workshop are listed in Table 1.  Table 1. Summary of Workshop Discussion Areas.      Microsystems:   Informatics &amp; Self-Empowerment    The   history of the informatics of patient empowerment      Self-efficacy   is intrapersonal empowerment      Self-efficacy   and empowerment through computer, web and mobile applications      Sensors   and self-efficacy&mdash;quantifying self      Self-efficacy   through integration of applications and personal evidence      Mesosystems:   Informatics &amp; Empowerment of Patients Within Medical Relationships    Patient-centered   measurement as empowerment      Ensuring   that patient values direct healthcare      Empowering   patients through patient-controlled access to health data      Macrosystems:   Informatics &amp; Empowerment of Patients Within Communities    Designing   empowering healthcare systems      Infrastructure   for community-wide collaborative promotion of health       Health Disparities and technology: cross   cutting issues    Populomics and   crossing the digital divide  Designing   electronic health records systems that address health disparities         Prior to this workshop, a test bed for use of computers to empower patients might have been any complete system where the computer provides or supports a feedback loop between patient (person) and his or her end goal. For example, an activity monitoring device connected to a cell phone might help a person balance his or her caloric intake and activity. While this functionality is useful, it is not necessarily empowering. The workshopÃ†s presentations and respondent feedback illustrated how this was insufficient. Because health care is a complex adaptive system with many inter related parts and of different levels, with unpredictable side effects from technologies, understanding how technology can help patients take more control of their lives requires test beds that span different parties in the health care system (patients, providers, payers) and different levels (personal, health care relationships) and populations.  The primary result of the workshop were proposals of a series of test beds for technologies for patient empowerment. These included:  1.         Integrated patient, payers and wireless and cellular testbed for behavioral change: Even if a mobile computing system is able to bring endless streams of patient behavioral data to  the physician, the physician will have little time for studying this data and prescribing or  suggesting interventions. We envision novel systems support and a new healthcare ecology  that avoid this problem.   2.         Community focused individually controlled health information exchange. Currently an  attractive hypothesis, a community-focused test bed, studying the impact on health and  empowerment of patient control of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
