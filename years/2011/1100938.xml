<AbstractNarration>The correspondence between homotopy types and higher categorical analogs of groupoids, first conjectured by Alexander Grothendieck, naturally leads to a view of mathematics where sets are used to parametrize collections of objects without "internal structure", while collections of objects with "internal structure" are parametrized by more general homotopy types. Univalent foundations are based on the combination of this view with the discovery that it is possible to directly formalize reasoning about homotopy types using Matin-Lof type theories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We expect that this new approach to the foundations will finally make it practical for mathematicians to use proof development software in their everyday work. The sophistication and user friendliness of such software ("proof assistants") have been growing steadily for decades and its use in computer science is becoming  standard. Enabling its use in pure mathematics will be of great benefit to the new generations of  mathematicians and to  the mathematical community as a whole.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Univalent Foundations of Mathematics" project was successfully completed.  The goal of this project was to start the process of constructing a new foundation of mathematics that would be more applicable than the existing one to the use  of the computer based tools for the development and verification of abstract mathematical constructions.   Working on this goal we have discovered that the new foundation that we started to develop is equally well adapted to the constructive and classical mathematics. This fundamental discovery meant that for the first time since the split between the constructive and classical approaches a unification became a possibility.   The PI continued working on a series of detailed papers that establish that the new foundation, as a foundation of the classical mathematics, is at least as reliable as the existing one. These papers, since they aim to establish the reliability of the new foundation, are written entirely in the framework of the old foundation and only when this or a similar series will have been completed will we be able to say with certainty that the new foundation is an adequate foundation for the classical mathematics. A very substantial progress in this direction has been obtained during the grant period.  The question of the validity of the new foundation for the constructive mathematics or, more precisely, the question of which modifications need to be added to the news foundation to make it an adequate foundation for constructive mathematics is being investigated by several teams the most advanced of which is the team led by Thierry Coquand. The modified foundation that they develop under the name "cubical type theory" will also have to be verified from the perspective of the classical mathematics and the tools that the PI has developed during the project are expected to be flexible enough to be applicable to this new task.   To summarize, this is a very exciting time in constructive mathematics and in foundations of mathematics that will lead, in the years to come, to a substantial change in how we do and how we teach pure mathematics.
