<AbstractNarration>The goals of this workshops project are: (1) to provide collaborative professional development opportunities for 24 early professional social science researchers, and science writers and communicators, and (2) to foster a stronger and durable "community of practice" between the fields of science policy research and science communications for the purposes of helping the general public better understand and become engaged with major issues of science and innovation policy.  In addition to the PI and co-PI, involved in the work will be: twelve science policy scholars and twelve science communications professionals (writers, bloggers, museum educators, and others); mentors; editors of major science publications; several guest observers from university writing programs around the country; and graduate students who will help document and video record the activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project activities include a suite of opportunities: two, four-day workshops; mentorship support; publication in hard copy and online of their articles in a special edition of Creative Nonfiction magazine; and public engagement experiences at Science Cafes around the country. These workshops and accompanying activities will continue to develop a strong foundation for the establishment of nascent collaborations of science policy scholars, science communicators, and informal science education professionals, whose partnerships should position them better to inform and engage the public on important science policy issues of our times.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Overview: Communicating Science and Innovation Policy through Narrative: Workshops on Fostering Narrative Nonfiction Partnerships between Science Communicators and Science Policy Scholars (aka: "Think Write Publish"), began to fill the need to connect science and innovation policy (S&amp;IP) with the Communicators who will translate the substance and future of these fields into language and style that public audiences will find illuminating and compelling.
