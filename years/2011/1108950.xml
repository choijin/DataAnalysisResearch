<AbstractNarration>This work aims to constrain models of the physical conditions of star formation by focusing on the dissipation of proto-planetary disks.  As a test of the importance of stellar irradiation to the physics and chemistry of the environments of pre-MS and MS stars, the PI will make key observations of infrared and radio emission lines of key molecular species such as HCO+, HCN, CN and CO of the disks around eight nearby young stars undergoing accretion. He and his team will conduct ground-based mid-IR and space-based far-IR spectroscopy (Chandra, Spitzer, Herschel), and radio spectroscopy with single-dish instruments (IRAM 30-m, JCMT and APEX), the SMA and ALMA. He will also carry out detailed numerical simulations of the spectral lines to constrain the radiation field information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will have broader impacts of training a postdoctoral researcher, producing a series of animations and lectures on topics related to planet-formation, and developing a new course on orbital resonances.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Just over two decades ago, humans had direct knowledge of only one solar system in the universe: ours. Since the mid-1990's, however, astronomers have discovered thousands of planets orbiting other stars. These so-called exoplanet systems present an astonishing diversity of planet populations and system architectures. To explain this diversity requires a deeper understanding of the origins of exoplanets. We must observe exoplanet systems just as they are emerging from their birthplaces: circumstellar disks of gas and dust orbiting (and feeding) young stars.  Astrophysicists can now directly test key aspects of theories describing the planet formation process in circumstellar disks, via suites of observations obtained with the latest generation of ground-based astronomical facilities. The new tools at our disposal range from near-infrared imaging systems on 8-meter-class telescopes to the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio interferometer.  By using these tools to observe those young stars that are nearest to Earth, we maximize the potential to make groundbreaking discoveries in the realm of newborn exoplanets and their birthplaces.  Our NSF program was aimed at unlocking this potential for a better understanding of the nearest-known sites of newborn planets. Some highlights of our NSF-supported research work follow.  We used the APEX (Chile) and IRAM (Spain) radio telescopes to obtain detailed, comprehensive "fingerprints" of the molecular compositions of three nearby planet-forming disks. These results provide insight into the "primordial (molecular) soup" out of which gas-giant planets like Jupiter would be expected to emerge. In particular, our APEX &amp; IRAM surveys support previous work showing that X-ray and UV radiation from young stars plays an important role in determining the chemistry of planet-forming disks and (hence) newborn planets. Following up on the APEX spectral surveys, we used Smithsonian's Submillimeter Array to image the distribution of C2H molecules around one of the three nearby young stars (TW Hydrae). To our surprise, we found that the C2H gas is found in a large ring around TW Hydrae. The ring's inner edge lies beyond where Pluto orbits the Sun. This discovery helped us to better understand just where and how X-rays and UV light from TW Hydrae are affecting the planet-forming gas orbiting this young star. We obtained images of the disks orbiting TW Hydrae and another young star/disk system, V4046 Sagittarii, in near-infrared light with the brand-new Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) on the 8-meter Gemini South telescope. These images allow us to peer into the regions where giant planets are expected to form within the disks.

Our ALMA survey hence provides insight into whether and how -- and how fast -- planets might form around very low-mass stars.
