<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) grant is to explore a novel hierarchical approach that incorporates design of non-conventional lattice topologies with geometric nonlinearities and buckling-induced softening to lower the operational phononic frequency range for effective energy harvesting.  The need for efficient and reliable electrical power sources for micro-electro-mechanical systems, wireless sensors and electronic portable devices, calls for innovative electromechanical structures and material systems capable of harvesting electrical energy from low frequency environmental mechanical vibrations. Unfortunately, a material's density and modulus become a pair of competing design constraints that prevent the realization of energy harvesting device with low operational frequencies.  Through synergized approach among multiscale modeling, design optimization, micro-fabrication and experimental validation, this grant supports the bold effort in achieving superior electromechanical energy conversion of electroactive polymer based phononic crystals featuring simultaneous energy harvesting and vibration isolation capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will reveal the energy harvesting mechanisms of microstructured phononic metamaterials through a deep understanding of the interplay between phononic bandgaps and the mechanical-electrical coupling in the electroactive polymer materials. The extension of level-set based topology optimization to multi-functional and multi-material design will help establishing a rigorous and computationally viable design framework accounting for the highly nonlinear and coupled mechanical-electrical phenomena of electroactive polymers, while enabling two-way communication between manufacturing and design. The integrated micro-fabrication procedure with rapid prototyping capability will offer "hardware-in-the-loop" proof of concepts using fully functional prototypes. The fruition of this research is expected to be the forging of boundaries between the multidisciplinary researchers from science-based mechanics of materials, design optimization, photonic and phononic metamaterials and micro-fabrication for advancing the field of "phononic metamaterials-based energy harvesting," while training the next generation of scientific and engineering leadership in an interdisciplinary learning environment.</AbstractNarration>
