<AbstractNarration>A crucial problem in dependability of concurrent and distributed software systems, which have become prevalent with the advances in service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, multi-core hardware, is the coordination of different components that form the whole system. In order to complete a task, components of a software system have to coordinate their executions by interacting with each other.&lt;br/&gt;Message-based communication is an increasingly common interaction mechanism used in concurrent and distributed systems where components interact with each other by sending and receiving messages. The objective of the proposed research is to develop novel techniques for specification, analysis, and verification of message-based interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop a hierarchy of communication contract specification models and investigate analysis and verification problems for each class. Within the proposed framework the interactions among components of a software system (called peers) will be modeled as conversations describing the global sequence of messages exchanged among the peers. The proposed research will result in a toolset for analyzing communication contracts and verifying properties of conversations generated by a set of peers that follow a&lt;br/&gt;given communication contract.   The research will have broader impact in at least three areas. By developing techniques for analysis and verification of message-based interactions in concurrent and distributed systems, the research will improve the dependability of software systems in a wide variety of application domains, including e-commerce, consumer applications, and telecommunications. Secondly, the research activity will help to expose graduate and undergraduate students to analysis and verification problems in concurrent and distributed systems, and message-based communication, through a variety of educational activities including courses, seminars and individual research mentoring. Finally, the research activity will help to disseminate the knowledge, techniques and tools developed for analysis and verification of communicating systems through publishing in the open literature, and making the software tools available in public domain.</AbstractNarration>

We have considered these conditions and their verification in the context of different types of communication paradigms such as communication through dedicated channels versus shared channels.  Second, we investigated the problem of automatically checking whether or not a specified interaction pattern can be implemented or realized in practice. We have showed that if the specified patterns satisfy certain properties, then they can be realized. We proved that these properties can be verified efficiently. We have further investigated automated techniques for repairing specifications that are unrealizable such that the repaired version becomes realizable.  Third, we developed techniques for automatically extracting formal data models from web applications, automatically checking their properties by translating verification queries to logic queries and using existing theorem provers and then repairing the identified bugs based on specification patterns.  Fourth, we investigated properties of theoretical computation models that relate to verification of modern computer systems.  Synchronizability and realizability of message-passing asynchronous systems modeled as communicating finite state machines were open problems. As part of this project, we have proved that these problems are decidable and presented algorithms for checking synchronizability and realizability conditions.  We have also developed prototype tools and evaluated their applicability in several case studies in the domains of service-oriented computing, distributed software and Singularity OS.  We showed that automated verification of data models of web applications is feasible using existing theorem provers. We developed a set of techniques for formal data model extraction, property verification via translation to logic and pattern based property repair. We implemented these techniques in a tool called iDaVer for verification of web applications implemented in Ruby-on-Rails.  We have generalized and extended earlier results on automata-theoretic computation models and their application to automated verification.  The results obtained from our research directly impacts development of distributed software systems both in terms of verifying desired properties of developed software and in terms of ensuring the implementability of software with desired properties.  Our results on verification of data models can be used to improve dependability of web applications.  Our theoretical results on automata-theoretic computation models can be utilized in future verification techniques.  The research results have been published in several conference proceedings at premium venues such as WWW, VMCAI, POPL, ASE and FASE and many prestigious journals. One of the publications have been recognized with ACM SIGSOFTDistinguished paper award at ASE 2014.  In terms of contributions to learning and work-force development, the funding allocated to University of California, Santa Barbarahas been used to fund two PhD students who obtained their PhDs in 2014 and 2016.  The benefits of the research to the society at large include advances in verification and implementation of message-passing asynchronous communication protocols, which have become the typical paradigm in modern computing systems. Additionally, the research focuses on the fundamental computational limitations in developing and analyzing asynchronously communicating systems and identifies sub-classes of systems, where such limitations do not exist and, therefore, can be automatically developed and analyzed in practice.  Results obtained within the scope of this project have demonstrated that verification of data model properties in web applications is feasible. Many software applications are implemented as web applications and improving their dependability provides a significant benefit to the Nation and Society.  The research results obtained in this project not only make foundational contributions to computer science but also address real-life problems in the digital society, which increasingly relies on distributed and Internet-based computing.
