<AbstractNarration>The PI will study and attempt to improve the state of the art in fundamental areas of algorithms: linear time solution of systems of linear equations, matchings, and approximation.  The basis of the linear system work is the recent breakthrough work of Spielman and Teng and the follow up work of Koutis, Miller, and Peng, who gave very efficient, near linear time algorithms for solving a large class of linear systems. The ideas in this scheme are intertwined with graph partitioning and metric approximation which the PI has long researched.  The PI will also use ideas from Spielman and Teng to attack the matching or assignment problem; in particular, understanding graph sparsification techniques in terms of the matching problem. Finally, the investigator proposes to work on extending a recent breakthrough on the TSP problem that reduced the asymmetric version of the problem to one of finding a tree that crosses cuts expediently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solution of linear systems is central to a tremendous variety of engineering and scientific problems ranging from climate change, to building modeling, to jet engine design (essentially any problem dealing with simulating classical physics). The assignment problem which the PI proposes to investigate is central in numerous production and business applications: indeed, almost any application that assigns jobs to tasks efficiently. Finally, the TSP problem is a famously intriguing problem which is worth studying for its own sake and for the methodogical breakthroughs that its study typically leads to.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    One worked in conjuction with the project with Microsoft Research and Google Research on inventions for the web.   One followed a phenomenon called group chats on twitter where groups would "meet" via twitter on a schedule to chat about a topic; e.g., support group for parents of kids with cancer.  Another project worked on incenting people to review places to maximize information.     Another student developed improved optimization algorithms for problems which are termed packing/covering.  That is they try to maximize the utilization of a resource, or minimize resource use while ensuring certain requirements are met.  The algorithms improved on the speed of previous approaches.  They employ an optimization framework which is spawned from high school calculus but is extended into higher dimensions. The notion of derivative, in particular, fails for these types of problems.  Thus, the approach needs to smooth the original problems to form a differentiable function and then optimize.  The geometry of the function led to slow algorithms.  We re-engineered the approaches to work in a different space where standard optimization techniques would work faster.     We also studied lower bounds on algorithms to help guide the field. In particular we showed that certain types of opimization algorithms could not solve certain central problems called CSP.  This restricts the applicability of these programs called Sum of Squares hierarchies.  In contrast, we also pursued algorithms for these, supported by a later grant.
