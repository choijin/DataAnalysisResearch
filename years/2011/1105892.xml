<AbstractNarration>Plants capture the energy of sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water initially into carbohydrates, and then eventually into food and fiber that feeds and clothes the world's population. A major problem with this process is that the protein that carries out the incorporation (or fixation) of carbon dioxide into carbohydrate, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), is inefficient. This is because this enzyme also fixes atmospheric oxygen into products that the plant must break down and recycle. These processes of fixation by Rubisco of carbon dioxide and oxygen are in competition, and the fixation of oxygen is so large that over 30% of the light energy captured by a plant is wasted in this process. This project seeks to maximize the amount of carbon dioxide (and minimize the amount of oxygen) fixed by Rubisco by increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide inside the cell, where Rubisco is located. This will be accomplished by introducing a light-driven carbon-dioxide pump into the plant cell membrane, to move carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the cell. This pump will use infrared light, which is not required for photosynthesis, as its source of energy. In this project halorhodopsin will first move chloride ions into the cell, using the energy of light. The chloride ions will then move out of the cell and (through the action of a membrane protein called an antiporter) be exchanged for bicarbonate ions that move into the cell. The bicarbonate will then be decomposed (by an enzyme called anhydrase) into carbon dioxide and water, with the net result that carbon dioxide has been pumped into the cell by a light-driven process. In a second approach it is planned to re-engineer halorhodopsin to pump bicarbonate directly into the cell without using chloride ions as an intermediate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Large increases in crop yields can be expected from the more productive fixation of carbon dioxide that is the goal of this project. The new technologies derived from this project will provide tools and knowledge to boost photosynthetic capacity that should lead rapidly to applications in agricultural and industrial systems. The project will also include intensive research training for undergraduate and graduate students and for postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To enhance the uptake inorganic carbon  from the atmosphere by photosynthetic organisms, which can convert CO2 into sugars, we are engineering a class of proteins termed as rhodopsins.  Rhodopsins are naturally light-powered ion pumps; we are attempting to  convert them into bicarbonate pumps, to bring this form of inorganic carbon into cells. The rhodopsins that we are studying, halorhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin, naturally pump chloride and protons, respectively.     To be successful, we must convert the ion selectivity of the rhodopsin and then install it into a photosynthetic organism, where it must be located in the right area as well as in the correct orientation, so that the ion is pumped into the cell.  A second aim was to tune the light responding element of the pump to better capture the sunlight used by photosynthetic organisms.   Our third goal scaffold enzymes that could convert the bicarbonate into CO2 for immediate consumption by the enzymes that consume CO2 into sugars.  We are trying to do this inside of the photosynthetic organism The challenges associated with each of these engineering projects made this a high-risk, high-reward project.  The reward essentially is the enhancement of photosynthetic productivity of cyanobacteria; this also has the potential to be extended to the chloroplasts of algae and plants, thereby enhancing growth. This complex project was approached by breaking it down into smaller goals such as finding ways to consistently localize the pumps into the appropriate part of the cell, and developing high throughput approaches for screening large number of  rhodopsin variants for their ability to transport bicarbonate. Important insights have been gained in all the subparts of the project which makes the possibility of developing light driven bicarbonate transporter more likely to be achieved than ever before.   The project was an international collaboration and involved PhDs, graduate students and undergraduates all of whom gained new skills in bioengineering.
