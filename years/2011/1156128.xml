<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The study of bacterial cell surfaces is a topic of intense interest, and the Bacterial Cell Surfaces Gordon Research Conference has been one of the most useful and productive venues for bringing together new blood and old practitioners to keep this area vitally alive and to advance it in new and unexpected ways.  The Bacterial Cell Surfaces Gordon Research Conference will be held June 24-29,2012 in Mount Snow Resort, West Dover, Vermont.  The organizers of the conference include Kevin Young, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Tracy Palmer, University of Dundee, Scotland.  The Gordon Research Conference on Bacterial Cell Surfaces has been one of the largest and most&lt;br/&gt;successful of the Gordon Conferences since its establishment in 1971.  This conference will focus on the biogenesis, structure and function of bacterial envelopes and surfaces, including bacterial membranes, cell walls, surface appendages and polymers. The conference will include a diverse program of topics, model systems and approaches, combining biochemistry, molecular genetics, structural biology, biophysics, imaging and modeling. Oral presentations will be grouped into nine sessions: 1) Protein localization, 2) Secretion, 3) Cell morphogenesis, 4) Motility, chemotaxis and surface structures, 5) Special surface interactions, 6) Stress, transduction and transport, 7) Outer and inner membranes, 8) Cell wall, and 9) Cell division.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;With regard to educational value, the conference has a long history of showcasing investigators who are leaders in their field, while at the same time introducing new, young and early stage scientists. In addition to those young investigators scheduled for oral presentations, up to six poster presenters (typically postdoctoral fellows or graduate students) will be selected to give short talks during the morning sessions.  The current program includes 31 speakers and is diverse in nationality (11 international), gender (12 female) and seniority (15 established investigators, 6 intermediate career, and 10 young and emerging scientists).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[           The Gordon Research Conference on BACTERIAL CELL SURFACES was held at Mount Snow Resort, West Dover, Vermont, June 24 &ndash; 29, 2012. The Conference was well-attended with 199 participants (attendees list attached). The attendees represented the spectrum of endeavor in this field coming from academia, industry, and government laboratories, both U.S. and foreign scientists, senior researchers, young investigators, and students. Of the 199 attendees, 65 voluntarily responded to a general inquiry regarding ethnicity which appears on our registration forms. Of the 65 respondents, 17% were Minorities &ndash; 2% Hispanic, 12% Asian and 3% African American. Approximately 40% of the participants at the 2012 meeting were women.           In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.          Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
