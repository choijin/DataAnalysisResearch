<AbstractNarration>PI:  Erich Grotewold (The Ohio State University)&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs:  Andrea I Doseff (The Ohio State University and John Gray (University of Toledo)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Establishing the architecture of gene regulatory networks and linking system components to agronomic traits is an emerging theme in plant systems biology. This project provides a concerted effort to comprehensively dissect the gene regulatory networks that target the metabolism of maize phenolic compounds, such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids, of fundamental agricultural importance. This study combines the discovery of novel transcription factors (TFs) that control maize phenolic accumulation, with the identification of their interaction partners and of direct target genes for individual and TF combinations. The investigation of allelic TF preference to gene regulation will provide insights that will be applicable to grasses irrespective of ploidy level. The evolutionary conservation/divergence of identified TF-DNA complexes will be evaluated in other grasses, providing an unparalleled understanding of how evolution impacted plant gene regulatory systems, and resulting in knowledge directly applicable to cereal breeding. Together with the generation of a comprehensive and centralized maize transcription factor open reading frame (ORF) collection and antibodies to several regulatory proteins, these studies will significantly advance understanding of the regulation and evolution of one of the most important plant metabolic pathways in plants. The resources generated will be useful in accelerating the study of the regulation of other important metabolic and developmental pathways in maize and other grasses. The deployment of the data here generated through the Web-accessible knowledge base GRASSIUS (www.grassius.org) and MaizeGDB (www.maizegdb.org) will continue to ensure that the findings derived from this project will have the broadest possible dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematics, and bioinformatics for the comparative transcriptional genomics of phenolic compounds in grass crops. Its interdisciplinary nature provides unique opportunities for the training of students and postdocs across several disciplines. The strong history of involvement of students corresponding to underrepresented groups by the PI/co-PIs will be further expanded through the synergy provided by the interaction between Ohio State University, a land-grant university with a leading research component, and University of Toledo, a multicultural research extensive university with a strong education mission. Ongoing training will be complemented by the application of tools and resources developed here in workshops at Ohio State University and the University of Puerto Rico Mayag√ºez. The inception of SIGuE (Success In Graduate Education) program, specifically designed to increase the recruitment and success of underrepresented minorities in graduate education, provides a natural continuum in efforts to better connect undergraduate and graduate instruction.</AbstractNarration>

Establishing the architecture of gene regulatory networks and linking system components to agronomic traits is an emerging theme in plant systems biology. This project focused on the discovery of novel transcription factors that control the accumulation of phenolic compounds in maize. Phenolics (such as flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and lignin) are important for the growth and defense of plants against pathogens and environmental factors, and also for animal nutrition and health. We cloned the open reading frames of most of the maize transcription factors in recombination-ready vectors. This collection of 2,000+ clones was made available to the community, and used to determine which transcription factor interacts with which phenolic biosynthesis genes using the yeast one-hybrid method. We identified over 1,100 novel transcription factor-target gene interactions, and many were subsequently verified in maize using complementary approaches. All the data generated from this project can be accessed from the web-accessible knowledgebase GRASSIUS (grassius.org). These results provide a first step towards elucidating the gene regulatory networks that control the expression of maize genes. As part of this project, several initiatives that uniquely linked research and education were successfully developed.

The six SiGuE Fellows (four Hispanic, two African-American) that completed the program have been successful in continuing with graduate education. The Fostering Integration of Research and undergraduate Education (FIRE) program at the University of Toledo has so far involved 550 students, many of which decided to participate during or after the program in research. The two-weeks long Summer Practical Workshops in Functional Genomics, involving the training of PhD students, postdocs, young faculty and high-school teachers in cutting edge technologies applied to plant research, were held at The Ohio State University in 2012, 2014 and 2016 involving a total of 55 participants, primarily from smaller institutions with limited access to avant-garde technologies. These workshops were complemented with shorter, yet similar experiences in 2013 and 2015 at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayag&uuml;ez, specifically targeting undergraduate and MSc students, and junior faculty from various Puerto Rico campuses integrating practical, computational and lecture components.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Erich&nbsp;Grotewold</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
