<AbstractNarration>Despite much investigation, when and how the Tibet plateau attained its elevation is a major unresolved problem in Earth science. This is partly due to the fact that early history of plateau growth is unknown. In recent years, many researchers have emphasized the effects of early Cenozoic India-Asia collision on the timing of increased elevation of the Tibet plateau; however, mechanical modeling of this increase in elevation requires improved constraints on the initial boundary conditions that existed prior to the impingement of India with Asia. This project employs a multi-disciplinary test of the hypothesis that a proto-plateau resulted from crustal thickening due to Mesozoic continent-continent collisional systems along the Qiangtang terrane borderlands prior to the collision of India with Asia. Reconstructing the upper crustal configuration of eastern Tibet prior to the Indian collision is performed using methods in sedimentology, stratigraphy, structure, stable isotope paleoaltimetry, geochemistry, geochronology, and basin modeling of the Mesozoic Qamdo basin in southeastern Tibet. Investigations of paleoenvironmental data from study of sedimentary deposits reveal patterns of aridification to compare with those indicative of plateau development. Comparison of sedimentary provenance of Qamdo basin deposits with lithologies of surrounding structural highlands and the structural kinematic history of adjacent deformation belts is used to model tectonic evolution and surface configuration of the region. Oxygen isotopic composition of paleosol carbonates is employed to assess paleoelevation history of the area and detect possible episodes of plateau rise. Documenting this early history of Tibet plateau evolution is required to address several outstanding issues of scientific and societal importance. First, research results provide constraints on initial input parameters that will improve the calibration of mechanical models of plateau development, as well as the threshold conditions under which extrusion tectonism was later initiated in the region. Also, the geological history of the Tibet plateau is thought to be tightly linked to major changes in climate patterns and wholesale secular changes in ocean chemistry due to chemical influx from the rivers that drain the Tibet plateau. Because chemical erosion of rocks consumes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, erosion of the widespread uplifted region of the Tibet plateau, enhanced by a monsoonal climate, is a potential driver of global cooling episodes. Finally, the plate tectonic processes that formed the Tibet region bear the most relevance to the plate tectonic processes operating today that control the distribution of major seismic, volcanic, and mass wasting (e.g., landslide) hazards around the globe, as highlighted by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake centered on the eastern Tibet plateau margin. In addition to the scientific objectives of this project, it is supporting the training of two Ph.D. students and three undergraduate students in a STEM discipline. Scientific collaboration between students and faculty at West Virginia University (U.S.), the University of Alabama (U.S.), and Nanjing University (China), is an important component of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We applied field and laboratory geological methods to test the hypothesis that a &ldquo;proto-Tibet&rdquo; plateau existed in  eastern Tibet prior to the Cenozoic collision between India and Asia that produced the modern Tibetan plateau. Our work on establishing the origin of Late Triassic-Cretaceous marine-continental deposits of the Qamdo  basin revealed a long history of Mesozoic convergent tectonism including the closure of the Paleotethys, Mesotethys and Neotethys, all of which shaped the geology of southeastern Tibet. During Late Triassic, areas to the north and east of Qamdo uplifted&nbsp; due to closure of the Paleo-Tethyan Ganzi-Litang ocean. Sediment composition indicates geographical separation between Qamdo and the Early Jurassic Bangong volcanic arc until the Middle-Late Jurassic when the Mesotethys ocean basin closed, and the arc rocks were accreted along the southwestern margin of the Qamdo basin. Finally during Cretaceous, another regional uplift episode occured, likely due to shortening associated with closure of the Neotethys ocean as India approached Asia along the Gangdese subduction system.</p> <ol> </ol> <p>&nbsp;Paleoclimate was assesed for the Cretaceous using the  carbonate clumped isotope palaeothermometer (&Delta;<sub>47</sub>-T) and paleosol CO<sub>2</sub> paleobarometer on Qamdo pedogenic carbonate nodules. From this work, we estimate minimum summer temperatures in southeastern Tibet (~15&deg; N) during  mid-Cretaceous were ~30 &deg;C, with a warming of ~10 &deg;C associated with  major increases in pCO<sub>2</sub> levels. Temperature trends from our reconstruction match coeval estimates of tropical sea-surface  temperature (SST). Our most conservative estimate of climate  sensitivity during mid-Cretaceous yields a value of ~10 &deg;C per CO<sub>2</sub> doubling under high CO<sub>2</sub> &lsquo;super-greenhouse&rsquo; conditions, significantly higher than modern day  values of ~1.5-4.5 &deg;C suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change (IPCC).</p> <p>In addition, our work provided the first pre-Cenozoic paleoaltimetry results for the  southeastern Tibetan Plateau revealed through oxygen isotope and  clumped isotope paleoaltimetry techniques. Average &Delta;<sub>47</sub>-T  estimate of soil temperatures decreased from 45 &plusmn; 2&deg;C in the Turonian to  35 &plusmn; 2&deg;C by the Santonian, accompanied by a decrease in average values &delta;<sup>18</sup>O  values of soil water from ~-6.0&permil; to ~-8.0&permil; . Given SST reconstructions  for the Turonian-Santonian interval that indicate constant temperature  of ~35&deg;C, and assuming temperature and isotopic lapse rates of 6.5&deg;C/km  and 1.5&permil;/km, respectively, the observed&nbsp;&Delta;<sub>47</sub>-T and&nbsp;&delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>soil water</sub> shifts, we estimate a positive  elevation change of ~1.5 km occured in southern Qamdo basin by Campanian (~83  Ma) time. This interpretation is supported by synchronous changes in  strontium isotopes, development of growth strata, and changes in sediment provenance at this time that support influence from convergent margin tectonism. Our interpretation of paleo-surface elevation is supported by thermochronology data that  indicate more extensive high topography in the Yidun and eastern  Songpan-Ganzi terrane. We conclude that a low-elevation Late Cretaceous  &lsquo;proto-plateau&rsquo; had formed in the southeastern Tibet probably associated  with the compressional strain field created by the Lhasa-Qiangtang  collision. The modern-day high elevation of southeastern Tibet is  therefore partially inherited from the Late Cretaceous topography  developed prior to the India-Asian collision.</p> <p>This project supported the professional development of 2 early-career  faculty member of an underrepresented group in EPSCoR states. In  addition this project supported the training of 2 PhD students in Earth  science in the use of both field and laboratory methods. At least 1  undergraduate student was trained in sample preparation and analysis  techniques in zircon U-Pb geochronology, a widely used tool in many  earth science disciplines. Project results were presented in the 1st and 2nd joint meetings between  the Geological Society of China and the Geological Society of America,  which promotes the interaction between scientists from these two  countries.
