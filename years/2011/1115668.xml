<AbstractNarration>Numerical algebraic geometry involves the use of numerical methods to extract &lt;br/&gt;data from ideals about the corresponding varieties or schemes.  This area has &lt;br/&gt;grown rapidly over the last 20 years and has found applications in many areas &lt;br/&gt;of science and engineering.  This grant is funding four projects in the area &lt;br/&gt;of numerical algebraic geometry.  First, the PI and his students will &lt;br/&gt;investigate several forms of preconditioning for homotopy continuation, &lt;br/&gt;including algorithms for finding (near-)optimal multihomogeneous and linear &lt;br/&gt;product start systems, as well as the use of dual bases to reduce the number &lt;br/&gt;of paths tracked to "bad" endpoints.  Second, the PI and several collaborators &lt;br/&gt;will work on three application areas:  exceptional mechanisms (via fiber &lt;br/&gt;products), software in Macaulay2 for algebraic geometry-related applications, &lt;br/&gt;and software for repeated parameter homotopies.  Third, the PI will work on &lt;br/&gt;analyzing the complexity of numerical algebraic geometry algorithms.  Finally, &lt;br/&gt;the PI and several collaborators will continue to work on methods to extract &lt;br/&gt;information about real algebraic sets both from standard continuation methods &lt;br/&gt;and from Khovanskii-Rolle continuation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polynomial systems of equations arise in many places throughout mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;science, and engineering. An entire mathematical field - algebraic geometry - &lt;br/&gt;grew out of the need to find solutions to these sorts of equations. Until the &lt;br/&gt;1960s, though, there was no known general technique for solving such systems &lt;br/&gt;of equations. The methods developed in that era require too much memory to be &lt;br/&gt;effective except for relatively small problems. More recently developed &lt;br/&gt;methods - the numerical methods of Sommese, Verschelde, Wampler, Li, and &lt;br/&gt;others, now collectively known as numerical algebraic geometry - allow for the &lt;br/&gt;solution of much larger polynomial systems, opening the application of &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry methods to a wider class of problems. However, there is &lt;br/&gt;still much to understand about these numerical methods. The goals of this &lt;br/&gt;project include addressing four open problems in this direction.  This work &lt;br/&gt;includes the development of techniques to streamline some of these &lt;br/&gt;computations, the implementation of valuable algorithms in popular and useful &lt;br/&gt;software packages, a careful analysis of the computational costs associated &lt;br/&gt;with the computational methods in this field, and the continued effort to &lt;br/&gt;extract useful real-world data from the data provided as output from these &lt;br/&gt;methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Polynomial systems arise in many disciplines throughout the sciences and engineering.  A fundamental computational math problem is to approximate the solutions of polynomial systems. This is the core problem of the field of numerical algebraic geometry.  This award supported several developments in this direction, encompassing the intellectual merit of the projects supported by this award.   First, given a polynomial system, there are ways of algebraically mainpulating the system to make numerical solving methods perform more efficiently and/or more accurately.  Similarly, there are now ways to exploit the geometry of the problem to avoid particularly difficult subproblems.  Several such "preconditioning" techniques were developed under this award.   Second, existing numerical methods for polynomial systems are known to work well at finding all solutions over the complex numbers, but finding real number solutions has always been (and continues to be) a challenge.  Two real number methods were developed under this award, along with partial support for two corresponding software packages (galeDuality and Bertini_real, both publicly available and free of charge to download and use).  Third, computational tools are only useful if available in easy-to-use software packages.  This award partially supported an interface between a standard numerical solver (Bertini) and a well-known computational algebraic geometry package (Macaulay2).  Another software package (Paramotopy, implementing parameter homotopies for use on large computer clusters) was also partially developed under this award.  Finally, the techniques developed under this award (and other methods from numerical algebraic geometry) were applied to a broad range of applications from STEM disciplines.  In one such project, the geometry of the parameter space of a biochemical reaction network was studied, leading to surprising, previously unknown results about the dynamics of the network.  This would not have been feasible without Paramotopy (described above).  In another such project, a new method for determining optimal configurations for cooperating robotic mechanisms was developed.  Given two linkages in planned to be in close proximity, this technique (again, based on Paramotopy) tells the user how best to position them to support one another in the case of a free-swinging joint failure in one of the linkages.  This form of redundant design is particularly useful for mechanisms used in hard-to-reach or dangerous locations, such as in space or when managing nuclear waste.  Aside from the applications described above and those that will come later, the broader impacts of this award include the training of six young mathematicians, four of whom have now completed their PhD and entered the workforce.  The other two will finish within two years.  This award allowed these students extra time to hone their skills as researchers, along with increased professional development opportunities such as training in pedagogy, professional presentations, and grant writing.  All told, this award contributed to significant forward progress in the numeical solution of polynomial systems (to be used across a variety of STEM disciplines)  and the training of six young experts who will apply these tools to various problems during their careers.
