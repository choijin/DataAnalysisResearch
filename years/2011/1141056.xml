<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project is bringing high-priority science results and data from the NSF-funded MARGINS program, an interdisciplinary study of the processes and evolution of continental margins, into undergraduate geoscience courses.  The project team, comprising experts in continental-margin research and geoscience education, is working with a user community to create, assess and disseminate a coherent set of modular mini-lessons and course segments for upper-division courses that engage students with cutting-edge findings on rupturing continental lithosphere, subduction processes, seismogenesis, and sediment dispersal from sources to sinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this project lies in the integration of research and education by transforming high-quality MARGINS science into educational resources for undergraduate classrooms. The Broader Impacts of this project lie in the multi-institutional effort to disseminate MARGINS science, offering scientists a powerful means of increasing the impact of their own research, while creating portable curricular resources to educate and engage geoscience students across a range of courses and institutional types.</AbstractNarration>
