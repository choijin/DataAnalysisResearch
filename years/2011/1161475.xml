<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to study the fundamental mechanisms of a recently discovered, highly efficient artificial photosynthesis process utilizing cobalt or iron nanostructures to directly convert carbon dioxide and water into hydrocarbon fuels with solar energy in a simple reaction chamber. The project will address fundamental questions encountered in preliminary research: What is the mechanism of photosynthesis on nanostructured metal surfaces? How does the morphology of the femtosecond laser nano/micro-machined surface and the presence of a three-phase (gas/liquid/solid) interface affect the photosynthesis rate? Answers to these questions will be obtained by studying key aspects of the artificial photosynthesis process such as (a) the surface plasmon optical absorption for light harvesting; (b) the rates of photodissociation and hydrocarbon synthesis; and (c) the lifetime/durability of the metal nanostructures for long-term use. Based on the knowledge acquired through this research, a cost-effective photosynthesis manufacturing process on a large scale can be found to meet global energy needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the proposed research will enable scientists to overcome key existing barriers to large-scale applications of the artificial photosynthesis technology. Efficient artificial photosynthesis would reduce the global energy problem, decrease the dependence of the United States on foreign imports and fossil fuels, and address environmental concerns such as the high carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Information on the properties of the metal nanostructures will also be of value to other fields where nanostructures and photo-physics/chemistry/biology are widely used, such as medicine, environment, chemical production, military, and security. The proposed method is also potentially applicable to fertilizer production with sunlight to greatly impact agriculture. The proposed work will contribute to nurturing multidisciplinary scientists and engineers through research-based education.</AbstractNarration>
