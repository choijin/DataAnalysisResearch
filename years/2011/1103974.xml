<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the logical strength of a mathematical theorem&mdash;i.e., how difficult the theorem is to prove, what techniques are needed to do so, and which other theorems can be proved using similar methods&mdash;helps us better understand the theorem and its applications. Reverse mathematics is an area of mathematical logic devoted to classifying theorems according to this strength, providing a common framework in which to compare and contrast theorems and constructions from disparate areas of mathematics. The results of these comparisons are consequently not only of interest to logicians, but also to mathematicians working outside of logic, whose fieldsÃ† underpinnings are elucidated by these results.  This project has yielded fundamental insights into the strengths of various theorems from across mathematics, including combinatorics, algebra, set theory, and model theory. Most notably, it has obtained revealing new results on the strength of Ramsey's theorem, which has long been one of the central points of interest in several areas of mathematical logic. The project has also analyzed theorems previously inaccessible in the framework of reverse mathematics, such as the finite intersection principle&mdash;a well-known equivalent of the axiom of choice in set theory&mdash;and obtained surprising connections between it and theorems from computability theory and model theory. These results have generated new technical and conceptual tools for carrying out and extending the reverse mathematical analysis, and spawned links with new fields, such as computable analysis, that are now being continued by the PI and a number of other researches.      Research in reverse mathematics and logic is interdisciplinary by nature, and the present project has extended its scope beyond even mathematics, to include cognitive science and philosophy. A number of the results of this project have applied logical methods to quantitative problems in these disciplines, and have established fruitful and ongoing new research collaborations. The PI has also involved students, at both the undergraduate and graduate level, and from diverse backgrounds, in this project, which has served to promote and enhance interest in logic and, more broadly, the mathematical sciences.
