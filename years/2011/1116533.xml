<AbstractNarration>The project studies three important domains which highlight physical Human-Robot Interaction involved in assisting humans in the home and workplace: (1) human guidance through cluttered environments using physical contact, (2) cooperative carrying of large objects through complex and dynamic environments, and (3) robot assisted sitting and getting up.  This is accomplished through the evolution of an experimental single-wheel mobility platform into an autonomous robot that is instructed and guided by people in a natural way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such systems are needed in many public health domains, including care for the elderly, rehabilitation and assistive programs. Project results are incorporated into coursework offered by two different departments at CMU, and exposes students to unique robot planning, control and Human-Robot Interaction issues.  High school students are introduced to this area as part of the Andrew Leap program.  Students from underrepresented groups participate through the ARTSI program.  Results may be presented in cooperation with museums or entertainment companies.</AbstractNarration>

The robot is the vanguard of a new class of mobile robots called "ballbots," which balance in place and move about in indoor environments using a single, spherical wheel. The particular emphasis of the research is to explore how such ballbots can interact physically with people by the exchange of forces.  This field of endeavor is referred to as physical human-robot interaction, or pHRI.  The ballbot can move at human walking speed along tortuous curved paths and is capable of navigating through a building by referring to a stored map.  Most importantly, the ballbot responds compliantly when touched or shoved, allowing safe, gentle interaction. This behavior is unique to ballbots, and is not found in traditional mobile robots. Three specific interactions were investigated: leading a person by the hand; assistance in rising from a chair; and cooperative carrying of a bulky object.  At the outset, numerous physical and computational improvements were made to the ballbot platform to support pHRI.  Among these was the addition of a pan/tilt turret on the top of the ballbot with a 3D camera, laser rangefinder, array microphone, and speakers.  We added speech dialog capability so the ballbot could speak and understand simple speech commands.  We made many changes to the ballbot's software, adopting the popular Robot Operating System to make it easier to develop new capabilities.  New motion planning algorithm: A ballbot must constantly balance and carefully maintain the relationship between its center of mass and the point of support beneath the ball wheel on the floor. Motion planning for ballbots is not straightforward because it must always respect the natural dynamics of the machine according to the laws of physics.  We invented a new method for planning motion trajectories for ballbots, based on a property called "differential flatness."  The new method allows ballbots to move gracefully and rapidly along lengthy paths inside a building, while avoiding stationary obstacles and moving obstacles such as people.

Performance greatly exceeds that of traditional statically stable mobile robots as well as humanoid robots.  Experiments in physical human robot interaction show the potential for using this type of robot for human assistance applications, especially for elderly or sight-impaired individuals. Several faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students participated in the research.       Last Modified: 10/28/2015       Submitted by: Ralph L Hollis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
