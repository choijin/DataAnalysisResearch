<AbstractNarration>Advanced vehicle control systems are becoming more sophisticated on today's vehicles for both safety and propulsion. This results in an increasing demand for highly skilled automotive technicians to maintain and repair these complex systems.  Currently, training for testing and repair of these systems is limited to manufacturer and dealer channels.  A large unmet demand in the secondary repair market exists.  J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC) in collaboration with City College of San Francisco, Southside Virginia Community College and James Madison University will develop three courses in advanced vehicle control systems including laboratory exercises, pilot the courses in traditional class format, and refine, convert and deliver them in distance learning format.  The project will also provide students with applied research experience and disseminate the results nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include developing course and laboratory materials that can be adopted by other institutions, spurring the training of advanced vehicle control technologies in two-year schools nationwide,  and addressing the unmet demand for high-tech automotive technicians.  The project plans to host statewide conference to demonstrate the programs and laboratories in Virginia and California.  A national web-based symposium will also be developed to facilitate the dissemination of the project results.  Presentations will be given in regional and national conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advanced vehicle control systems are becoming standard on todayÆs vehicles. There is a growing national need for highly skilled technicians to maintain these complex systems. These new systems consist of modular components with complex diagnostic procedures, thereby changing the repair and testing methods required to service the vehicles. Unfortunately, education in these methods is currently limited to manufacturer and dealer channels. Hence, there is a large, unaddressed demand in the secondary repair market.    During the early stages of this project two critical elements were identified: 1.) the safety and advanced electronic systems of todayÆs vehicles present significant challenges for entry level automotive technology students, and 2.) the traditional delivery of automotive education in semester long sessions presented barriers to student learning and mastery.   Addressing these critical elements required adaptations to the original schedule so that specialty training aids could be designed and constructed for hands-on instruction. The instructional delivery of this material was modified so that foundational content was presented through two online courses with a separate hands-on lab oriented course. Coincidentally, this delivery model replicated what many automotive manufacturers use for their in-service technicians.  Based on the experience grained through this project and the feedback from industry, further modification to the delivery methodology needs to occur. The instructional delivery modification needs to focus on deconstructing the sixteen (16) week, three to four credit hour course into smaller duration units equivalent to one to two credit hour course values.
