<AbstractNarration>IIP 1134843 &lt;br/&gt;Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) &lt;br/&gt;Clancy &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech proposes to join the Security and Software Engineering Center (S2ERC), an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) which currently is a multi-university Center comprised of Ball State (lead institution), and the Iowa State University. The center focuses on improving the management of the software engineering process, the productivity of software engineers, and the security, quality and timeliness of software engineering products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech (VT) requests funding for becoming a third site of the NSF Center for Security and Software Engineering Center (S2ERC) under the leadership of Professor T. Charles Clancy. The addition of Virginia Tech faculty and from the National Capital Region will promote S2ERC reputation as the premier I/UCRC in two research areas critical to the country, namely software engineering and security. The seventeen VT faculty who are planning to participate in the S2ERC will increase the Center's research capabilities in areas such as software/system security, hardware and embedded system security, wireless network and spectrum security, enterprise and internet security, modeling and simulation of dynamic cyber systems, and cyber law, policy and business. While some of these research areas represent new capabilities in the S2ERC, others will strengthen current expertise in the Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of Virginia Tech to S2ERC will enable the existing center to access the broad array of Northern Virginia companies focused in this area. The combination of location and current federal research strategy will allow this center to be at the nexus of an extremely important research topic and one that industry is highly interested in cutting edge research results. Additionally, Virginia Tech has an international footprint, operating in five countries. VT plans to have an extremely diverse pool of students and faculty involved in the center. Students will benefit from laboratory work and interaction with NSA and other agencies in Northern Virginia along with coursework in cyber security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Virginia Tech joined the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center Program (I/UCRC) as a site member in the Security and Software Engineering Research Center (S2ERC) in 2011.  The major goals of Virginia Tech as a site within the S2ERC I/UCRC is to enable relevant research that provides leap-ahead capabilities in software and security engineering; this research provides invaluable opportunities for students and faculty to advance the state of the discipline and contribute to the greater body of knowledge to our domain.  Virginia Tech seeks to leverage the research performed in S2ERC to generate deeper interest from industry members and grow relationships into deeper and longer lasting engagements that produce even more ambitious advances in science and technology within software and security engineering, to the benefit of the industry (and often our nation) as a whole.  Over the past program year, Virginia Tech has been able to fully fund eight graduate students, and partially fund another six graduate students via S2ERC funded research. Additionally, five undergraduate students were able to be guided through research in either a wage position or with undergraduate research credits. Over the entire grant, over 60 graduate students participated.  These students have had an opportunity to present the findings of their work to S2ERC members, their peers, and the university community and S2ERC Showcases, meetings with S2ERC members, and at the Graduate Student Seminar Series hosted by the Hume Center at Virginia Tech.    Involvement in S2ERC is highly impactful to students and faculty alike, both in providing deep experiential learning to students within the technical discipline and also in applying science to the specific interests of industry affiliates. Students and faculty gain experience presenting their materials, both written and oral, and have the opportunity to defend their research among a critical real-world audience through participation in regular affiliate interactions and at bi-annual showcases. S2REC unequivocally provides opportunities for collaboration between academia and industry that would otherwise be unavailable, and these experiences benefit all parties involved. In addition, student participation in S2ERC frequently leads to workforce development opportunities for our members, including internships and full-time job offers.  Two key technology transition successes for the program include one patent filed and issued, and a venture-backed university spin-off company whose core seed research was partially funded through a S2ERC project.  Virginia Tech submitted and was awarded its renewal proposal for Phase 2 continuation.       Last Modified: 09/29/2017       Submitted by: T. Charles Clancy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
