<AbstractNarration>In this collaborative project the Principal Investigators (PIs) will&lt;br/&gt;investigate mathematical models for topological phases of matter and their&lt;br/&gt;application to the nascent field of quantum information.  Examples of&lt;br/&gt;topological phases of matter include Fractional Quantum Hall liquids and&lt;br/&gt;topological insulators: materials subjected to extreme physical conditions&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. near zero Kelvin, under large magnetic forces) which appear to&lt;br/&gt;exhibit topological behavior.  The main objectives of the project are to&lt;br/&gt;better understand the taxonomy of these exotic states of matter through&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models, address physically and computationally motivated&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems, and apply topological and algebraic methods to&lt;br/&gt;study them. For example, the issue of quantum computational power&lt;br/&gt;(universality) may be analyzed by finding the images of the braid groups&lt;br/&gt;under representations associated to a particular model. Moreover, the&lt;br/&gt;extant hypothesized models for topological states of matter do not capture&lt;br/&gt;all of the subtleties (such as fermionic topological order) so the PIs&lt;br/&gt;will develop new models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classical states of matter of solid, liquid and gas have more refined&lt;br/&gt;classifications: for example, solid crystals may be differentiated by&lt;br/&gt;their symmetries.  Newly discovered topological materials have yet to be&lt;br/&gt;fully understood, but potentially can be used to build (quantum)&lt;br/&gt;computational devices out-performing standard micro-chip based computers.&lt;br/&gt;The most commonly encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum&lt;br/&gt;circuit model, requires challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the&lt;br/&gt;hardware to be of practical value due to local interactions of the system&lt;br/&gt;with the surrounding environment. The topological model based on exotic&lt;br/&gt;states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in&lt;br/&gt;tolerance for such interactions. The PIs will mathematically study these&lt;br/&gt;exotic states of matter focusing on their application to new computational&lt;br/&gt;paradigms with potentially significant benefit to society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Physical systems are often studied through their symmetries--transformations that leave the system unchanged.  In solid state physics, for example, crystal structures are typically classified using the corresponding space group.  Topological phases of matter are characterized as having topological symmetry--small local perturbations do not change the overall state of the system.  These exotic states of matter may appear as 2-dimensional emergent phenomena, when certain materials are subjected to low temperatures and large magnetic forces as in the fractional quantum Hall effect illustrated below.    Such materials have the potential to be the hardware for topological quantum computers, which can be visualized as creating, braiding, and measuring particle-like defects visualized as follows:    In this project we studied foundational questions on the detection, distinguishability and utility of these systems through their mathematical models.    One highlight of our work is a proof of a long-standing conjecture that there are only finitely many distinct models with a prescribed number of distinguishable particle types.  This makes a taxonomy for topological phases feasible, and we have completely classified systems with up to 5 distinguishable particles.  A second major problem addressed in the project is the computational power of topological quantum computers corresponding to a given model.  We must determine if any given quantum operation can be achieved (up to some prescribed error).  We have conjectured that this question can be answered indirectly by a fairly simple measurement of the particle's quantum dimension.  We have now verified this conjecture for the large class of models associated with quantum groups.  An even more fundamental question is how to determine if a particle is "non-abelian", that is, if there are two braiding operations on a system of such particles so that the order in which they are performed produces different results.  The well-publicized (see e.g. The Gaurdian, 5 October 2014) search for the "Majorana fermion" is motivated by the quest for non-abelian particles in nature.  We have shown that, as above, it is enough to measure the quantum dimension of the particle: if it is not equal to 1, then the particle is non-abelian.  Broader Impacts  Through our efforts, both directly and indirectly funded, a vertically integrated research group on the mathematics of topological phases and applications is now well-established and growing.  Rowell's Texas A&amp;M research group has included 2 postdocs, 5 PhD students and 2 undergraduates, with one woman in each category.  One of these PhD students has graduated  and is now forming a new research group on topological quantum computation at a national lab.  The broader research group now includes industry (Microsoft), academia (Texas A&amp;M and others) and national labs (PNNL).  Researchers at all levels are being recruited and trained: Rowell co-organized a workshop for graduate students and postdocs at Snowbird, Utah in 2014, and a similar conference in Colombia in 2015. Another conference will take place in Oaxaca, Mexico in 2016 to engage researchers in the broader mathematics community.  Topological quantum computing has a potentially tranformative impact on the scientific community and the broader public.  On June 23, 2014 the New York Times published an article describing Microsoft's involvement.  Progress such as was achieved in this project will sustain this area of research and deepen the impacts at all levels.
