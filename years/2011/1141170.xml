<AbstractNarration>Computer science educators recognize that rapid advances in technology and the emergence of a global economy make it essential to national competitiveness to expose students from all disciplines to the ideas of computational thinking. Computational thinking includes a broad range of mental tools and concepts from computer science that empower specialists in all disciplines to more effectively adopt, use and develop computational tools to solve problems, design systems and understand human behavior. To adequately prepare a workforce for the changing economic and global landscape, the project is developing a model that enables students with diverse perspectives and disciplinary backgrounds to learn how to collaborate and integrate concepts from their respective fields to develop technology-based solutions for complex real-world problems. The model includes collaboration with a community partner, making it practical for the many campuses with community engaged learning curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach is deeply rooted in the considerable research base on pedagogy in computer science, the liberal arts and journalism, as well as how students learn. The project is demonstrating how to adapt computer science and non-computer science courses, and is developing a suite of assessment instruments to measure outcomes for participants. The model is replicable for a wide range of computing-dependent disciplines and local community partners. Through multidisciplinary, collaborative and immersion experiences, undergraduate students better internalize how to take responsibility for engaged citizenship in a complex and diverse society, while advancing their critical, analytic and computational thinking.</AbstractNarration>

The goals for project were to formalize a model for courses that collaborate across disciplinary boundaries and with a community partner; create an experiential and engaging learning environment through which to immerse both computer science (CS) and non-CS majors in computational thinking (CT); to study the collaborative learning environment; and to articulate the processes, products, challenges and effective strategies that manifest collaborative problem solving.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span> </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The pilot project was a multi-semester study of the impact on student perceptions of their computational thinking abilities as a result of collaboration between students in CS and journalism courses to solve a problem for a community partner, Habitat for Humanity. Quantitative and qualitative instruments were developed to measure the outcomes in this study, and can contribute to the knowledge base of STEM workforce preparedness in computing. Computational thinking can be broadly defined as a way of solving problems that draws on concepts fundamental to CS. It has been described as a group phenomenon that can assist specialists in other disciplines to more effectively adopt, use, and develop computational tools. It is therefore reasonable to infer that collaborative learning environments are conducive to fostering this vital set of competencies. Classes focused on computational problem solving in a group context also afford students the opportunity to hone communication and collaboration skills beyond the classroom, and to understand how computer science is applied to particular knowledge domains.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span> </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Many interdisciplinary computing collaborations in upper-level CS courses have been with other STEM disciplines. However, non-STEM fields that have been transformed by computer science can also serve as test beds for curricular innovation; journalism is one such field. In this study, undergraduate students in CS and journalism courses focused on creating a computational solution to address a real community need, and we investigated whether immersion in multidisciplinary collaborative experiences increases the computational thinking abilities of both CS and non-CS students. Forty-one CS students participated in the study alongside 96 students in other STEM and non-STEM majors. Quantitative data were collected to gauge students' attainment of concepts and skills constitutive to computational thinking.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span> </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Pre-test data indicate that CS students were no different from other STEM students in their own assessment of computational thinking and skills. Post-test data indicate that while all students made significant gains in self-assessment of skills and knowledge, CS majors fared significantly better than their peers. The data also indicate gains in computational thinking among the students in the collaborating journalism classes. The gains for the digital arts students outpaced those of the journalism students, however, journalism students expressed increased motivation to acquire more computing skills. This result has particular value for journalism education research, where the inculcation of computational thinking has become a priority. The project also demonstrates that complex &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; problems can be incorporated into the curriculum without sacrificing the learning goals of rigorous courses.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span> </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>All students increased their sentiment of local efficacy, indicating that after participating in the collaboration, they increased their sense of responsibility for and ability to make a difference in their immediate communities. CS students, who reported a much lower sense of local efficacy than the students in the journalism classes at the outset, demonstrated the same levels of local efficacy as their journalism classmates in the post-test. The collaboration thus had a positive impact on all students in terms of increasing their sense of local efficacy, but this impact was much stronger among CS students. While the model was designed to make computational thinking more attractive and relevant to people from underrepresented groups, there was not enough diversity by gender or race / ethnicity in these courses to determine whether the model had an impact. Since all students experienced gains in computational thinking and because research indicates that service learning increases motivation among historically underrepresented groups, we believe our model holds promise for diversifying the computational workforce, and for increasing computational skills among students from more diverse majors, such as journalism.</span></p> <p><span>One significant spin-off project to emerge from this research is Trenton Makes Music (</span><a href="http://trentonmakesmusic.org/"><span>http://trentonmakesmusic.org</span></a><span>), a digital humanities project to document the music history of New Jersey&rsquo;s capital city. This collaboration between faculty and students in journalism, digital arts, music technology, local artists and the Trenton public schools and public library employs the CABECT curricular model of collaborating classes and jointly-developed digital artifacts. Among other outcomes from that project, the project directors will begin presenting workshops for secondary school teachers on using digital tools and collaborative models to have students investigate their own communities.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Sarah&nbsp;M&nbsp;Pulimood</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1141170/1141170_10171978_1511828408781_Model--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1141170/1141170_10171978_1511828408781_Model--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CurricularModel"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1141170/1141170_10171978_1511828408781_Model--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CurricularModel"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Model for courses that collaborate across disciplinary boundaries and with a community partner</div> <div class="imageCredit">S.
