The conference was held in September 2011 in Austin, TX.  This was the 13th year of the conference, which convened more than 200 researchers doing key work in  High Performance Computing.  High Performance Computing is a key enabler of US research and economic competitiveness.   This conference brings together professionals to work on all aspects of building and using cluster computing systems, including system architecture, networking, I/O, and applications research.   Attendees were from universities, national laboratories, and the private sector.   This project supported 41 students to attend the conference from US Universities, including 34 PhD students, 2 master's students, and 5 undergraduates.   Twenty-nine of the students gave presentations, submitted papers, or presented posters at the meeting.  Many of the students attended tutorials to improve their professional skills.   Members of the conference committee served as mentors to the students, and met with them at conference sessions and networking events.  All of the students had the opportunity to meet and interact with professionals in their chosen field of study, beyond their colleagues at their home universities.   The opportunity to attend conferences such as this are important aspects of these future STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) professionals overall career development.
