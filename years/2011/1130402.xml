<AbstractNarration>This project will provide U.S. students with the opportunity to gain international research experience in verifying and designing nanometer silicon-based nanometer integrated computing and communication systems. U.S. students will spend four weeks per year at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. This project will support the collaborative research and education activities between the MSLAB Lab at University of California at Riverside and the Design Automation Lab (EDA) at Tsinghua University of China.  The team will jointly tackle the challenges of verifying  and designing  silicon-based nanometer VLSI systems.  The collaborative research projects will focus on the efficient statistical full-chip power estimation considering process variations with spatial correlations and chip yield improvement techniques due to power and timing variations. U.S. students will jointly develop new statistical leakage, dynamic and total power estimation techniques and statistical chip yield optimization techniques for design and optimization of nanometer high performance integrated computing and communication systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The proposed collaborative educational and research activities will provide unique training, mentoring, networking and intellectual development opportunities for U.S. students. Such international engagement will benefit the students' entire careers and help improve their competitiveness and competency as scientists and engineers.  Finally, the joint research will strengthen existing computer engineering research and education programs, and broaden the collaborative research works at UC Riverside in synergy with one well-recognized and funded research program in China.  The curriculum and textbook development will boost the VLSI design technique research at UC Riverside and promote the statistical VLSI performance modeling and estimation field as a scholarly discipline.</AbstractNarration>

Performance bound analysis of analog circuits in time domain  The new method, called TIDBA, consists of several steps to compute the bound performances in time domain. First the performance bound in frequency domain is computed for a linearized analog circuits by an variational symbolic analysis method and  the Kharitonov's functions. Then the time domain performance bound is computed via a new general-signal transient bound analysis method. Experimental results from two industry benchmark circuits show that TIDBA gives the correct bounds for the Monte Carlo analysis while it delivers one order of magnitude speedup over the Monte Carlo method.  2. Parallel Monte Carlo statistical analysis of analog circuits using graph-based approaches based on GPU platforms  We proposed a new parallel statistical analysis method for large analog circuits using determinant decision diagram (DDD) based graph technique based on GPU platforms. We designed novel data structures to represent the DDD graphs in the GPUs to enable fast memory access of massive parallel threads for computing the numerical values of DDD graphs.  By using heretical DDD (HDDD), we can analyze even larger analog circuits. The resulting algorithm is a general-purpose matrix solver suitable for fine-grain massive GPU-based computing for any circuit matrices.  Experimental results show that the new evaluation algorithm can achieve about two orders of magnitude speedup over the serial CPU based evaluation and more than 4X speedup over numerical SPICE-based simulation method on some large analog circuits.  3. Performance bound and yield analysis of analog circuits based on optimization techniques in frequency domain and time domain.  We developed a worse case or performance bound analysis method in frequency domain.  The new method first derives the transfer functions of linear (or linearized) analog circuits via a graph-based symbolic analysis method. Then frequency response bounds of the transfer functions in terms of magnitude and phase are obtained by a nonlinear constrained optimization technique. Experimental results showed that the new method can achieve similar accuracy while delivers 20 times speedup over Monte Carlo simulation of HSPICE on some typical analog circuits.  For time domain analysis, performance expressions are obtained,  then   time-domain performance response bound of current time step were  obtained by a nonlinear constrained optimization process subject to the parameter variations and variational circuit state bounds computed from the previous time step.   xperimental results show tha...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
