<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on Haitian diaspora groups and their networks within the U.S. and transnationally to understand their role in fostering disaster resilience and recovery after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. We focus on two main questions: 1) How do diaspora groups influence long-term post-disaster recovery and resilience through transnational advocacy efforts?  2) How do diaspora groups function as organizational and social networks in the context of disaster recovery? The study area will focus on areas with large concentrations of Haitian-American populations and diaspora groups: South Florida, New York, Boston/MA, and the Atlanta area in Georgia.  These areas are where approximately 80 percent of the Haitian-American diaspora reside and are also where most Haitian-American diaspora coalitions and groups are based. In-depth interviews and online surveys will serve as the primary research method, and will be conducted with members of Haitian-American community groups, as well as other key stakeholders including: non-profit organizations, local, state, and federal officials, international aid organizations, and immigration officials and advocates. We will also conduct secondary data analysis of pre-existing plans and policies and relevant government documents. Social Network Analysis (SNA) will be used as a tool to map the structure and type of diaspora networks, including familial, kinship, and social networks, along with formal coordination and cooperation patterns with government and non-governmental organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will transform and extend knowledge and theories related to the international dimensions of recovery. Studying diaspora networks in host countries and in the international community is also new and unique and will advance scholarly and practical understandings of transnational social capital, capacity, and coordination in the continuum of disaster response to long term recovery and rebuilding. Potential contributions span and benefit those in disciplines that are involved with disaster planning and recovery, social network ties and related analyses, emergency management, homeland security, infrastructure planning, post-disaster economic development, evacuation, sheltering, and housing recovery. This research will ultimately help host communities, advocacy groups, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and international aid agencies in developing mechanisms to foster disaster recovery, development, and for effective resource allocation, along with informing responses to future disasters and disaster-induced migration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research has helped shed light on how diaspora groups, non-profits, and international organizations affect disaster recovery processes, and their roles in building disaster resilience, a phenomenon that occurs frequently in countries dependent on international assistance. It has also helped fill gaps in knowledge about transnational networks and policy actors, housing concerns for displaced populations, and how levels of collaboration can impact long-term disaster recovery.  Intellectual Merit:    The outcomes of this project with respect to intellectual merit are:  1)      The results have extended existing knowledge and theories related to networks by applying them to diaspora groups and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs); there is very little existing work on the extent of collaboration  between diaspora groups and local and international NGOs after disaster.  2)      This research contributes to knowledge on the effects of social capital and collaboration among networks of voluntary groups, non-governmental organizations, transnational policy actors, and local, state, and federal agencies. It also highlights how street-level bureaucrats and host communities respond to transboundary disasters and governance issues.  3)      This project has applied and extended social network and organizational concepts such as centrality, power structures, homophily, resource dependency, and other analytical constructs to enhance scholarly and practical understandings of transnational social capital, capacity and coordination, the role of local and international actors and patterns of interaction within and among them in the continuum of disaster response to long term recovery and rebuilding. This project collected data from a unique dataset provided by an umbrella INGO and transformed it for use in a Social Network Analysis model to understand the extent and structure of network relationships among INGOs working in Haiti. The results are shedding light on how levels of collaboration affected disaster recovery and providing lessons for future work in this area.      4)      The results have provided new understandings of post-disaster housing dilemmas and the role played by NGOs and their networks in housing provision. Some of the key insights gained in these areas are: NGOs need to pay more attention to the sustainability of their interventions, particularly in developing countries; rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, aid organizations need to develop long-term relationships and understand local political and economic environments, societal and cultural norms, accompanying infrastructure needs, and end-user preferences; aid organizations need to develop adaptive resilience and build their own organizational capacities; and better coordination and oversight of third sector organizations is needed. Taken together, these findings contribute to emergent discourses on disaster recovery theories within a global context.   Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this study are:  1)      This research contributes to improved understandings of how migrant groups such as the Haitian diaspora lay down civic and community roots and their participation in disaster recovery policies and processes domestically and transnationally.  2)      This study highlights the international dimensions of disaster recovery, addressing a critical gap in the literature. Diaspora groups and NGOs are likely to be significant in disaster relief and recovery in their home and host countries, but their role is understudied and poorly understood. On a practical level, this research can help international aid groups and host country governments better understand how they could harness the power of diaspora groups and NGOs to further recovery, rebuilding, and longer-term societal resilience. 3)      The directory of Haitian-Diaspora organizations created in this project provides a resource to international and other aid organizations interested in leveraging the knowledge and expertise of these organizations. It also provides the smaller, minority-led organizations with information about other diaspora organizations within their region and in other parts of the country with whom they could collaborate and allows other organizations to learn about them. Our hope is that the directory of NGOs will ultimately help state and non-state agencies and communities in developing mechanisms to: foster collaboration and coordination during pre-disaster preparedness and mitigation and post-disaster recovery; to facilitate resource allocation; and, to inform appropriate responses to future disasters. 4)      The research is also useful for the Haitian diaspora, particularly those in South Florida, Boston, New York and Atlanta who were interviewed for this project and who will continue to play a critical role in long-term recovery in Haiti. 5)      The project has enhanced research and education through mentoring, training, and funding students (including those of Haitian descent) in several different research methods (qualitative methods, social network analysis, and survey research) and policy and disaster management theories. 6)      The products of this research have been broadly disseminated through publications and educational courseware including research articles, conference papers, presentations, an edited (forthcoming) book on housing recovery, which includes chapters on  displacement, the politics of recovery, and the role of NGOs, course syllabi and material on diversity and social vulnerability, inlcuding key issues of resilience and recovery for a capstone course, an undergraduate course in an Honors program, and through a project website to disseminate key results.
