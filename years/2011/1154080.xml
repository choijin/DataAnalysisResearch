<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for 12 United States researchers to attend an international meeting on ?Synergy with and Learning from Nature? to be held on October 20-22, 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey. The goal of the meeting is to bring together diverse research communities to identify research areas that will advance knowledge both in engineering and physical sciences as well as in life sciences. Specifically, the meeting will focus on the understanding and design of engineering systems that are in synergy with and learning from nature. The meeting is co-sponsored by the European Science Foundation (ESF), the Turkish Science and Technology Council (TUBITAK), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), the National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC), and the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM). It will be attended by experts from all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key outcome of the meeting will be an international research agenda designed to help funding agencies to prioritize the investment of their research funds in the area of advanced sensors and sensor-based decision making and control.  A secondary outcome of the meeting will be encouragement to women and minorities to become involved in this area of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An international Workshop on "Synergy with and Learning from Nature" was held on October 20-22, 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey. The Workshop was co-sponsored by the European Science Foundation (ESF), the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the Turkish Scientific and Technological Research Council (TUBITAK),  the National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC), the Korean Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM), and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).  The Workshop brought together scientists and engineers from different countries who were active in this field to discuss and determine research directions that were inspired by nature.  The participating funding agencies would consider the recommendations made by the Workshop participants in their funding plans and strategies.  9 scientists and engineers from the US and 29 participants from Europe, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan participated in the Workshop. Amongst US participants are 3 women and 1 assistant professor.  Four focused topics with important societal implications were discussed:  Bio-inspired Design, Innovation &amp; Architecture Sensing &amp; Self-X (Adapting) Materials Energy Plant (Animal) Perspective Health Engineering-inspired Physiology   Working groups were formed during the Workshop to identify critical issues and potential research opportunities in these four topical areas. Possible roadmaps leading to large scale, multi-country, multi-institutional global collaborations to address these issues were explored.  A Science Policy Briefing, "Nature-Inspired Science and Engineering for a Sustainable Future", was produced in June 2012 as the result of the Workshop (attached to this report). The Briefing addresses the opportunities, the challenges, and policy implications in this exciting research area.  Broader impacts of the Workshop include:  It broght together researchers in life sciences and engineering and physical sciences to explore issues in the interdisciplinary areas inspired by nature. It helped form international collaborations among researchers from three different continents, US, Europe and Asia. It involved the next generation of researchers in the planning of new research directions.        Last Modified: 06/05/2013       Submitted by: K.  Jimmy Hsia]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
