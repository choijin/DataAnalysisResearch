<AbstractNarration>The proposed project is a follow-up and expansion of preious research using stable isotope analysis and paleo-DNA to discuss the population history from four locations, the Chaluka midden site, Shiprock, and Kagamil caves, in the Eastern Aleutians, using samples from human and non-human faunal remains.  The original project addressed hypotheses concerning the biological difference between ?Paleo? and ?Neo-Aleuts,? originally defined using craniometrics and cranial morphology and concluded that the differences did not reflect wholesale population replacement as had previously been hypothesized.    The results from Coltrain?s previous analysis suggested that the historic populations in different localities differentially used terrestrial and marine subsistence resources.  This project would expand the suite of stable isotopes, specifically sulfur to separate food taxa, carbon isotopes from bone apatite, oxygen isotopes as a proxy for temperature levels, and compound-specific nitrogen to separate specific amino acids.  Analysis of these various isotopes would allow the researcher to more closely identify the diets of the individuals represented in the historic populations and provide more specific evidence for a separation of diet between the same population, rather than the skeletal sample representing two separate populations as previously thought.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was designed to reconstruct the foraging activities and radiocarbon age of a large collection of prehistoric burials from the Eastern Aleutian Islands. Prehistoric groups living in the Eastern Aleutians subsisted virtually entirely on marine fish, sea mammals and sea birds.

Most studies of this type identify animal bones associated with archaeological sites and the types of tools and weapons used to acquire foods in order to reconstruct ancient diets. While these techniques are informative, they do not allow archaeologists to examine gender or age differences in diet and how diets changed over time. To address more detailed questions about ancient Aleutian diets, we radiocarbon dated and analyzed the stable isotope chemistry of bone collagen (protein) and bone hydroxyapatite (mineral) for 80 individuals from three, well-known prehistoric sites in the Eastern Aleutians, Chaluka Midden on Umnak Island and the Shiprock and Kagamil Island burial caves. Middens are large collections of refuse discarded by prehistoric people and may contain human remains as well as animal bone, broken tools and other utilitarian items. Chaluka Midden is several hundred feet long and wide as well as more than 20 feet deep and records 4,000 years or more of near continuous occupation on Umnak Island, yielding skeletal remains and 4,000+ artifacts.
