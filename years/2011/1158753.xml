<AbstractNarration>This is an ambitious project that has the potential to fill in important gaps in the overall picture of orogenesis in the central Andes, and of convergent-margin tectonism in general. The project is constructed around a well defined basic-science question, did the Andes rise in a rapid pulse, or did they rise gradually? Producing elevations and crustal thicknesses of the magnitude found in this study area remains a key problem in continental tectonics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This question provides a foundation from which the PIs develop a variety of linked projects, including: 3-D structural analysis of fold-thrust belt shortening in the Andes, testing of new methods of paleo-elevation analysis, use of seismic studies to characterize the roots of the range (both in the deep crust and in the underlying mantle), creative use of petrologic and isotopic data to constrain thickened crust at times in the past. The project has the potential to address 3-D mass balance issues during orogeny, as well as the impact of a rising mountain belt on continent-scale weather systems. Of note, to put the analysis of orographic weather studies in context, the PIs will also undertake a broader paleo-climate study. All of the questions to be studied are current and important, and are of interest across traditional disciplinary boundaries and, the research strategy as outlined has a high potential to answer the questions that it poses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EarthÆs mountains have long been recognized as one of the primary observable features that show plate tectonic modification of the planetary surface. From early on, geologists have observed that the planetÆs highest mountains are also where the crust is unusually thick. At the simplest level, mountain range elevation is comparable to an iceberg floating at sea. Based on ArchimedesÆ principle of buoyancy, the height of an iceberg above water is related to the weight of water it displaces below the water line. The thicker the ice is, the higher the iceberg will appear to be. In the case of a mountain range, the "ice" is the mountain range crust floating on a "sea" of hot, semi-fluid rocks that make up the earthÆs mantle. The thicker the crust is, the higher the mountain range will be. The Himalayas and the Andes both have peak elevations greater than 6 km surrounding low-relief plateaus perched at ~3.5&ndash;5 km above sea level.
