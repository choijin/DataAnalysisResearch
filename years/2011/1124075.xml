<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) Program and the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF, Professor Echegoyen from the University of Texas-El Paso and Professors Martin, Poblet and Torres from Spain will synthesize, isolate, and characterize a series of new fullerene derivatives with highly unusual electronic properties. Some of the new derivatives will possess one or more attached ferrocene or ruthenocene groups to five-membered rings on the surface of endohedral fullerenes, to yield the first endohedral buckymetallocenes ever reported. Electronic coupling between the exo- and endohedral metal species will be measured and analyzed. The properties of these new compounds will be fully characterized using a wide variety of techniques, especially electrochemistry, looking for endo-exo interactions and their relationship to the overall properties. In a second project, a new series of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) based on newly designed porphyrins and phthalocyanine linkers will be prepared, in an effort to obtain COFs with relatively large pore sizes. The ability to incorporate fullerenes inside these COF pores will be probed with a variety of techniques to try to assess if Donor-Acceptor (D-A) interactions exist and how strong they are. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fullerenes, also called 'Buckyballs' are all-carbon compounds with unique and somewhat unusual electronic properties that make them useful in many applications, for example in solar cells. They are closed carbon structures (the one possessing only 60 carbons is identical to a soccer ball) and are capable of undergoing chemical reactions on their surfaces. Fullerenes that encapsulate other species inside, such as clusters of other atoms, are called endohedral fullerenes, and these have very interesting and unique electronic properties. Many reactions have been used to functionalize the surfaces of fullerenes, both empty as well as endohedral, but some unique ones will be explored in the present work, especially on the endohedral compounds. The resulting compounds will be characterized and their properties measured, specifically looking at potential applications in solar photovoltaics. Besides the immediate educational experience and mentoring provided to the undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project, the most profound broader impact of this project derives from the commitment of the US Principle Investigator (PI) to recruit and educate underrepresented minorities in his laboratories. The PI actively recruits Puerto Rican and other Hispanic and minority students to his labs as evidenced by the fact that 14 of his 22 PhD graduates have been Hispanic. In addition to actively mentoring underrepresented minority students (Hispanics primarily), this project involves very strong international collaborations with three different research groups in Spain, two being synthetically oriented and one theoretical. The PI has a long and fruitful history in both of these broader impact areas and these are expected to continue under the present grant.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Some of the main scientific contributions that resulted from the work supported under this grant are: 1) the discovery, isolation and characterization of a new dimetallic sulfide clusterfullerene that contains only titanium, a transition metal, in the entrapped cluster (Ti2S), inside a C78 carbon cage with D3h symmetry. All previously reported endohedral clusterfullerenes contained at least one rare earth metal inside, which are very expensive, while Ti is relatively inexpensive. Clusterfullerenes are carbon cages containing groups of atoms (clusters) that are non-covalently trapped, but mechanically and electrostatically encapsulated inside the cage, see Figure 1; 2) the preparation and isolation of another new clusterfullerene, with formula Sc2S@C70 where the cage possesses C2 symmetry, never observed before, see Figure 2; 3) the development of a new procedure to purify clusterfullerenes based on their differences in redox potential, a property that reflects their natural tendency to accept or donate electrons, see Figure 3; and 4) the analysis of the most fundamental properties of clusterfullerenes using a combination of electrochemistry and a technique called Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). We were able to add one extra electron to and remove one electron from a compound with formula Sc4O2@C80, which provided very detailed information, never seen before, about the electronic distribution inside these unique caged molecules, see Figure 4.     As important or more important than the scientific accomplishments briefly described above, the students and postdoctoral participants in this ICC project were significantly impacted by the international collaboration, which involved the exchange of several students, some coming from Spain to UTEP for short, medium and extended stays and others going to spend time in the laboratories of the collaborators in Madrid. These exchanges impacted the students directly involved but also the rest of the research group members since the social and cultural aspects are not limited to the direct participants. The friendships and connections catalyzed by these exchanges will have a long range impact in all students, both personally and professionally. The exact value of these benefits is difficult to assess but in our ever expanding globalization efforts and the increasingly flat world, these students will certainly have an edge.
