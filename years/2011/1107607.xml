<AbstractNarration>The scientific goals and methods that address the intellectual merits of the research are: (1) Expand on existing lake monitoring sites in northern Alaska by developing a network of regionally representative lakes along environmental gradients from which we will collect baseline data to assess current physical, chemical, and biological lake characteristics.  This will allow the project scientists to make spatial and temporal comparisons to determine the impact of warmer temperatures, changing cloud cover and precipitation patterns, permafrost degradation, and direct human impacts on lakes; (2) Implement a multiscale (hierarchical) lake instrumentation scheme such that basic data is collected from 51 lakes, while a subset of lakes are more intensively instrumented; (3) Provide regional scaling and extrapolation of key metrics through calibration and validation of satellite imagery with ground measurements; and (4) Develop and implement standardized protocols to enable inter-site comparison and to prepare for expansion towards a pan-Arctic network. The education/outreach goals that address the broader impacts of the research outlined above are: (1) Incorporate indigenous observations of lake physical and biological characteristics and changes. Innovative interactive methods of sharing information will be developed and made available through native and local organizations. Scientific and technical training will be provided to IÃ±upiat students for monitoring lake and drinking water quality; (2) Develop a demonstration monitoring network based on the Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) architecture and link this network to research centers, indigenous communities, and other power- and connectivity-challenged environments; (3) Develop and refine data management, visualization, and archiving activities with A-CADIS; and (4) Provide an introduction to Arctic science for several beginning investigators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Northern Alaska is characterized by thousands of lakes that have developed in permafrost, as shown in Figure 1.  Although lakes are good recorders of climate effects and are harbingers of climate shifts, very little information has been collected from these Arctic lakes because they are remote and difficult to access.  One of the primary scientific goals of this project was to collect physical, chemical and biological baseline data from about 60 regionally representative lakes along environmental gradients. The purpose was to make spatial and temporal comparisons to determine the impact of warmer temperatures, changing cloud cover and precipitation patterns, permafrost degradation, and direct human impacts on lakes. The intent was to develop and implement standardized protocols to enable inter-site comparison and to prepare for expansion towards a pan-Arctic network.       Each lake was visited in late winter to measure ice and snow thickness, and to deploy instruments through the ice.  Figure 2a and 2b summarize winter severity (expressed as Freezing Degree Days or FDD) and average ice/snow thickness for the 10 lake nodes labeled in Figure 1.  The record is for the period 2012-2015.  The pattern shows that winters generally warmed during the first three years, while ice thickness declined. Winter 2014-15 slightly reversed this trend.  Early snow accumulation explains some of the interannual and intersite variability. On average, the ice was about 150 cm thick over the study area.  What is especially interesting is that ice thickness measured in the late 1950s was about 200 cm, so the ice cover appears to be getting thinner owing to warmer temperatures observed regionally.       These lakes tend to be shallow, often less than 2 m in depth.  This means that, in the recent past, lakes would typically freeze to the bottom in winter except in the deeper central pool.  If the ice cover is getting thinner, a smaller portion of the lake is freezing to the bottom in winter.  This shift has important implications for the lake energy balance, the water temperature, timing of ice freezeback and meltout, and lake biota as shown in Figures 3a and 3b.  What is clear is that the temperature of the lake bottom sediments will increase over time, and could eventually lead to the formation of an unfrozen zone beneath the lake that will penetrate the thick permafrost.  Our studies have shown there is considerable methane emitted from these lakes that has a deep underground source, and that methane emission would increase if the permafrost is punctured by many warming-induced conduits.       On the treeless tundra, winds tend to be quite strong.  During especially windy conditions, lake water begins to circulate and forms large 3-dimensional gyres as shown in Figure 4.  Lakes in this image are typically blue, but on this windy day lake bottom sediment was entrained and outlines the circulation patterns of sediment erosion, transportation and deposition.  This supports the contended hypothesis that the pronounced lake orientation observed in the image is likely due to the wind-induced circulation patterns.       Lake water temperature patterns in summer demonstrate that lakes further south become ice-free about 2 weeks earlier than those near the coast.  This is partly due to their more southerly latitude, but also reflects the impact of cool, cloudy conditions near the Arctic Ocean which inhibits melt.  Because of the longer ice-free season and sunnier weather, inland lakes tend to average several degrees warmer.  Analysis of the water chemistry samples shows that lake water is very pure and pristine, although lakes adjacent to the ocean can contain some impurities.
