<AbstractNarration>The FCC released its National Broadband Plan citing the exponentially growing demand for mobile data services and the critical need to better utilize the radio spectrum.  Beyond retargeting certain frequency bands, the FCC is considering a paradigm shift of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technology and policy.  DSA allows 'secondary' radios to transmit in underutilized 'white space' provided they create minimal interference to 'primary' radios.  Significant white space, as much as 85%, has been observed across time, frequency, and location.  However, even in the TV bands, the challenge of inconspicuous utilization of white spaces has not yet been achieved by the two leading solutions, distributed spectrum sensing and centralized emitter databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on a comprehensive approach to DSA based upon spectrum sensing that combines the following in a feedback loop: novel modeling of primary and secondary transmissions; design of optimal spectrum sensing algorithms and secondary access protocols based upon these models; and experimental validation within a testbed of software-defined radios.  Preliminary results develop primary Markov models and optimal sequence detection algorithms for spectrum sensing that build upon the well-known Viterbi and forward-backward algorithms and expose fundamental limitations due to primary mismatch for the commonly used energy detector.  The connections to trellis- and graph-based algorithms from the channel coding community should introduce a sizable new toolbox to DSA researchers.  Secondary access protocols that take advantage of Markov process models for the primary users similarly exhibit improved performance tradeoffs between primary interference and secondary throughput.  Collaborators in industry and regulatory bodies will be kept informed of the research results with an aim toward impacting DSA technology and policy development at national and international levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The radio frequency (RF) spectrum is the natural resource required by all wireless systems &ndash; Cellular, WiFi, Public Safety &amp; Military, and Broadcasing. Viable spectrum below 6 GHz is crowded with many static allocations to different wireless technologies, but not all of it is utilized efficiently.  For example, there is a large band of spectrum around 3.5 GHz that is currently allocated to government radars that are only infrequently operated, and even then only along the coasts  A Notre Dame team led by Prof. J. Nicholas Laneman and several graduate students has been working on rethinking how wireless devices of the future will dynamically share spectrum. They have developed several patented and patent-pending algorithms for finding vacant or unused spectrum, a technique broadly referred to as spectrum sensing, and have designed communication waveforms that take advantage of available spectrum without causing harmful interference. These technologies can be integrated with spectrum databases and other spectrum access systems for a variety of applications.      This project has enabled communication system researchers from electrical engineering to become more aware of the policy and regulatory issues surrounding interference among heterogeneous wireless systems. This awareness has led to new models and algorithms that incorporate risks which can be parameterized using regulatory or policy inputs. In addition to a number peer-reviewed research publications in top-tier journals, the project has supported real-world prototyping of the models and algorithms using software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, and thereby enabled experimental validation and demonstration to wider audiences.  The unique SDR testbed and world-leading expertise developed through this project will enable Notre Dame researchers to continue making significant contributions to this important area of national need for years to come.
