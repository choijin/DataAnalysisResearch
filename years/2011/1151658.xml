<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the research of Professors Michael W. Crowder and David L. Tierney of Miami University.  Professors Crowder and Tierney will probe molecular motions in enzymes during catalysis using rapid freeze quench double electron-electron resonance (RFQ-DEER) spectroscopy.  Enzymes are not static biomolecules; rather, the catalytic activities of most enzymes require highly coordinated motions of loops, helices, and other structural features of the enzymes for the biochemical reactions to proceed. While there are a number of techniques already available to probe enzyme motions, many of these techniques require large quantities of enzyme and large assumptions to interpret the data. The technique to be optimized in this work is amenable to conditions of low enzyme concentration. The methodology developed in these proposed studies will address important issues that affect how applicable the technique will be to other systems, such as (1) determining the range of reaction times that can be reliably interrogated with this technique, (2) exploring varying spin labels to ascertain which work best for this technique, (3) optimizing the RFQ process for the collection of samples for Q-band DEER, and (4) developing methods to handle multi-subunit proteins.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this project include training of undergraduate and graduate students in enzymology, modern EPR spectroscopy, and molecular biology.  If successful, the proposed methodology could find broader scientific impact in the evaluation of enzyme motions during catalysis across a significant range of enzyme systems. The investigtors will continue their involvement in community outreach, such as hosting an annual Science Week for elementary school children and making presentations on antibiotic resistance to local non-science audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main goal of this project was to develop a method to probe the motions of enzymes during catalysis. Enzymes are remarkable biomolecules that can catalyze difficult biochemical reactions, most often at low temperatures and at physiological conditions. Catalysis is thought to occur by motions of different parts of the enzyme; however, there are very few methods to directly probe these motions. We hypothesized to use a technique, called double electron electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, to measure the distances between two positions on the enzyme as the enzyme catalyzes a chemical reaction. In order to measure the distances, we needed to stop the chemical reactions at very short time points, such as millisecond (one-thousandths of a second) or microsecond (one-millionth of a second) time points. The rationale was that we would stop the reactions at different time points and measure the distances between the positions on the enzyme(s). To stop the reactions at specific time points, we hypothesized to use a rapid-freeze quench (RFQ) system, in which the enzyme and a chemical are rapidly mixed and frozen quickly at discrete time points (the freezing stops the chemical reactions). The specific aims of this project were (1)&nbsp; to evaluate the range of reaction times that could be used with our RFQ system, (2) to evaluate different chemical probes, which we use to measure the distances between positions on the enzyme, (3) to optimize the freezing technique to make the best samples for DEER spectroscopy, and (4) to expand our method to be used on more complex enzymes. During the three year granting period, we were able to accomplish all of our specific aims. Our data show that our RFQ-DEER system can detect enzyme motions during catalysis.

We are planning to test a novel RFQ systems that has &gt;5 times faster quench times to further extend the use of this technique to enzymes that are more catalytically active. This work is important because detailed knowledge of the reaction catalyzed by an enzyme may lead to the design and preparation of small molecule inhibitors.
