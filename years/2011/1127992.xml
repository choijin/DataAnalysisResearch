<AbstractNarration>In this project the research team will examine how intergovernmental grants shape agents' preferences so that the agents' choices will be influenced beyond the lifespan of a grant program. In particular, the project focuses on how federal grants may shape the preferences of local governments. The work is based on an "informed principals-learning agents" (IP-LA) framework which argues that the information, shared risk, and policy learning produced through grant application and implementation alter the preferences and goals of agents so that the desired behaviors should persist. In this model, preferences are endogenous to strategy, which contrasts with most principal-agent models that assume fixed preferences. The research will analyze the impact of energy efficiency and conservation grants on the energy program and sustainability preferences of local governments and whether municipalities continue existing programs, alter or reconfigure programs, or discontinue them after federal funds have been exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this work addresses practical policy issues involved in the design and implementation of intergovernmental programs, especially targeted one-shot grants. The outcomes of this research can inform policy designs and implementation strategies, especially in new or rapidly expanding policy arenas such local energy/climate policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study investigated local implementation process and implementation delays experienced in the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program, a component of the American Recovery and Reinvestments Act (ARRA).  The findings of this research extend and enrich political science and public administration theories of intergovernmental policy implementation and governmental contracting within grant programs.  The results of this study have implications for governmental operations and grant management with potential for improving implementation success of intergovernmental grant programs.  The findings identify the important role that goal alignment among federal and local stakeholders, has for reducing delay in the implementation of federal grants supported programs by local governments and their contractors.  Additionally, local resource capacities and specific grant management processes and contract mechanisms such as full and open competitive bidding, contract recession and outcome based performance measurement were found to be predictors of successful program implementation at the city level.   This research also makes a unique contribution to understanding intergovernmental grants by advancing and testing an "informed principals and leaning agents" that posits that grants can induce action by subordinate governments beyond the grant period.  This theory is supported by tracking and modeling grant recipients programs and policy actions over time.  The findings of this analysis provides empirical evidence that the durability of policy actions is linked to policy learning and capacity building in the implementation of federal grant programs.
