<AbstractNarration>Network data have become common in a wide range of fields, and a large and diverse community of researchers have studied various aspects of networks, yet statistical methods are rarely applied. This project proposes new theory, methodology, and algorithms that take a principled statistical approach to these problems, assess uncertainty, and establish conditions for desirable properties such as consistency.  The focus is primarily on discovering community structure in networks, a common phenomenon in practice and a fundamental question in network analysis.   New pseudo-likelihood algorithms are proposed for fitting the block model for networks, as well as several generalizations that allow for non-uniform degree distribution within blocks, removing the main limitation of the classic block model.   The pseudo-likelihood based on aggregated data substantially speeds up computation, allowing fitting these models to larger and sparser networks than previously possible.   The asymptotic distribution of criteria used for community detection is also studied, which leads to development of significance tests for community structure, consistency conditions, and asymptotically correct partition thresholds, which have important practical implications.  New, more robust criteria are also proposed, consistent under weaker conditions.  The proposal also develops a formal non-parametric test for comparing two networks, a problem that arises frequently in practice but is currently addressed only through informal comparisons of summary statistics.   Finally, covariates on nodes and edges are incorporated into the models and used for predicting unobserved links in the networks.  Many of the proposed methods provide the first statistical solutions to the corresponding network problems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of statistical methods for community detection in networks, while contributing to the development of core statistical theory and methodology, has direct impact on the interdisciplinary field of network analysis and the study of complex networks.  The applications of these are wide-spread, covering such diverse areas as infectious disease modeling, national security, communications, sociology, and genomics.   The new statistical tools proposed take a more formal, rigorous approach, and have the potential to change how many scientists approach network analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Network data have become common in a wide range of fields, such as communications, sociology, epidemiology, and genetics.   Networks consist of nodes and edges connecting some of the nodes;  they are a mathematical representation of observed relationships between people or objects, such as friendships in a social network.   This project focused on the area of network science concerned with community detection, which means discovering parts of the network that form close-knit groups.   This is of interest to sociologists in friendship networks, biologists in gene or protein networks, and security specialists in communication networks.   Our focus has been on developing statistically sound and scalable algorithms for discovering communities; one of the algorithms we developed under this project can process a network of ten million nodes in under a minute and is the current state of the art both in speed and in accuracy.  We also focused on incorporating richer and more realistic scenarios into community detection.   One such scenario is when additional information is available about the nodes; for example, age, gender, race, and education information may be available in a social network and influences community formation.   Another scenario is when communities overlap and people belong to more than one community at a time; for example,you may be friends with people on a social network because they are your neighbors, colleagues, classmates, or exercise buddies, and some people fall into more than one category.   We have also done theoretical analysis of community detection for sparse networks (networks with a relatively small number of edges) to determine the minimum number of edges that has to be observed in a network of a given size to guarantee a given level of accuracy in community detection.
