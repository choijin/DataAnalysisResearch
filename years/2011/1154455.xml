<AbstractNarration>A unique feature of the Enhancing Ecological Education Scholarship Program at Paul Smith's College is its setting: the college is embedded in the Adirondack Park in upstate New York.  Within this 6 million acre natural resource, the College recruits students who are passionate about careers in Environmental Science and Fisheries &amp; Wildlife Science and are academically talented, yet are financially needy. Particularly targeting students transferring from two-year institutions and first-generation college students, the program supports them financially (with scholarships up to four years) and academically.  Students join research laboratories at the College such as those in the Adirondack Watershed Institute and the Center for Adirondack Biodiversity to enhance their commitment to STEM careers.  This experience strengthens their performance on their senior capstone project which is required of all Paul Smith's graduates.  Numerous mechanisms at Paul Smith's identify challenges early and offer strategies to address challenges as well as provide opportunities for students to develop their scientific expertise.  This enhances students' persistence as science majors through graduation and primes them to compete for jobs in the natural sciences.  Of the scholarship recipients, it is expected that 90% will complete a bachelor's degree and either join the work force or continue to graduate school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Preparing undergraduates for careers in the natural sciences, specifically those in natural resources was the goal of Enhancing Ecological Education (E3) program at Paul Smith?s College.  Over the course of 5 years, $500,000 was awarded to 28 undergraduate science majors with the intent of supporting them to become scientists.  During the academic year, all students participated weekly in science seminars and graduate style research (lab and field).  Science seminars ranged from discussions on classic work in science to exercises such as engaging in the "gamification of ecology".  Research projects focused on plants and vertebrates of the Adirondacks, the location of the college.  The research groups made real contributions to the body knowledge in a variety of areas: bog ecology, bird-window mortality, snowshoe hare behavior, deer behavior, effects of climate change on amphibians, and developing "greener" methods for laboratory techniques.   Twenty-six students stayed with the program until they graduated or the program ended. 100% of these students graduated or were on track to graduate on time or early (4 years or less of college).  Nearly every full time science faculty member at the college participated in the project.  Faculty led seminars, mentored research, traveled with students to conferences, and guided students in seeking summer and permanent jobs as well as graduate school.  Students successfully found paid summer employment in their fields including Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs).  The majority of graduates are working in natural resources.  Four of the students are pursuing master?s degrees (such as Wildlife Ecology and Anthrozoology) while two others have begun PhD programs (Aquatic Ecology and Plant Science &amp; Ecology).  Several other students intend on pursuing graduate studies after work experience in the natural resources. Thus, we conservatively estimate that 80% (21/26) of the PSC E3 students will successfully seek careers or graduate studies in natural resources.   Many of the students at Paul Smith?s College are the first in their families to attend college and lived in small, rural communities where high school science courses are minimally supported.  We believed that offering students the chance to engage in real life research and to benefit from individualized support in the pursuit of science careers would result in students recognizing themselves as capable scientists.  We also thought they would benefit by 1) becoming more proficient in the scientific process, and 2) receiving support necessary to pursue science careers (ex., guidance in applying to graduate school).  Students participated fully in the scientific process, from reviewing literature to designing studies and collecting/analyzing data.  All students but one attended at least one science conference where they presented the results of their research.  Over the course of five years, S-STEM students attended scientific conferences/meetings in 8 states, presented 23 posters/oral presentations, and published 3 articles in peer reviewed, scientific literature.  S-STEM covered travel costs (travel would not have been possible without the S-STEM grant).  Students also communicated with the broader community by presenting at a local library and nature center; and reaching out to a local newspaper reporter who covers environmental stories.  In addition, the students answered a request from a nature center on how to reduce the numbers of birds hitting windows.  The intent of the financial support was to relieve students of the need to find paid work outside of class, thereby freeing their time to collaborate on research projects with faculty.  We discovered that students still were really busy (athletics, tutoring, off campus jobs). The financial support did not result necessarily in students having more time and many still worked a part-time job.  Some of the highly academically capable students were engaged by the desire to protect natural resources rather than the science.  The E3 experience did not change their career trajectories in the short term (1-4 years after graduation).  We will continue to follow this small group of students as they may still benefit from their experience. We also concluded that support from families and perhaps the cultural perception of science careers (as we discussed when we read a book by Carl Sagan) played an important role in whether or not the students decided to pursue careers in science. In light of these findings, we submitted a proposal for another S-STEM grant which will 1) provide the same high level of scientific experience to science students, and 2) allow us to experimentally investigate how family and culture can help science students to develop careers as scientists.
