<AbstractNarration>The evolutionary relationships amongst species in the order Brassicales (which includes approximately 4550 species, the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, and many economically important crop species), are currently poorly known. Knowledge of these relationships is required to interpret the wealth of genomic, developmental, and physiological data available for this group within an evolutionary context. This study will resolve the phylogenetic relationships within the order Brassicales utilizing hundreds of loci encoded across the nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genomes. In addition, this project will investigate diversification rates and the evolution of each genome compartment (i.e. nuclear and organellar genomes) -- including genome size, gene content (e.g. gene loss and duplications, novel gene functions), and genome structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cultivated and wild Brassicales species possess numerous novel traits and chemistries with enormous value to crop improvement, including biotic resistances (e.g. insects, fungi, and nematodes) and abiotic stress tolerances (e.g. drought, freezing, and heavy metals). In addition, this plant group shares novel chemistries that are beneficial to human health, including treatments for cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. This research will enhance our understanding of which species share these beneficial novel biochemistries and traits, and characterizing the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Ultimately, this framework will allow these traits to be targeted for pharmaceuticals and to improve crops.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Missouri, this project trained people visiting from other universities.  For public outreach, we developed and organized a three-week science project based learning (PBL) module at Lewis and Clark Middle School, included four classrooms of 7th graders (over 100 students), and involved learning the basics of plant genetics and performing multiple independent experiments utilizing the plant model Brassica rapa.  The results of our research were presented at research findings at several international conferences (Plant and Animal Genome Conference, International Botanical Conference, and Botany meeting), local meetings at the University of Missouri, and at the Missouri State Capital in front of an audience of state politicians.
