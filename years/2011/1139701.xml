<AbstractNarration>The vital importance of gaining a better understanding of seismic (earthquake) and volcanic hazards and risks related to the process of subduction was dramatically underscored by the recent megathrust earthquake in Japan, and its catastrophic consequences. A heavily populated region of North America that is subject to similarly conditions is Cascadia, which extends from southern British Columbia to northernmost California. The Cascadia Initiative (CI) is an onshore/offshore seismic and geodetic experiment that will deploy an array of seismometers on the seafloor to complement an array of stations onshore, with the aim of addressing questions ranging from megathrust earthquakes to volcanic arc structure to the formation, deformation and hydration of the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates. These diverse targets are components of the overall subduction zone system and require an array of seismometers crosses the shoreline and encompasses relevant plate boundaries. The experimental design and objectives, specified at meeting held in Portland, Oregon in 2010, are described in the NSF Cascadia Initiative Workshop Report, which spells out the scientific objectives of the CI, the resources involved and the community-defined OBS deployment plan. This award will support a team of scientists tocaary out and oversee the first year of CI OBS deployments (summer 2011), the planning and operational efforts of the Cascadia Initiative Expedition Team (CIET) and the initial Education and Outreach (E&amp;O) effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chief broader impact of the Cascadia Initiative is its very high societal relevance. Achieving a better understanding of seismicity and volcanism in regions such as Cascadia is key to mitigating risks and planning for the potentially devastating effects of volcanic eruptions and great earthquakes. This proposal includes important outreach and education activities as well. The CIET Education and Outreach program will develop two opportunities during the first year. First, the 'CC@sea' project will support community college ('CC') student participation in OBS deployment, retrieval and pre-cruise and follow-up outreach activities in CCs, high schools and the community. The second Cascadia Initiative E&amp;O program develops activities in high school classrooms in Oregon (initially), Washington and northern California.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The Cascadia Initiative was an onshore/offshore seismic and geodetic experiment that took advantage of new technology &mdash; an amphibious array &mdash; to study questions ranging from megathrust earthquakes to episodic tremor to volcanic arc structure to the formation, deformation and hydration of the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates  [Toomey et al., 2014].  These wide-ranging science objectives were developed by an NSF-supported, community workshop convened in Portland, Oregon in October 2010[1].    Addressing the diversity of the CI science objectives required an ambitious, plate-scale seismic experiment, one that encompassed the onshore and offshore components of the Cascadia subduction zone as well as the underthrusting Juan de Fuca plate (Figure 1).  The 2010 CI Workshop concluded that the OBS component of the CI should comprise both a plate-scale deployment of OBSs that replicated the 70-km spacing and 18-month duration of the EarthScope transportable array and a tighter array along the subduction zone including several focused experiments at key sites.   Broader Impacts: Two aspects of the CI were novel and changing both practices and capabilities within the ocean sciences community.  First, the CI was a community-based experiment, meaning that the scientific community vets its scientific objectives, experimental design and logistical implementation and that all resulting data are publically available.  Secondly, the CI was deploying a new generation of ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) that were designed to withstand a direct hit by bottom trawling fisheries and that were equipped with sensors shielded from ocean bottom currents, thereby opening the shallow marine environment (&lt;1000 m) for more routine geophysical investigations. These sea changes in practices and capabilities are benefitting science, attracting a new generation of seismologists, and delivering results that will benefit society.  The CI was the first community experiment to utilize an amphibious array and it exemplifies the benefits and challenges of this mode of data collection and sharing. The community experiment concept was developed at the Experiments With Portable Ocean Bottom Seismographs Workshop held at Snowbird, Utah in September 2010.  The key characteristics of a community experiment are that the community &mdash; through openly announced, NSF-supported workshops &mdash; acts as the proponents of the experiment and that all data are immediately made available to the public.  The benefits of a community experiment are several:  The primary benefit is that the community can do experiments that would be unaffordable otherwise given the expense of working in the oceans. Figure 2 shows that large-scale experiments can only move forward by establishing community buy-in.  This includes defining the science objectives, the instrumental capabilities, the availability of data and metadata, and an overall plan for an integrated analysis and synthesis of results.  Second, a policy of open-data access increases the breadth of inquiry and types of methodologies applied to the resulting data, thereby increasing the data?s value. Lastly, open data access and opportunities to participate in seagoing expeditions is attracting a growing number of graduate students and postdocs, ensuring the future health and vigor of the seismology community.  The CI is having a profound influence on the community that uses ocean-bottom seismometer data, particularly early career scientists.  The Cascadia Initiative Expedition Team?s Apply-to-Sail program has taken over 100 early career scientists to sea, including undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs.  To date, over 20 TB of CI OBS data have been downloaded from the IRIS DMC, by over 500 unique users, at over 300 unique institutions, in 25 different countries (Figure 3).  That so many users are downloading CI OBS data ensures that there is wider use of the data, thereby enhancing the scientific return and making the overall experiment cost effective.
