<AbstractNarration>Professor Gerald Meyer and Dr. Nancy Ryan Gray, on behalf of the Gordon Conference, are supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to organize a first time Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in Photochemistry: Solar Photochemistry and Catalysis. The seminar will be convened for two days in July 2011 immediately preceding the Gordon Conference on the same subject in Stone Hill College, Boston, MA.  The seminar will give the participating young scientists a chance to exchange talks and posters, and to be seamlessly integrated into the full Gordon Conference meeting.  Junior scientists entering the important area of solar photochemistry and catalysis will have an opportunity to present and discuss their research results with peers and leading experts in the field.  The participation of a diverse group of young scientists in such an activity will contribute to the development of the future U.S. workforce in this important area of research that is relevant to energy sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
