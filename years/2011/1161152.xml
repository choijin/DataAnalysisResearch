<AbstractNarration>The Mathematics Achievement as a STEP for STEM Success (MAS3) project at Cleveland State University (CSU) is providing cohorts of students who place into precalculus enrichment activities, including mandatory and high-quality supplemental instruction.  In addition, the MAS3 student cohorts are provided with problem-based learning (PBL), research experiences, support services and greater immersion into and utilization of existing campus and community assets in an effort to increase the pipeline, persistence and graduation rates of these students in STEM.  Additionally, a PBL Seminar involves a collaboration among science, mathematics, and engineering faculty and supplemental instructors that provides structure and content to engage the cohort of students as well as other students enrolled in other sections of precalculus and calculus.  Moreover, the project involves continuing and refining the Engineering Education Summer Conference (EESC) as a tool to enhance MAS3 outreach and recruitment. The conference brings together grades 7-12 educators and staff, university faculty, and industry professionals for a critical conversation about implementing and improving science and mathematics education in grades 7-12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The project is laying the groundwork for a long-term institutional transformation at CSU that will have far-reaching impacts. MAS3 will provide a model of replication for other large, public universities with a large segment of mathematically underprepared students.  In addition to providing a research-grounded support system to maximize the students' success, the project is targeting at-risk students accepted by CSU to study the effects of these interventions to various important educational measures of their success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The project represents a well-documented model to increase the pass rates of a major barrier to STEM and college success: precalculus and calculus courses.  Particularly because the project is focusing recruitment activities on student populations where this barrier has been particularly problematic (e.g., underrepresented students including females, those with weak academic preparation or low income).  In addition, the project is serving as a model for the educational efficacy of PBL seminars that bring together faculty stakeholders in mathematics, science, and engineering. The summer institutes also is serving as a model for other institutions to recruit STEM students and to initiate dialogue at the K-12 level needed for students to be adequately prepared to begin college-level science, mathematics, and engineering coursework.</AbstractNarration>

Mathematics has been a major barrier to success, thus the main thrust of interventions was focused on helping students complete the required precalculus and calculus courses by improving students? likelihood of passing these ?gateway? courses. In Fall 2014, Operation STEM synergized efforts with the Ohio Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation in STEM (LSAMP ? NSF-HRD 1304371).   Interventions:   1.  Cohort Model with Summer Bridge Program.      Each summer, approximately 100 STEM students (primarily CSU freshmen) engaged in a free 8-day Summer Institute.     They reviewed mathematics, engaged in cohort bonding activities, learned about campus support services, listened to STEM career talks, and explored the campus. Students earned a $200 stipend for the Summer Institute.   During the academic year    Students were assigned a faculty mentor, they attended career workshops, study skills workshops, and social activities.   They received a $400 stipend per term if they successfully completed enough activities and earned a grade of C or better in their mathematics class.   These students who took the summer bridge program were designated OpSTEM/LSAMP scholars. As a result of the Summer Institute, pass rates for these students were significantly higher (80-90% pass rate) than students who did not participate; and most importantly, for those students starting in college algebra, the achievement gap among underrepresented minority students was removed.   2.      Mandatory Supplemental Instruction (MSI) with STEM Peer Teachers (SPTs)     150 minutes of additional instruction outside of the classroom for all students in college algebra and trigonometry (approximately 120 students for each class per term). MSI consisted of active engagement with the content of the course, not homework completion (which students completed on their own). A Similar model was instituted for selected sections of Calculus I and II (approximately 120 students per term ? 30% of all calculus students). SPTs were students who had already succeeded in the course.  Two or three SPTs, each of whom received extensive training, were assigned to each section. Pass rates rate increases:    College Algebra rose from 55% to 73%. Trigonometry rose from 61% to 75%. Calculus I sections with MSI rose from 60% to 71%. Calculus II sections with MSI rose from 67% to 73%.     3.      Summer Calculus I for Free     For students who successfully completed college algebra and trigonometry the first year. No tuition was charged. Students were able to ?catch up? and enrolled in needed engineering and physics classes at the start of the sophomore year.   80% pass rate resulted in 131 students, over five years, moving more rapidly toward STEM degree attainment.   Challenges:    Project Based Learning (PBL)     We found this difficult to implement into a packed curriculum during class time. PBL was difficult for SPTs to implement during additional sessions as they were unfamiliar with the approach and the problem itself.   Undergraduate Research Experiences    We created a course to help prepare students for research experience. This course was difficult to schedule, and students were reluctant to take it because it did not ?count? toward a degree. Faculty were reluctant to take freshman or sophomore students into their research labs.   Impact:    Cohort of Excellence      Faculty have reported that the OpSTEM/LSAMP scholars were ready and eager to learn in the college algebra, trigonometry, and calculus courses in the fall as a result of the Summer Bridge Program.  The OpSTEM/LSAMP scholars set the tone for all students in the classes!    Spirit of Collaboration      Academic cooperation exists among The colleges of Science and Health Professions, Engineering, and Education to help STEM students succeed in their mathematics classes.  Additionally, academic support services that include financial aid, first-year advising, and student employment have been critical in Operation STEM?s success.     Meaningful Campus Employment    SPTs bond as students and employees committed to helping their fellow students succeed.  SPTs have meaningful work experiences to put on their resume as they hone their communication skills.  Several have committed to a career in teaching or mathematics (or both)!    In Summary:   Since 2013:  2100 Precalculus &amp; Calculus students and SPTs have been impacted by OpSTEM 433 OpSTEM/LSAMP scholars have participated in the Summer Bridge Program and first-year programming that includes mentoring, career seminars, and study skills workshops.   In 2017-2018:  27 class sections had Mandatory Supplemental Instruction led by SPTs with 32 SPTs on payroll 611 unique students were impacted      Sustainability  Through philanthropy, the renewal of LSAMP (NSF-HRD 1817314), and commitments by Cleveland State University, the Cohort Model with the Summer Bridge Program, the mandatory supplemental instruction led by SPTs, and Summer Calculus for Free will continue for the foreseeable future.
