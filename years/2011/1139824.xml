<AbstractNarration>The Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Miniority Participation (OK-LSAMP) under the&lt;br/&gt;leadership of Oklahoma State University will sponsor as sixth cohort of Bridge to the&lt;br/&gt;Doctorate (BD) students at the institution. The program will focus on the&lt;br/&gt;recruitment, retention, mentoring, and graduation of the students from STEM fields&lt;br/&gt;pursuing M. S. and Ph.D. degrees in science, technology, engineering, and technology&lt;br/&gt;(STEM) fields.  Special emphasis will be placed on increasing Native American representation in STEM graduate programs and retention to the STEM doctoral degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program objectives for this cohort are: (i) recruitment of 12 LSAMP graduates to the&lt;br/&gt;BD program, (ii) completion of coursework by each BD Fellow within the first two years of the graduate study, (iii) identification of a research mentor by the start of the 2nd year in the program, and (iv) each BD fellow earning at least one graduate degree in a STEM field. The program has also identified four key educational outcomes that each BD fellow must achieve prior to graduation. These outcomes are: (i) knowledge of learning methods and effective teaching strategies, (ii) ability to communicate&lt;br/&gt;effectively, (iii) ability to perform research independently, and (iv) an understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the importance of life-long learning. To achieve these objectives and outcomes, the program has developed a strong and ambitious plan which includes workshops, seminars, socials, meetings, international research&lt;br/&gt;experiences, conference activities for the BD fellows and research mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation of the program objectives and the assessment of the achievement of educational outcomes include input from students, external program evaluator, and the BD Council. BD Council consists of&lt;br/&gt;members from OU and OSU including the PI of the Oklahoma Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity involves the furthering the research on what constitutes best&lt;br/&gt;practices for the recruitment, retention, and graduation of underrepresented minority&lt;br/&gt;students with doctoral degrees in STEM fields.  Collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between the BD program and projects funded through the NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)and other public and private section organizations at the university will not only benefit the BD Fellows but also the faculty engaged in research targeted towards promoting diversity in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential impacts of the proposed activity are multidimensional. At the institutional&lt;br/&gt;level, success of the BD program will positively impact institutionalization of the best&lt;br/&gt;practices. Diversity in the graduate STEM programs will promote diversity in the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate programs and vice versa.  Institutional commitment to diversity as evidenced by a diverse student population will undoubtedly support the efforts of diversifying STEM faculty. For Oklahoma, it will lead to stronger relationships between K-12 schools including tribal establishments and&lt;br/&gt;STEM programs, diversification of the pipeline for STEM education, and further&lt;br/&gt;stimulating economic development in the state. At the national level, graduation of at&lt;br/&gt;least 12 additional BD Fellows with Ph.D. degrees who have achieved the four key outcomes&lt;br/&gt;stated for the program will have a significant impact on the gender and ethnic profiles of&lt;br/&gt;STEM faculty in academia, as well as industry and other government agencies&lt;br/&gt;employing Ph.D. graduates. Dissemination of best practices through archival paper&lt;br/&gt;publications and presentations at professional conferences will&lt;br/&gt;broaden the impact as more institutional will implement the best practices which will in&lt;br/&gt;turn transform the ethnic and gender distribution of the STEM workforce and also&lt;br/&gt;increase the number of graduates from STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Oklahoma Bridge to the Doctorate (BD), Cohort 5 recruited 12 Fellows to begin the program.  An additional Fellow was added, with NSF permission, to utilize residual funds resulting from some FellowsÆ degree completion.  Six Fellows were selected to begin graduate studies spring 2012, two began summer 2012, and four began in the fall 2012 semester.  The BD students engaged in activities that enhanced their academic foundation, aroused the studentsÆ intellectual consciousness, and provided other experiences that promote success in graduate school and workforce preparation.  BD Fellows:  Performed or engaged in research with world-renown faculty;  Engaged in conference and symposium presentations Presented research in regional, national, and international conferences and symposiums; Received national scholarships, including the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; Received local and national awards; Participated in peer-mentoring to undergraduate STEM majors; Served in officer positions in national organizations; Published in peer-reviewed journals, with Fellows listed as lead authors;  Earned an average GPA of over 3.0; Earned a STEM graduate degree.   Participants engaged in activities that enhanced and assessed their academic performance, aroused accountability consciousness, and provided other experiences that lead to success in their programs.  Three Fellows began in a Ph.D. track and are making satisfactory progress toward degree completion. Of these three: one has presented research twice at international conferences (2014 Arabidopsis International Conference, Australia,  2015 Arabidopsis International Conference in Paris, France).  Six (6) Fellows completed requirements for and received Master of Science degrees.  Eight (8) Fellows are on track to complete Ph.D. program and degree requirements.  Five (5) Fellows have taken positions in industry following completion of M.S. degree requirements and are not, at this time, pursuing degrees.  Two (2) Fellows continue to work toward completion of the M.S. degree.  One (1) Fellow received the GRFP and transferred to Cornell University.  One Fellow was accepted into the OSU School of Medicine Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program. This Fellow remains on track to complete Ph.D. requirements.  One (1) Fellow accepted employment as a public school Science teacher at a large metropolitan school district following completion of the M.S. degree program.  One (1) has accepted employment with the State of Wisconsin as a Nuclear Engineer/Radioactive Materials Inspector.  He plans to pursue a Ph.D. following two years of required employment.
