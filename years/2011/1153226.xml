<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) will investigate the detailed dynamics and structure of plasma sheets associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), by analyzing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) data and hard X-ray (HXR) data from spacecraft. The PI notes that the physics of current sheets is an important component in our study of CMEs and the magnetic reconnection process, and that recent spacecraft data provide an unprecedented opportunity to advance this type of research and to address key scientific questions. To this end, the PI will specifically use this data to determine how these plasma sheets form, whether they are pre-existent or are formed only after the onset of a CME eruption, whether the plasma sheets seen in EUV and the "post-CME rays" seen in white light are the same structures, and what role these current sheets play in CME acceleration and solar flare energy release. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since magnetic reconnection is one of the fundamental processes in laboratory, space, and astrophysical plasmas, this work will enhance our theoretical understanding of a phenomenon that is crucial to multiple scientific disciplines. In the solar physics context, the magnetic energy released by reconnection events in the solar atmosphere drives space weather and a better of understanding of this process will improve the nation's space weather forecasts for the benefit of society. The project will support the professional development of a young solar physicist, and this research will have an educational impact through its incorporation into the undergraduate curriculum in classrooms at NJIT.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of this award is to train graduate student to carry out first class research. The student obtained his Ph.D. in 2016.  The project also promotes strong international collaboration between New Jersey Institute of Technology in US and University of Science and Technology in China.   We have also obtained the important scientific results. The most significant ones are listed below.  Filaments outline magnetic field inversion lines.  Their eruptions often cause solar flares that have adverse effects on earth.  It is time that we found that a filament that was composed of two branches separated in height by about  13 Mm, as inferred from three-dimensional reconstruction. We call it "the double-deck" filament.  We also carried first theoretic modeling to understand the magnetic properties of it.  We studies a solar eruptive event, in which a vertical current sheet  (VCS) is observed in the wake of an erupting flux rope in the Solar  Dynamic Observatory (SDO). The VCS is first detected following the impulsive acceleration  of the erupting flux rope but prior to the onset of a non-thermal hard  X-ray and microwave burst, with plasma blobs moving upwards at speeds  up to 1400 km/s along the sheet.  For large-scale activities, recent high resolution EUV observation from  the SDO is able to diagnose the plasma  around current sheet, the key role of magnetic reconnection during  energetic solar flares. Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) have been  frequently observed during the gradual phase of flares near the limb. In  coronal emission lines sensitive to flaring plasma, they appear as  tadpole-like dark voids against the diffuse fan-shaped "haze" above the  well-defined flare arcade and flow toward the arcade. As part of his  Ph.D. thesis, he carefully studied several selected  SADs from two flare events and calculated their differential emission  measures (DEMs) as well as DEM-weighted temperatures. Our analysis  corroborates that SADs are density depletion associated with a  substantial decrease in DEM. This depression in DEM rapidly recovers in  the wake of the SADs studied, generally within a few minutes, suggesting  that they are discrete features. In addition, we found that SADs in one  event is spatio-temporally associated with the successive formation of  post-flare loops along the flare arcade.
