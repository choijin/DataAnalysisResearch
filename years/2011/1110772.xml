<AbstractNarration>The existence of social monogamy (when a male and a female live together) has long puzzled researchers since both sexes usually gain more reproductive success by mating with multiple partners. This raises the question: under what conditions will monogamy provide reproductive advantages? The proposed research seeks to test three hypotheses that may explain the evolution of social monogamy in the mantis shrimp Pullosquilla litoralis: even spatial distribution of females, equal sex ratio between males and females, and the need for biparental care. It also tests the effects of even female spatial distribution and sex ratio on genetic monogamy (how many males sire each egg clutch) of P. litoralis to discover, how social mating systems and genetic mating systems interact to shape reproductive behaviors?.&lt;br/&gt;P. litoralis is a mantis shrimp that lives in pairs in burrows in sandy marine substrates where both males and females care for eggs by aerating them and removing fouled eggs. The proposed research will be conducted through field studies and experiments at Lizard Island Research Station, Australia. Field studies and experimentation in the marine lab will examine the effects of female spatial distribution and sex ratio on social monogamy in P. litoralis. Paternity testing will elucidate the effects of these factors on genetic monogamy. Laboratory experiments will also examine the effects of biparental care on the reproductive success of male and female P. litoralis. Finally, this research will contribute to management strategies for the conservation of marine crustaceans&lt;br/&gt;As charismatic invertebrates, mantis shrimps are excellent ambassadors for the conservation of coral reefs. Co-PI Wright will share her research with the public through K-12 classroom visits, a field blog that will be hosted by the UC Museum of Paleontology in coordination with the Understanding Science initiative, and undergraduate mentorship.</AbstractNarration>

Social monogamy is characteristic of several ecologically important marine crustaceans, while biparental care has only been characterized in a single genus of stomatopod crustacean (a.k.a. mantis shrimp), <em>Pullosquilla</em>. <em>Pullosquilla </em>species&nbsp;are small stomatopods (~1.5 cm) that live in heterosexual pairs in sandy burrows in shallow sand flats in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Previous research indicates that male and female <em>Pullosquilla</em> provide equal amounts of care for their egg clutches by guarding them, oxygenating them, and removing fouled eggs. When food is abundant, pairs may double-clutch by producing a second clutch of eggs before the first clutch has hatched. In this case, males and females expend approximately twice as much time providing care to both clutches of eggs as they do for a single clutch. This project examined the effects of biparental care on the survival and development of stomatopod eggs to better understand the evolution and maintenance of biparental care. It also investigated the demography of stomatopods living in a sand flat to determine the prevalence of social monogamy in the population.

We found that in the absence of any care, egg clutch survival and growth decreased. However, neither the number, nor the sex of the care providers had a significant effect on changes in egg clutch mass. Parental care conditions did not affect ovary size, the total number of eggs in a clutch, or egg size. Thus, while parental care increases reproduction of offspring in <em>Pullosquilla</em>, care by a single parent of either sex is sufficient to achieve this goal. These results suggest that biparental care is not evolutionarily maintained in <em>P. thomassini </em>by increasing the number of offspring hatching in an egg clutch. Instead, it is likely that biparental care is evolutionarily maintained by increasing the rate of egg clutch production and facilitating double-clutching.
