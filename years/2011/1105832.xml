<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1105832, Principal Investigator: Dmitry Tamarkin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research projects concentrate on issues related to the  microlocal approach to categories associated with symplectic manifolds, such as the Fukaya category.  It is anticipated that by applying algebraic tools such as differential graded categories and higher categories, will yield geometric simplifications by avoiding transversality and other geometric conditions that can be hard to  provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic geometry is the study of the background structure for the Hamiltonian version of classical mechanics.  The study of this kind of geometry was revolutionized in the 1980s by the use of analytic techniques involving maps of surfaces into symplectic manifolds, a point of view that led more recently to the Fukaya categories invoked below.  These Fukaya categories carry a lot of significant information about the underlying symplectic manifold, and it would be useful to have a less subtle description of them than the original definition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project's major goal is constructing the microlocal category of a closedsymplectic manifold.      It was K. Fukaja who  associated a category to every symplectic manifold in the 90's, thereby providing a rigorous mathematical construction of a certain type of  quantum field theories, namely, Witten's A-theory.       The construction is based on the analysis of the space of pseudo-holomorphic maps of a disc into the manifold.  In the project a different way of associating  a category to a symplectic manifiold is proposed.  Our approach is based on purely topological ideas  which frees the construction from various problems, such as transversalities;  also, one can treat singular  Lagrangian manifolds in the same way as non-singular ones.  The above mentioned topological ideas were developed by M. Kashiwara and P.  Schapira in their foundational  book ' Sheaves on Manifolds'.  Conjecturally, the microlocal category contains Fukaya's category as a full sub-category which may result in new approaches to computing Fukaya's categories.  Another goal of the project was solving one of the central problems of the resurgent analysis, namely, that of the analytic continuation of solutions to the Laplace transformed 1-dimensional Schroedinger equation, jointly with A Getmanenko, In particular,  we describe a certain complex surface of the continuation.  As is shown in the resurgent analysis, the shape of this surface    controls the asymptotics of the solutions to the original Schroedinger equation.  Our approach, again, was mainly based on the ideas of microlocal analysis by Kaschiwara-Schapira.                Last Modified: 05/27/2016       Submitted by: Dmitry Tamarkin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
