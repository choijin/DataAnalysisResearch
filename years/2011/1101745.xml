<AbstractNarration>This experimental nuclear physics research program is focused primarily on determining the properties of neutron-rich exotic nuclei at or just beyond the neutron dripline. In the lightest mass region (Z &lt; 9) relatively little is known about the properties of unbound nuclear ground and excited states.  Experiments designed to determine these properties are carried out using the Coupled Cyclotron Facility (CCF) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University, along with the coupled MoNA-LISA arrays (Modular Neutron Array and the Large-area multi-Institutional Scintillator Array) in conjunction with the Sweeper Magnet.  A central component of this research program is undergraduate student participation in every aspect of the research.  Students participate in the experimental runs, including in preparation beforehand and in the analysis afterward.&lt;br/&gt;Results from the this research program will advance knowledge of nuclear structure far from stability. Opportunities for undergraduates to participate in this cutting-edge research, and to interact with the larger nuclear physics community, provide the kind of experiences that help recruit future generations of nuclear scientists.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Research conducted under this NSF grant is based both at Westmont College and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University, and involves undergraduate student participation at its heart.  The purpose of the program is to investigate light neutron-rich nuclei that are far removed from stability, by measuring properties of both neutron-unbound ground and excited states in nuclei located at or near the neutron "drip-line."  In order to pursue these investigations we use accelerator beams provided by the Coupled-Cyclotron Facility at the NSCL, and detect the products of secondary beam reactions using the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) and the Large area multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA).  Each of these arrays was constructed by undergraduate students from 9 primarily undergraduate institutions.  They are located in the NSCL N2 vault at the end of one of the accelerator beam lines, and are used in conjunction with the Sweeper Magnet and Sweeper charged particle detector chamber.   Systems that we have successfully investigated during this award period include N=19 nuclei around the so-called "Island of Inversion," and the  neutron-rich nuclei: 19C, 21C, 22C, and 24O.   Research on exotic nuclei using MoNA/LISA and the Sweeper Magnet at NSCL/MSU advances understanding of shell-model structure near the neutron dripline, as well as our understanding of neutron halo nuclei.  An additional and very important component of this program is the training of young scientists.  Undergraduate students have opportunity to work at a world-class research laboratory alongside professional physicists in cutting-edge research that provides critical information for our basic understanding of matter.  In many cases students are inspired to continue working in the field based on the positive experience of encountering "real" science and the pursuit of answers to fundamentally interesting questions.
