<AbstractNarration>Predicting future conditions of the Arctic Ocean system requires scientific knowledge of its present status as well as a process-based understanding of the mechanisms of change. This research effort will synthesize a number of recent, upcoming, and historical datasets to create three regional carbon budgets for the Chukchi/western Beaufort Sea, the Bering Sea, and the northern Gulf of Alaska. As waters from the North Pacific make their way through these regions a number of transformations occur that modify them before they enter the central Arctic Ocean. In general, the waters exiting these shelf seas are fresher, colder, and have lower pH due to the uptake of CO2 and the remineralization of organic matter. Because of the importance that biogeochemical transformations have in preconditioning the waters of the central Arctic and ultimately parts of the North Atlantic it is important to gain a better understanding of how these processes impact the carbon biogeochemistry of the region. The investigators propose to address this issue by better constraining the carbon budgets for three zones in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean including coastal fluxes, rates of primary production and air-sea exchange of CO2 as well as developing algorithms with predictive capabilities for carbonate mineral saturation states. The aim of this effort is to determine how physical forcing and biological responses control the marine carbon cycle including the rates of air-sea CO2 exchange and net community production as well as ocean acidification effects in the contrasting shelf environments, and to better constrain the present stocks and fluxes of carbon and determine how climate change will affect the regional carbon cycle. The project will support four early career investigators, a postdoctoral scientist, and a Ph.D. student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Pacific-Arctic region is undergoing rapid transformations that have brought it to the top of international scientific and political agendas. Predicting future conditions of the Arctic Ocean system requires scientific knowledge of its present status as well as a process-based understanding of the mechanisms of change.  The continental shelf seas in this part of the ocean play a critical and likely increasing role in the global carbon cycle.  In recent years a number of US and International field efforts have begun to fill in the data gaps across these high latitude seas, but this work is being done in a time of unprecedented environmental change.  Sea ice is diminishing in the region and the retreat of seasonal sea ice in the marginal ice zones has begun to occur earlier and persist longer.  This, along with changes in terrestrial fluxes and warming temperatures, have likely cascaded into the ecosystems with unknown consequences to primary production, air-sea exchange of gases such as carbon dioxide, the fate of organic matter, and the extent and controls on ocean acidification. As waters from the North Pacific make their way through this area a number of transformations occur that modify them before they enter the central Arctic Ocean  The major goals of the project were to create an integrative, interdisciplinary, pan-Arctic study to quantify changes and feedbacks among the physical and biogeochemical components of the region and their ultimate impacts on the marine carbon system.  The major scientific outcome of the project was the finding that the Arctic Ocean is rapidly changing with regard to its marine carbon.  The waters of the Arctic Ocean take up much more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at present compared to proceeding decades. As a result of this change in the status of the Arctic Ocean, ocean chemistry has also changed with acidification of shelf waters occurring at a faster pace than predicted less than ten years ago. This has potential significant impacts on the ,marine ecosystems of the Arctic shelves.       Last Modified: 11/30/2016       Submitted by: Nicholas R Bates]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
