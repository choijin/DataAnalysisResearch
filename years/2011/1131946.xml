<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests   NSF support to broaden participation in The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO) to be held in Chamonix, France  April 2-6, 2011.  The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO) is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working on bridging the gap between software abstraction and hardware execution. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to increase the impact of this conference by enabling participation by studentsfrom US-based institutions for whom travel support would otherwise preclude their attendance.</AbstractNarration>
