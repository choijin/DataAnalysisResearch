<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine is a variable speed wind turbine widely used in the modern wind power industry. Presently, commercial DFIG wind turbines primarily use technology that was developed a decade ago. However, research is needed to enhance energy harvesting from the wind in more efficient and reliable ways due to the following reasons: 1) Recent studies indicated that an existing power converter control technology used in a DFIG wind turbine has a competing control deficiency. 2) The present design of DFIG wind power control system does not support the needs for optimal and smart control of the system. 3) Recent research on DFIG characteristics showed that optimal and artificial intelligence technology is favorable for efficient DFIG control and integration.     Intellectual Merits:  This project developed an optimal vector control technology based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and artificial neural networks for a DFIG wind turbine, an advanced neural network training algorithm, and state-of-the-art simulation and hardware experiment facilities and mechanisms. This is the first-ever application of ADP to vector control of power electronic converters and induction generators.      The specific outcomes and findings of the project include:  1)     We have successfully completed the training and testing for both grid-side and rotor-side controllers for a DFIG wind turbine.  2)     The neural network vector controller can track the reference d- and q-axis currents effectively even for testing trajectories and reference currents that are far away from the training data.  3)     Compared to conventional vector control methods, the neural vector control approach produces the fastest response time, lowest overshoot, and, in general, the best performance.  4)     In noisy, disturbance, and power converter switching environments, the neural network vector controller demonstrates strong capabilities in tracking the reference command while maintaining high power quality.  5)     Under a fault in the grid system, the neural network controller for a DFIG wind turbine exhibits a strong short-circuit ride-through capability.  6)     We integrated our neural network vector controller design with energy system principles and conventional control techniques. We found that this interdisciplinary neural network design approach can significantly enhance the performance and ensure the reliability and adaptive capability of neural network controllers under practical conditions and physical system constraints.  7)     We built a hardware experiment system and conducted a series of tests to examine the performance of the neural network vector controllers in challenging hardware experiment conditions. Compared to conventional controllers, the neural network vector controllers demonstrated excellent performance with very fast tracking speed, reduced oscillations and harmonics, and improved stability and reliability.  Beyond the proposed project scope, we conducted preliminary research in the following areas.  i)      Developed a new Forward Accumulation Through Time (FATT) algorithm and integrated FATT with Levenberg&ndash;Marquardt algorithm to improve training of recurrent neural networks.  ii)    Investigated microgrid control using neural networks. We found that the neural network vector controller has the potential to overcome many challenges for smooth transition and control of a microgrid between grid-tied mode and islanding mode.  iii)  Investigated how to apply neural network vector control technology to high voltage dc transmission systems.  iv)   Conducted preliminary research of nested-loop neural network controllers for ac electric machines and drives.    v)     Investigated control of grid connected inverters with LC and LCL filtering schemes for single-phase applications.  vi)   Investigated wind speed forecasting.   vii) A video from the project website (http://bama.ua.edu/~shli/Research/NSF_EPAS....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
