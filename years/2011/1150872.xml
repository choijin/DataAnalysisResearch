<AbstractNarration>This project studies the topology and geometry of low-dimensional manifolds and the knots and surfaces embedded therein. Specific goals include a classification of knots in the 3-dimensional sphere which produce  simple manifolds under surgery, topological characterization of knots which bound complex curves inside  complex   surfaces, and a deeper understanding of the structure of cobordism groups of knots and 3-manifolds.  Primary tools for this study arise in symplectic geometry, gauge theory, and quantum algebra. Many of these tools come in the form of  algebraic invariants e.g. Floer homology theories or combinatorial knot invariants such as Khovanov homology. The project also seeks to further our understanding of the invariants themselves,  and a central theme is to determine the extent  to which they faithfully represent the topological objects which they shadow.   The specific mathematical goals of the project are complemented by concrete initiatives targeted at graduate and undergraduate education, together with  activities aimed at an international community of topologists and geometers.  For instance, a new graduate course will be designed and implemented whose dual focus is on the development of topological breadth and communication skills in a variety of scenarios.  A summer school  for undergraduates and a broad-interest conference on topology will be organized.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology and geometry are mathematical fields which study  shapes and spaces, and low-dimensional topology focuses on those shapes which are within or just out of reach of our vision.   This project makes fundamental contributions to low-dimensional topology.   One of the key problems that the project attacks is the mathematical theory of "knotting", an area which attempts to understand and quantify the method by which ideal strings become tangled and knotted in space.  In addition to a fundamental role which knotting plays in low-dimensional topology, its theory has deep interactions with many seemingly unconnected areas of mathematics and physics, and even to areas such as polymer science.    One of the central aims of the project is to understand how knots evolve over time.  Imagine a movie in which a piece of string freely moves in space, becoming more or less tangled over time.  Further imagine that  at some frames in the movie more drastic phenomena occur such as the appearance or disappearance of a new loop of string or the gluing of two segments of the string together.  Such a movie is called a "concordance", and using this idea one can treat knotted pieces of string in much the same way that we treat numbers; namely, one can add and subtract knots in an algebraic way.    Understanding the arithmetic of knots turns out to have deep implications for the study of 4-dimensional space, one of the most difficult and least understood areas of modern mathematics.    In addition to its specific mathematical aims, the project will also contribute in a significant way to graduate and undergraduate education and to a global  research community through design and organization of innovative courses, workshops, and conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on bettering our understanding of topological and geometric structures, particularly of low-dimensional objects.  By a low-dimensional object, we mean a shape or structure that one can almost "see", having four or fewer intrinsic degrees of freedom.  A perennial exemplar of such an object is a "knot". Mathematically, a knot is a differentiable embedding of a circle into a 3-dimensional space, such as the Euclidean space that humans typically perceive themselves to exist within.    This definition codifies the notion of knots that everyone is familiar with:  tied up pieces of string.  Here, though, it is important to note that the ends of the string are fused together.   There is a host of simply stated, but difficult to answer questions about the mathematical theory of knots.  For instance: given a knot, how can one determine if one can "untie" it without breaking the string?  This is called the "unknotting problem", or "recognizing the unknot".   While such questions have long been asked within pure mathematics,  their relevance to science and technology has recently blossomed.   For instance, many questions in knot theory and low-dimensional topology are intimately connected to particle physics and "gauge theory".  This project exploited such connections with theoretical physics to prove several fundamental results about 4-dimensional aspects of knots.    Knot theory has also recently been linked to biological sciences by way of knotting phenomena witnessed in, for instance, circular DNA.  Knot theory, and its close connection with a subject called "braid theory", has also figured non-trivially in some efforts to build a quantum computer.  The project pursued a variety of questions, many of which centered on 4-dimensional aspects of knots.   One should think of knots as being able to evolve in time. As they do so, they trace out a surface not unlike a soap film, within 4-dimensional space.  These surfaces allow for algebraic structures to be placed upon knots, and indeed allow one to add and subtract knots much like numbers.  The project proved many new and fundamental results about these algebraic facets of knot theory.  It also explored connections between the surfaces in 4-dimensions described above and complex numbers.  Indeed, in a natural way the roots of a two-variable polynomial, if they are allowed to be taken from the complex numbers, trace out a surface in 4-dimensional space.  This project explored and helped to classify which knots arise as slices of one of these "complex" surfaces at a fixed time.  Another result of the project developed a new algorithm for determining whether a given collection of knots in 3-space, called a link, could be simultaneously unknotted.  This result used deep tools from gauge theory, quantum algebra, infinite dimensional analysis, and partial differential equations.    In addition to the mathematical results produced by the project, it also had implications for the education of students at Michigan State University and beyond.  Hedden gave many invited presentations, research level graduate courses, and lecture series, in a variety of national and international venues.  Through these, he trained a new generation of researchers in the fields of knot theory and low-dimensional topology.  One outcome of the project, in particular, was a novel course Hedden designed and co-taught with B, Schmidt, that trained graduate students in mathematical communication skills.  As pure mathematicians often have difficulty in explaining their research to people outside a narrow group, this course was an important step towards cross-fertilization of ideas from pure mathematics with other disciplines.
