<AbstractNarration>Tropical forests are extremely diverse and the origin of such high diversity is a central question in biology.  This project will explore how the interactions between plants and the insects that consume plants (herbivores) may contribute to this high diversity.  Plants have evolved a battery of defenses to protect their leaves from insects, and insects are continually evolving counter-adaptations.  Although it is hypothesized that the rate of defense evolution is extremely fast, how this evolutionary process proceeds is still poorly understood.  The research addresses how herbivores drive the evolution of plant defenses, how plant defenses influence which species of plants herbivores consume and how plant-herbivore interactions might influence plant community composition and diversity in the tropics, the most species-rich forests in the world.  It will focus on the taxonomic, genetic and functional diversity of trees in the genus Inga (Leguminosae) and its insect herbivores at five sites in Central and South America.  Inga is one of the most speciose (more than 300 species) and among the most locally diverse and abundant Neotropical trees.  This interdisciplinary study will measure plant defenses, including chemical toxins, physical defenses and the attraction of protective ants to sugar-bearing nectaries on the leaves.  DNA sequencing of herbivores and Inga will allow quantification of the diversity of species, will test whether more closely related Inga species have more similar defenses, and will determine whether herbivores choose hosts based on the similarity of their defenses.  It is hypothesized that if plant species differ in their defenses, they will be attacked by different herbivore species, and thus can coexist as neighbors, leading to high local diversity typical of tropical forests.  Thus this project will shed light on the origin and maintenance of biological diversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ongoing loss of biodiversity is a critical issue for science and society.  The research will be communicated to different audiences in order to enhance their appreciation of nature and science.  The team will create a theater of biodiversity for school children and families in Utah, conduct Tom Sawyer style Saturday science days for children from poor communities near the Brazil and Peru field stations, give presentations on tropical diversity for tourists, and develop the use of Inga in agroforestry in Peru.  The integrative project will also create an open, accessible website to share data and other project results, and to facilitate related research by other scientists.</AbstractNarration>

Because plants and their herbivores constitute more than 50% of terrestrial biodiversity, these questions are key to understanding Earth&rsquo;s ecosytems, particularly tropical rainforests. To be effective we focused on the tree genus <em>Inga</em>, with about 300 species from tropical forests of South and Central America. We conducted extensive fieldwork to collect samples and data on plant defenses in Panama, Peru, Brazil, French Guiana, and Ecuador. The other major aspects were developing new laboratory-based technologies. We successfully obtained an evolutionary tree for <em>Inga</em>. We also quantified the similarity/dissimilarity of the diverse and complex chemical defenses of <em>Inga</em>. Both are essential tools that, heretofore, had not been available.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These advances allowed us to develop a new tool for distinguishing species of plants that are very difficult to separate based on the standard methods, morphology and DNA sequences.

These results support a widely accepted hypothesis that herbivores drive plants to rapidly evolve novel defenses. But, this study led to a new idea about the evolution of herbivores. In contrast to a frequently quoted hypothesis, we proposed that the process by which herbivores choose plants to feed on may evolve slowly. Specifically, herbivores may choose the species of plants for which they already have adaptations rather than evolve traits permitting consumption of new species. Thus, herbivore evolution may play a much smaller role in host choice than had been thought.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another major goal in biology, especially tropical biology, is to understand the mechanism by which many hundreds of species of plants can coexist. For example, the diversity of trees in a single hectare (2.5 acres) of tropical rainforest can be 655 species. This exceeds the total diversity of trees of the entire US and Canada combined, less than 500 species. This contrast requires explanation, particularly for genera with many species. For example, <em>Inga</em> has very many, 45, very closely related species that coexist at a single site. Ecological theory predicts that the best-performing species, one or a few, should dominate. But, an alternative is that negative interactions with the enemies of plants, such as herbivores, result in more attack on abundant species of plants keeping their populations in check. If so, more species of plants could be packed into a small area leading to high local diversity. This hypothesis, while attractive, has not been proven and is the focus of much current research. Because we measured herbivore food preferences and quantified the traits that allow plants to defend themselves (e.g. chemistry and hairs), we provided a new test of this mechanism. Our results support the hypothesis that attack by herbivores promotes the very high number of plant species in small areas.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outreach included many presentations for the general public given by students and researchers.
