<AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMR 1156737&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site Materials Physics at the University of Florida  will bring 12 undergraduates per year to the University of Florida for a 10-week summer research experience. Each REU participant will be integrated into an active research group under the guidance of a faculty mentor and in most cases also more junior members of the group.  The research projects cover a wide range of topics in condensed matter physics and materials science:  multiferroism, carbon nanotubes, organic solar cells, piezoelectricity, quantum dots, low-dimensional magnetism, superconductivity, quantum phase transitions, low temperature physics, and large scale simulations.  To provide a complete research experience the program includes seminars on current and emerging research areas, a seminar on applying to graduate school,  a forum led by graduate students on life as a graduate student, a written communication workshop, an oral communication workshop, a library workshop, visits to local scientific and technical facilities, a group outreach activity for local K-5 students, and social events.   Through exposure to all aspects of research, the project will equip undergraduate students to make informed career decisions, make them more likely to continue  in science and engineering, and better prepare them for advanced research if they attend graduate  school. Members of underrepresented groups will be actively recruited to enhance diversity in the science and engineering workforce.  This project is supported by the Office of Special Programs,  Division of Materials Research, NSF. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;The REU Site Materials Physics at the University of Florida will bring 12 undergraduates per year to the University of Florida for a 10-week summer research experience. Through exposure to research, the students will be more likely to continue in science and engineering and also be better prepared for advanced research in graduate school.    The research topics include many deemed essential for technological advancement in the future: advanced electronic and magnetic materials and materials for energy conversion.  In addition to completing a research project students will be exposed to research in seminars and field trips, have career development workshops including written and oral communication and applying to graduate school, and participate in a group outreach activity with local K-5 students to excite our future scientists and engineers about teaching.   Women, minorities, and students from schools with limited research opportunities will be actively recruited to enhance the diversity of the science and engineering workforce.  This project is supported by the Office of Special Programs,  Division of Materials Research, NSF. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The REU Site: Materials Physics at the University of Florida brought 12 undergraduates each summer 2012-2014 to the University of Florida to do research in a ten week program.  These 36 students came from schools in 19 different states across the country.  Approximately half of the students came a from school with limited research opportunities so this program represented their chance to experience scientific research while an undergraduate.  One quarter of the participants were from a group which is traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, and 42% of the participants were women.  The students received a stipend, housing, travel expenses to and from Gainesville, and support for travel to a scientific meeting.  As part of the program each student performs research under the guidance of a faculty mentor.  The research projects cover a broad range of topics in condensed matter physics such as: growing new materials which might be superconducting, testing different materials that could be used in special transistors for flat panel displays, changing the properties of magnetic materials using strain, looking for the lowest energy or ground state of quantum magnets, and using quantum mechanics to predict the properties of new materials.  All of the projects were true research projects in the sense that the results were unknown ahead of time, and the students experience both the excitement and challenges of research when things do to work the first time.  While ten weeks is short for scientific research, the students all contribute to their research group's projects.  One third of the students presented their work at scientific meetings.  The REU participants also attended one or two professional development activities per week: laboratory tours such as of the UF nanoscience facility and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, seminars by faculty explaining different research areas at the undergraduate level, a presentation on applying to graduate school, and workshops on public speaking and scientific writing.  In addition for each year of the program the participants had one outreach activity: doing hands-on physics activities with students from local elementary schools that received poor grades from the state of Florida, explaining their research to a group of 30 middle school teachers on campus as part of teacher training program, and doing physics activities with a group of ninth grade students interested in science.  Finally at the end of the program the participants gave 10-15 minute presentations and submitted a 10-20 page paper on their research.  These papers were placed on the program web site, except where the data is to be used in a future publication.  It is quite remarkable that in a period of ten weeks the REU students go from knowing very little about their research area to the point of giving a talk and writing a paper.  While the students worked very hard, when polled all of them would recommend the program to a fellow student interested in science and engineering.  One of the goals of the REU program is to encourage students to continue on with their education in science and engineering.  Of the students who have received their undergraduate degree by May 2016, 88% are in STEM related fields with 66% in graduate school, 16% in a STEM job, and 6% teaching in a STEM field.  The remaining students are either in medical school, a non-STEM job, or are presently applying to gradaute school.
