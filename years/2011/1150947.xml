<AbstractNarration>1150947&lt;br/&gt;Shadden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inappropriate clotting (thrombosis) stemming from alterations in blood flow is a primary concern with nearly all major cardiovascular diseases, surgeries, and devices. Conceptually, blood flow influences thrombosis in two general ways: by imparting forces and directing transport.  However, mechanistic understandings of these processes remain poorly defined. This has been a critical barrier in addressing why certain flow features correlate favorably, or unfavorably, to thrombotic events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop tools and insights needed to determine the mechanisms by which local disturbances in blood flow potentiate pathological clot formation. This will be accomplished through advancements in computational blood flow modeling and analysis, along with empirical data collected to help guide and validate the numerical findings. This work will specifically address how altered flow leads to thrombus formation in stenotic arteries, which is the primary cause of heart attack and stroke. Recent results have uncovered striking and synergistic interactions between fluid forces and transport mechanisms that are consistent with clinical observations of stenotic thrombus. There is substantial broader potential to use the tools and insights developed by this project to address what hemodynamic conditions are important, and how they are best modeled, identified and conveyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will foster education on several fronts uniquely suited to PI's environment. Important findings and techniques will be integrated by the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) Mathematics and Science Education department into ongoing STEM curriculum development to promote engineering to K-5 students, and into the IIT Boeing Scholars Academy Program for Chicagoland high school students. The design, fabrication and testing of experimental models used to support this research will be incorporated into IIT's unique Interprofessional Projects Program, instructed by the PI.</AbstractNarration>
