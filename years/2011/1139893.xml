<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to increase in-class research using data that have local/global relevance, utilize modern technologies and computational approaches, and integrate molecular and organismal biology. Data on the soil bacterial communities present in corn and soy (industrial and organic) agroecosystems are collected using next generation sequencing technology. These data are then used to develop full courses and modules for courses ranging from introductory/core courses (that also serve non-majors) to upper-level electives. In each course, while the hypotheses addressed and the tools used to address them differ in content, they are complementary to each other and illustrate the power of using an interdisciplinary approach to science. For example, students in one course examine community differences in species composition while in another they look at how the communities differ in terms of metabolic pathways. Knowledge surveys are used at the beginning and end of each course. Comparisons within and between courses evaluate changes in student perceptions and learning over the short and long-term. Each module also includes a summative assessment in the form of an analysis of students formal papers or presentations and an evaluation of the students' abilities to use the tools involved and to interpret the results they generate.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Students exposed to this project have a fresh appreciation of the complexity of the soil biome, especially as they pass through the midwestern landscape dominated by corn and soy. They gain first-hand knowledge of bacterial prevalence, diversity, and importance. They use real DNA sequences to identify organisms, to find out what biological processes are occurring in the soil, and throughout use computer programs to organize, query, and analyze the data. Faculty and students collaborate to write results for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The data are helping to answer such questions as: How do different crops and different agricultural practices influence soil bacterial communities? Are some potentially harmful bacteria facilitated or are important nutrient pathways absent depending on the agroecosystem?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The team includes a broad array of faculty, institutions and students so the project acts as a test site for the strength of such breadth. The faculty team for this project includes evolutionary ecologists, molecular biologists, a biochemist, and a computer scientist spread across two institutions, only four miles apart, that have different missions and serve different populations of students. One institution is a residential liberal arts college (Earlham College) and the other a branch of a state university (Indiana University East). The students and faculty at both institutions interact in course preparation, research, and the sharing of results. These interactions expose students to a greater range of faculty and faculty to a greater range of students, as both institutions work together to transform their curricula.  The project also increases the ways by which underrepresented groups can participate in research; IU East enrolls a high proportion (~40%) of first-generation college students and the McNair program at Earlham College promotes the involvement of underrepresented groups in research.  In addition, most of the course materials are organized as modules that can easily be adopted without a major change in the structure of established courses.  The data and modules developed are being made freely available and actively disseminated, via new and already established repositories for teaching resources, and also through presentations at research and teaching workshops and national meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals for our project were to develop datasets that can be mined and utilized in undergraduate classrooms, and then to design, implement, and assess course modules centered on these data.  Our pedagogical goals were to increase students doing real science and analyzing real, important, and relevant data in science classrooms, and for students to learn fundamental concepts in biology, from molecular biology through ecology and evolution, while using these data.  Our pure scientific goals were to collect data that would shed light on a major issue, soil health, and the fundamental importance of bacteria to crop health.      The data collected for this project were "metagenomic", or DNA sequences from multiple organisms collected as a single sample.  Metagenomic samples typically consist of multiple microbial species that are difficult or impossible to study and sequence in isolation and that live in the same area (e.g., in your gut, on your computer monitor, in the soil, etc.).  So that the data would be of interest to undergraduates, generally, and adoptable by multiple institutions, we chose a "problem" of global interest, and of particular relevance in the Midwest (where our college is located), the microbial health or our agricultural soil.  Our data were collected to test how tilling of the soil and crop rotation change the composition and function of soil microbial communities. These communities are of fundamental importance to soil health, as it is these communities that process and cycle essential nutrients (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, etc.).  And it is soil health that will determine the current and future sustainability of agriculture.  Tillage and rotation are expected to disrupt communities, perhaps disrupting which bacteria are present and what ecosystem-level processes the communities are able to do.     We collected soil samples from agricultural fields; half were conventionally tilled and the other half minimally or not tilled.  The same fields were sampled in two consecutive years and the crop was rotated from corn to soy, or vice versa, between years.  DNA was extracted from the soil and sequenced in two different ways that allowed us to examine both which species were present in the soil, and what functional processes were occurring in the soil. We generated approximately 400 gigabases of DNA sequence (for reference, the human genome is ~3 gigabases).  As expected, we detected hundreds of millions of bacteria and tens of thousands of species per gram of soil.  We found that most of the differences among the fields were attributable to whether the soil was tilled or not (see Figure 1).  The differences we detected between tilled and untilled fields are likely attributable to differences in soil chemistry (Figure 1 insets).  The differences in community composition also affect community function where there is generally more potential activity for nitrogen cycle processes in no till fields (see Figure 2).  Our data suggest that the tilling of soil, by decreasing nutrient retention, affects microbial community composition and capacity to cycle essential plant nutrients &ndash; which exacerbates the need for increased fertilizer application.     The amount of data we generated is enormous and can be mined in many ways so that students can address original hypotheses about particular processes or organisms.  We generated one new course and eight course modules centered on these data.  An advantage of using this type of data is that it can be examined from many different contexts.  For example, the ecology module has students examining which species are present and how soil chemistry might affect species presence/absence, while the microbiology module has students examining what microbial pathways and processes are affected by tilling and crop rotation (among other factors that differ among the fields).      The course modules were designed and implemented at two institutions, Earlham College and Indiana University...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
