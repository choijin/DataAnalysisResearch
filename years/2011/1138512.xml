<AbstractNarration>The University of California, San Diego and San Diego State University propose the Computing Principles for All Students'  Success (ComPASS) Project that will build local capacity for teaching the proposed new Advanced Placement CS Principles (CSP) course. ComPASS will create novel curricula and methodology content for teacher profession development. The project will develop and evaluate pedagogical content knowledge curriculum to support the adoption of best methods and practices in teaching CSP content. It will continue the engagement of the San Diego-area computing education community, and tailor its offered training and support to engage university faculty, as well as in-service and pre-service teachers both with and without computing backgrounds. It will build comprehensive, multi-pronged, flexible, and scalable infrastructure to train and support teachers and faculty and it will pilot that infrastructure at 2 universities, 5 community colleges, and 15 high schools. The project's research component will evaluate the use of blended-learning approaches in transferring effective pedagogical techniques to diverse instructor groups. In addition, the pilot sites have been chosen to reflect a commitment to serving underrepresented populations and the research plan includes a qualitative study of the attitudes of those students with respect to course content and their beliefs about computing. ComPASS will foster the implementation of broadbased, inclusive, and motivational education in computing foundations and computational thinking for all students, regardless of their eventual career path. The ComPASS project will directly impact 105 pre-service teachers, 19 in-service teachers, and about 5000 students. If successful, its model could be adopted at other universities, colleges, and school districts.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, over 150 undergraduate non-CS majors at SDSU were exposed to CS Principles via Alice and peer instruction, and more than 30 pre-service teachers in credential programs at SDSU learned about CS Principles and how to teach it and incorporate it into their eventual schools over the duration of the grant. At least 5 of these 30 have gone on to teach CS Principles in their own classrooms, and are connecting to the developing CS Education community in our region.</p> <p>Over the course of this project we have learned more about what it takes to implement a CS Principles course both inside and outside of the classroom.

To that end, we supported teachers and schools in submitting the course for A-G approval, and by the end of this grant most CS Principles courses offered within the San Diego region have received University of California approval for college preparatory A-G credit as either mathematics or general electives.
