<AbstractNarration>Although the concept that thick continental lithosphere extends and ultimately ruptures has been accepted for over 50 years, the conditions required for this to occur and the factors that are most important in controlling the style of rifting, the formation and maintenance of tectonic segmentation and the initiation of magmatism remain contentious. This is especially true of the earliest stages of extension, in part because most studies focus on successfully rifted margins and mature rifts, where extensive stretching, syn- and post-rift magmatism, and post-breakup sedimentation overwrite and bury the record of incipient extension. Understanding how, why and when features that are characteristic of mid-ocean ridges and rifts first form and evolve during early rifting is essential for a broader understanding of plate divergence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary scientific goal of this project is to examine the emergence and early evolution of two fundamental features of all divergent plate boundaries: magmatism and segmentation. Magmatism accommodates a significant percentage of plate separation at most mid-ocean ridges and late-stage rifts. Likewise, transform faults demarcate discrete spreading segments in mid-ocean ridges, which are broadly &lt;br/&gt;characterized by more robust magmatism at their centers than at their edges. Well-developed magmatic and tectonic segmentation is also observed in late-stage rifts and new ocean basins However,little is known about the controls on the initiation and development of magmatism and segmentation in young rifts. Specifically, th PIs seek to address the following questions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? When, where and why does magmatism initiate in rifts, and what is its role in accommodating extension? &lt;br/&gt;? What controls the development of tectonic segmentation in early-stage rifts? How is it manifested in 4D patterns of magmatism &lt;br/&gt;and deformation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of an integrated geophysical, geochemical and geological study of the northern Lake Malawi region in the East African Rift System (EARS) to address these questions. This is one of the few places in the world that has all of the ingredients necessary for a comprehensive study of early rifting. Active and passive seismic data and MT data will reveal the 3D structure of the crust and lithosphere at a variety of length scales, from the architecture of border faults and accommodation zones to the distribution of deformation and magma (if present) in the mantle lithosphere. Surface deformation, seismicity, and rift stratigraphy, as well as geochronology, thermobarometry and geochemistry of volcanic rocks, will yield constraints on the origin of magmatism and the evolution of deformation and magmatism at a range of time scales, including possibly variable contributions from sub-lithospheric versus lithospheric sources. Comparisons of active and cumulative deformation patterns will enable the evaluation of the importance of episodicity, seismicity and magmatism in accommodating extension and how they relate to segmentation. This powerful combination of temporal and spatial constraints will produce unique insights into the initiation of segmentation and magmatism during continental rifting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The concept that continents can extend and ultimately break apart has been accepted for over 50 years, but the conditions required for this to occur and the factors that are most important in determining where, how fast, and in what manner continents break apart is still contentious.  An ideal place to study the process of continental rifting in its earliest stages is in northern Lake Malawi/Nyasa and so the multi-institutional and international project called SEGMENT (http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~djs/segment/main.html) was developed.  The project used a variety of techniques to study the location of magma and faults within the study area.  The part of the project at Cornell University focused on making new observations of how the ground deforms in the area and how that deformation is related to the process of extension.  In particular, we made observations of ground deformation using a technique called satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), whereby we determined how the distance between the satellite and the ground changed between overpasses of the satellite.  Using this method, we determined how the ground moved during a sequence of earthquakes (including 9 events with magnitudes greater than 5) that occurred near the town of Karonga, Malawi in 2009 .  More than 200,000 people were affected by these earthquakes, including four deaths and almost two hundred injuries.  One outcome of the project was that we used these InSAR observations to develop a model for how the fault slipped during the earthquake sequence (see image attached).  We compared our model with the location of aftershocks located during 4 months of 2010 by our SEMGENT project partners at Columbia University.  The locations of ~1900 aftershocks recorded between Jan&shy;-May 2010 are largely consistent with a west&shy;d-ipping normal fault directly beneath Karonga as constrained by previous studies. However, a substantial number of epicenters cluster in a east&shy; dipping geometry in the central part of the study area, and additional west&shy;-dipping clusters can be discerned beneath Lake Malawi, particularly in the southern part of the study area. The distribution of events is strongly suggestive of multiple faults interacting to produce the observed deformation, and the InSAR data permit this (although they do not require it). In fact, when we do an InSAR inversion for slip on multiple faults (with locations constrained by the aftershocks), we find that most (~90%) of the fault slip still occurs on the St. Mary's Fault (thought to be the dominant fault in previous work). We propose that fault interaction contributed to the seismic moment release as series of Mw 5 and 6 events instead of a normal mainshock&shy;-aftershock sequence.

This depth discrepancy appears to be robust (even when we test a range of different seismic velocity models) and may be explained by fault interaction. Structural complexities associated with fault interaction may have limited the extent of co&shy;seismic slip during the mainshocks, which increased stress on deeper portions of fault systems and nearby favorably oriented faults, causing the energetic aftershock series.  These results provide new evidence for previously unmapped faults that should be consisdered in future hazard assessments.  Further, we have found potential cm&shy;-scale ground deformation with InSAR from the Mw 5.1 earthquake near Karonga on 31 Dec. 2014 that is 15 km from the earthquake location determined by standard global catalogs, but overlaps in space with the hypocenter relocation using data from the SEGMENT seismometers from partners Cindy Ebinger and Sarah Jaye Oliva. More broadly, global earthquake catalogs are often mislocated by &gt; 10 km in lateral location and &gt; 5 km in depth in this region.  This reinforces the need to increase the number of seismometers in this region along with InSAR observations to improve earthquake locations.   We have not found any ground deformation at the Rungwe volcanic province from InSAR within our detection threshold (~2 cm/yr) between 2007-2010, but recommend continued monitoring of this potentially active volcano.  These results are being integrated with the work of project partners in a synthesis study about early-stage rifting in northern Malawi.
