<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research of Professor James A. Phillips and undergraduate research students at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire (UWEC). Phillips and his students will extend their previous experimental and theoretical research on a novel class of Lewis acid-base complexes that undergo significant structural changes between various chemical environments (i.e., when they move from the gas-phase to a solution). Their primary experimental technique is low-temperature infrared spectroscopy, which is applied to two types of sample environments for these complexes: solid thin films comprised of the components, and samples of solid neon or argon seeded with small quantities of them. These measurements will be combined with theoretical calculations to determine gas-phase structural and energetic properties, which provide insight into the extent of the structural changes, as well as the mechanism by which condensed-phase environments manifest them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond fundamental motivations, this work may ultimately lead to a new class of molecular machines or switches, because the complexes sought contain individual bonds that can be affected by a macroscopic, external stimulus. This is the key design feature of all systems that underlie nanotechnology applications. Moreover, this research will take place at a low-cost, accessible, public university with a track record of advancing the careers of low-income and first-generation students, of which a high percentage matriculate to PhD programs. As such, continued funding for this project will enhance opportunities for these students to gain experience with specialized instruments and computational methods that would not occur in a classroom setting, and also bolster their writing and presentation skills.</AbstractNarration>

For CH<sub>3</sub>CN&ndash;BCl<sub>3</sub>, the &ldquo;short-bond structure&rdquo; was significantly more stable (i.e., lower in energy), and we wanted to determine, to what extent adding the F or the Cl might affect the relative energies of the structures. What we found was the change raised the energy of the &ldquo;short-bond&rdquo; structure (relative to CH<sub>3</sub>CN&ndash;BCl<sub>3</sub>), and did not affect that of the &ldquo;long-bond&rdquo; structure to any great extent; which rendered the two structures about equal in energy for FCH<sub>2</sub>CN&ndash;BCl<sub>3 </sub>and ClCH<sub>2</sub>CN&ndash;BCl<sub>3</sub>. However, we were still unable to observe the &ldquo;long bond&rdquo; form in low temperature IR spectroscopy experiments.

In short, we found that adding an F or a Cl atom to the GeF<sub>4</sub> systems (<em>e.g.</em>, FCH<sub>2</sub>CN&ndash;GeF<sub>4</sub>) dramatically increased medium-sensitivity, and were able to verify these effects with experiments. For the SiF<sub>4</sub> systems, theoretical predictions indicated a great degree of medium sensitivity with larger carbon chains (e.g. CH<sub>3</sub>CN<sub>2</sub>CN&ndash;SiF<sub>4</sub>), but like in the case of CH<sub>3</sub>CN&ndash;SiF<sub>4</sub>, experiments showed no evidence of structural change. For GeF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> complexes, which comprise the next essential step in terms of extending this behavior to systems prone to applications in nanotechnology or for electromechanical device design, we found the simple change from F to CH<sub>3</sub> caused a major reduction in strength/reactivity.
