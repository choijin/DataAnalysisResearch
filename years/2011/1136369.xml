<AbstractNarration>The Education Studies Program and the Physical Sciences Division of the University of California San Diego have established a Master Teacher Fellowship (MTF) program as part of their California Teach (CalTeach) Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. This effort is a partnership with local high-needs school districts, mentor teachers, and local community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is realized through the professional development offered to 42 local STEM teachers to serve as mentors and education leaders in high-needa school districts. Throughout the academic school year, Fellows participate in targeted online courses to further develop specific content and pedagogical skills. During the summer, Fellows join UCSD faculty for institutes in either mathematics or science instructional topics. UCSD has also established a Master Teacher in Residence program that recruits an MTF to join the university faculty each year, engaging them in teaching university coursework and supervising Noyce Scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expectation for Broader Impacts result from the project's further understanding of four vital components of learning and expertise development for teachers: the importance of mentorship, expertise development through experience, social networks, and blended learning. Finally, by enhancing the quality of mentorship that UCSD prospective teachers in the STEM fields receive, the project helps support the recruitment of highly qualified teachers in high need schools.</AbstractNarration>
