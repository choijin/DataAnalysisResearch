<AbstractNarration>Researchers have tried to increase the efficiency of various catalyst particles by dispersing them on carbon nanofiber/nanotube (CNTs) catalyst supports, due to the availability of higher specific surface areas of these tubular carbon nanomaterials. Success has not been notably achieved. In evaluating CNTs as supports for Fischer-Tropsch catalysts,  PIs Kanchan Mondal and Saikat Talapatra of Southern Illinois University and Mauricio Terrones of Pennsylvania State University observed that the CNTs themselves perform better than conventional catalysts, exhibiting an order of magnitude more activity with three orders of magnitude less iron content. It was thought that this was due to some uniqueness in the residual iron from the CNT synthesis, but subsequent extraction of the residual Fe resulted in still another order of magnitude improvement in activity.  This is a potentially dramatic change in the nature of CNT catalysis. One of the aims of this proposal is to investigate the role of CNTs themselves as catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, especially FT catalysis. Other significant factors such as their curved carbon surfaces (offering higher adsorption potential to the adsorbate gases near its vicinity), surface defects and functionalization have been primarily over looked as to their possible contribution to heterogeneous catalysis. The PIs propound an excellent series of questions related to catalysis on CNTs that they intend to address, and to then creatively adjust synthesis and treatment processes to optimize the CNT catalytic performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational aspects of this project are interesting in that the undergraduate and graduate students will be exposed to a truly cross-cutting and multi-disciplinary research effort about the use of nanommaterials in heterogeneous catalysis. The potential tie-in to renewable fuels and energy is an added plus in the educational experience.</AbstractNarration>

We believe that exciting possibilities exists in the field of heterogeneous catalysis if as-produced and O, B and N functionalized CNT materials are used as catalytic materials.    Intellectual Impact: There are several innovative aspects in the research that have significantly contribute to our understanding of the role played by nanostructured carbon surfaces as it relates to heterogeneous catalysis. The innovations in materials design, through nanotechnology based approaches are drastically enhancing our knowledge in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.  We have shown the carbon nanotubes with defects and molecular functionalities can effect CO hydrodeoxygenation and subsequent chain growth through both experimental validation and DFT modelling.  While the products are similar to Fisher Trospch Synthesis, the reaction pathways are different.  As a result more oxygenates are produced at higher temperatures unlike those obtained with transition metal catalysts.  The need for a graphene structure was proven by both modeling as well as experiments with various carbon structures. It was observed that the CO hydrodeoxygenation proceeded faster with an increase in curvature.  Commercially available CNTs can also be used for such a process but needs more time for surface activation.  It was noted that lower syngas with lower CO:H2 ratio regenerated the catalyst surface and thus is believed to be of consequence for use with biomass derived syngas.
