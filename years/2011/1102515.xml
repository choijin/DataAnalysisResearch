<AbstractNarration>Lithium atoms exhibit extraordinarily broad Feshbach resonances.  The Feshbach resonance for the lowest hyperfine sublevel of Li-7 extends over a range of approximately 200 Gauss (G), where it goes through a zero crossing with a slope of only 0.1 ao/G, where ao is the Bohr radius.  Our work exploits the properties of this Feshbach resonance to study bosons with attractive, weak, or very strong interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of bright matter wave solitons, previously demonstrated with weakly attracting Li-7 atoms, enables the exploration of fundamental quantum phenomena.  We study single particle tunneling by causing the soliton to execute dipole oscillations in a one-dimensional optical trap in the presence of a central barrier formed from a light sheet.  This system may show a remarkable coherent recombination that could form the basis for a bright matter wave soliton interferometer.  Longer term goals are to work towards true macroscopic quantum tunneling in order to create a Schr√∂dinger Cat state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our second project is study of the effect of a disordered potential, created from optical speckle, on the transport properties of a Bose-Einstein condensate.  Recent proposals in condensed matter to demonstrate a "superinsulator", in which there is a finite temperature transition between a conducting and insulating state in 1D may be realizable using cold atoms.  A closely related topic is to understand the role of interactions in Anderson Localization by measuring the localization length as a function of interparticle interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the broad Feshbach resonance enables access to the regime of strong interactions where the mean-field theory of Bose-Einstein condensation breaks down.  Both the perturbative regime, where the energy is corrected in powers of many time the cube of the scattering length and the regime of strong condensate depletion are being explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wave/particle duality is at the heart of quantum physics.  At very low temperatures, we find that particles that ordinarily act as compact solid objects behave as if they are waves, that is, they reflect, diffract, and interfere.  Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of atoms are iconic examples of such behavior.  A BEC is a collection of atoms that become a single quantum mechanical wave at temperatures as low as one millionth of a degree above absolute zero.  In this program, we create BECs of interacting lithium atoms and use them to explore and test some of the most fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics, including the tunneling of particles through otherwise impenetrable barriers.  These experiments are enabled by the ability to tune the strength of the interatomic interactions and to even change whether they are repulsive or attractive.  By making them weakly attractive, the BECs form a soliton, which is a packet of waves that can travel over a distance without dissipating.  Under some conditions a BEC soliton may behave as a single "super-atom", thus stretching the realm of quantum mechanics to ever larger objects, much like the famous Schrodinger Cat.  We also tune the interactions to the opposite extreme, where the interactions are repulsive and very strong.  These BECs are being used to test our theories of strongly interacting matter.  These experiments will give us a greater understanding of the quantum realm, which hopefully, will allow us to exploit quantum phenomena, such as superconductivity, for practical applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this NSF funded project, we used techniques to cool and trap atoms to temperatures of just a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero.  At these temperatures, atoms behave quantum mechanically, exhibiting a wave-particle duality that is usually associated with much lighter particles, especially electrons.  This enables us, as experimenters, to use atoms to simulate the behavior of many-particle systems, such as non-linear wave packets, and electronic materials.  The advantage of using cold atoms in this context is the ability to control and tune their properties, including the atom-atom interaction, temperature, density, and even dimensionality, to name but a few.  We have focused on two main areas:  1) the generation of matter-wave solitons and their mutual interactions; and 2) the simulation of high-temperature superconductors.  Solitons are self-bound packets of waves, in which a self-attraction prevents the wave packet from spreading out.  Solitons are often associated with optical phenomena, where an interaction between a laser beam and a propagation medium produces self-focusing.  In our system, we create solitons from Bose-Einstein condensates of self-attracting atoms, in this case lithium.  A Bose-Einstein condensate is a collection of atoms that occupy the quantum mechanical ground state.  We produce the condensates by evaporating a warmer gas of atoms until they condense into the ground state.  The lithium atoms attract one another, thus stabilizing the condensate/soliton against spreading as it propagates.  Unfortunately, solitons are only stable in one-dimension, so we must confine them in thin tubes made from a focused laser beam.   In our most recent experiment, we studied the collision of two such solitons.  We found that the character of the collision depended on the phase of the wave-oscillation between the two solitons.  If the two solitons are waving out-of-phase, such that the wave peaks of one corresponded to the crests of another, the amplitude of the two solitons in the region between them is suppressed by quantum mechanical interference.  Thus, in an out-of-phase collision it appears as if the two solitons bounce off each other without ever overlapping.  If the solitons are in-phase, on the other hand, the amplitude between solitons is maximized and the solitons appear to pass through one another.  By "tagging" the solitons, such that one is noticeably smaller than the other, we found that solitons pass through one another in all collisions, in agreement with the theoretical understanding.  We also observed two solitons annihilating each other during an in-phase collision where the density increased so much as to produce a catastrophic collapse, destroying both.  These experiments help to elucidate properties of soliton interactions that were not generally appreciated in the soliton research community.  In our other main line of research, we simulated a three-dimensional crystal lattice using standing waves of light.  We populated this light crystal with ultracold atoms, which behave like the electrons in an electronic material.  This configuration is interesting as it fulfills the basic model of a high-temperature superconductor.  (A superconductor conducts electrical current without any heat or dissipation of the flow of current).  We are attempting to determine whether this "Hubbard model" contains the essence of high-temperature superconductivity.  Despite the fact that these materials were first produced 30 years ago, physicists still do not understand how then become superconductors, and why they are superconductors at such a (relatively) high temperature.  All materials that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity share a common trait:  under certain conditions that electrons in the material order anti-ferromagnetically, such that the electron spins on adjacent lattice sits point in opposite directions.  Previous experiments had not achieved sufficiently low temperatures to exhibit t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
