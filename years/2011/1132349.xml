<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this symposium is to bring together experts in the field of polyelectrolyte complexes   and those  specializing in the field of polyelectrolyte multilayers . These fields have significant conceptual overlap  but are not often considered together. Their similarity is that they both center around noncovalent interactions between charged polymers.  The goal of the symposium on these overlapping fields is to generate new ideas and to stimulate new dialogues about polyelectrolyte theory, processing and applications. The multiple sessions of the symposium will cover a broad range of topics which include: Solution behavior of polyelectrolyte complexes, nanoparticles from these complexes, complexation of biological molecules, assembly of polyelectrolyte multilayers , transport and conduction through polyelectrolyte multilayers and complexes, swichable and responsive polyelectrolyte  and layer by layer complexes, drug delivery, and new characterization techniques. Sessions will start with an invited speaker and continue with talks selected from submitted abstracts. The request for funding is towards the travel costs of participants. The symposium, "Polyelectrolyte Complexes and Mutilayers", will be held as part of the ACS Division of Colloid and Surface Chemistry program at the 242nd  ACS  meeting in Denver CO Aug.28th- Sept.1, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyelectrolytes are polymers which contain groups which dissociate in aqueous solutions making the polymers charged either positively or negatively depending on the groups. Polyelectrolyte complexes are formed by the association of oppositely charged polymers in solution, whereas polyelectrolyte multilayers are formed by the alternating adsorption of oppositely charged polymers from solution onto a substrate. The objective of this symposium is to bring together experts in the field of polyelectrolyte complexes  and those  specializing in the field of polyelectrolyte multilayers, which share overlapping conceptual underpinnings, but are not often considered together. The multiple sessions of the symposium will cover the fundamentals of these materials and their wide ranging applications which include the fields of energy  generation (e.g. fuel cells), bio-inspired materials,  and drug delivery. The request for funding is towards the travel costs of participants. The symposium, "Polyelectrolyte Complexes and Mutilayers", will be held as part of the ACS Division of Colloid and Surface Chemistry program at the 242nd  ACS  meeting in Denver CO Aug.28th- Sept.1, 2011.</AbstractNarration>
