<AbstractNarration>This research project is a suite of laboratory experiments examining the dynamic evolution of motion of a contact junction on a fault surface which results in gross rupture - using what is called nano-seismology.  In order to understand the mechanisms leading to fluid-injection induced seismicity (IS), the mechanisms leading to rupture initiation must be defined.  This project's novel sensors will allow measurement, at a scale approaching shear of nanojunctions, of evolving frictional behavior.  Waveform inversion and forward synthetics will model measured behaviors, tying together the multiple scales across which there are self-similar frictional mechanisms, leading up to actual "slip."  The first stage of the experimental campaign is the investigation of the effects of thermoelastic strain and cementation on fault strength; the second stage will investigate the effects of contact melting on rupture initiation mechanisms.  The third set of experiments will take place in a steam driven true-triaxial geothermal reservoir simulator.  This set of tests will investigate the effects of thermal contraction, and injected water flashing to steam, as proximate causes of fault weakening. Both through-going and growing hydraulic fractures will be modeled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are potentially a major contributor to the nation's supply of clean, sustainable energy.  An EGS is an engineered subsurface heat exchanger designed to either improve a conventional hydrothermal reservoir, or to create a circulation system where hot reservoir rocks have low permeability.  This is most often done by injection of pressurized fluids.  This injection has been shown to induce seismicity, so understanding the mechanisms of why induced seismicity occurs is fundamental for utilizing this resource.  Understanding the mechanisms of induced seismicity is also necessary for the exploitation of the country's rich deposits of shale gas, and for carbon sequestration.  The Geysers hydrothermal field, which is the largest such electricity producer in the world, will serve as the field test bed; laboratory results being compared to actual seismic behavior from the Geysers through partnership with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What small motions on an earthquake fault lead up to failure?  This is a life or death question where we are making real progress.  We have undertaken a series of laboratory experiments to help solve this problem.  We chose the laboratory because we can control all the variables at work in the field, allowing us to focus on the detailed effects of each one.  We have the equations for the specimen mechanical response, (GreenÆs function), solved exactly.  We know the seismic behavior of the Plexiglas we use as the fault exactly as well as its mechanical constants.  In addition, we can measure right up to the fault, which has been impossible in the field.  As the seismologists measure closer and closer to the fault, our solutions help them decode what they are seeing.  In our tabletop experiment we model the fault with Plexiglas, which is a very good stand-in for ductile fault rock.  The actual contact between two sliding blocks is an assembly of small contacts we call asperities, rather than the entire measured surface.  The actual area of contact of these asperities is a very small percentage of the gross size of the contacting blocks.  We are able to measure size, location and force on these asperities using pressure sensitive film.  We can capture how they change as the sliding blocks are pushed past each other (similar to the San Andreas fault) using video cameras.  We measure the relative movement along the fault, and capture the seismic foreshocks with special nano-seismic sensors invented by us.  The quantitative detail of our experiments is unmatched.  We have seen that the lead-up to an earthquake starts with very slow sliding that does not emit many foreshocks.  If the fault is moving fast, or if the squeezing load is large, the number of foreshocks greatly increases.  We have discovered that the premonitory motions start at weaker sections of the fault where there are not many asperities.  The local motions surround the dense asperity areas and result in one large, strong asperity holding on at the last microsecond before the earthquake.  We have quantitative proof of these behaviors.  These behaviors have been observed in the field but it is difficult to understand the details because of all the confounding factors from field measurements.  This work is directly applicable to tribology, the study of friction.  If we step back, what we have studied is the question of what dynamics happen between sliding pieces before we have the gross sliding itself.  This is an important question for understanding the mechanics of what is friction.  Hopefully, our work will help seismologists predict earthquakes.
