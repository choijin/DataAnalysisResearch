<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Biophysical alteration of wetland geomorphology in&lt;br/&gt;response to rising sea level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our objective is to examine the evolution of networks of tidal creeks in salt marshes as&lt;br/&gt;they respond to rising sea level. We have documented rapidly growing creeks, incising into the&lt;br/&gt;marsh at 1-2 m per year, in coastal marshes throughout the South Atlantic Bight and in similar&lt;br/&gt;environments worldwide. Understanding the mechanisms driving the evolution of these drainage&lt;br/&gt;networks is crucial for predicting marsh responses to sea level rise under different conditions.&lt;br/&gt;The study will examine the physics of tidal flows and sediment erosion, while also considering&lt;br/&gt;the significant impact of marsh plants and animals (e.g. crabs) on these processes. Using a&lt;br/&gt;combination of field measurements, mesocosm experiments, and numerical modeling, we will 1)&lt;br/&gt;evaluate the physical mechanisms underlying sediment erosion in creeks, including variation in&lt;br/&gt;flow speed and processes changing the strength of the marsh soils, 2) test the hypotheses that&lt;br/&gt;crabs facilitate growth of creeks by loosening sediment through burrowing and removing&lt;br/&gt;stabilizing vegetation; and that hydrological conditions at creek heads are preferred by crabs, and&lt;br/&gt;3) develop a numerical model of creek evolution to test the importance of different parameters&lt;br/&gt;such as vegetation type, faunal density, tidal range and sediment supply on the morphological&lt;br/&gt;evolution of creeks. The model will help us to integrate our observations and generalize our&lt;br/&gt;findings over a range of conditions.&lt;br/&gt;Salt marshes provide valuable ecosystem services to humanity, but these productive habitats are&lt;br/&gt;threatened globally by accelerating sea-level rise. Understanding the impact of sea-level rise on&lt;br/&gt;the physical structure of a marsh is crucial to predicting both the response of marsh ecosystems&lt;br/&gt;and the larger-scale morphological response of the coastline. The impact of increasing water&lt;br/&gt;levels on marshes depends on complex feedbacks between physical and biological processes.&lt;br/&gt;Initial studies of this issue focused on interactions between water depth and marsh elevation,&lt;br/&gt;which affect sediment deposition and plant growth. Recently, increasing attention is being&lt;br/&gt;directed towards the manner in which creek networks evolve as they respond to the larger&lt;br/&gt;volume of water they must convey during each tidal cycle at higher sea levels. The evolution of&lt;br/&gt;creek networks is a critical component of marsh response to sea-level rise, because creek&lt;br/&gt;morphology affects the amount of water and sediment delivered to the marsh surface, and the&lt;br/&gt;drainage of the marsh, and thus, the length of time the marsh is waterlogged. In turn, the flooding&lt;br/&gt;and drainage of the marsh influences the health of plants and animals in this ecologically vital&lt;br/&gt;environment. The ability of creek networks to respond to increasing sea levels depends, in part,&lt;br/&gt;on how easy it is to erode the marsh surface, which depends on both sediment type, and on&lt;br/&gt;stabilization or loosening associated with flora and fauna. Uncovering the linkages between&lt;br/&gt;geology and biology will have bearing on the fields of geology, ecology and climatology, as well&lt;br/&gt;as those interested in coastal protection and salt marsh evolution. The project will develop a new&lt;br/&gt;modeling tool to examine response of marshes to sea-level rise, which will be broadly applicable&lt;br/&gt;to many salt marshes in the U.S. and globally.</AbstractNarration>
