<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will explore how high school students learn engineering design by investigating these students' misconceptions about engineering design.  The investigators will use a longitudinal study of high school students in three states who engage in engineering design experiences.  The analysis techniques to be employed are well-grounded in current theories.  Comparisons with college students will provide insights on how students develop design competencies.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to guide existing projects and efforts that introduce elements of engineering and design into the K-12 curriculum, particularly at the high school level.  As design becomes increasingly important in university engineering programs, an increased understanding of high school student's design experiences is need to help them transition from secondary school to college.  The project will broadly disseminate findings among the engineering education and cognitive science communities so that the research can impact practice.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

Programmatically at both university and K-12 levels, the long-term goal being sought was to gain a better understanding of the influence K-12 pre-engineering experiences have on student acquisition of design practices, and thereby afford educators the opportunity to appropriately modify instruction taking into account such prior practices. To bridge university and K-12 levels, this project builds upon a previous NSF-funded study on undergraduate engineering design education and utilizes the same design requirements and methodological approach necessary for establishing a uniform basis of comparisons among students differing in educational backgrounds, environments, and experiences. The method followed was a verbal protocol analysis based on GeroÃ†s Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) ontology which employs a task-independent approach that is distinct from a task-based or an ad hoc approach. This approach to protocol analysis is applicable across any process-based view of designing and generates results based on a common comparative measure independent of the design task.  Research Design  The fundamental research question addressed through this study was: What are the measurable cognitive differences in designing between high school students and undergraduate engineering students? The research design studied two variables, design experience and maturity, where experience is formal pre-engineering coursework and maturity was the time between data collected during the fall of both junior and senior years of high school. Two groups of participants, those with and those without formal pre-engineering course experience, were drawn from samples of high school juniors attending several rural mid-Atlantic high schools all offering the same 9th &ndash; 12th grade pre-engineering course sequence. Within these pre and non-engineering groups participants self-selected into pairs, who then were presented with an engineering design challenge and tasked with collaborating to sketch an acceptable design solution on a white board. The design sessions were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed following the FBS verbal protocol.  Results  Comparing cognitive effort between undergraduate engineering students with high school experiment and control groups on the six design issues revealed there were significant differences in function Year 1, and in expected behavior and the problem-solution (P-S) index in Year 2. Similarly for the eight syntactic design processes, Year 1 comparisons revealed differences on synthesis, analysis, reformulation II, and the P-S index, and Year 2 on evaluation, which did not occur in the first year. Also found in Year 2 were reformulation I and the P-S index differences only with the group that had taken pre-engineering courses. Comparisons between the high school experiment and control groups found there were no statistical differences in cognitive effort on design issues or design processes within either year. Furthermore, analysis of data across both years revealed no statistical differences in cognitive effort expended by these two groups within the problem and solution spaces. Typical of such novice designers, the high school participants devoted the largest amount of their cognitive effort on structure.  Discussion  Finding significant differences in cognitive effort between undergraduate engineering students and high school student groups was anticipated given there are substantial program differences. However, finding there...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
