<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) nanotags for diagnostic and security applications.  A novel class of SERS tags that exhibit much higher performance than other tag formulations were demonstrated.  This novel class of tags consists of a bimetallic nanoparticle with the Raman-active molecule trapped at the metal/metal junction.  In this project, four spectrally distinct SERS tags will be fabricated, coated with silica shells, and functionalized with antibodies to provide specific targeting for diagnostic applications, or with polymers to provide stability in solvents and inks for security applications.  Tags will be characterized using a novel high throughput flow spectroscopy instrument capable of analyzing thousands of individual SERS tags, enabling rapid optimization of tag formulations.  The performance of optimized tags will be tested in diagnostic and security applications to demonstrate and quantify tag efficacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide bright, robust, and spectrally distinct molecules and nanoparticles that can be used to identify and track biologics, people, and products.  Currently fluorescent molecules are the most commonly used tag; however, due to their spectral widths, current instrumentation is limited to tracking only 5-20 tags simultaneously.  SERS tags, with their very narrow spectral features thus more distinct variants, offer the promise of much higher multiplexing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This Phase I SBIR project focused on the technical development of a new composite nanoparticle with tunable and controllable optical properties, and determination of the commercial opportunities for using such particles in applications such as sensitive biological detection assays and anti-counterfeiting applications.  As we continue to develop formulations for these industries, nanoComposix has already commercialized a portion of the technology developed through this award, providing related nanomaterials to academic researchers and companies who are conducting fundamental scientific research and incorporating such particles into biological studies and renewable-energy (e.g. solar cells) applications.     The nanoparticles developed in this effort can be used as optical tags to identify and track biologics, people, and products.  For many applications, the more distinct variants that can be generated from a particular class of tags, the higher the degree of multiplexing and the more powerful the technology.  Previously, fluorescence labels have typically been used for these applications but have drawbacks associated with their brightness, stability, and the number of simultaneous tags that can be individually discriminated. One solution for increasing the degree of multiplexing within an assay is to use the Raman spectra of molecules to provide a spectral fingerprint of the tag.   Due to the complexity and narrow line width of the Raman peak, tags with potentially hundreds of unique signatures can be generated.  While intrinsic Raman scattering is weak and requires long measurement times to obtain a Raman spectrum, Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) from molecules near the surface of plasmonic metal nanoparticles offers the potential for intensities comparable to that of fluorescent tags.  NanoComposix and collaborators at the La Jolla Bioengineering Insitute (LJBI) have developed bimetallic Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) nanotags that are bright, uniform, and highly reproducible, and can be tuned to provide unique and complex signals for detection.     During the Phase I research period, we addressed challenges related to SERS nanotag fabrication, and developed bimetallic nanotags that are bright, uniform, and highly reproducible on a tag-to-tag basis.  By changing the Raman-active molecule incorporated into our SERS tags, we fabricated several spectrally distinct nanotags, and our technology can be adapted to produce SERS tags that are optimized for different excitation sources.  The SERS tags were attached to cells and polymer microspheres for flow cytometry measurements, and we demonstrated that such particles have potential application in anti-counterfeiting security inks.
