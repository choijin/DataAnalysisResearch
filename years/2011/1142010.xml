<AbstractNarration>1142010/Talghader&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to combine the expertise of both glaciologists and optical engineers to develop polarization- preserving optical scattering techniques for borehole tools to identify changes in high-resolution crystal structure (fabric) and dust content of glacial ice. The intellectual merit of this work is that the fabric and impurity content of the ice contain details on climate, volcanic activity and ice flow history.  Such fabric measurements are currently taken by slicing an ice core into sections after it has started to depressurize which is an extremely time-intensive process that damages the core and does not always preserve the properties of ice in its in-situ state. In addition the ice core usually must be consumed in order to measure the components of the dust. The fabric measurements of this study utilize the concept that singly-scattered light in ice preserves most of its polarization when it is backscattered once from bubbles or dust; therefore, changes to the polarization of singly-backscattered light must originate with the birefringence. Measurements based on this concept will enable this program to obtain continuous records of fabric and correlate them to chronology and dust content. The project will also develop advanced borehole instruments to replace current logging tools, which require optical sources, detectors and power cables to be submerged in borehole fluid and lowered into the ice sheet at temperatures of -50oC. The use of telecommunications fiber will allow all sources and detectors to remain at the surface and enable low-noise signal processing techniques such as lock-in amplification that increase signal integrity and reduce needed power. Further, fiber logging systems would be much smaller and more flexible than current tools and capable of navigating most boreholes without a heavy winch. In order to assess fabric in situ and test fiber-optic borehole tools, field measurements will be made at WAIS Divide and a deep log will also be made at Siple Dome, both in West Antarctica. If successful, the broader impacts of the proposed research would include the development of new analytical methods and lightweight logging tools for ice drilling research that can operate in boreholes drilled in ice.  Eventually the work could result in the development of better prehistoric records of glacier flow, atmospheric particulates, precipitation, and climate forcing.  The project encompasses a broad base of theoretical, experimental, and design work, which makes it ideal for training graduate students and advanced undergraduates. Collaboration with schools and classroom teachers will help bring aspects of optics, climate, and polar science to an existing Middle School curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most powerful methods for dating deep ice in the Polar Regions uses optical borehole logging, where an instrument is gradually lowered into a hole drilled into the ice and continually sends laser illumination out the side of the instrument. The laser light is scattered back from impurities in the ice, and the pattern of the scattered light versus depth gives critical information about the presence and timing of events such as ancient volcanic eruptions. The NSF-funded program, Optical Fabric and Fiber Logging of Glacial Ice, under principal investigator Joseph Talghader at the University of Minnesota, developed new logging technology to increase the resolution of borehole measurements. A low resolution measurement will often see many events spaced over many years as a single signal, whereas high resolution can potentially distinguish individual events down to a single year.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lightweight, optical-fiber-based borehole logger was designed and constructed for measuring ash layers in shallow and intermediate depth boreholes in the Polar Regions. This logger, shown in Figures 1 and 2, weighed only a few pounds and could easily be fit in a backpack. With appropriate packaging of the associated power supplies and lengths of fiber, this system could provide an excellent means of accessing ash layers by small teams in quickly drilled shallow boreholes and in moulins (holes produced by glacial meltwater) or warped boreholes.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The physical reasons for the high resolution of this logger was two-fold. The logger was designed so that the ports of laser emission and detection were within approximately 1cm of one another. In addition, the wavelength of the laser light source was 808nm, which was chosen so that the absorption length of the light in the ice was comparable to the scattering distance at the logging depths. This prevented dispersal of the light by scattering that would reduce the resolution of the logger.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two researchers from this program, graduate student Wing Chan and the PI, traveled to Siple Dome in Antarctica during the '13-'14 field season. After logging, they analyzed data from the fiber-optic logger, which measured the upper 300m of the Siple Dome borehole. The logger turned out to provide the highest resolution optical logging ever performed. Most excitingly, this data was found to have extremely high correlations with research on the chemically determined sulfate spikes in ice cores from the logging region. Sulfate spikes are a common chemical signature of volcanic eruptions when ice is melted and examined chemically. Twenty out of the twenty-seven spikes in optical backscattering corresponded to depths that matched with the sulfate signals of Kurbatov, as shown in Figure 3. This indicates that optical logging can have the resolution necessary to isolate specific volcanic events even when they do not dominate the background or other events in chronological proximity.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data was also found to be consistent, within the limits of the resolution differences, with data taken by a previous logger by our collaborator, Ryan Bay, of the University of California, Berkeley. The ability to resolve individual volcanic events enables further advances in optical logging to classify eruptions by tephra composition, conductivity, and particle shape. This would guide glaciologists and volcanologists rapidly to the eruptions of global impact or other scientific interest and dramatically reduce the need to painstakingly chemically analyze core from uninteresting regions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Joseph&nbsp;J&nbsp;Talghader</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1142010/1142010_10157635_1472434718656_figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1142010/1142010_10157635_1472434718656_figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2 - Optical Fiber Logger 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1142010/1142010_10157635_1472434718656_figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2 - Optical Fiber Logger 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Optical fiber logger just prior to deployment in the Siple Dome borehole.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wing Chan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joseph&nbsp;J&nbsp;Talghader</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2 - Optical Fiber Logger 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1142010/1142010_10157635_1472434928350_figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1142010/1142010_10157635_1472434928350_figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3 - Matching between Ash and Sulfates"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1142010/1142010_10157635_1472434928350_figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3 - Matching between Ash and Sulfates"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The optical signal from the logger was plotted versus depth into the ice and processed.
