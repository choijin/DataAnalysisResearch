<AbstractNarration>A broad range of observations -- from galaxies and superclusters to distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation -- tell us that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs exist and are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of cryogenic phonon-mediated devices to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. With this powerful technology, they have operated for four years the CDMS-II experiment with 30 detectors deep underground in the Soudan mine in Minnesota, and obtained the best limit worldwide at high WIMP masses. This award will fund the base program of this group to focus primarily on detector characterization and optimization, rapid-turnaround initial cryogenic screening of full-scale CDMS production detectors, rapid-turnaround Tc-testing of tungsten film samples from the detector production line, detector fabrication support, collaborative work with scientists and technical staff at new CDMS detector fabrication and substrate polishing facilities, and assistance with CDMS-related materials analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only are its scientific results important for astrophysics and particle physics, but its technological development will also push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, whose applications are increasingly widespread. In addition to working with students from Santa Clara University (SCU), an undergraduate institution, the PI actively mentors undergraduates, graduate students and junior research staff at other CDMS institutions. The close proximity of SCU to Stanford, UC Berkeley and SLAC makes close collaborations with these groups particularly easy - and tremendously beneficial to SCU students. Lastly, the SCU group does some outreach with K-12 students in the San Francisco Bay Area and supports the public outreach program at Soudan as part of the SuperCDMS collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Santa Clara University (SCU) group funded by this grant consists of several undergraduate physics students and one faculty member. The SCU group belongs to a very active collaboration of ~100 scientists and engineers from all around the world who work collaboratively on the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search Experiment (SuperCDMS). This experiment is one of the two most sensitive experiments in the world searching for weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPS - particles hypothesized to comprise the vast majority of the hidden (or "dark") matter in the universe.  The SuperCDMS experiment is housed in a self-contained laboratory ~ &frac12; mile underground in an old iron mine in Soudan, Minnesota. The underground location is important because it dramatically reduces unwanted cosmic ray interactions (and other background signals) in our detectors.  At the core of the underground SuperCDMS experiment are "towers"  of state-of-the-art semiconductor (silicon and germanium) detectors that have been coated with superconducting metal films. The films are precisely patterned on the detector faces using techniques similar to those used in the semiconductor industry to make computer chips. The SuperCDMS detectors operate continually at a temperature very close to absolute zero where quantum mechanics is important.  The detectors are made at Stanford University, in collaboration with current and former SCU group members. The advanced technology used (and in some cases developed) to make these detectors can be used also in other applications, including superconducting circuitry and materials science studies.
