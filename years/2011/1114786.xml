<AbstractNarration>This project will support the organization of a three-day international workshop on structural health monitoring at Stanford University.  The workshop activities will integrate advanced sensing technology with diagnostics, prognostics, and knowledge of material/structural damage characteristics to assess the health of structures in service to prevent structural catastrophes, minimize downtime and sustain performance, and reduce maintenance cost.  The workshop will review the current developments in this area, identify key and emerging research issues, and promote exchanges and crossfertilization across different disciplines such as sensors and sensor systems, networking, computing, data mining, integrated design, diagnostics, prognostics, signal processing, multifunctional materials, and applications such as civil infrastructures, ground/air/space transportation vehicles, and marine structures. The workshop will consists of keynote lectures by distinguished individuals from industry, university, and government, technical and poster presentations, and meeting of expert panels to discuss key issues and concerns to the industry and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide a multi-disciplinary forum for exchange of scientific information between researchers, practitioners and students.   A special faculty-student panel discussion is organized to establish a direct interface between students and distinguished researchers/academicians around the world.  The workshop will produce proceedings of the technical presentations made by different researchers and form a scientific committee to develop guidelines and recommendations for government agencies and industry to promote structural health monitoring research and its application on buildings and civil infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ National Science Foundation Project Outcomes Report for the General Public   Project Title: International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring 2011;  Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA  "Condition-&deg;&copy;?based Maintenance and Intelligent Structures"  September 13-15, 2011  PI: Fu?Kuo Chang  Award Number: 114786  Award Expires: 08/31/2012  Program Officer :  Kishor Mehta  Email: kimehta@nsf.gov  2011 INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING  SUMMARY  This report summarizes the organization and activities of the International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring held at Stanford University on Sept. 13-15, 2011 sponsored by National Science Foundation. Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an emerging technology, which integrates advanced sensing technology with diagnostics, prognostics, and knowledge of material/structural damage characteristics to estimate the health status of the structures, while in service, to prevent structural catastrophes, minimize downtimeand sustain performance, and reduce maintenance cost. It is particularly important and attractive for sustaining the performance of national infrastructure systems for both existing structures and new constructions, such as highway systems, buildings, power plants, transportation infrastructures, etc. The theme of the workshop is "Condition-Based Maintenance and Intelligent Structures." The objectives of the workshop are to review the progress of the current rapid developmenti n the technologies related to the field, identify key and emerging issues in research and development, and promote exchanges and cross-fertilization across disciplines such as sensors, sensor systems, networking, computing, data mining, integrated design, diagnostics, prognostics, signal processing, multifunctional materials, and applications such as civil infrastructures, ground/air/space transportation vehicles, and marine structures.  Distinguished individuals from industry, academe, and government were invited to deliver keynote lectures and presentations. The workshop concluded with technical papers collected into two volumes and panel discussions where major concerns from the industries on SHM development were identified during the workshop.  Intellectual merit of the proposed activities:  The workshop provided researchers an opportunity to assess across the board the current state-of-the art technology in SHM and promoted intellectual exchange in enhancing the SHM technology development across multiple industries including civil, aerospace, mechanical systems, marine, energy and off-shore platforms sectors.  The broad impacts resulting from the activities:  The workshop resulted in proceedings of the technical presentations as well as in the formation of a technical committee consisting of key personnel from government, industry, and academe. The committee was responsible for developing appropriate guidelines and recommendations for government agencies and industry to promote structural health monitoring development.
