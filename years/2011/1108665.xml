<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative project is to continue an on-going and successful program of frequent monitoring of the variability in quasar continuum emission and the response of the characteristic broad emission lines to those variations.  This provides a probe of the size of the emitting regions, their velocities via the line profiles, and allows an estimate of the mass of the central super-massive black hole. This "reverberation mapping" method is the primary way of measuring the masses of black holes in the central regions of active galaxies out to high redshifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs.  Public outreach includes involvement in the COSMOS high school summer science teaching program.</AbstractNarration>

It has long been thought that their incredible power comes from matter falling into a supermassive black hole, millions to billions of times the SunÃ†s mass. Energy can be released in the strong gravitational field surrounding a supermassive black hole with high efficiency, thereby explaining the observed luminosity of AGNs. If correct, this is a very exciting conclusion, because black holes are among the strangest objects known in the Universe, and a supermassive one may reside at the center of nearly every large galaxy. Black holes are very important in astrophysics, and they have great popular appeal as well. But to provide compelling evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes, we need to show that an extremely large mass resides within a very small volume in the center of AGNs.  We also want to determine their growth history and study their surrounding gas.  The primary method used to measure the masses of the putative black holes in AGNs is called "reverberation mapping." This technique relies on temporal variability to resolve the size of the region that produces broad emission lines, typically light days to light months, in order to use the broad-line region (BLR) as a dynamical probe of the black hole mass. Also, high-quality reverberation data can, in principle, yield details of the kinematic structure of the BLR through measurement of velocity-resolved time variability of broad emission lines, but most previous datasets have been of insufficient quality.
