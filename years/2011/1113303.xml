<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project brings a development of a new non-rotational wind energy conversion that will enable novel wind energy applications in areas where the wind energy currently cannot be used. The technology utilizes novel electrofluidic approaches to develop the wind energy system that can be easily transported and assembled and it will have much lower production and maintenance costs compared to the conventional turbine technology.  Wind energy installations are increasing worldwide at a rate exceeding 25%; however wind energy faces potential issues with aesthetics, sound, wildlife issues, shadow flicker and public safety. The current wind turbines are too large, highly visible, difficult to transport, and do not satisfy the need for quick installation of a portable wind energy system for disaster relief, military deployment, or difficult to access wind resources. The proposed technology does not use movable parts in the utilization of wind energy and will open up applications of wind energy in setting that are not conventional used, such as in cities, on bridges, skyscrapers, or large stadiums. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is based on the advantages of the proposed non-rotational technology that include efficient operation at lower wind speeds, the system does not require complicated moving parts or its costly maintenance, such as needed in conventional wind turbines. The developed products will open-up new markets both for large wind energy installations as well as home applications. Wind energy is one of the alternative sources that generates electricity without a release of harmful pollutants or gases and is one of the cheapest forms of energy available today. The proposed technology will open-up new markets for wind energy in settings where no electric grid infrastructure exists, such as in some rural farms, as well as it may provide a backup or supplemental energy source in disaster situations. It will enable novel uses of wind energy in high-rise buildings, bridges and/or as portable and transferable energy systems.</AbstractNarration>
