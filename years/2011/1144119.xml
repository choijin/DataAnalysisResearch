<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the phylogeny of green lacewings (Family Chrysopidae) using DNA sequences combined with external characteristics for all types of living and fossil species. Although there are a number of widespread, common species, the family includes at least 1200 species, many of which are poorly known and still undescribed and we lack a clear understanding of evolutionary patterns and processes in the group.  The phylogeny will be used to explore how chrysopids evolved trash-carrying in larvae and how adults use chemicals from flowers and insect prey to attract mates. A vocabulary of descriptive morphological terms for lacewings will be defined, with terms related to each other and to those used for other insects, so that they have universal meaning when related back to gene expression. This effort will deliver products such as web-based identification tools and a monograph on world genera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green lacewings are used widely throughout the world in Integrative Pest Management in both field and horticultural cropping systems as generalist predators. Thus, the phylogenetic results from this project may lead to the discovery of new species that may also be of economic importance in agriculture. The findings will also enable greater understanding of lacewing evolution, including how and when certain behaviors and biology appeared. The project will contribute to the broader goal of developing a Common Arthropod Ontology, linking phenotype (i.e. appearance) to genotype (i.e. genetics) in all insect-like organisms. This project will also provide training for two community college interns, a PhD student, and a postdoctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Green lacewings (Chrysopidae) are a charismatic group of insects familiar to specialists and non-specialists alike, frequently encountered in backyards and at porch lights during the summer months; they are used widely throughout the world in Integrative Pest Management in field and horticultural cropping systems as generalist predators. We studied the evolutionary relationships among world Chrysopidae genera, as well as relationships among the various other related families of lacewings, including&nbsp;<span>Hemerobiidae, Osmylidae, Myrmeleontidae, Mantispidae, Nymphidae, Dilaridae. Relationships among lacewings at all levels have been previously difficult to understand, both from morphological and molecular points of view. For the first time, we successfully elucidated relationships among lacewings using a variety of methods, including morphology, DNA sequences and even genomes. Using these data we explored how various interesting characteristics of lacewings have evolved, such as defensive camouflaging behavior in larvae. We now also understand for the first time, important characters in adult wings veins, especially previously controversial identities of certain wing veins across different families of lacewings.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Green lacewings are the second-most species rich families of lacewings and have been difficult to resolve their taxonomy satisfactorily in the past. Our best understanding about chrysopid taxonomiy is a now-outdated revision of the family published in 1990. By using modern cybertaxonomic approaches we used a character matrix to export natural language descriptions of all the genera of green lacewings in a single monograph, as well as made the data available for subsequent meta-data analysis. This approach has not only solved our problems regarding taxonomy of the group, but also serves as an empirical example of modernizing a traditional field of science and enabling value adding to the information generated in other fields of biodiversity discovery.</span></p> <p><span>The broader impacts of this research project include a large amount of training and mentor ship for interns, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. Four community college interns were trained in scientific methods during the project, and had individual projects for course credit. Many of these students will go on to four year degrees at local universities and the skills learned during this project will be useful in developing them for future success. Two PhD students were involved with our project, Laura Breitkreuz (collaborative project <span>DEB1144162) and Jessica Gillung (student assistant) worked with project participants during the project, and gained experience and skills in lacewing morphology, phylogenetic analysis, outreach, field work, report and manuscript writing. Importantly, both are gaining skills in analyzing genomic data, a resource that will be integral in future research programs for both. Post-doctoral research Ivonne Garzon gained important experience and skills during the project, including all of the above and also training in project development and grant writing. This will be important as she enters the professional realm and develops her own research program for a successful career.</span></span></p> <p><span><span>Quantitative phylogenetic research on Neuroptera has lagged behind other insects, primarily due to difficulties in DNA sequencing. Activities and breakthroughs during this NSF project enabled us to sequence the DNA of large numbers of Neuroptera, providing large amounts of Sanger, mitogenomic, and genomic sequence data.
