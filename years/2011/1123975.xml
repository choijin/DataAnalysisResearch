<AbstractNarration>Critical to the study of languages and how they change are longitudinal studies, which allow for the examination of communities over time. This study focuses on African American English as spoken in Harlem, New York City. African American English refers to a nonstandard variety of English characteristically spoken by African Americans in the United States. This term covers a wide range of ways of speaking, from very casual to very formal, as spoken by a range of individuals from different age groups, ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds. Today, Harlem is undergoing rapid change due to gentrification. This has resulted in a decrease of its black majority as new residents come in. The aim of this research is to examine the ways in which the language of Harlem's African American residents has changed since the 1960s, in light of the significant changes the neighborhood itself has undergone. That is, what is happening to African American English, now that Harlem is no longer home to just African Americans? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will observe and record roughly seventy-two residents of Harlem, from a range of age groups and socioeconomic classes. Social and linguistic data will be collected through sociolinguistic interviews with individuals and groups and ethnographic observations, which will then be compared to previous linguistic research conducted in Harlem in the 1960s. The current research promises to build a more comprehensive picture of language contact and change, and will shed light on issues pertaining to mediums for language transmission. This study also has implications for education, especially in urban centers, where black students continue to struggle in schools throughout the United States. A better understanding of African American English and the social circumstances under which it is used can help educators to differentiate between dialectal differences and actual learning deficiencies, and thus provide the necessary support for students.</AbstractNarration>

Puerto Rican English refers to a nonstandard variety of American English characteristically spoken by native English speakers in the United States who identify as being of Puerto Rican descent.

The New York City neighborhood of Harlem is of particular importance for the field of sociolinguistics, as it has been the site of several groundbreaking studies on African American English, Puerto Rican English and Spanish-English codeswitching. Research for these studies took place in 1960s and 1970s, at a time when the New York City Housing Authority had just finished constructing some of the largest public housing complexes&nbsp; in the area. This study aims to determine how residential shifts that have taken place in East Harlem over the last half century are visible at the linguistic level, with particular attention paid&nbsp; to the movement of residents from smaller privately-owned tenement buildings to larger government-owned low-income housing projects.

This study focuses on two linguistic variables, prosodic rhythm and production of the diphthong /ay/ (as in words like <em>bide </em>and <em>bye</em>), in the English of 30 Puerto Rican-identified native English speakers across two generations. With regard to rhythm, Puerto Rican English is traditionally fairly syllable-timed as result of contact with Spanish, a phenomenon which listeners describe as a &ldquo;staccato-like sound&rdquo;. With /ay/ monopthongization, words like <em>bide</em>, <em>bite</em> and <em>bye</em> can be pronounced &ldquo;bahd&rdquo;, &ldquo;baht&rdquo; and &ldquo;bah" respectively. The presence of /ay/ monophthongization in Puerto Rican English is thought to be the result of contact with African American English. This project seeks to determine to what extent the use of these variables may be changing over time, as East Harlem&rsquo;s Puerto Rican community has come into closer contact with African Americans over the last half century.
