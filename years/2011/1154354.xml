<AbstractNarration>Roger Williams University (RWU) is implementing the STILAS program to attract, support, graduate, and prepare academically talented STEM students with significant financial need for future success in vital STEM fields.  At least 15 students are receiving an annual renewable scholarship of up to $10,000 over four years. STILAS builds on: 1) effective recruitment and comprehensive student support services programs targeting underserved students; 2) university priorities and strengths emphasizing research and other experiences engaging students in practical applications of academic learning; and 3) academic and co-curricular activities that build group identity, enhance learning, and connect students to services and post-graduation opportunities that promote more motivated, accomplished and self-directed graduates in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to their coursework, STILAS students participate in on-going STEM-related activities such as field trips, externships, and competitions as well as cohort-specific experiences (including a mentoring program, tutoring, brown-bag discussions and undergraduate research opportunities). Building on the success of established RWU programs, STILAS participants also receive comprehensive, personalized services from the advising, student advocacy and academic support offices.  Program recruitment includes outreach to urban science and technology high schools and a free STEM camp experience to bring promising juniors to campus.  STILAS students participate in these outreach activities as role models to attract others into the STEM fields.  The project increases the academic grounding and future opportunities for students historically underrepresented in the STEM fields and supports graduates who are ready to enter industry and/or further education. STILAS is building, assessing and disseminating a comprehensive model that can broadly inform STEM outreach to underrepresented students in the U.S.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Roger Williams University (RWU) received a $586,500 National Science Foundation grant in 2009 to provide scholarship funds and academic support to increase the number and retention of underrepresented students majoring in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields at RWU.  This program, known as STILAS, was a cross-departmental endeavor that incorporated faculty in their roles as advisors, mentors, instructors and departmental liaisons; RWU Intercultural Leadership Ambassador (ILA) program members; and grant office members.  The specific objectives of STILAS were to attract 15 new academically talented STEM students with financial need, integrate the new STILAS cohort into ILA activities and develop STEM-specific programming while encouraging more RWU students with academic talent and financial need to consider STEM fields of study, and support the persistence, completion rates, and post-baccalaureate preparation of STILAS students.  STILAS students received individualized support through course-specific peer tutoring, leadership training, team building and community engagement.  STILAS provided programming tailored to the needs and interests of STEM students, including field trips to research facilities, seminars presented by leaders in the field, and community building activities.  STILAS students were connected with faculty, peer mentors and advisors, and were provided with guidance on applying to and succeeding in undergraduate research and internship opportunities.   STILAS students also received individualized support in the graduate school and post-graduate employment application process.  The STILAS program was extremely successful in supporting these students in their academic success, placing them in STEM-related research and internship opportunities, and seeing them continue in STEM fields after graduation.  The average final GPA of the STILAS students was 3.6.  All of the STILAS students engaged in on- and off-campus internships or research experiences.  The students? research experiences extended to their attendance at conferences to explore the communication of science, as well as presenting their own work.  As a result of these placements, as well as the one-to-one mentoring provided through the STILAS program, the students gained crucial post-graduate skills and insights into STEM careers, and all students secured jobs and/or graduate school placements in their STEM disciplines.   RWU?s STILAS program is a successful model of a comprehensive, cohort-based initiative integral to a sustainable undergraduate program that supports and advances all students in the STEM fields.
