<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and commercialize tools for creating and displaying interactive 3-D technical illustrations for STEM-related topics. This project takes a new approach to the problem by applying Image-Based Modeling and Rendering (IBMR) techniques which enable the creation of highly realistic digital 3-D scenes by processing and resampling images captured with a camera. In particular, the technology developed through this effort will enable a wide range of interactive 3-D visualizations that are currently poorly served by available video compression algorithms and 2-D vector-based animation tools. The first goal of the proposal is to develop methods and algorithms for capturing, compressing, and displaying these types of datasets. The second goal is to develop a prototype digital textbook chapter that will supplement a physics class on Optics. This chapter will include interactive modules explaining the basic theory of refraction, reflection, dispersion and diffraction, followed by applied lessons on how light is manipulated and measured by a modern camera and how the geometric and material properties of gemstones give rise to their rich appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop technology that will transform the ~$8.7B market for education textbooks by replacing paper textbooks with digital versions.  This transition is currently stalled because the majority of digital textbook providers are simply scanning the pages of existing textbooks. Although these "books beneath glass" are more portable and less expensive than their physical counterparts, they neglect the promising opportunity for truly interactive material. We believe this is largely due to the current lack of tools for creating and rendering the type of 3-D content that mobile devices have only recently become capable of processing. The technology developed through this project will generate business opportunities in direct content creation, consulting services, and licensing fees. The core technology will also have applications in the areas of cultural heritage, consumer marketing, and advertising.</AbstractNarration>

Each of these activities has met significant research and development milestones.  A "spin" is a visualization which allows a user to rotate an object about a central axis to inspect it from various angles and zoom levels.

This platform also allows a user to add 3D labels to their spin to highlight certain aspects of the object. (See http://arq.io/ant for a demo.)  Once a spin has been published, the link can be shared so that anyone with a modern web-browser can also inspect the spin.  Arqball Spin has enabled many interesting new applications in education---both K-12 and college---and online commerce.  Our key innovations in capture, compression, and rendering, have enabled a broad community of users to become 3D content creators instead of consumers.  In addition to Arqball Spin, we have developed an internal tool for creating 3D geometry of molecules and large proteins from specifications that are publicly available through online repositories like PubChem and the Protein Databank.
