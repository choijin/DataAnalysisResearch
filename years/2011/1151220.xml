<AbstractNarration>CBET 1151220/ Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF CAREER award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program supports the development of a novel containment strategy for engineered organisms based on synthetic auxotrophy. Synthetic auxotrophs provide a strategy for mitigating the risks of accidental environmental release of novel organisms developed using the tools of synthetic biology. The synthetic auxotrophs developed in this study will be engineered such that their viability is dependent upon a chemical not found in nature. Therefore these organisms cannot survive outside the contained environments to which the synthetic compound has been added. The process for generating these synthetic auxotrophs involves a novel protein engineering strategy. It takes a protein critical to the growth of the organism encoded by an essential gene and rewires its interactions with the cell such that it can only grows in the presence of the synthetic compound.  Along with the development of containment strategies, the PI will develop an interactive website that provides context and navigation through the diverse training resources available on the internet.  Based around the idea of a Trail, or a series of related electronic content, the site will guide students through tutorials, quizzes, and multimedia content towards mastery of specific subject areas. These subjects include the technical implementation of synthetic biology, as well as design theory, basic science, and issues of human practice.  Together these efforts address key unresolved issues of biosafety and training in this field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sought to address two major issues in synthetic biology:  the need for a biosafety containment technology and education materials for the new field.  We successfully developed solutions to both needs and presented materials in publication and online.     Ligand-dependent essential genes  Many applications of synthetic biology are hampered by the lack of robust biocontainment solutions.  These include the production of bioactive chemicals and the use of live cells as therapeutics including probiotics and T-cell immunotherapy.  For these applications where some harmful situations could occur during normal use, it is important to be able to shut the cells down on demand. We developed a biosafety technology that enables this type of control.  We developed the means of finding mutations to native genes that render them dependent on a chemical that must be provided to the cells to maintain viability.  When the chemical is omitted, the engineered cells die. Thus, we can control the viability of the organism by feeding the chemical when its growth is desired, and terminate growth by withholding the chemical. The technology works by combining a genetic selection with targeted mutagenesis. We used molecular biology techniques to punch holes in proteins required for the growth of the organism.  We targeted specific sites within the proteins and randomized them to generate a diversity of holes.

Synthetic Biology Trails  Despite building on a rich tradition of molecular biology and biotechnology, there are many new concepts in synthetic biology that have not been described in an educational format for younger students. We have developed Synthetic Biology Trails as a resource for students and the general public interested in learning more about how the technology works and its economic and social implications.
