<AbstractNarration>Sensing of biomolecular species with required sensitivity, specificity and engineering constraints is critical to numerous fields; ranging from environmental monitoring of toxic species to personalized health diagnostics. The diverse and multiple considerations for such a viable sensor system require interdisciplinary approach that combines the innate specificity of biological binding events, a signal transduction platform that is widely deployable and the necessary economic, ergonomic and systems-level constraints. &lt;br/&gt;Given such needs for diverse and multifaceted approaches, international collaborations are essential to advancing our understanding of multiplexed integrated sensor arrays for biochemical sensing. Bio-engineered sensors research requires numerous device engineering simulations, process iterations and high-level laboratory experimentation in which Northwestern (NU) and University of Basel (UB) have substantial complementary resources and expertise. &lt;br/&gt;This OISE collaborative project will bring together US and Swiss researchers to address the critical needs in biomolecular sensing. The project leverages strong existing cantilever-based sensors research activities in individual groups at NU in Evanston, IL and UB at Basel, Switzerland. The project aims to develop sensor systems that are simple-to-use, cost effective, widely deployable, and amenable to massively parallel (multiplexed) detection of diverse biomolecular species that are critical to many technologies ? ranging from environmental monitoring to personal health markers. These would include DNAs, proteins and viral pathogens; for example. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed collaboration will provide scientists and students access to facilities and expertise not available at respective individual institutions. The international collaboration will also help industries to engage highly-trained personnel in fields involving applications of multiplexed sensor technologies. The collective effort through this OISE international collaborative program between Northwestern and Basel will set the stage for biomolecular sensor development and applications using silicon-based detection platform that has considerable promise as a point-to-care, handheld, cost-effective and widely deployable detection system.</AbstractNarration>

Specific findings include:   1) Northwestern group developed the integrated readout cantilever and provided to Swiss counterpart for detecting malignant cancer via breathe and other related methods.   2) Northwestern and University of Basel group jointly designed and custom made fluidic cell where probe-target binding of biomolecules can be monitored under physiological conditions. These fluids cells are compatible with both electronic and optical readouts. Basel group developed software controlled chamber for detecting malignant cancer via patient breathe. Hardware electronic has been developed by them as well.   3) Both teams developed strategies for extending this program to Broader level in terms of joint development of handheld devices for cantilever based assay development and identify several potential cardiac, cancer and food borne diseases markers for further studies.    Broader Impact: Two graduate students availed the unique opportunity to get training in world-renowned labs in Switzerland, under Profs. Gerber and Muller. Key publications resulted from this collaboration, including an invited perspective in Nature Naotech. journal. Pi utilized project findings in course/curricula at Northwestern as well as many open houses and public outreach. Based on the project, PI conducted Townhall lecture for broader public dissemination.   The project team undertook several educational and outreach initiatives during the current project period. The Northwestern team led by PI (Dravid) used the NUANCE center forum to demonstrate the electronic chip development by creating several project modules for summer interns ranging from optimization of receptor chemistry to device simulation and characterization several advanced microscopy techniques and fabrication. The PI introduced the concept of electronic readout based cantilevers for application as electronic feedback on advanced SPM in the Freshmen Course, MSc 190: Freshmen Seminar, during fall 2013.   Project research helped developed nanomechanical sensors as potential personalized diagnostics methodology.
