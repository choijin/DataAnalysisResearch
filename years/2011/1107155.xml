<AbstractNarration>This new initiative is developing a pilot program to recruit undergraduate physical science and engineering students from underrepresented groups into the graduate program in the Department of Geosciences at Stony Brook University, educate them via formal courses and research projects to the M. S. degree in geosciences, and position them for employment as science associates in national user facilities of the U. S. Department of Energy [DOE], including the National Synchrotron Light Source [NSLS] at the Brookhaven National Laboratory [BNL].  This new program builds on the evolving relationship between professors from Historical Black Colleges and Universities [HBCUs] and the NSLS at BNL.  An outcome of this relationship has been the creation of an Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Educational Access in Science and Engineering [INCREASE], an organization to promote research in HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions [MSIs], involving utilization of national user facilities such as the NSLS at BNL.  This award, when combined with matching funds from NSLS, is supporting 3 students per year in this program. This program is addressing well-recognized low levels of participation by African-American students in the geosciences and is fostering development and training of the diverse scientific and technical workshop required for 21st century geoscience careers.  In addition to INCREASE and the NSLS, partners in this new initiative include:  the Center for Inclusive Education at Stony Brook University and the Office of Educational Programs at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF GEO-11-07155  September 2011 to August 2016  $198,339 for 5 years     "A Career Path for African-American Students from HBCUs to National Laboratories"     Project Outcomes Report  3 October 2016     The geosciences have the lowest diversity of all the science, technology, engineering and mathematics [STEM] disciplines [Huntoon et al., 2015].  To address this poor record, the NSF Directorate for Geosciences established a new program entitled "Opportunities for Enhancing Diversity in the Geosciences [OEDG]." In 2011, we created a new initiative at Stony Brook University: "A Career Path for African-American Students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities [HBCUs] to National Laboratories."  The goals of this new initiative are to: Recruit undergraduate science and engineering students  from underrepresented groups that received their undergraduate degrees from minority-serving institutions into the graduate program in the Department of Geosciences at Stony Brook University; Educate these student trainees through formal courses and research projects to the M. S. in Geosciences Instrumentation; Provide these student trainees with a marketable skill set in an emerging field between science and technology; Prepare these student trainees for employment as science associates in national user facilities of the U. S. Department of Energy [DOE], such as the National Synchrotron Light Source [NSLS] at the Brookhaven National Laboratory [BNL].   Our program builds on the longstanding relationship between professors from Historical Black Colleges and Universities [HBCUs] and BNL.  An outcome of this relationship has been the creation of an Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Educational Access in Science and Engineering [INCREASE], an organization whose main role is to support and advance research involving national laboratories and thereby to afford access to research facilities not available to HBCU faculty at their home institutions; our colleague Gabriel Gwanmesia from Delaware State University is a founding member of INCREASE.  We have reached out to our colleagues at INCREASE institutions to help us identify and recruit students.  To date, this program has graduated three M. S. students:  Ashley Thompson from Delaware State University; Melissa Sims from the University of South Carolina; and Adair&eacute; Heady from Delaware State University.  In December 2013, Ashley Thompson successfully defended her MS thesis entitled:  "Development of Microreactor System for in situ Invesitgation of Rock-Brine-CO2 interactions."  In January 2014, Ashley was admitted to the PhD program in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook.  In May 2014, Melissa Sims successfully defended her MS thesis entitled: "Beyond FIT2D: Calculating Intensity Errors for Data Analysis of X-ray Synchrotron Powder Diffraction Data." Melissa was admitted to the PhD program in Geosciences in September 2014 and is conducting her thesis research under the supervision of Lars Ehm.  In August 2014, Adair&eacute; Heady successfully defended her MS thesis entitled: "Internal Resistive Heating of an Almax-Boehler Diamond Anvil Cell".  Adair&eacute; and is seeking employment at a national laboratory such as Brookhaven National Lab.    With graduations of Heady, Sims and Thompson, the first contingent of students in our diversity program successfully achieved their goal of a MS in Geosciences Instrumentation, within a two-year period.   In September 2014, Brandon Rhymer from the University of the US Virgin Islands enrolled in the MS in Geosciences Instrumentation program.  Brandon was a summer student at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 2012 and 2013 and was mentored there by Gabriel Gwanmesia and Lars Ehm.  In May 2016, Brandon successfully defended his MS thesis entitled "py321DIAS: Data Intensity Analysis Software for 2D Powder Diffraction Data."  He has returned to his home institution to teach for a year before deciding whether to pursue further graduate study.                   Melissa Sims, the student mentioned above who is now enrolled in the PhD program in Geosciences and has been awarded a prestigious W. Burghardt Turner Graduate Fellowship by the Center for Inclusive Education and the Graduate School at Stony Brook. Funding from our diversity program will provide the matching and supplemental funding for both  Melissa as she proceeds in her doctoral research.  In May 2014, our program "A Career Path for African-American Students from HBCUs to National Laboratories" received the Dean?s Award for Excellence and Innovation in Graduation Education at Stony Brook University.  In the July 1, 2016 issue of EOS-Earth &amp; Space Science News magazine of the American Geophysical Union, we published an article entitled:  "Creating Career Paths for African-American Students in Geosciences."  This article has elicited very favorable comments from colleagues throughout the world.      References     Huntoon, J. E., C. Tanenbaum, and J.
