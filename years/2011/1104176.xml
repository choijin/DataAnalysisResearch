<AbstractNarration>The National Center for Supply Chain Technology Education is a consortium of five strategically located community colleges across the nation with robust programs preparing technicians for careers in private and public sector supply chain technology. The institutions are: Norco College, CA, Sinclair Community College, OH, Oakton Community College, IL, Jefferson Community and Technical College, KY, and Tacoma Community College, WA.  The supply chain technician workforce is over 11 million workers and is expected to grow during the next ten years.  The Center engages strategic partners nationally across the private and public supply chain continuum: manufacturing, distribution, warehousing and information technology,   A 2+2+2 model supply chain career pathway is developed with educational partners at all three levels to provide education for positions beyond the entry level.  Professional development is provided for faculty at all three educational levels.  Successful practices are disseminated through face-to-face and electronic means. Evaluative activities measure the progress of the Center toward its goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary of Achievements  Norco College, along with Sinclair and Oakton Community Colleges, established the National Center for Supply Chain Technology Education in August of 2011.  In its first five years of operation, the Center has:  Established a strong, committed industry leadership team with membership that includes Target, FedEx Ground, UPS, Cardinal Health, Toyota and Walmart Conducted national and state labor market research for the occupation of supply chain technician Developed a model program of study for supply chain technician Produced a variety of instructional support materials for the model program, including career awareness lesson plans, course outlines, videos, case studies, white papers and an interactive e-textbook titled Introduction to the Automated Warehouse Acquired 53 educational collaborators in 17 states and  Established a self-sustaining model of collaboration for industry and education.     Intellectual Merit    Through collaboration with its Industry Leadership Team, the National Center for Supply Chain Technology Education (NCSCTE) has developed industry-driven curricular content for its model program.  This type of collaboration between education and industry represents the gold standard of technician education.  In sharing the model program with educational collaborators, knowledge of the field is advanced.  Through the efforts of the NCSCTE, industry is learning how to engage with education to ensure that curriculum provides students with the skills that are needed.  NCSCTE educates the public about the occupation of supply chain technician and its opportunities and informs individuals how to become one.  This increases the visibility of supply chain technology as a field of study and practice.  Broader Impacts of the Work   Through its implementation of supply chain technology pathways, the NCSCTE is increasing the number of highly-qualified supply chain technicians to meet the growing national need.  Industry?s involvement in the development of the model program ensures that students at collaborating educational institutions possess the skills and knowledge that industry needs.  As industry is ensured a skilled workforce, it can more quickly automate and expand its operations.   As more supply chain technicians are hired, the demand for the training increases, and with consistent program enrollment and labor market demand, community colleges are able to commit to permanently offering a supply chain technology program to students.  This makes training more available to potential technicians, who naturally seek technical training in a location close to where they reside.  This process by which the educational, industrial and human resource infrastructure is developed represents that which ensures long-term sustainability of the supply chain workforce ecosystem.  The establishment of this ecosystem contributes to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increases the number and quality of partnerships between education and industry; improves the strength and quality of the supply chain workforce; and makes U.S. companies more competitive in the global marketplace, which produces a significant, enduring impact on the national economy as whole.
