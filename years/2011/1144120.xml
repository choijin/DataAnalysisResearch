<AbstractNarration>Flows of partially ionized plasma are frequently characterized by the presence of both thermal and nonthermal populations of ions. This occurs, e. g., in the outer heliosphere, the part of interstellar space beyond the solar system whose properties are determined by the solar wind (SW) interaction with the local interstellar medium (LISM). Understanding the behavior of such flows requires us toinvestigate a variety of physical phenomena occurring throughout the solar system.  The current proposal addresses the question the sky-spanning "ribbon" of unexpectedly intense emissions of ENAs detected by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission. By modeling the heliosphere using the resources of the Blue Waters facility at NCSA its becomes possible to analyze such puzzling astrophysical flows as those in the Guitar nebula, and compare modeling with remote observations. Numerical solution of these problems with the realistic boundary conditions provided by remote and in situ observations of the SW properties, requires the application of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technologies and petascale supercomputers. Codes developed during the NSF ITR program and various NASA projects will be used for the modeling and compared with observations by IBEX.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><em>Intellectual merits.</em></strong> This project made it possible to obtain breakthrough results related to the physics of the solar wind (SW), local interstellar medium (LISM), and their interaction. Collision of the SW and LISM plasmas creates a boundary, which is called the heliopause. The SW flow is also characterized by the presence of a so-called heliospheric termination shock. Similarly, depending on the strength of the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF), a bow shock can be formed in front of the heliopause. Since the LISM is partially ionized, charge exchange between interstellar hydrogen atoms and SW protons plays a major role in the SW-LISM interaction. The structure of the inner heliosphere and physical processes occurring in it are studied through in situ measurement from a fleet of spacecraft orbiting Earth, e.g., ACE, STEREO, Ulysses, Wind, etc., and remote observations from different solar observatories. The outer heliosphere, the one which is affected by LISM neutral atoms, is investigated by direct measurements of the Voyager and New Horizons spacecraft and remotely by Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), and Hubble Space Telescope. Numerical simulations, such as performed in this project, allow us to interpret and explain observational data. Our computational modeling revealed the physical phenomena accompanying the SW propagation from the Sun to the very boundary of the heliosphere: (1) we investigated the propagation of coronal mass ejections toward Earth where they may affect the energetic particle environment and create situations hazardous to both humans and electronic devices; (2) we have shown that the charge exchange and ISMF pressure compete in making the heliosphere asymmetric; (3) two years before the actual measurement of Voyager 1, we predicted such unusual phenomenon as the backward SW flow that lasts as long as 2 years; (4) we have shown the possibility of spontaneous transition of the SW flow to a turbulent regime in the region between the heliospheric termination shock and the heliopause; (5) our simulations showed that directions towards the IBEX "ribbon" of enhanced energetic neutral atom flow coincide with the lines of sight perpendicular to the ISMF lines draping around the heliopause and proposed a viable mechanism for this phenomenon; (6)&nbsp; we have shown that the heliopause is subject to different kind of&nbsp; instabilities affecting the SW-LISM interface; (7) we have shown that the heliotail - the downwind part of the heliosphere - is likely to be as long as a few tens of distances from the Sun to Earth and that it affects the influx of very high energy cosmic rays into the inner heliosphere; (9) by fitting observational data, we were able to establish constraints on the otherwise unknown properties of the interstellar medium.</p> <p>Numerical simulations have been performed with our in-house Multi-Scale Fluid Kinetic Simulation Suite (MS-FLUKSS) that is a collection of codes solving the coupled time-dependent, 3D MHD, gas dynamics, turbulence, and kinetic Boltzmann equations in the adaptive mesh refinement framework. The codes scales well to 160,000 computing cores and have been ported on major national supercomputers.</p> <p><strong><em>Broader impact.</em></strong> The impact on other disciplines is through the ubiquity of physical processes we are modeling. This is true not only for space physics and astrophysics, but also for the fusion plasma. In particular, the neutral beam heating mechanism is very similar to what happens in the SW-LISM interaction. Besides, the work we have implemented is expected to have a major impact in many other areas. Our code development and numerical results obtained from it provide a major leap forward in the computation and simulation of complex charged and neutral gas systems. The development of codes that embrace &ldquo;coupling complexity&rdquo; via the self-consistent incorporation of multiple physical scales and processes in models is viewed as a pivotal development in the different plasma physics areas for the current decade. The ubiquity of the underlying model suggests numerous applications to other space physics (e. g., space weather related and Solar Probe+ mission), astrophysics, and, in general, plasma physics problems. The components of our physical model and corresponding code routines in the publicly accessible simulation suite may be also useful to model plasma-beam interactions in Tokamak fusion devices to be implemented in the burning plasma experiment ITER. Besides the impact on the modeling of complex physical systems, we anticipate that our approach to computational resource management for complex codes utilizing multiple algorithm technologies will be a major advance on current approaches. The development of sophisticated resource management technologies will be essential for all future modeling efforts that incorporate a diversity of scales and physical processes. Our collaboration with the Blue Waters team allowed us to further promote the application of adaptive technologies to contemporary plasma physics problems through the development of publicly available packages suitable for multiple applications.<br /> <br /></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/07/2016<br>      Modified by: Nikolai&nbsp;V&nbsp;Pogorelov</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1144120/1144120_10181384_1470538521932_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1144120/1144120_10181384_1470538521932_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Transition to turbulence in the heliosheath."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1144120/1144120_10181384_1470538521932_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Transition to turbulence in the heliosheath."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Transition to chaotic behavior in the inner heliosheath, the solar wind region between the termination shock and the heliopause.
