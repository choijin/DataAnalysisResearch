<AbstractNarration>This Type 2 project is expanding the use of the POGIL (Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) approach in psychology to eight sites within the Touro College system, a diverse multi-campus institution. Instructional materials for experimental psychology labs based on the POGIL approach (developed with support from a CCLI Phase 1 grant) are also being expanded.  The pedagogical approach now includes a version of a student preceptor model developed in a CCLI Phase 1 grant to St. Olaf College.  Early results indicate that combining POGIL with student preceptors boosts student learning.  In order to disseminate this work, workshops are being conducted on Touro College campuses and are planned for nearby colleges in order to reach faculty from other institutions in the tri-state (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut) area - especially those with underserved populations.  The workshops provide hands-on experience with the POGIL materials.  Feedback from faculty and students at other institutions is serving to further refine and revise the new curricular materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: In addition to testing and refining the extant POGIL instructional materials and widening the community of users to additional campuses, the current project is also developing a performance assessment instrument in order to test the impact of the new instructional materials on students' abilities to apply principles in experimental psychology laboratories.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The standardized set of POGIL instructional materials are being disseminated for use at other institutions, first locally within the Touro College system, then in the New York tri-state area, and eventually nationally. They have the potential to be used by many students at other colleges.  The POGIL approach has proven to be particularly effective for students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major outcomes were:  (1)   We developed a set of process -oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) materials for the Experimental Psychology Laboratory. We revised and improved on the modules based on feedback we received from faculty and students.  (2)   We expanded the use of the POGIL instructional materials we developed for the Experimental Psychology Labs from three to eight sites at Touro College, a diverse multi-campus commuter institution.  (3)   We developed POGIL curricular materials on the following topics for the Experimental Psychology Laboratory:  Mean, Median and Mode; Correlation Coefficients; Truncated Range; Retrospective Studies; How to Design an Experiment; Single Factor Designs vs. Factorial Designs; Common Types of Interactions; Between Subjects Designs; Repeated Measures ANOVA; Matching;  Insight Learning:  Kohler?s Chimps; Iconic Memory; Priming and Memory;  Color Perception; Pattern Recognition; Inductive reasoning vs. deductive reasoning;  Top-down processing vs. Bottom-up processing;  Learning:  The Premack Principle;  Learning:  What is a Token Economy?;  Reading and Interpreting Graphs;  Prospective Memory:  Event-based and Time-based; Student t-tests; Two-Way ANOVA;  Reconstructive Memory; Psychophysics:  Absolute threshold and Difference Thresholds;  Chi-Square Tests; The Three Store Model of Memory:  Sensory Store, STS and LTS; Transfer from STS to LTS; Latent Learning; Psychophysics:  Signal Detection Theory; Tests:  Test-retest reliability; internal consistency;  Clark and Chase?s work (sentence/picture comparison); Depths of Processing; Sternberg?s Scanning of Short-Term Memory; Hemispheric Specialization and Split-Brain Research; Cognitive Neuroscience:  Dr. Raichle?s Research;  Cognitive Neuroscience:  Brain Fingerprinting;  Rosch?s work on Prototypes; Collins and Quillian?s work on Semantic Memory; Habituation/Preference Paradigms and infant memory;  Object Permanence and Infant Memory;  Case categories; the Stroop Effect; the Wason Selection Task; Pragmatic Reasoning Schemata;  Bandura?s Work with Modeling of Aggression; Milgram?s Prisoner Experiment;  Operant conditioning.                                   (4)   We used a preceptor model. Before the start of each semester, seminars were conducted for selected outstanding students who took our Experimental Psychology Labs.  These  students then served as preceptors:  They were assigned to the labs and aided the instructors by circulating among the student learning teams to assist in the guided-inquiry process.  (5)   We conducted many well-attended workshops to train the faculty teaching at the five new sites and for external colleges on the use of POGIL materials in the Experimental Psychology Labs. This was part of our efforts at disseminating our POGIL instructional materials to other colleges and universities. (6)   We will be publishing our curricular materials with Pacific Crest Publishing .  We also have a website http://pogilforexperimentalpsychologylabs.org/ that contains a representative sample of our POGIL modules. We are submitting a revision of an article for publication.             Last Modified: 11/29/2017       Submitted by: Barbara T Rumain]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
