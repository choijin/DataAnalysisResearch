<AbstractNarration>Individuals can perceive the same risk in different ways, construing it either more abstractly or concretely. It is currently not known how one's level of construal affects behavioral response to risks in the real world. The objective of this project is to test if the effects of construal level on decision making found in the laboratory can be replicated with personally relevant risks and environmental problems. Specifically, we are studying if presenting an abstract risk more concretely increases behavioral change and risk perception by presenting the risk of radon in the home in a message frame that reduces psychological distance. Additionally, we are examining if putting the decision maker into an abstract construal level increases behavioral change and risk perception by including a construal level manipulation prior to the risk message to ensure that the risk is being presented on a congruent level of abstraction. Finally, the research is determining which is more effective at bringing about behavioral change by focusing on the risk or the mitigating behavior required by testing two different message frames in an experimental survey. The research demonstrates the most effective way to use construal levels in risk communication to increase their effectiveness and paint a fuller, more nuanced picture of the role of construal levels in real world decision making. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is producing real and meaningful benefits to both public and environmental health. The general framework tested here (encouraging individuals to incur a short term cost in exchange for a greater long term gain) is the same for a myriad of other health risks such as smoking, HIV testing, and sun exposure. An improved method of communicating these risks may result in an increase in the adoption of healthier behaviors, leading to more lives saved and healthier lives lived.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Construal Level Theory of Psychological Distance provides a way to classify how we see the world.  Objects, ideas, or risks can be construed as relatively more general and abstract, or more specific and concrete.  Additionally, objects, ideas, and risks can also be removed from us and our direct experience on four different dimensions:  temporal, spatial, social, and hypotheticality.  Those objects which are nearer to us in time and space, involve people who are similar to us, and have a higher likelihood of occurring are construed more concretely than those which are farther away, involve people who are unlike us, and have a low likelihood of occurring.  Construal levels can be manipulated through message frames that use either general or specific words, phrases, and information.  It is important to understand how construal levels can be changed because a personÆs subjective level of construal influences their perceptions, preferences and decisions.  Smple changes in word usage can have a real and measurable impact on the audienceÆs behavior.  Our research has shown that altering only a few words was enough to produce significant differences in the amount of home radon test kits respondents requested and completed, even though the information delivered was essentially the same.  We found that respondents who lived in areas of high risk were more motivated by a broader and more general message frame, while those who lived in areas of low risk were more motivated by a specific and more localized message frame.  This contradicts the conventional wisdom long held by risk communicators, which favored a specific and localized message frame for all risks in all circumstances. We suggest that there is no neutral way to a risk message, yet information must be communicated to the public in order to close the gap between perceived and actual risk.  By understanding how a risk may be construed, and composing risk communicating messages that match that level of construal, it is possible to increase the success of risk communication efforts. Psychological distance can also be applied when communicating public policies.  Because public policies are abstract concepts, they are construed abstractly.  Therefore, by matching that abstract level of construal when communicating information regarding the policy, it is possible to get an audience to engage in more deliberate consideration and decision making.  One simple way to do this is by creating psychological distance between the individual and the policy.  Our research shows that the public consider a policy to be more personally relevant when it was to be implemented ten years in the future compared to the same policy when it was to be implemented immediately.         There is essentially no neutral message frame.  It is extremely difficult to communicate information in a way that is not either general or specific.  Because of this, it is easy to change how people construe a risk.  This can be done by framing the risk using either general or specific words (building vs home), data (deaths per year vs deaths per day), and setting or scale (town vs nation).   Risk communicators should try to match construal levels.  Care should be taken to match the construal level of the frame or message to how the risk is construed whenever possible.  More thought and effort are put into decision making when thinking abstractly about an abstract object, or thinking concretely about a concrete object.   Use a specific and localized message frame when your audience is at a relatively low level of risk (e.g., "3 people die every day in your state").  Our research showed that in areas of low levels of radon, presenting information in a specific message frame resulted in a greater number of radon tests than a specific frame.   Use a more general and globalized message frame when your audience is at a relatively high level of risk (e.g., "22,000 people die every year in the United States").
