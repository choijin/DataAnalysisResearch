<AbstractNarration>Scientific inquiries generate many different kinds of shapes.  Protein backbones are represented as curves, MRI scans give us a three-dimensional representation of the brain, and stress tensors in materials can be represented by point sets in a curved manifold.  Because of improvements in data gathering and sensing technologies, we now have large databases of shapes, and have the chance to gain a deeper understanding of scientific processes by performing detailed analysis of these shape collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shape databases are large and complex.  Thus, a core challenge when analyzing shape collections is finding succinct descriptions, or synopses, of these collections.  Such synopses give us snapshots of the data, describe local and global variations in a population,  and provide the building blocks for advanced and rigorous data analysis.  However, shapes have complex representations, and the spaces that shapes inhabit are mathematically intricate.  Computing compact synopses with provable quality requires new geometric and algorithmic ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI, using experience in the areas of shape matching, data analysis, synopsis data structures, and the geometry of non-Euclidean spaces, will develop a suite of algorithmic techniques for producing synopsis structures on shapes, including generalized means and medians, clusterings, subspace representations, and approximate histograms and distributions.  This research lays the foundations for rigorous data analysis in shape spaces.  It  develops the algorithmic and geometric building blocks that will yield a deeper understanding of these spaces, and in doing so will yield many new ideas for computations in the non-Euclidean spaces that shapes inhabit.  More broadly, the computational study of shape as a pathway to deeper scientific inquiry takes advantage of the power of computational methods as well as growing stores of data, and creates new opportunities for the emerging area of data-driven science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Shapes arise in numerous scientific domains, ranging from medical imaging to groups of people.  Moreover, at each intermediate analysis steps, the data itself is modeled through various shapes.  In this project we developed several fundamental techniques and analysis methods for processing and representing groups of such shapes.  These groups emerge from multiple views over times, ensembles of observations, or models of possible shapes due to uncertainty inherent in the data.  As such these groups of shapes serve as the basis for much of modern data analysis.   Our main contributions take the form of a suite of techniques for efficiently and compactly representing this data while retaining the true synopsis shape within bounded error; these synopsis structures are often called coresets or sketches.  Highlights of our results include the first coreset for ensembles of shapes defined by locational uncertainty and the first coreset which allows topologically-preserving reconstruction of a central underlying shape.  We also develop and demonstrated our techniques at enormous scales, for instance sketches that work through massively parallel systems and demonstrated on 100s of millions of input shapes.  Emerging partially from the work developed within this project, these coresets and sketches for data shape space are becoming a standard method for managing large-scale structured data sets with rigorous accuracy guarantees.
