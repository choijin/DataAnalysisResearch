<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras that will provide training for 10 students for ten weeks, during the summers of 2012-2014.  The program focuses on molecular biosciences -- the application of molecular biology and bioinformatics to major areas of biology like molecular genetics, microbiology, neuroscience and evolution. The Department of Biology faculty will serve as mentors, who will offer a wide range of interesting and exciting projects for the students. Parallel to the research work, students will participate in a series of workshops and seminars, such as the responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities, and the graduate school application process. The REU students have access to a rich array of individual mentor's facilities as well as many interdepartmental labs and centers with core facilities such as electron and confocal microscopy, sequencing, microarray analysis, proteomic analysis, etc. In addition, students will write a scientific report on their research project and present their work at an end-of-program symposium. The program's multi-phase recruitment effort consists of both traditional "hard copy" formats as well as digital-based advertising. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in biomolecular sciences. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://biology.uprrp.edu/undergraduate/ur_research_oportunities.htm, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Migdalisel Colon at lisycolonberlingeri@yahoo.com) or the co-PI (Dr. Jose E Garcia at jegarcia@hpcf.upr.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The REU-"Channeling Bio-Majors into Research Careers in Bio-Molecular Sciences and Informatics" summer research exeperience at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus targeted students interested in cellular and molecular biology and bioinformatics.  Thirty students participated in the program over the 3 years of the grant.  Students came from mainly teaching (non-research) universities from Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the mainland where a similar research experience was not available.  Students worked in a research laboratory during 10 weeks, under the supervision of the laboratory principal invetigator.  Fourteen investigators from the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras Campus and from the Medical Sciences Campus served as mentors.  This was a "hands-on" experience where students participated in the design and performance of experiments and the acquisiton and analysis of results.  Additional activities included workshops and seminars to develop other professional aspects.  The summer experience ended with a Symposium attended by students, faculty and general public where the students presented their research and answered questions from the public.   A recent survey was conducted to determine the academic and professional career choices of students that had previously participated in our REU from 2012&ndash;2014.  57% of participants (17 out of 30) responded to this anonymous online survey. Of the 5 participants that have already completed their BS degree,  1 has continued onto graduate school in Biological Sciences, 3 have chosen a professional career in the biotechnology and medical devices industry and 1 is pursuing a graduate degree in science education technology.  Of the students that have yet to obtain their BS degree,  6 are aiming towards obtaining a graduate degree in a STEM discipline, 2 are aiming for entry into an MD/PhD programs, 3 are aiming for entry into medical school and 1 has expressed interest in pursuing a graduate degree in medical technology. These data reflect the success of the program in channeling underrepresented minority undergraduate students into careers in science.
