<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project between Tufts University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is researching and developing a new version of the Scratch programming language to be called ScratchJr, designed specifically for early childhood education (K-2). The current version of Scratch, which is widely implemented, is intended for ages 8-16 and is not developmentally appropriate for young children. This work will provide research-based evidence regarding young children's abilities to use an object-oriented programming language and to study the impact this has on the children's learning of scientific concepts and procedures. The team will develop ScratchJr in an iterative cycle, testing it in both in the Devtech lab at Tufts and the Eliot Pearson lab school and with a wider network of early childhood partners.  At the end of the three-year project, ScratchJr will have been tested with approximately 350 students in K-2, 40 parents, and 58 early childhood educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ScratchJr will have three components: 1) a developmentally appropriate interface, with both touch screen and keyboard/mouse options; 2) an embedded library of curricular modules with STEM content to meet federal and state mandates in early childhood education; and 3) an on-line resource and community for early childhood educators and parents.  The research questions focus on whether ScratchJr can help these young children learn foundational knowledge structures such as sequencing, causality, classification, composition, symbols, patterns, estimation, and prediction; specific content knowledge; and problem solving skills.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary proposal makes contributions to the fields of learning technologies, early childhood education and human computer interaction. ScratchJr has the potential for broad implementation in both formal and informal settings.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The ScratchJr project began as an idea: can young children learn the basic concepts of computer programming, and if so, how can we teach them? Professor Marina Umaschi Bers of Tufts University and Professor Mitchel Resnick of MIT set out to answer this question, with help from the Playful Invention Company, and funding from the National Science Foundation. The team used Resnick&rsquo;s block programming language, Scratch, as an initial template for the ScratchJr model. Scratch was launched in 2007 and is geared towards children ages 8 and up, while ScratchJr would be for ages 5-7, and used as a way for children to tell personally meaningful stories by creating programs for various characters. After 5 years of development, ScratchJr is now a publically-available application in which children snap together graphical programming blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and sing. Children can modify characters in the Paint Editor, add their own voices and sounds, even insert photos of themselves,&nbsp;then use the programming blocks to make their characters come to life. In creating these programs, children learn fundamental development skills of not only coding, but also problem solving, storytelling, collaboration, creativity, sequencing, and more.</p> <p>Since its inception, the ScratchJr project has aimed to become a developmentally-appropriate educational technology to allow children to engage in open-ended creative design and digital construction. Through the development of curricular resources, the ScratchJr team has created a free tool that supports integrated learning of STEM, literacy, problem solving, and computational skills. This has all been developed through five years of researching with hundreds of children and educators, prototyping different possibilities, designing an interface to best meet developmental needs of young children, and integrating feedback from users.</p> <p>The project life was broken down into 5 phases: Phase 1(September 2011-May 2012) used Scratch to create initial prototypes of the ScratchJr application, testing the program in elementary schools and recognizing areas in Scratch where young children struggled; Phase 2 (September 2012-January 2013) saw pilot testing by researchers in classrooms with ScratchJr v1, and the development of ScratchJr v2; Phase 3 (January 2013-August 2013) saw curriculum development based on Phase 2 findings, and prototyping of a tablet-based ScratchJr beta version; Phase 4 (September 2013-August 2014) consisted of the development of the ScratchJr release-version, and the application&rsquo;s launch in July, 2014; Phase 5 (September 2014-August 2016) was ScratchJr&rsquo;s dissemination phase, in which the ScratchJr team worked to get the application out in the world and available on many different platforms.</p> <p>ScratchJr has been a thoroughly researched and developed project by the DevTech Research Group at the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study &amp; Human Development at Tufts University and the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. From DevTech, at least 10 academic papers have been published based on studies conducted about ScratchJr, two Masters theses and one PhD dissertation about ScratchJr have been published by Tufts students, and numerous workshops and presentations have been given to train educators, administrators, children, and parents on how to use the programming application. Through this vast amount of research, the ScratchJr team has made curricula, activities, guides, and assessments publically available on the ScratchJr website, facilitating programming education for young children in both the classroom and the home. These resources, as well as additional lesson plans and ideas, are also available in <em>The Official ScratchJr Book</em>, written by Professors Bers and Resnick and published in October, 2015. This book has been translated into at least 5 different languages, demonstrating educators&rsquo;, parents&rsquo;, and children&rsquo;s desire to use this programming tool across the globe.</p> <p>In addition to this publication, the ScratchJr project also launched a collaboration with PBS KIDS in December, 2015. This application, PBS KIDS ScratchJr, helps children ages 5-8 learn core coding concepts as they create their own interactive stories and games using favorite characters from popular children's television programs produced by&nbsp;PBS&nbsp;KIDS, such as &nbsp;WILD KRATTS, WORDGIRL, PEG + CAT, and NATURE CAT. More assets from other PBS KIDS shows are planned to launch in new versions of the application by Fall, 2016.</p> <p>As of August, 2016, ScratchJr is available on iPads, Android tablets, Google Chromebooks, and Amazon Kindle tablets. An .apk file is also available for download, making the application accessible on virtually every device greater than seven inches. Furthermore, ScratchJr is used in all 50 states and 188 of 196 countries worldwide. There are nearly 160,000 sessions of ScratchJr every week, and users spend an average of over 14 minutes per session in the application. These numbers are continually rising as ScratchJr is made available on more platforms, and as the importance of computer science education becomes more widely recognized. The ScratchJr team will continue to conduct outreach activities, make ScratchJr available in more languages, and improve upon the software in the future.
