<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit.  The overall goal of this project is to increase understanding of the mechanisms that govern genetic recombination in mammalian chromosomes.  The term "genetic recombination" refers to a process in which segments of DNA are exchanged between two chromosomal regions.  Recombination plays an important role in the evolution of genomes, contributes to genetic diversity, and provides a means for repair of DNA damage that occurs on a daily basis.  Although recombination is generally beneficial, it may be viewed as a double-edged sword.  While recombination helps to maintain the integrity of chromosomes, it is critical that mechanisms exist to assure that exchanges are allowed to occur only between appropriate chromosomal regions so that potentially deleterious genetic rearrangements are avoided.  For the most part, recombination must be restricted to DNA segments that share a high degree of identity in order for deleterious exchanges to be precluded, but little is known about how cells regulate recombination.  In this research project, a novel set of engineered DNA molecules will be inserted into chromosomes in mouse cells, and these molecules will allow recombination events to be monitored.  The various DNA molecules are designed to test the cell's ability to carry out recombination between DNA segments sharing different degrees of identity.  These studies will illuminate the rules normally employed to decide which DNA segments can engage in recombination, and which DNA segments are excluded from such exchanges.  Also to be investigated is the question of whether certain forms of DNA damage might alter the rules of recombination.  The roles played by certain proteins in the regulation of recombination will also be explored.  This project will provide a clearer picture of how recombination can both shape and maintain the mammalian genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. This project will make substantive contributions to general science education and practical scientific training.  The research will be conducted in a laboratory that is located in a large undergraduate Department of Biological Sciences that is responsible for educating more than 1600 undergraduate majors.  The laboratory in which this work will be done has a history of offering research experiences for undergraduates and this project will continue this history.  It is noteworthy that the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of South Carolina has a very diverse student body, and so this project will afford an important opportunity for providing research experiences for traditionally underrepresented groups.  In the past, this project's Principal Investigator (PI) has served as mentor to African American and women undergraduates, and these research experiences have encouraged several individuals to choose careers in science.  The PI has also served as mentor to numerous masters and doctoral degree students from the U.S. and abroad and this research project will continue this important training of new scientists.  Several Historically Black Colleges and Universities are within proximity to the University of South Carolina.  The PI will visit these institutions to present scientific seminars reporting the results of the funded work and will use such engagements to talk with students about graduate school opportunities and the possibility of pursuing a career in science.  The PI will also visit with students in grades K-12 to discuss career opportunities in science, research results, and general issues related to science.  In addition to potentially encouraging careers in science, these latter outreach activities may serve to enhance the scientific literacy of the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Genetic information is stored in the DNA in our chromosomes.  It is essential to our health and well-being that cells repair DNA damage that our chromosomes experience on a daily basis.  Our project focused on gaining a better understanding of how mammalian cells repair damaged DNA to maintain the integrity of chromosomes.  More specifically, we conducted studies to gain insight into how cells repair DNA breaks accurately with little or no alteration to the genetic information.  Sometimes when chromosomal DNA breaks, the broken DNA ends find another unbroken stretch of DNA to use as a template from which genetic information can be copied back into the break site.  This mechanism allows for the patching of the break and the restoration of genetic information that may otherwise be lost.  For this mechanism to work properly and accurately, it is essential that the broken DNA find the correct partner to use as a template.  In other words, the broken DNA must interact with a stretch of DNA that is very similar or identical to the DNA in need of repair.  This would assure that appropriate information is copied into the break site.  We used a model cell culture system that allowed us to artificially induce a break in a chromosome and study in detail what the rules are for how the cell repaired the break.  Our work has led to a better understanding of how broken DNA goes about finding a suitable partner to use as a template in repair.  Such knowledge will ultimately allow for a better understanding of how this process may go awry in genetic disease, such as cancer, and thus provide greater insight into possible ways of ameliorating such problems.  Over the past five years this project has also provided training experiences  for one PhD student, one Masters student, as well as at least twelve  undergraduate students.  This project constituted a significant portion  of the PhD dissertation research of the doctoral student.  The PhD, MS,  and undergraduate students gained experience in cell culture and  methodologies for studying DNA repair, and have  received training in experimental design and interpretation.  The PhD  student had the opportunity to present his work at a national meeting, and the Masters student's work was  presented at a national meeting as well.   Of note, this project provided a research experience for an     undergraduate student who is a member of an underrepresented group and research experiences for a     number of female undergraduate students.  It is also noteworthy that  two female undergraduates who have worked on this project over the past two  years were majors in Biomedical  Engineering, and two other  female undergraduates who worked on this project were majors in Excercise Science.  The work conducted on this project and the opportunities it has  presented have therefore helped to build  bridges between basic biology,  engineering, and other areas of the life  sciences.  Undergraduate participants gained experience in  modern molecular biology techniques, and gained experience in presenting  the results of their work at meetings and as written reports.  Indeed,  seven students presented posters describing their contributions to this  project at local meetings.  Additionally, four students  have had authorship on posters at national scientific conferences.  Also, significantly, three female undergraduates were authors on a peer-reviewed scientific article (including lead authorship).  I am  proud that two participating undergraduates graduated from the University of  South Carolina with the honor of "Graduation with Leadership  Distinction," based in part on their work done on this NSF-supported  project.  I have happily recruited three undergraduates to carry  out research on related work during the upcoming 2018-2019 academic year.  I am particularly proud of the happy circumstance that this project has allowed for the training of a number of female undergraduate students.  I am quite proud to witness these very successful  young women move on to bright futures as engineers, scientists, and  health professionals and I am happy to have perhaps played some part in  facilitating their career paths by providing research opportunities made possible by this NSF-supported project.
