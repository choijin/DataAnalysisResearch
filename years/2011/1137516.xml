<AbstractNarration>Health informatics is one of the nation's largest growth industries. The US Department of Labor predicts a 49% job growth in health information and health informatics. In response to this demand, North Carolina A&amp;T State University's Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Developing a Health Informatics Security and Privacy Program  - establishes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) concentration in Health Informatics Security and Privacy (HISP). This is a joint effort between the Departments of Computer Science, Mathematics and Management. News courses on health information systems and mathematics for health informatics, as well as a modified course in management, are being developed. Course modules on health informatics security and privacy will be integrated in existing computer security and information assurance courses in the Department of Computer Science. Undergraduate and graduate students are involved in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partnership among the three disciplines can improve the collaboration among these departments to jointly improve STEM education at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, as well as strengthen the University's Center for Cyber Defense.  This project will produce graduates from groups underrepresented in the field to satisfy the increasing need for health informatics and health information technology professionals.</AbstractNarration>
