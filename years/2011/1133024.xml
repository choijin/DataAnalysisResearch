<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Disaster Resilience for Rural Communities (DRRC) collaborative research project is to examine the obstacles to and opportunities for the use of seasonal climate forecasts in flood planning and management in U.S. rural areas, focusing on the 1) characteristics that make scientific and technical information likely to be used by rural practitioners; 2) structure and function of networks of rural users of forecast information and; 3) influence of group decision processes in decision making about how and whether to employ climate forecasts in rural flood management. The approach begins with four case studies of rural regions that have attempted to use seasonal climate information.  After that, a national-level survey of stakeholders engaged in flood planning and emergency management in rural areas to investigate experiences with and factors affecting the use of climate information will be implemented. Finally, in-person simulations of local, regional, and state-level stakeholders in two US rural regions to investigate how network features, group biases, and decision structures influence climate forecast use in rural flood planning and management will be conducted.  The chief intellectual merit of this project lies in enhancing understanding of the development of trust and collaboration in weak and strong network administrative organization and in extending the literature on emergency management decision-making in tightly-knit urban response networks to dispersed rural pre-disaster planning and mitigation.  This work also advances approaches to capture and measure preferences related to characteristics of uncertain information and to compare individual-based stated preferences and group decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seasonal climate information such as forecasts of El Ni√±o conditions months ahead of time can be used to improve planning and management of weather-related extreme events such as floods. Unfortunately, even when seasonal forecast information appears clear, putting knowledge about likely climate conditions into practice to improve planning for extreme events before they happen poses difficulties. Flood and other emergency managers typically work in situations with tight budgets, and they also must make decisions quickly.  In addition, managers may find it difficult to clearly communicate to the public and policymakers the range of possible outcomes from events that are highly uncertain.  This may be particularly the case in rural areas, where geographic distances complicate communication and technical expertise disperses more widely than in concentrated urban areas.  This project examines whether the way in which forecast information is presented and the way in which those involved in emergency management in rural areas interact with each other influence the ability to use seasonal climate information to improve planning and management to reduce societal losses from floods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It√Üs comforting to think that expert risk managers, people who are responsible for protecting the public from all manner of natural and unnatural hazards, are also expert decision makers.   However, prior research suggests that there is room for improvement in the decision-making performance of expert decision makers when it comes to how they carry out their day-to-day jobs.  Such improvements could come as the result of additional training in (1) how to detect decision-making weaknesses, and (2) how to utilize decision-aiding tools that can help to improve decision-making performance.  This research involved working with expert emergency risk managers in small group (workshop) settings, as well as through a large national survey. The intent of the research was to identify patterns in expert decision makers decision-making, which could be used in future training programs aimed at improving job performance.  In terms of main findings from this research, there were three:  1.) Risk managers are prone to systematic bias when making decisions under conditions of risk and uncertainty.   For example, risk managers exhibit a strong tendency toward "loss aversion".  This means that opposite frames of the same problem yield very different judgments.  Specifically, if 100 homes are at risk from flooding, a frame which refers to 50 homes that may be lost yields a preference for more extreme, and risk-prone judgments than does the identical but opposite frame of 50 homes that may be saved.   Likewise, risk managers are likely to make decision prone to group effects; managers are more likely to take protective action based on a forecast if an emergency manager in a neighboring county does so irrespective of what the risk forecast actually indicates.  This result suggests that emergency managers interpret climate forecasts through networks rather than individually.  Finally, this research revealed wide variation in what managers meant by commonly used risk characterizations such as "somewhat unlikely", "unlikely", and "likely". The implication here is that when precision is important, risk forecasts should include specific probabilities or percentages, or some other continuous variable (such as a 1-10 scale) rather than simple narratives.  2.) Risk managers strongly prefer to take action to protect lives and property and be wrong (i.e., avoid being impacted by a risk or hazard), versus not taking action to protect lives and property and be wrong (i.e., being impacted by a risk or hazard). This is actually good news for communities because it suggests that risk managers will go to great lengths to protect people and infrastructure.  However, this finding underscores the importance of training in decision-making because overreactions to risk are a possible outcome of this kind of behavior.  Repeated overreactions can lead to the wasteful use of resources that would limit risk management actions that could be taken in the future.  3.) Risk managers struggle with uncertainty. This research included assessments of how emergency managers deal with uncertainty.  Risk managers had difficulty dealing with all types of uncertainty presentations, and did not indicate a preference for any specific presentation (as being more helpful to them than others) during decision-making.  This presents a challenge to both risk managers and training programs for them because uncertainty is an ever-present dimension in decision-making.   Together, these findings point to the importance of developing training programs for risk managers that:  1.) Help them to identify biases and pitfalls in decision-making;  2.) Contribute to careful tradeoff making when allocating resources to risks or hazards that are of a low probability or magnitude (thereby ensuring that resources are in place when danger strikes); and  3.) Help risk managers to better interpret and respond to uncertainty when evaluating risks and hazards.                   Last Modified: 12/01/2015       Subm...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
