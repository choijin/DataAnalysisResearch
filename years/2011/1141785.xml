<AbstractNarration>This project is a comprehensive interdisciplinary study of the March 11 initial M=9 and M=7.9 earthquakes, the resulting tsunami wave generation, propagation and coastal inundation along northern Honshu Island, and the initial pathways and changes in Cs-237 concentrations as it enters the coastal waters at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility and spreads across the shelf to deeper water.  The approach is to use a combination of advanced seismic and nested coupled atmospheric/3-D ocean circulation numerical models plus available field measurements to simulate these processes starting with the initial March 11 M=9 earthquake bottom movement through April 12. During this 33-day simulation, the Cs-137 source concentration levels peaked and decreased towards the increasing coastal and off-shelf concentration levels, indicative of cross-shelf transport and shelf-ocean exchange processes, with a potential sedimentation loss and biological accumulation in the near-shore region. Detailed descriptions of the different model simulations, the resulting ocean circulation and water property output fields and initial analysis will be uploaded to a project website on a frequent basis for use by others interested in coastal physical and bio/chemical processes in the study area and as initial conditions for studies of the long-term spread of Cs-137 and other radionuclides in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The March 11 earthquakes, tsunami waves, coastal inundation, and initial release of Cs-137 into the ocean cover a wide range of time (from seconds to a month) and space (meters to 100's of km) scales. The multi-scale modeling approach with advanced models should produce a comprehensive and integrated description and understanding of the key physical processes involved and an independent assessment of the initial fate and spread of Cs-137 and its impact on the coastal ecosystem within the RAPID grant period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This study will foster U.S-Japanese collaboration in several areas of ocean sciences (marine geophysics, physical oceanography, and bio-chemistry related to Cs-137 and other released radionuclides). The team includes one Japanese PhD student, and it is anticipated that the models and model results posted on a website will be used by researchers, students, and others as the study progresses. One outcome of this study will be a tested new combined earthquake/3-D ocean model system that can be used by researchers and coastal planners for assessing potential tsunami flooding from future earthquakes in the megathrust zones east of Japan. This system can be applied to other earthquake and or tsunami-prone areas.</AbstractNarration>
