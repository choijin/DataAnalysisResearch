<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The FASEB Summer Conference II will be held on the Ciocco Resort in Lucca Italy, September 4 - 9, 2011. This is the second conference that rotates between the US and Europe. The first conference was held in 2009. This initial conference spurred considerable interdisciplinary cross-talk and spawned new collaborative studies between scientists working in areas that have been historically studied separately.  There aren't any other conferences that focus on the NAD metabolome as a whole. The major areas of NAD metabolism and signaling research will be represented.  The following nine sessions will be covered:  NAD Biosynthesis and Metabolism (2 sessions), NAD metabolites and signaling, NAD dependent protein deacetylation by sirtuins, Poly-ADP-ribose metabolism, NAD crosstalk and biology, Mono-ADP ribosylation, Mechanisms of NAD-dependent gene regulation and Translational studies of NAD metabolism.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The 2011 FASEB Summer conference on NAD Metabolism and Signalling will bring together a highly diverse group of scientists working in all areas of NAD-related metabolism and biology and provide a forum for exchange of information and data. The topics and themes that will be covered in this meeting will be global in nature, allowing for a unique interdisciplinary scientific experience that is not provided by other more specialized meetings that focus on only one aspect of NAD metabolism. Also, the conference will foster new interactions between scientists that do not normally meet one another in the course of their work.</AbstractNarration>

NAD, which is formed from the vitamin B3, also plays an important role in anti-oxidant pathways and helps to prevent the build up of dangerous toxins in cells within the body. In addition to these critical roles, NAD is used by cells to activate genes that prevent aging.

In total, 34 scientists gave short talks and, within this group, there were 14 women and 26 young investigators (mixture of graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and early-stage independent investigators). Thus, over half of the presentations at the meeting were selected from the submitted abstracts and young investigators gave 40% of all talks at the meeting.
