<AbstractNarration>Dr. Zhao will work on a number of problems in arithmetic algebraic geometry and number theory. His main focus is on the study of arithmetic, geometric and analytic properties of the multiple polylogarithms and the multiple zeta functions which are generalizations of the classical polylogarithms and the Riemann zeta function, respectively. In recent years, these objects and their various generalizations have appeared prominently in a lot of areas of mathematics and physics. The theory of their special values, in particular, has provided and will continue to provide answers to important and far reaching problems such as those in algebraic geometry involving motives over number fields. Dr. Zhao will utilize the theory of motivic fundamental groups of Deligned and Goncharov, Hopf algebra techniques and Rota-Baxter operators developed by Guo, Kreimer and their collaborators, (quasi-)shuffle algebras studied by Hoffman, and computer-aided computation to investigate the fine structures of these special values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is one of the foundations of mathematics since the beginning of recorded human history, and it serves nowadays as the basis for many applications, including cryptography and coding theory.&lt;br/&gt;Arithmetic algebraic geometry, one of the newest and most active fields of modern mathematics, studies the arithmetic nature of geometric properties of solutions to systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Its application in number theory has both enriched algebraic geometry and revolutionized the study of number theory. The proposed research considers questions involving objects that deeply reflect some fundamental information about fields of algebraic numbers over which these objects are defined. Such questions have their genesis in the work of Goldbach,  Euler and Gauss, and mathematicians in generations continue to invent new techniques to try to solve their mysteries. Many parts of the project offer significant research opportunities for undergraduate students through both advanced course works and the summer research programs. Dr. Zhao plans to utilize these opportunities to attract more advanced undergraduate students to study math by involving them in mathematical research in all the stages, from the initial computation to the final presentation of their results in various professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the funding period, the PI studied the multiple zeta functions, multiple polylogarithms and their related topics. These objects are closely related to many other branches of mathematics and mathematical physics. For example, to analyze and predict the collisions between higher energy particles one need to compute the Feynman integrals which often times can be expressed using the special values of multiple zeta or multiple polylogarithms.  There are many relations between these special values. A large class of these is called "Two-one formulas", first conjectured by Ohno and Zudilin in 2007.

During this work, he also directed a senior thesis of an undergraduate student and co-authored with her on paper published by Mathematika, a journal of the London Mathematical Society. The PI also directed and collaborated with another two undergraduate students and a graduate student on a paper submitted for publication.  One important tool to study relations between multiple zeta values is to consider the so-called double shuffle relations which are produced when one multiple two values using two different methods.

This work generalized similar works by German and Japanese mathematicians who treated the level one and two cases, respectively, a few years ago.  In number theory, it is often very fruitful to study q-analogs of mathematical objects. Currently, there are many different versions of q-analogs of multiple zeta values.  The PI discovered a new approach which nicely unifies them via a type of special algebraic structures called Rota-Baxter algebras.
