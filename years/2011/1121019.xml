<AbstractNarration>Agrobacterium tumefaciens is found as free-living bacteria in the soils of most temperate and tropical climates.  Certain strains of the bacterium can infect a wide variety of plants and cause them to develop tumors.  This occurs as a result of the activation of a variety of molecular processes in the bacterium that provide it with the capacity to induce plant tumors. Interestingly, some plant species do not appear to respond to the bacteria by forming tumors and in plants that do form tumors, certain tissue types seem significantly more susceptible. The investigators are determining how the bacteria recognize that they are on a plant - or more precisely in particular plant tissues. After coming into close proximity with plant tissues the bacterium recognizes different chemicals produced by the plant, including phenolic derivatives and certain sugars. Both types of molecules are required to induce the synthesis of bacterial products required to cause tumors to develop. Intriguingly, the distribution of these molecules is not uniform around the plant.  The investigators have designed a series of experiments that will allow them to map the distribution of the signals within the plant (thereby determining the 'signal landscape').  Through these studies they will then be able to determine whether regions of the plant that make tumors in response to the bacteria are the only regions of the plant that make the appropriate signals.  This, for example, could lead to the identification of tissues that don't make tumors even when the bacteria are 'artificially activated' and thereby lead to an understanding of how these tissues 'defend' themselves against the tumor causing actions of the bacterium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of scientists whose areas of expertise comprise chemistry, biochemistry, plant pathology, molecular biology, and microbiology will direct the project. This provides a strong interdisciplinary training environment for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students.  The planned experiments will provide projects for three to six undergraduate students who work in our laboratories. Students will get 'hands on' experience in molecular biological, biochemical, and cell culture techniques and the opportunity to present their work to their peers. Moreover, both PIs have been extensively involved in alternative approaches to science education and can incorporate many aspects of the proposed work into these projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Broad host range pathogens confront problems in the context of regulating their virulence mechanisms. Because these mechanisms are usually energy intensive, the controlling system needs very tight regulation.  On the other hand, to have a broad host range &ndash; the capacity to cause disease in a broad diversity of organisms &ndash; the pathogen should have a control system that is very flexible in terms of signal perception. In the research supported by this grant we examined host recognition by the broad host range plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens.  When this soil bacterium encounters a wide variety of sugars and phenols it completely alters its metabolism, activating the expression of numerous genes (the so-called ævirulenceÆ or ævirÆ genes) that lead to tumor formation on plants.  The fundamental questions we studied were 1) How can a broad variety of host derived signals be recognized? 2) Is this flexibility important in terms of having a broad host range? and 3) Are the signals present uniformly in the host or do the signals help the pathogen recognize areas of the plant that are susceptible to infection?     Several important outcomes came from our work on this system.  First, we characterized the binding site for the sugars on the ChvE protein that binds sugars and induces expression of the virulence genes. We found that mutations at some of the key amino acids at that site affected the binding of some sugars but not others.  Utilizing bacteria carrying the mutated ChvE we showed that neutral sugars (e.g. glucose) are the sugars that are present in Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) at infection sites, whereas sugar acids, (e.g. galacturonic acid), are the predominant sugars present in Kalancho&euml; degraimentia at infection sites.

A second key outcome of our studies is the finding that the sugar transport machinery of the bacterium is essential for the bacterium to activate vir gene expression in response to the concentration of sugars present at an infection site (high) but not in the soil (low). This integration of the metabolic machinery of the bacterium with the virulence machinery represents an important new finding that could lead to novel means of controlling pathogenesis.     Finally, a membrane protein, VirA, recognizes the phenols that induce virulence gene expression in Agrobacterium.  Our results identified a key region of VirA for phenol recognition as well as a region responsible for integrating the æsugarÆ and the æphenolÆ input signals through Boolean AND and OR logic gates in what is best described as an integration node. Combining these results, we developed strains of the bacterium that change color when the vir genes are expressed, and by monitoring this color change in bacteria applied to different organs and tissues of the plant, we have been able to map the distribution of different vir inducing signals in the plant.

Our activities have ranged from public lectures about our research to lay audiences, to helping re-train adults in the workforce to become Research Technicians (working with the Philadelphia Community College), to addressing key issues in the relationship between STEM and the broader society.  We recently argued, in English and in German, for the importance of the liberal arts in the global marketplace of new ideas and ever-expanding STEM technological innovations. The editorials specifically argued for art as a way of knowing (http://www.exploratorium.edu/knowing/reports.htm) and a greater integration of STEM with the arts and humanities.
