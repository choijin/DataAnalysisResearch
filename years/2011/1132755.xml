<AbstractNarration>Disaster losses continue to increase in the United States, yet we lack a fundamental understanding of the pattern of disaster losses for the nation and their impacts on rural and non-rural places. If a policy goal is to improve community resilience to disasters, empirically defined baselines are a necessary starting point. This project integrates physical and social datasets through a suite of statistical and geospatial techniques in the construction of theoretically based and methodologically sound indicators of resilience for the nation at the county level. The goal is to provide a set of quantitative baseline indicators for measuring disaster resilience.  Once the indicators are developed, the composite index will be validated (using uncertainty and sensitivity analyses). Exploration of the statistical and spatial variability in the composition of indicators identifies and analyzes the relationship between resilience, vulnerability, and the relative impact of disasters on rural and non-rural places. In addition to spatial analyses of resilience, the project identifies differences in the drivers of resilience among counties. This work helps identify opportunities for intervention strategies to improve resilience, opportunities that may be dramatically different between rural and non-rural counties and within rural counties as well.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of this project is twofold.  First, there is considerable local, state, and federal programmatic interest in community disaster resilience. At present, there is little agreement on what to measure, how to measure it, and in determining which metrics are the most useful. Second, in order to judge the effectiveness of any policy or program, there needs to be a starting point for assessments. This project provides just such a starting point with the development of baseline indicators for tracking changes in resilience over time. Monitoring changes in the indicators provides the evidentiary basis for programs to gauge their success in enhancing the nation?s resilience. The research team will disseminate results to stakeholders at county, state, and national levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to develop a measure of community resilience that would identify differences between rural and urban counties.  We define resilience as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events.  The purpose was to develop a measure that was scientifically-informed but also easy to construct and apply to US counties. One measure of resilience, the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities (BRIC) illustrates the multi-faceted nature of community resilience using six broad drivers&mdash;community capital, social resilience, economic resilience, infrastructure resilience, institutional capital, and environmental resilience.  Each driver is measured and calculated separately, helping to provide a deeper understanding of each across a community.  When combined they produce and overall resilience score for the county in question.  These scores are then mapped to show the geographic variation throughout the US.  Mapping enables a quick understanding of the similarities and differences between places in both the overall score but also with each sub-index.  The Midwest and Northeast regions generally have higher levels of overall resilience, while lower levels of resilience are found in the interior West, in the border regions with Mexico, and in Appalachia.  Further, there are distinct differences between urban and rural counties, with rural counties generally having lower scores.  Two of the drivers are particularly useful in distinguishing urban and rural resilience:  rural counties are more likely to have higher community capital scores; urban counties have higher economic resilience scores. More specifically, community capital measures involving place attachment, religious adherence, civic organizations as well as population stability exert the most influence.  Higher employment rates and homeownership are the distinguishing features of urban resilience.  Broader Impacts.  One of the recommendations of landmark National Research Council report, Disaster Resilience: A National Imperative, was to develop a national scorecard by which to measure progress towards the goal of making the national more resilient.  BRIC is one of a dozen or so metrics that are now being tested and implemented, and it is gaining in acceptance at local, state, and federal entities because of its ease of use and its scientifically driven conceptualization and construction. Normally it takes many years before methodologies or tools translate from science (as seen in published work) to practice (actual use). The project team has been very successful in translating our results to useful information for non-profit organizations, state and local entities, as well as federal government attempts to create a resilience scorecard. Furthermore, overall BRIC scores are freely available to interested parties through a web site. The sharing of results and the translation of research findings into practical policies will help to promote safer environments for US citizens.  Intellectual Merit.  The area of disaster resilience metrics is in its infancy and this project is among the first to move from a purely theoretical understanding of the concept to an actual empirical implementation of an index. In addition to adhering to sound scientific principles in its construction, the BRIC is easily replicated at different time intervals) as a way of measuring change in resilience.
