<AbstractNarration>A great deal of work remains to understand how the first stars in the Universe formed and how their formation and life cycles affected the formation of the first galaxies in the Universe.  Understanding these essential details will provide important clues to understanding the formation and life history of our own Galaxy and many others.  This project aims to track the time history of heavy chemical elements in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at very high redshift.  Because most researchers believe that heating from supernovae and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN) played a vital role in galaxy assembly, the principal investigator (PI) has chosen to study the heavy elements, which are a byproduct of this heating "feedback."  The PI will address the following specific scientific questions: (1) Is there a decline in the C IV abundance as the epoch of reionization is approached?  (2) Is there a change in the ionization structure of heavy element systems at redshift around 6?  (3) Do the large differences in absorption properties between QSO sightlines at redshift 6 reflect cosmic variance or a signature of stochastic early star formation?  (4) What mechanism populates galaxy haloes with cold baryons (seen in Mg II) at early times?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include important educational components.  A graduate student will be supported for the three years of this grant, and the PI works closely with his institution to mentor undergraduates in research and astronomical observing activities.  The PI also has an excellent track record in working with students from groups underrepresented in the physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The earliest stars and galaxies in the universe formed out of chemically pristine gas clouds, containing only hydrogen and helium that were created in the first few minutes after the Big Bang.  All of the heavier elements of the periodic table were created by stars, either through core nuclear fusion, or by the capture of free neutrons at or near the end of the stellar life cycle.  These elements, including carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are continuously  recycled into the surrounding intergalactic gas reservoir by each generation of stars.  Although these gas clouds are not luminous, their presence can be inferred through absorption they produce in the light of distant background objects which we record with astronomical spectrometers.  Since each element possesses a characteristic spectroscopic fingerprint, observations of the most distant objects probe the chemical content of intergalactic gas as it was when the light was emitted, some 95% of the lookback time to the Big Bang.  At the start of the award period, the PIÃ†s research group commissioned an infrared spectrometer (named FIRE) on the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes in the Chilean Andes.  This instrument was specifically designed for observations of ultra-distant sources, whose emitted ultraviolet and optical light is shifted into infrared wavelengths as seen on Earth, because of cosmic expansion.  Our NSF program, entitled Feedback from the First Stars: Chemical Abundances in the First Billion Years after the Big Bang, supported the first scientific measurements with this instrument, focusing in particular on the pollution of the early universe with carbon and magnesium.  Our group, composed of the PI, two supported graduate students, and an affiliated NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, traveled to Chile for over 15 observing runs, collecting spectra of 30 ultra-distant quasars (redshift z &gt; 5.5, roughly 90% cosmic lookback).  We analyzed the first ten of these to constrain the evolution of ionized carbon in the early universe.  This form of carbon, which has lost three electrons relative to the neutral state but is readily observed in our spectra, has a relatively constant abundance over much of the UniverseÃ†s history.  Analysis of the new data revealed a distinctly lower concentration of this ion at early times, suggesting that the universal carbon abundance may have grown rapidly when the universe was approximately 1 billion years old (compared to todayÃ†s 13.7 billion years).  A rapid evolution in heavy element abundances could indicate that our observations are approaching the epoch of the first stars, which are the presumed sources of the observed carbon. It is also possible that the carbon still exists at these times but is predominantly in other ionization states (i.e. different numbers of stripped electrons) which are not as readily detected.  We have taken additional observations to test this alternate hypothesis, and the results await further analysis.  During the same observing campaign, we observed a sample of 90 additional objects that are slightly less distant, and hence brighter.  We used these objects to perform the first census of singly ionized magnesium in the early universe.  Our publications on this topic link to extensive literature on the subject in the more local universe, where such absorption is found in the outer halos of luminous galaxies.  We detected magnesium out to the largest distances our observations could probe, a somewhat surprising result.    During the course of the award a new quasar was discovered at redshift z &gt; 7; this remains the most distant known quasar in the universe and we focused significant effort towards its observation and characterization. In particular, our deep spectral observations revealed evidence of foreground absorption from gas with copious amounts of hydrogen, but no apparent heavy elements.  The coincidence of this gas cloudÃ†s very early origins, and its extremely low bound on heavy-element content, further s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
