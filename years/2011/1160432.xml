<AbstractNarration>This project concerns development and analysis of mathematical models of several complex biological processes, each with major importance to the fundamental and health sciences: cellular blebbing and its role in cellular locomotion through extracellular matrix, platelet deposition and fibrin gelation in arterial blood clotting, mucin secretion and its role in acid transport in the stomach, protein sorting and trafficking by the Golgi apparatus.  Although the details of the biology of these processes are vastly different, a common theme is that each involves a complex viscoelastic material mixture whose behavior is determined by the dynamic interplay of mechanics, flow, physical structure, and chemistry.  The mathematical description of these processes requires equations describing multiphase flow, the evolution of composition, structure and chemistry, and the relationship between stresses and composition/structure.  The solution and analysis of sophisticated models that combine these elements will pose substantial mathematical and computational challenges.  To meet these challenges, the investigators will develop and apply advanced numerical algorithms to gain fundamental insights into the mechanisms of function of these important physiological processes.  This work will lead to novel and important advances in understanding the essential role of the mechanics and dynamics of complex materials in the function of biological systems.  This, in turn, will support improved diagnosis and treatment of a range of serious medical disorders including coronary artery disease, cancer, and metabolic disease.  The work will also lead to better understanding of complex materials in general and contribute to the design of novel new materials for meeting pressing technological challenges.  Furthermore, the design of new computational algorithms will lead to new capabilities in the use of high-performance computing in science and engineering.  The highly interdisciplinary nature of the project will provide many opportunities for training young scientists in the new multi-disciplinary approach to science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many important physiological processes involve interactions between materials of different types (for example, water and cells or water and polymer gels) and which move relative to one another.  The physical interactions between the materials can be strongly influenced by chemical reactions, and the chemical reactions in turn are influenced by the materials' motion and other interactions.  Better insight into how such complex systems work and are regulated is critical to understanding these important processes and how they can be manipulated to improve human health.  Because these processes are governed by physical and chemical principles and properties, and because these principles and properties can be expressed mathematically, mathematical tools can be brought to bear on these problems. Through mathematical analysis and computational simulations, new insights into the materials' behavior can be developed and a wealth of data can be obtained that complements the data obtainable from traditional laboratory experiments.  Hence the combination of mathematical and experimental investigators brought together in this project is expected to lead to significant new insights in important physiological and pathological situations including blood clotting, metabolism, and cancer metastasis.  Further the mathematics and computational tools developed in the project will impact the development of non-biological complex materials to meet pressing technological challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Title:  FRG:Collaborative Research: Chemically-active Viscoelastic Mixture Models in Physiology: Formulation, Analysis, and Computation  Overview:  Mixtures of polymer networks and fluid or clumps of cells and fluid are common place in biology.  Each cell in our body is filled with a mixture of multiple polymer networks and fluid and the coordination of these is essential for the cell?s function.   Blood clots, such as those that form in arteries of the heart, involve both polymer networks and clumps of cells in a fluid.   The mucus that coats the inside of the pulmonary airways and the inside of the stomach is a mixture of polymer and fluid.   These mixtures have mechanical properties much different from simple fluids or solids and those properties are key to their biological functions.   The composition of the mixtures, the structure of the networks, and their mechanical properties are regulated by chemical processes, e.g., enzymatic degradation.   This project is concerned with the development of sophisticated mathematical models of polymer-fluid and cell-fluid mixtures and their regulation in several biological contexts and with the development of the cutting-edge numerical methods needed to study these models.         Intellectual Merit:     General mixture models were developed and adapted for several specific biological contexts.   One is platelet aggregation during arterial blood clot formation.  Another is the function of the mucus layer that protects the stomach lining from damage by the acids and enzymes in the stomach lumen.   A third is the dynamics of lipid vesicles used in intracellular protein sorting.  A different type of model was developed for degradation of the fibrin gel portion of a blood clot.  Computational methods were developed for solving the equations in these models.   The models led to new insights into the workings of each of these biological systems.     Broader Impact:     The biological processes addressed in this proposal have important physiological and pathological aspects.   The models and the insights gleaned from them improve understanding of these processes and pave the way for potential improvements in therapies.  Polymer-fluid mixtures also arise in many engineering situations and the models and numerical methods developed in this project should be useful in studying those situations.   Graduate students and postdocs involved in the project received training and experience in modern interdisciplinary science in which mathematical modeling and simulation, in conjunction with experimentation, together give new understanding that would be difficult to achieve from experimentation alone.
