<AbstractNarration>The Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) was formed from the merger of three telescope arrays supported by the Division of Astronomical Science's University Radio Observatories (URO) Program: Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) array  of six 10.4-meter-diameter telescopes, the Berkeley Illinois Maryland Association (BIMA) array of nine 6.1-meter-diameter telescopes, and the University of Chicago's Sunyaev-Zeldovitch Array of eight 3.5-meter-diameter telescopes. CARMA currently achieves resolutions as high as 0.2 arcseconds at a wavelength of 1mm and, due to its heterogeneous combination of telescope diameters, provides excellent imaging over a wide range of angular scales.  Science enabled by CARMA covers a broad range of astronomical topics, including star formation and molecular clouds, studies of external galaxies, and the investigation of solar system objects. CARMA is a pathfinder for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and a pipeline for training experts in the field of millimeter interferometry to take full advantage of ALMA's capabilities for US astronomy.   Users outside the CARMA collaboration receive 30% of all observing time.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>It is generally agreed that stars are created due to the collapse of dense cores in the interstellar clouds of molecular gas and dust that pervade our Milky Way Galaxy. However, more information is required to fully understand the physical processes involved in cloud and core collapse and the effects of the newly-born stars on their larger surroundings. Such studies require high quality, detailed images of the spatial and velocity structure of the molecular gas over extended cloud regions. This project provided observations of extended star-forming clouds at higher resolution than has hitherto been available, based on Combined Array for Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) millimeter-wave, interferometric imaging surveys of the molecular gas in the Orion-A and North American Nebula (NAN) clouds. The subsequent combination of the CARMA measurements with single telescope observations of the same regions at the same wavelengths has led to images that probe cloud structure on spatial scales that range from those of individual clouds down to those of pre-stellar cores and proto-stellar envelopes - a factor of about 600. For Orion-A, the degree of spatial detail and the dynamic range of the maps are the highest yet achieved for extended clouds. Dissemination of the results is being achieved through ongoing scientific publications as well as by making the combined data cubes available on the web. This has already been accomplished for Orion-A, and is nearing completion for the NAN cloud.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CARMA observations surveyed 1-2 square degrees of the Orion-A and North American Nebula clouds for emission from the spectral lines of CO, 13CO C18O CS and SO. These molecules trace a variety of physical conditions in the clouds, including morphology, temperature, density, shocks and turbulence. Sensitivity to a wide range of spatial scales was achieved by combining the array observations with single telescope data from Japan's Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO) 45-m<strong> </strong>telescope. For the NAN cloud, observations from the Purple Mountain Observatory's 13.7m telescope were used as a compliment. Ensuring accuracy in the construction of the combined data cubes from the large data sets involved was a significant challenge. It was successfully met thanks largely to the dedications and skills of the Yale postdoctoral fellow, Shuo Kong, and to the support of the Yale High Performance Computing Center. The final combined data cubes are already stimulating a wide range of studies of star formation problems, including the impact of the effects of feedback from newly-formed stars on their environments, the emergence of cloud filaments and their role in the formation of dense cores and proto-stars, and the formation of star clusters. Figure 1 displays the CARMA-NRO image of CO emission across the Orion-A cloud, while Figure 2 zooms in to OMC-1, one of the star forming regions identified in Figure 1, to illustrate the complexity of structure that can now be seen. This image was a prizewinner for Shuo Kong in the Yale 2019 Art in Science Competition.</p> <p>A further important goal for this project was to train young scientists for the future.
