<AbstractNarration>1126887&lt;br/&gt;Bales&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation grant supports development of a basin-scale (4,500 km2) integrated hydrologic observation system in the Sierra Nevada Mountains spanning the rain-snow elevation transition in the American River basin.  The basin-scale instrument will include 23 local sensor clusters each with 10-20 snow depth sensors and meteorological sensors to include temperature, precipitation and humidity.  A subset of the clusters will have sensors for the measurement of incident and reflected solar radiation, soil moisture and temperature and tree sap flow sensors, the latter to elucidate the elevation dependent timing of the onset of evapotranspiration in the spring.  The basin-scale instrument design takes into consideration the needs for integrated measurement of key water cycle reservoirs, fluxes and their controlling factors in the high Sierras with sensor cluster sitings across variable elevation, aspect, slope and vegetation cover.   All of the sensor observations will be tied with a wireless communications strategy delivering real-time observations to a central information management system that will be open for public access via the web.   The need for quantification of key water cycle reservoirs and the balances between them at increased spatiotemporal scales is a long standing goal of the hydrologic science community.  The proposed hydrologic observation system focuses on a snowpack dominated mountain ecosystem that supports the water needs of California's Central Valley agribusiness empire and the needs of tens of millions of California residents.   The American River basin hydrologic observatory will be unprecedented in scale and leveraged on existing NSF investments in smaller prototype snow hydrology observations in the southern Sierras and more widely distributed and focused ecohydrologic observations funded through the Division of Earth Sciences Critical Zone Observatories (CZO) program as part of the Southern Sierra CZO.  Partnerships with relevant state agencies including the California Department of Water Resources and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District will foster and support the development. Data generated from this observation system will inform new classes of modeling tools to produce quantitative climate assessments, influence hydrologic forecasting, probe system response to climate and land-cover perturbations, increase process understanding of basin-scale water cycles, and provide defensible scenarios for infrastructure planning at a scale currently not possible. Scientific questions that will be addressable using collected observations will include: 1)) How do physiographic and ecological patterns influence the variability of mountain water fluxes?; 2) How do hydrologic systems that are subjected to multiple perturbations respond?; 3) How do pulses and changes propagate through the hydrologic system?; and 4) How can the predictive ability for these responses be improved?  &lt;br/&gt;The PI team includes faculty at UC-Merced, a non-Ph.D. granting institution, with expertise in hydrology and environmental engineering, and a USDA agency hydrologist.  The development will engage undergraduate students in construction and the wireless telecommunication strategy and development will be accomplished through subaward to support acquisition of wireless radio and miniaturized computing architectures and for a collaborating computer scientist at UC-Berkeley who specializes in wireless communications development to design and complete the network topology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We successfully developed and deployed a basin&shy;-scale instrument cluster to make comprehensive water-&shy;balance measurements at the scale of a tributary river basin in the Central Sierra Nevada. This American River Hydrologic Observatory (ARHO) was installed at the upper, seasonally snow-covered part of the 4573 km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;American river basin. This basin-scale instrument cluster consists of 14 local wireless-sensor clusters, each having at least 10 measurement nodes and 15-20 repeater nodes to transmit the wireless signal across the complex topography and dense forest of each local cluster. Each node has sensors for air temperature, relative humidity and snow depth; and a subset of nodes have sensors for solar radiation, soil temperature and soil moisture. All clusters also have a meteorological station, including precipitation measurements. The result is a spatially extensive measurement network, with nodes strategically placed across gradients of the main variables that affect these attributes, i.e. elevation, slope, aspect, canopy cover and soil type. The system was designed to have annual maintenance requirements similar to that of the current operational measurement sites in the basin.</p> <p>The system was operational beginning in water year 2014, and research findings fall into two categories: i) system design and operation, and ii) hydrologic science.

Compared to existing operational sensor installations, the ARHO wireless-sensor network reduces hydrologic uncertainty in at least three ways. First, redundant measurements improved estimation of lapse rates for air and dew-point temperature. Second, distributed measurements captured local variability and constrained uncertainty in air and dew-point temperature, snow accumulation and derived hydrologic attributes important for modeling and prediction. Third, the distributed relative-humidity measurements offer a unique capability to monitor upper-basin patterns in dew-point temperature and better characterize elevation gradient of water vapor-pressure deficit. Ongoing research in the basin is currently a focus of the University of California Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative (<a href="http://ucwater.org/">UC Water</a>); and partnerships with operational agencies are providing additional support for operation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/04/2017<br>      Modified by: Roger&nbsp;C&nbsp;Bales</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1126887/1126887_10135999_1483546603617_F_0--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1126887/1126887_10135999_1483546603617_F_0--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Artist concept"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1126887/1126887_10135999_1483546603617_F_0--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Artist concept"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Artist concept of American River Hydrologic Observatory, illustrating blending of above and below ground in situ sensors with remotely sensed satellite data to give broad spatial measurement of mountain water cycle.</div> <div class="imageCredit">J.

This first basin-scale wireless-sensor network provides reliable, representative measurements in a mountain basin.  The distributed network better characterizes patterns of key hydrologic variables compared to operational networks.  Used with spatially explicit modeling and other spatial data, the network offers unprecedented opportunities for improved hydrologic prediction.

Results from one additional hydrologic study, precipitation estimation in the drought year 2014, can also be summarized in 3 succinct points.  Distributed sensor data show large heterogeneity in rain versus snow precipitation, not apparent in more-limited operational data.
