<AbstractNarration>Title: February Fourier Talks 2012&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for the seventh meeting in the February Fourier&lt;br/&gt;Talks (FFT) series. The 2012 FFT will be held February 16-17, 2012, at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland, College Park. The FFT is a high-level forum for&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysts to bring their work to scientists from industry and&lt;br/&gt;government agencies. In addition it allows experts in applied and pure&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis to get familiar with the latest problems in need of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical formulation and solution. Finally, it introduces young&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and scientists to applied and pure harmonic analysis. More&lt;br/&gt;information, including a list of speakers and abstracts, registration&lt;br/&gt;information, and an archive of past conferences, can be found at the&lt;br/&gt;conference webpage: www.fft2012.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The February Fourier Talks directly encourage dialogue and collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between mathematicians and scientists working in industry and government.&lt;br/&gt;The structure of the conference consists of three main lectures and sixteen&lt;br/&gt;30 minute invited talks. The conference encourages and financially supports&lt;br/&gt;participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

Keynote Address: In contrast to the highly technical day sessions, this lecture is aimed at a general public audience and highlights the role of mathematics, in general, and harmonic analysis, in particular. Furthermore, this Keynote Address can be seen as an opportunity for practitioners in a specific area to present mathematical problems that one encounters in one's  work.  For {\it FFT $2012$}, Dr.~Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute  talked on ``Is God a Mathematician?''.   Poster Session: This...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
