<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to study several questions involving arithmetic aspects of&lt;br/&gt;maps between algebraic varieties.  These questions include new far-reaching&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of major results about abelian varieties, including the&lt;br/&gt;Mordell--Lang conjecture (Faltings' theorem) and Merel's uniform boundedness&lt;br/&gt;theorem for rational torsion on elliptic curves over a number field.  In the&lt;br/&gt;generalizations, the group structure in an abelian variety is replaced by&lt;br/&gt;objects which exist in any variety.  The PI's study of maps between varieties&lt;br/&gt;will yield results about dynamical systems, Diophantine equations,&lt;br/&gt;automorphism groups of curves, and value distribution of meromorphic functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polynomials whose coefficients are rational numbers are a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;tool in many aspect of modern life, ranging from&lt;br/&gt;information security to weather prediction.  These basic objects have been&lt;br/&gt;intensively studied for over two thousand years, but recent years have seen&lt;br/&gt;the discovery of previously unexpected phenomena.  The proposed research will&lt;br/&gt;examine these fundamental objects from several perspectives.  This will likely&lt;br/&gt;yield immediate consequences in computer science, in addition to long-term&lt;br/&gt;consequences across many disciplines.  Finally, much of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will be carried out jointly with graduate and undergraduate students, so that&lt;br/&gt;it will make an educational contribution in addition to its scientific impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project I (along with various collaborators) discovered several new types of results in number theory, topology, dynamical systems, and complex analysis.  Some of these answer questions that have been studied for many years, and some introduce new directions of study.  A common theme in the results is that a thorough understanding of rational functions (namely, ratios between two polynomials) can be applied to answer many types of questions, such as questions about maps between geometric objects or questions about functions of a complex variable.  In this project I obtained a deep understanding of rational functions, in ways which previously had not been thought possible, and applied this understanding to various questions.  It is to be expected that many further applications will follow, both to questions in various areas of math and to questions in other sciences and engineering.  One broader impact of this project is in mentoring: I included as part of my research team several high school students, dozens of undergraduates, several graduate students, and two postdoctoral fellows, several of whom were female or members of underrepresented groups.  In addition I gave several talks for students at various schools, and served as a judge for multiple student research contests.
