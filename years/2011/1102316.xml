<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a systematic approach to fault mitigation for improving the reliability of electrical drives. The approach is to use data-driven and model-based fault diagnosis and prognosis algorithms to determine the remaining useful life of components and subsystems and to&lt;br/&gt;use this information for accurate and timely failure mitigation for increased system&lt;br/&gt;reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is the development of signal processing and pattern recognition algorithms for compact and discriminative fault signature extraction from sensor measurements, the training and development of a stochastic prognosis model using these signatures and the development of accurate&lt;br/&gt;reliability models for electric drives incorporating this model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodologies developed in this research will have a broader impact on the design of electrical machines, power electronics and controllers that employ redundancies. This research will have a great effect on the US automotive industry as it migrates to hybrid and electric vehicles where reliability is an overriding concern. The results of the proposed project will be integrated into the curriculum in the form of design problems for the senior capstone class and teaching modules on built-in redundancies of drives and reliability to train the next generation of engineers who can work on hybrid and electric vehicles. The collaboration between industry and Michigan State University will offer summer internship opportunities for graduate students as well as providing a forum for the PIs to share their findings with the automotive engineering community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In terms of intellectual merit, this project introduced the ideas of failure prognosis of electrical drives to present day applications, and in particular to drives for hybrid and electrical vehicles. We developed techniques that encompass both data-based and model-based diagnosis and failure prognosis, as well as techniques to mitigate faults.  Starting with the original objective to detect faults and predict failures in PMAC machines, we developed methods to detect eccentricity demagnetization and short circuit fault diagnosis, and subsequently prognosis of faults in bearings, insulation and power electronics switches.   We also developed methods to separate the diagnosis of these faults, so that appropriate action can be taken, based on the type of fault and rate of fault development.  Specifically we developed and published (in IEEE Journals and Conferences) methods to separate the eccentricity from short circuit and inverter faults, and on how to mitigate these faults. They included change in control strategy, field weakening, or change in the angle of phase currents to accommodate changes in topology.   In terms of Broader Impact, besides the publications, we have also been invited to give papers at small, high-quality workshops, and the PI is the general Chairman the 2017 edition of the IEEE Symposium for the Diagnosis of Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives. Along the same lines of dissemination of results and broader impact, there have been four Ph.D.  Dissertations, completed primarily through support of this project.  Students have been employed by industry and government. Additional industrial projects have resulted from this work.  A number of talks on the results of this project have been given to industry, and cooperation with foreign institutes (Valencia in Spain, Lyon in France and Graz in Austria) have been supported. They have resulted in visits, presentations, and students from MSU working abroad and vice versa.  Aspects of this work are also continuing in order to address one of the most persistent and unsolved problems in electrical machines, the prognosis of insulation breakdown. This is important, since even if a short-circuit fault is detected or predicted, there is seldom adequate time or even the ability to mitigate it.  Hence predicting insulation breakdown is critical, and tools that have been developed as part of this project are modified and extended for this purpose.  A monograph on the failure prognosis of electrical drives is in the planning stage.       Last Modified: 12/13/2016       Submitted by: Elias G Strangas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
