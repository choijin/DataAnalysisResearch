<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the fundamental biological question of the evolution of novel traits, i.e. traits that do not have obvious precursors. The PIs use a novel behavioral trait, namely the female preference for leading calls, to study the mechanisms that lead to the evolution of this trait. Using a diverse study system (Neoconocephalus katydids), the PIs use a broad range of experiments to test all relevant factors that could potentially contribute to the evolution of the novel trait. Experimental methods include behavioral tests, breeding experiments, bioacoustic analyses and neurobiological analyses. All experiments will be conducted comparatively among up to ten species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will produce arguably the most complete picture of the evolution of a novel trait to date, allowing critical evaluation of multiple adaptive and non-adaptive hypotheses. This study will be a major contribution to the understanding of the origins of biodiversity at both the physiological and evolutionary levels. Understanding the origins of biodiversity may in turn contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, by furthering the understanding of the role that climate and other environmental variables impact trait expression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this study include not only potential contributions to preserving biodiversity, but also educating future scientists.  Four graduate students and multiple undergraduate students will be trained. The breadth of approaches makes this project ideal for training students in the integrative study of complex biological problems. The PIs also reach out to other biology faculty at regional 2- and 4-year colleges through workshops on integrating current research approaches into the undergraduate curriculum, and by building a community of biology educators across multiple institutions.</AbstractNarration>
