<AbstractNarration>Exactly how galaxies form and develop is a mystery that has long eluded astronomers.  So, it is crucial for scientists to unravel clues of galaxy formation and development.  This project focuses on one very important clue to this mystery in spiral galaxies: how the chemical makeup (abundance) of the interstellar medium (ISM) of nearby spiral galaxies is spatially distributed.  The investigators have carefully chosen a specific set of galaxies for this study from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) because SINGS galaxies have excellent multiwavelength observations already available to aid the investigators in interpreting the data that they will obtain in this project.  Using the Multi-Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), the investigators will observe high quality emission line spectra of approximately 1000 ionized gas (H II) regions of 13 SINGS galaxies, increasing the number of previously observed H II regions by more than a factor of 10. Securing these new measurements will allow the investigators to address several scientific topics: (1) the dispersion of the ISM chemical abundances as a function of radius, (2) chemical abundance radial gradients in spiral galaxies, (3) the yields of elements from stellar nucleosynthesis with potential constraints on the stellar initial mass function, (4) the chemical development of galaxies at much greater distances (high redshift), and (5) the chemical enrichment history of the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each of the three years, this project will help fund the education of one graduate student from an underrepresented group (a female), will provide a summer research position for an undergraduate, and will fund a postdoctoral scientist.  Both principal investigators are also heavily involved in public outreach activities to benefit their communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All of the chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are made in nuclear processes in the centers of massive stars that spread these elements into interstellar space during supernova explosions.  Each successive generation of stars is born with more heavy elements  than the previous, a process called "chemical evolution".  Our Sun and its planets are relatively rich in metals as a result of the material from which they formed being processed through many previous generations of stars in our Galaxy.  This project was aimed at obtaining improved data on the spread of heavy elements in nearby galaxies using observations of gaseous nebulae associated with recently formed stars with the newly commissioned Multi-Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) on the twin 8.4-meter diameter Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) on Mt. Graham in Arizona (see lbto.org).  The MODS spectrograph, built by The Ohio State University, is ideally suited to the collection and analysis of the spectra of star forming regions.  With these spectra, we assay the gas in these nebulae for the amounts of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Sulfur, Argon, and Neon, which trace the production of these elements in the supernova explosions of massive stars.  Earlier data relied on measurements of a few nebulae per galaxy, but with MODS and the LBT we can measure many 10s to over 100 nebulae in a single galaxy with very high precision, allowing detailed comparison of patterns of element enrichment and the spread in enrichment from point to point within the galaxies.  Overall we obtained outstanding spectra of nearly 750 star formation regions in 12 nearby spiral galaxies, a huge increase over previous decades of work.  We will be making these data publicly available after the project is complete.  We made the following findings:  1) We confirm previous observations of a gradient in oxygen abundance in spirals in the sense that the centers of galaxies, where there have been more generations of stars, have more oxygen than the outskirts of galaxies, and this decline from center to outside falls exponentially with radius. Similarly, we confirm gradients in the N/O ratio, telling us about secondary production of Nitrogen relative to Oxygen in intermediate mass stars, and the ratios of the other elements, Ar/O, Ne/O, and S/O are all flat with radius, telling us that they are produced in the same proportions as Oxygen, all as predicted by chemical evolution models.  We also confirm the apparent flattening of N/O in the outskirts of two galaxies. There is a suggestion in our data that the N/O enrichment pattern from galaxy-to-galaxy may not be nearly universal as sometimes thought, and we are exploring this further.  2) However, while we confirm these oxygen gradients, we find that in the Whirlpool Galaxy, which is in the midst of a strong tidal encounter with another smaller galaxy, the oxygen abundance gradient is about 2-times flatter than in comparable-size galaxies, and we find a strong gradient in the N/O ratio (higher in the middle, less in the outskirts), contradicting earlier claims that N/O was nearly constant in the Whirlpool Galaxy.  3) We also find that with our greatly improved data there is an unexpected floor in the spread of the O/H ratio at a given radius.  Everyone, including us when we started this, expected that we?d find a small spread, but instead we find that the spread in O/H is larger than the individual measurement errors.  4) A particular surprise was that models of heavy-element production in massive stars predicts that the Ne/O ratio should be nearly constant, and indeed it is for most galaxies, clustering around a value like that seen in our Sun.  However, a subset of star forming regions show a second clustering at a value about 58% lower, suggestive of a systematic Neon deficit in these regions that otherwise have indistinguishable Oxygen-to-Hydrogen ratios (thus allowing us to rule out that Ne/O is due to an Oxygen excess instead of a Neon deficit).  This is a mystery, and we are exploring it further in work beyond this award period.  5) Our high quality spectra allowed us to conduct abundance analyses of low excitation nebulae which are not often observed in chemical abundances studies.  Because of the increased baseline in ionization fraction, we were able to derive new and more comprehensive "ionization correction coefficients" which allow for the conversion from ionic to total chemical abundances.
