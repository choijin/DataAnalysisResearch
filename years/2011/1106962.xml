<AbstractNarration>The investigator derives a logspline procedure to estimate the density and conditional density (for regression type of applications) functions for response variable subject to random truncation. In addition to bias adjustment due to random truncation, the estimators will be shown to possess optimal rates of convergence and important issues related to high-dimensional explanatory variables will be addressed via ANOVA type of decomposition. For functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, the PI and his collaborators estimate the hemodynamic response function(HRF) via deconvolution and develop statistical inference for brain region activation. They also consider the problem of spatial-temporal feature extraction using independent component analysis (ICA). Under appropriate conditions, both parametric and non-parametric statistical inference for the mixing matrix and the latent temporal signals will be derived. Finally, for data involving simultaneous recording of an ensemble of neurons, the problem of feature extraction in identify a group of neurons that interact with the target neuron is examined by using a logspline methodology to estimate the conditional intensity function. The PI studies the statistical inference for firing probability by establishing optimal rates of convergence and the asymptotic distribution of the estimator. Software for all the projects will be developed and disseminated for public use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advance in computer technology has provided a fertile ground for many exciting research opportunities. A profound example is how scientists now use genomic data to study diseases that affect our health. Another is biomedical imaging in brain disease and cognitive studies. In order to conduct valid statistical inferences based on these types of data, it is important to account for the under-sampling issue during the data acquisition stage. The Principle Investigator (PI) develops a flexible statistical framework to address this problem and investigates the modelling validity in real world applications. In particular, the PI and his colleagues investigate how their statistical modelling of blood flow information can help scientists interpret the functional magnetic resonant imaging data for medical applications. They also construct brain images that  capture the neural physiological activity or circuitry of a specific task, as a pathway to understand how the brain functions. Finally, the PI uses efficient and effective statistical methods to study the dynamics of the brain at a much higher temporal resolution by modelling the electro-potential or neuro-firing probability of a task-specific ensemble of neurons. These results help medical researchers advance their knowledge in their related fields so that treatments to various genetic or central nervous system diseases that affect our health can be developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) uses noninvasive MRI techniques to enable studies of dynamic physiological processes at a time scale of seconds. In simple terms fMRI is fast and sensitive to local changes in levels of brain activity. Increases in local brain activity increase the local levels of blood oxygen. This in turn causes the measured signal to increase. The images produced are said to be Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD). Typically, an fMRI dataset consists of a 3D grid of voxels, each containing a time series of measurements that reflect brain activity. Out of roughly 200,000 voxels that lie inside the brain we wish to identify those that were activated under certain experimental conditions. A popular method to analyze these massive spatial-temporal data is to regress the response linearly on the convolution of the input signal and a pre-specified hemodynamic response function (HRF). Our main objective is to address issues related to validating the linearity and adaptive estimation of HRF. The results indicated that our approach is promising (Figure 1). During the funding period, we further developed our existing software and established sampling properties of the proposed procedures on spatial-temporal modeling of fMRI data (Figure 2) by exploiting the spatial correlation structure (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/coloredICA/index.html). Our proposed parametric independent colored sources (PICS) has been extended to handle independent colored sources with possibly mixed specta, where ARMA estimates are often unstable (Figure 3). This method was applied to analyze EEG data which often include artifacts not originated from the brain (Figure 4). These proposed methods based on single-subject fMRI data are novel and they provide new insights in visualizing spatial and temporal features of the data. A greater achievement is the extension of our PICS procedure to compare groups of human subjects using their brain images. This is referred to as the group parametric independent colored sources (GPICS). One of the studies is to compare resting state neural networks among normal and diseased subjects (Figure 5). Another related component was to set up a framework for the statistical analysis of neural spike train data. There is a vast amount of data involving simultaneous recording of an ensemble of neurons. The problem of feature extraction is about how to identify a group of neurons that interact with the target neuron. We employ a likelihood approach based on polynomial spline functions. The conditional intensity function and firing probability will be estimated directly in this framework. All these research activities will appear in a book entitled Statistical Techniques for Neural Scientists (Figure 6).
