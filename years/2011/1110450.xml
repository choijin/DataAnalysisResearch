<AbstractNarration>The primary objective of the proposed research is to determine how behavioral changes?specifically changes in preferences for mates?contribute to the evolution of new species. This study focuses on a pair of two closely related North American species, the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and the cotton mouse (P. gossypinus), which have accumulated few genetic differences between them yet differ in mating preferences. Using a combination of behavioral mate choice tests and genetic analysis, this research aims to determine: (1) the degree to which different mating preferences between P. leucopus and P. gossypinus prevent gene exchange under controlled laboratory conditions, and (2) the genetic basis of those behavioral differences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By studying what types of genetic changes produce behaviors that prevent species from hybridizing, we can learn how behavior evolves as well as quantify its role in the formation of new species. The results from the proposed research will improve our overall understanding of life?s diversity, and will be used to create several family programs and a display case in the Evolution exhibit for the Harvard Museum of Natural History. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Why are there over 100,000 species of beetles, but only 9,000 species of birds? How does the process of speciation work, and are there types of environmental or behavioral differences that promote this process?  One approach to studying the process of speciation is to identify reasons why species avoid mating with other species, thereby preventing genetic exchange and allowing for differentiation. Although there are many ways that species avoid genetic exchange&mdash;either by preventing mating in the first place, or reducing the fitness of hybrid offspring after mating has occurred&mdash;there is emerging evidence that pre-mating mechanisms can evolve quickly (Coyne &amp; Orr 1998; Hendry et al. 2000; Nosil 2012). By identifying which "reproductive barriers" evolve earliest and act strongest between species pairs, we can gain a better insight into which processes&mdash;adaptation to different environments, sexual selection for attractive traits, learning, or conflict between the sexes&mdash;promote speciation.  Our goal was to understand how mating preferences form a reproductive barrier.

These results support the idea that mating preferences are indeed strong and may be learned for some species through the process of sexual imprinting on parents.  In summary, we have shown that in these two species (1) hybridization has been rare throughout their history, (2) behavioral differences in mating preferences are very strong, and (3)...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
