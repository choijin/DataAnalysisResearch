<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop methods to acquire real-world images and video from far fewer measurements than is possible in the current state-of-the-art.  Such methods could be used to greatly reduce the cost of imaging in situations where taking measurements of an image/video is currently very expensive.  This is the case, for example, in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), commonly used in both medicine and neuroscientific research.  These methods could also make possible the acquisition of much more detailed information from the same imaging resources in areas such as remote sensing, geoscience, or astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  To achieve this goal, the project will exploit manifold models for signal structure that have previously proved intractable in the compressive sensing literature. While manifold models can efficiently express many signals in terms of dramatically fewer parameters than the usual Fourier/wavelet models, allowing for complete reconstruction of these signals from dramatically fewer measurements, the complexity of manifold models has to date stood as an obstacle to their use in efficient data acquisition. This project will employ an elegant framework, based on the kernel trick commonly used in kernel methods in machine learning, to permit the use of manifold models for compressive sensing with little to no increase in computational complexity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The main goal of this project has been to build improved mathematical methods for reconstructing better quality images from limited measurements.  This problem is of interest because there are a variety of real-world practical imaging problems where it occurs.  One important example is medical imaging with MRI.  Getting an MRI is both expensive and a long, uncomfortable process for the patient because each individual measurement is time-consuming and expensive to take.  With improved algorithms for getting better quality images out of the same number of measurements, we can decrease the number of measurements needed for an MRI and thus also its cost and discomfort.  This is just one example.  The strategy taken has been to use manifold models for images, which have been previously under-explored in the literature on reconstruction. The first main outcome of the project was our desired one: improved algorithms for reconstructing images from limited, incomplete, and/or corrupted measurements.  We found that our new algorithms performed better than even the current state-of-the-art methods for reconstructing images from limited or missing measurements, both in terms of quantitative metrics like PSNR and in terms of visual quality.  Such quality improvements can, for example, permit a doctor to discern and diagnose medical issues where otherwise it would not be possible. Along the way, we also found that there was a valuable opportunity to improve the algorithms used for fitting the manifold models to data.  We thus developed a new algorithm called KODA to do this.  The improvements in model fit we achieved can in turn be used to improve performance on a variety of practical tasks involving classification/identification of images or other data.  For example, we found that KODA improved performance on (1) a task of reading the handwritten zip code digits that the post office receives on letters, (2) a task of finding the relevant newsgroup articles on a given topic, and (3) a problem of having a wearable fitness tracker device recognize which exercises are being done.  These are just a few examples of practical scenarios in which our new data modeling method could be used. A third major outcome was a novel computationally-efficient algorithm for fitting models to extremely large datasets, as are becoming more and more common in the "big data" era.  Under the right conditions on the data, our method's required computation can scale with the size of the data samples instead of the square of the size, as prior methods do, which for large datasets vastly speeds up the computation time. Finally, in addition to the research results, there were a number of human development outcomes as well.  First, three PhD students received years of training in doing mathematical research and developing new algorithms to solve practical problems, as well as financial support for their studies.  Two of the three students have completed their PhDs and the third intends to finish within a year.  Another undergraduate student received two years of mentoring on undergraduate research projects and was inspired by that experience to pursue PhD-level study in the field at Caltech.  Furthermore, a graduate-level course was created by the Principal Investigator (PI) on modern advanced methods for data analysis, such as those used in the research, and it was taught three times to a total of 49 graduate-level students.  Finally, the PI gave a number of outreach talks on her research to groups of high school and freshmen students, especially women and minorities.  Hence, the project has also contributed in a small way toward training and inspiring the next generation of scientists.
