<AbstractNarration>Lichens and bryophytes share biological traits that make them some of the most sensitive indicators of environmental change. The goal of this project is to provide high quality data to address how species distributions change as a result of major environmental events across time and space. Specifically, this project will digitize the label information (the what, when, where and by whom collected) and images for approximately 2.3 million biological specimens curated in North American lichen and bryophyte herbaria. These collections represent well over 90% of all specimens collected in Canada, the United States and Mexico and held by over 60 US non-governmental institutions. New, on-line digitization techniques will be made publically available at at http://symbiota.org/nalichens/ and http://symbiota.org/bryophytes/, and will allow interested members of the public to be involved and learn about biodiversity alongside the professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Availability of nearly the entire North American bryophyte and lichen collections on-line will greatly accelerate knowledge and evaluation of the biodiversity of these organisms by fostering collaborations between professionals and the general public. Additionally, models developed from these digitized data will aid future mapping projections of large scale species distributions and identification of biodiversity hotspots as prime candidates for protection. These endeavors will help to elucidate regions where changes are imminent and likely to have substantial impact, as well as to facilitate proactive initiatives to alleviate such changes. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As part of a collaborative nationwide project, the Ohio State University Herbarium imaged all 14,360 labels of our North American lichen collections.  These images were then processed at the project headquarters to capture the identification and locality information and these data are being transcribed and deposited in the project database and made available publicly through the online Lichen Portal.  Four undergraduate students participated in the data capture for the project and received training on the importance and handling of natural history specimens.  A graduate student was involved with supervision of data capture and was paid for with other funds.  The OSU PI oversaw project operations and communicated with the project central office to coordinate work.  These data are now available via the web portal for research tracking climate change and pollution patterns, among other research possibilities, because of the sensitivity of these species to changes in airborne contaminants and to changing climate conditions. Thus far, data that were mobilized through this project have been used in two scientific studies (PhD research) by collaborating institutions. Aspects of the project have been presented at national and international conferences, the ADBC summit, and several guest lectures at partner organizations.  The need for further curation of the OSU collections was also highlighted by the project.       Last Modified: 09/28/2015       Submitted by: John V Freudenstein]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
