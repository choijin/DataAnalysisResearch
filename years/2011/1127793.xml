<AbstractNarration>The proposed AIR project will allow construction of a prototype of a new scaled-up device for continuous fabrication of nanofibers, as well as to investigate and model the fiber formation processes in the device, including hydrodynamic liquid jet deformation, phase separation, polymer precipitation and fiber deformation. The proposed work would also allow efficient and reliable control of the diameter, length and aspect ratios of nanorods and nanofibers in the scaled-up process; and will be performed in collaboration between the North Carolina State team and Xanofi, a new small spin-off company. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work would make possible the transition from an innovative technique into a breakthrough technology that can profoundly change the emerging market of nanomaterials. The scaled-up technology developed in this proposal could bolster the $100 million market for nanofibers. The envisioned applications of these nanofibers in energy-efficient filters and solid-state lighting would help develop a new generation of greener industrial and consumer products. The commercial development of this platform technology would bolster the economy of North Carolina through job creation in partnerships with local and national companies. The plans for educational outreach include internships for community college students at NORTH Carolina State and Xanofi, and demonstrations of nanomaterial fabrication in local high schools.</AbstractNarration>

The shear process can be used in the fabrication of nanofibers from many classes of materials, including hydrophilic, chemically or biologically active polymers. The resulting polymer nanofibers can also incorporate functional particles by simply adding them to the polymer solution.
