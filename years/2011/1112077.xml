<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the NSF Chemistry Division supports a Collaborative Research effort by Assoc. Prof. Claudio J. Margulis (P.I.) at the University of Iowa Dept. of Chemistry and by Prof. Edward W. Castner, Jr. (co-P.I.) at the Dept. of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. The goal is to study in detail the structural and dynamical properties of ionic liquids using a combination of theoretical and computational methods from the Margulis group with experimental investigations done by the Castner group. Ionic liquids consist of flexible, asymmetric molecular cations and anions. Several reports have shown that very small modification of either the cation or the anion components of the ionic liquid can make dramatic changes to its properties. For example replacing the central nitrogen atom of a tetralkylammonium cation by a phosphorus atom can lead to a drop in the liquid viscosity by a factor of two. Our current understanding of these liquids does not provide a straightforward explanation of these results; our goal is to combine x-ray and NMR experiments on these liquids with detailed molecular simulations and theoretical analyses to explain this phenomenon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observed x-ray scattering patterns from ionic liquids that all share the same bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide anion are remarkably similar. This is because the anions have more electron-rich atoms than the hydrocarbon-based cations. Thus, whereas the cations may be the most important organizational components in many liquids, the information content in the x-ray scattering provides mostly detailed information about the anions with information about the cations being obtained only indirectly. We will invert this circumstance by preparing ionic liquids with smaller anions such as nitrate, dicyanamide and acetate, so that the observed x-ray scattering patterns result predominantly from scattering by the cations. This will provide a new perspective on the structure of ionic liquids. It will also help in testing and designing better parameters for simulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the research is of a fundamental nature, the outcomes will inform the design, testing and selection of ionic liquids for a range of electrolyte applications and interaction with biological molecules and assemblies. These liquids are providing solutions to a number of significant challenges in energy storage, nanotechnology, processing of biomass, and pharmaceutical research. Undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will receive training in the latest experimental methods, including synchrotron-based x-ray scattering experiments, two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and theoretical methods applied to the statistical physics of complex liquids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Ionic liquids are salts that can be liquid below room temperature, with the component anions and cations made from (in)organic molecular ions.  Their unique properties make them valuable solvents for a variety of applications such as next-generation energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors) or for solubilizing biomass from trees and weeds in order to convert these to sustainable liquid fuels. The research goals in this NSF grant period have been to investigate some of the unusual properties of liquid salts to see if these can properties can be selectively enhanced in order to provide for better performance of these novel solvents. During previous NSF-sponsored research, we discovered that very small changes in the structure of the ionic liquid cations, by as little as a change in a single atom, could result in huge changes in their properties.  During the current project, we use X-ray scattering, computational molecular movies, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate some of the unusual properties.  For example changing a nitrogen to phosphorus atom in the center of a cation causes the ionic liquid to show a lower viscosity, which can lead to faster chemical reaction rates.  In another direction, replacing one methylene (CH2) group by an oxygen atom, having the same number of electrons, makes for a more flexible chain and also a lower viscosity.  Our results showed that even though these hydrocarbon vs. oxygenated chains have the same length and number of electrons, their local conformations are quite different, and explain the differences in local structure and friction that we observed in the experiments and computer simulations.  An example of the kind of picture obtained by validating the computational results via the results from X-ray scattering is shown in the attached figure, where the red shapes are the probability isodensity surfaces for finding bis-trifylamide anions surrounding the cations shown. In addition to directly supporting the laboratory research projects, this NSF grant provided numerous opportunities for enhancing the national science infrastructure by training young scientists in new methods.  These individuals are now enjoying science careers that were directly facilitated by their participation in these projects.  Dr. Marie Thomas is now an assistant professor at Fordham Univ., and Dr. Sufia Khatun is teaching at The College of Staten Island.  Dr. Heather Lee defended her Ph.D. thesis in May 2012 and is now a group leader at LÆOreal, while Dr. Min Liang finished her postdoctoral work in Jan. 2015 to begin a career at Avon Products.  Dr. Tanya Fadeeva completed her thesis in 2011 and is now teaching at Rutgers.  Undergraduate researchers are now doing very well in the prestigious Ph.D. programs they have enrolled in:  Mr. Patrick Kramer (Stanford); Ms. Tianyi Liu (U. Penn) and Ms. Jessalyn DeVine (UC Berkeley). Finally, the NSF grant provided opportunities for the young researchers named above to present their work at a number of different national and international level scientific conferences.  This in turn facilitated new international collaborations with groups at the Univ. of Rome, Italy; the CNRS Lab. in Clermont-Ferrand, France; and Chiba Univ., Japan.
