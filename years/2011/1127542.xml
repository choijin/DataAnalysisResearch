<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and test real-time process monitoring systems to support manufacturing of miniature digital cameras.  Rapid growth in unit volume of digital cameras for cellphones and consumer goods has outpaced the industry?s manufacturing process monitoring technology.  Except for simple pass/fail outgoing quality tests, high volume camera manufacturers lack any system for in-line, real-time monitoring of production errors that cause low yields, high production costs, and delay new product introduction.  The Real-time Camera Analysis and Process Tracking algorithm, ReCAPT, integrates with existing production equipment to identify manufacturing errors and trends before product quality is compromised.  ReCAPT leverages outgoing QC data, along with novel design-aware algorithms to identify assembly and fabrication errors and improve the manufacturing process.  The Phase II objectives include optimizing the data collection hardware and pre-processing software, automating and generalizing the algorithm initialization, and integrating ReCAPT into the production environment through improvements to the algorithm?s robustness.  With a key commercialization partner, ReCAPT will be tested multiple times in actual production environments with potential customers reviewing the results.  The results will determine the achievable improvement in production efficiency, and quantify ReCAPT?s economic value to manufacturers of digital cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project involves improving yields in the production of miniature camera lenses.  Over one billion miniature digital cameras produced annually supply the explosive growth in cell phones and other mobile consumer electronics.  The pursuit of cost reduction has led to development of wafer-level manufacturing where thousands of camera lenses are simultaneously fabricated, affixed to a wafer of image sensors and then diced ? potentially eliminating the need for individual component assembly. By improving yields and lowering costs, ReCAPT will enable the rapid adoption of wafer-level and other automated, capital intensive camera manufacturing technologies. The broader impact is the development of manufacturing technologies that rely on automation and precision engineering instead of manual labor, enabling US companies to gain traction in the growing $15 Billion annual digital camera market.  The statistical manufacturing process data supplied by ReCAPT enables real-time control of manufacturing, reduces new product risk, and allows more aggressive development of innovative camera technology.  Sold as an enhancement to existing automated manufacturing equipment, the ReCAPT software product will increase profit for component manufacturers, improve product performance and performance consistency for consumer goods manufacturers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a result of the Phase II/IIB research program, FiveFocal developed software technology to model all the components of a digital cameras &ndash; the optical lens, the sensor, and image signal processing.  FiveFocal LLC released this software as Imager, a camera simulation and modeling program, in November 2015.  This product enables engineers to virtually prototype digital imaging systems and evaluate their anticipated imaging performance based on the parameters entered for each component of the imaging system.  This software is available directly from our website at an introductory price of $2400 for a year subscription locked to a single computer.  Cameras have a profound and ever increasing impact on society in many areas. Today we rely on them to document our lives, they improve robotically assisted, minimally invasive surgery, and tomorrow they will guide our self-driving cars. In general, camera engineers use very sophisticated tools to design the individual components of a camera&ndash; the lens, sensor, and signal processing.  But when they combine those individual components to make a camera system, surprisingly they often do it by trial and error.  WeÆre changing that with our software, FiveFocal Imager.  It simulates images as if they came from a real camera.  It does this by combining all components of an imaging system: the illumination, scene content, a physical lens model, a sensor with real pixel effects, and image processing algorithms.   The end result is software that enables engineers to virtually prototype their cameras before building a costly hardware prototype, this will reduce time, cost, and engineering risk. We are going to do for camera design what CAD programs did for mechanical design-create a powerful, easy to use virtual prototyping and design tool.  How do we know that there is a market for our Imager software? For 6 years we bootstrapped our company by providing optical engineering services to US federal agencies, and many well-known consumer electronics companies. Working with these customers provided insight into their challenges, and highlighted the opportunity for our software.  Discussions have begun with two companies to potentially distribute our software through their extensive network and international reach.  Through Universities, we have a plan to put our software into the hands of next yearÆs workforce &ndash; a strategy that established Solidworks and Matlab, as dominant engineering software.  CU Boulder plans to use our software in a class, and we have strong contacts to other universities with well-known optics departments.  Using the technology developed under the NSF SBIR Phase I/II/IIB program we have developed a commercial product that will reduce the time, risk, and cost associated with developing imaging systems for diverse consumer, medical, industrial, security, and defense applications.
