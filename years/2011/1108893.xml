<AbstractNarration>Among the most important projects planned for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be the measurement of the cosmological effects of dark energy. These effects will be detected through their influence on the growth of structure in the early universe and on weak gravitational lensing by galaxies and galaxy clusters. In order for these efforts to succeed, studies of the potential sources of error should begin now. The LSST survey, expected to comprise of order 1 billion galaxies, will have such small statistical errors that systematic errors - the most important being in the measurement of photometric redshift and weak gravitational lens shear - may dominate. In this project, the proposing team will carry out a comprehensive study of the origin and impact of these systematic effects in dark energy measurements, and develop algorithms, analysis tools and observing techniques to minimize their impact. They will use the improved understanding of the residual systematics to simulate the performance of LSST, as a precursor to construction. They have previously found that dark energy constraints are sensitive to systematics in ways that depend strongly on how separate techniques (such as weak lensing, cosmic shear, and baryon acoustic oscillations) are combined. The team intends to exploit this sensitivity and investigate new methods for controlling systematic error by combining several observational probes in an optimal way. They will use end-to- end simulations of LSST to develop and test these algorithms, and apply them to the current data from the Deep Lens Survey (DLS) to produce science in the near term. The team intends to make its techniques, data, and open-source software publicly available with no proprietary period, with the expectation that their photometric redshift algorithm will be widely used. In addition to contributing to education through the mentoring of a postdoctoral researcher, the project will also engage in public outreach and informal education by partnering in the development of new tools to visualize the dark and luminous structure of the Universe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ About 95% of the universe, dubbed "dark energy" and "dark matter",  is currently beyond our understanding.  The physical nature of these cosmic ingredients remains a complete mystery to the present day.  Their mere existence is exciting evidence for new physics.  Dark matter and dark energy also play a key role in shaping our Universe as a whole. Dark energy controls the present evolution of the universe -- the expension of the universe is accelerating. Dark matter had a dominant role in the emergence and formation of structures in the universe in past epochs, where the dark matter provided the controlling gravitational fields to form galaxies.   The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) sky survey will probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy in novel ways. One of the most important probes is the cosmic mirage of distant galaxies behind foreground concentrations of dark matter -- measured over ten billion years of look-back time.  This "weak gravitational lens shear" distortion of the shapes of several billion galaxies will produce an unprecedented view of the development of dark matter structure over cosmic time  --  if observational systematic errors can be minimized. Two technical developments are required: Since spectroscopy of billions of faint galaxies is not feasible, we must develop improved ways of using multi-color photometry and other information on galaxies to estimate their redshift. And we must understand, measure, and suppress biases in measurments of the gravitational lens distorted shapes of these billions of faint galaxies.  Research pursued under this grant resulted in characterization and understanding of these systematic errors within the context of combined observational probes, and a novel algorithm for gravitational lens shear data analysis which significantly enhances the promise of LSST to probe the nature dark energy.  LSST's sample of several billion galaxies has such small statistical error (noise) that systematic errors could dominate.  The two dominant systematic errors in current sky surveys are: the measurement of photometric redshift and weak gravitational lens shear. We developed techniques to significantly reduce the systematic errors in weak lens shear estimation and in photometric redshift estimation to levels well below the statistical noise expected in full depth LSST imaging. As validation we appied our new weak lens algorithm SFIT to a blind international galaxy shear estimation contest called "GREAT3" and won first place.    Using improved photometric redshifts, we then applied SFIT to an LSST precursor sky survey Deep Lens Survey (DLS) data on a million distant galaxies over a large volume, in a tomographic measurement of cosmic shear. This resulted in a precise measurement of amplitude of the cosmic dark matter density fluctuations. This full 3D tomographic cosmic shear analysis using SFIT on DLS data has given the most precise measurement to date of the dark matter power spectrum normalization sigma_8.   See Jee et al. arXiv:1510.03962.  This measurement of sigma_8 removes the tension that existed between CFHTLens survey cosmic shear and the Planck cosmic microwave background results.
