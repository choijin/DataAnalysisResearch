<AbstractNarration>This award facilitates scientific research using the large new computational resource named Blue Waters scheduled to be deployed at the University of Illinois in 2012. It provides travel funds to support technical coordination between the principal investigators, the Blue Waters project team and vendor technical team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm for structure formation has had many successes over a large range of scales: from Cosmic Microwave Background fluctuations on the scale of the horizon to the formation and clustering of individual galaxies. However, at the low end of the galaxy luminosity function, the agreement between the CDM theory and observations is somewhat at odds. In particular, the existence of bulgeless, cored small galaxies is not a natural prediction of CDM. However, these are the scales where the baryonic physics of gas cooling, star formation and feedback can significantly impact the overall mass of the galaxy. Furthermore, accurately modeling the star formation process requires spatial resolution of order 100 parsecs or less and mass resolutions of less than 10000 solar masses in order to resolve the molecular star forming regions of the interstellar medium.  The planned simulations  will use the Blue Waters petascale system to model space telescope survey volumes consistent with addresssing small galaxies from high redshift to the present with sufficient resolution to make robust predictions of the luminosity function, star formation rate and morphologies appropriate for these surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be involved in these computational advances in cosmology research.  The project team is successful in attracting a diverse population of students.  Morever, the simulations will be represented visually in public outreach forums as well as in instruction in undergraduate courses, increasing public understanding of galaxy and star formation which is fundamental to our knowledge of the Universe as a whole.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the origins of galaxies like our own Milky Way requires the modeling of physics on a vast range of scales.  The majority of the matter is dark (that is, only interacts gravitationally) and its accumulation and distribution within a galaxy depends on structure on the largest scales.   Galaxies themselves are quite small compared this large scale structure (see image).  While the visible components are a minority of the mass, they have significant influence on the evolution of the Universe, and certainly on how we can observe the Universe.  Therefore it is important for models of the formation of galaxies match both the sizes of galaxies today, and the observations of galaxies in the early Universe, such as those made by the Hubble Space Telescope.  In this project we have demonstrated that we can build models that satisfy these requirements, but only at significant computational cost and using the largest supercomputers available (such as the NSF Blue Waters sustained petascale computiing facility.)  These sophisticated models help us understand processes in the Universe that would be otherwise hard to address.  For instance, we know that most of the volume of the Universe is filled with a very low density, very hot plasma, (the Inter-Galactic Medium) but we don't know how that plasma came to be so hot.  Our models show that, somewhat counter-intuitively, radiation from the stars in the smallest galaxies are sufficient to heat the IGM to its current state.  This is because our models predict there are a large number of small galaxies (which we predict will be discovered by future telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope), and that the radiation more easily escapes these small galaxies.  The fascination of this subject has attracted many good students both at the Graduate and Undergraduate level to work on the simulation results.  The work performed in analyzing these simulations was a significant part of two Ph. D. theses at the University of Washington.  Five undergraduate students participated in the analysis of these simulations, particularly in comparing the simulated galaxies to real galaxies.
