<AbstractNarration>To encourage more US-based participation in geo-spatial research, this support will enable  20 promising graduate and undergraduate students in computer science  the necessary financial support to attend one of the field's premier forums, the International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases (SSTD), to be held this year in Minneapolis August 24-26. The biennial event showcases cutting-edge research spanning a vast array of topics and attracts researchers, developers, and end users around the world from academia, industry, and government.  The engagement and subsequent education of the next generation of scientists and engineers working with spatial and temporal data will have a significant impact on the lives of ordinary people everywhere. In addition to improvements in vehicular and various forms of public transportation, security mechanisms featuring unprecedented sophistication will be made possible by enhanced intelligence gathering via spatial analysis of satellite imagery, and macroscopic ecological health will be more accurately modeled with more informative uses of spatio-temporal data. Promoting this conference participation by U.S. based graduate and undergraduate students is important for helping the United States to maintain a major foothold in the exciting products, services and ideas to come out of the field of spatial and temporal data.</AbstractNarration>

Finally, at SSTD 2011, industry representatives were present to discuss current research and potential job opportunities with the students during the demonstration track of the conference.
