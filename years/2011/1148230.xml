<AbstractNarration>This RTG program will continue the development of a comprehensive program of cross-disciplinary research and training in Mathematical and Computational Biology, housed within the Department of Mathematics at the University of Utah.  The training component will give students a high level of mathematical training, substantial exposure to biological problems and techniques, and extensive experience in communication and collaboration with experimental life scientists.  The research component will develop and use mathematical and computational methods to study complex biological processes, organized around four major research themes of biofluids, ecology and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and physiology.  The training of students in this program will include traditional and non-traditional coursework, journal clubs, seminars, laboratory rotations, extramural research experiences, research group meetings, mentoring, consulting and teaching experiences, as well as a variety of professional development experiences.  Students will receive research mentoring by mathematicians and experimentalists in a highly interactive setting in which they learn the necessary biology and develop the ability to do non-traditional, cross-disciplinary, cutting edge research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will train fully integrated, collaborative researchers, scholars and educators in mathematical and computational biology, thus bringing  to bear the power of mathematics on the challenging problems of modern biology.  Many collaborative research projects will be initiated as a result of our research training paradigm, as students become engaged with other students and faculty in other departments and institutions.  By placing quantitatively trained individuals in an environment where medical and biological problems are at the forefront, the possibilities for new insights and discoveries are truly outstanding. The long term effect of this program will be a new generation of applied mathematical scientists who can work effectively to build bridges between traditional disciplines and among academia, industry and the public sector.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project were to train undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students to do interdisciplinary research in mathematical biology and to initiate and develop research collaborations between life scientists and mathematicians, mediated by these students.  This goal of training undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in interdisciplinary mathematical biology research was met in  excellent fashion.  Over the course of this grant, we involved 41 undergraduate students in REU research projects.  We were able to provide partial support to 36 graduate students, producing 26 PhD theses, and initiating and establishing 20 collaborations with scientists in non-mathematics, life science fields.     In addition, there were 4 non-supported students who    participated in our training program and produced PhD theses.  We had 3 postdoctoral fellows, who in addition to having their research shaped by the interactions in our program, were involved in the mentoring and training of undergraduate and graduate students.  Advanced graduate students were  all directly engaged in the training and mentoring of younger students through our active journal club and research group programs.  Of the postdoctoral fellows, two are employed  in tenure track faculty positions and one is employed by a research pharmaceutical company.  Research topics of these trainees were wide ranging, including (in broad terms) biophysics, cell biology, developmental biology, neuroscience, immunology, epidemiology, cancer dynamics, ecology, molecular biology, genetic regulation, physiology of diabetes, blood physiology and clotting. A complete listing of our PhD recipients can be found on our website at http://www.math.utah.edu/research/mathbio/people/alumni.html.
