<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This CalWomenTech Scale Up Project (CWT Scale Up Project) is based on the successful, five-year GSE Extension Services grant.  The original project worked with eight community college technology programs in California to increase the number of women recruited and retained to STEM programs in which they were underrepresented.  The project also disseminated research-based proven strategies and resources to California educators and a limited national audience. The CalWomenTech Project has resulted in significant increases in the enrollment of female students and in the retention of both female and male students. The CWT Scale Up Project seeks to diffuse the core activities of the intensive CalWomenTech Project to a much larger audience of educational practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CWT Scale Up Project is based on research: both the CalWomenTech Project's own successful outcomes and on a literature review of the proven practices of other STEM practitioners, much of which can be found in IWITTS' online Proven Practices Collection (includes peer-reviewed articles, case studies, and webinars) developed by the CalWomenTech Project.  Objectives include providing educational practitioners with workshops, webinars, and group coaching on recruitment and retention plan implementation, along with development of an online learning community. A professionally designed outreach campaign by an experienced social media networking consultant will feature CalWomenTech successful results, professional development opportunities, and the online Proven Practices Collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The end goal of the CalWomenTech Scale Up Project is to increase the number of women in STEM. Our nation is enriched when women fully contribute to the advancement of science and technology. By giving practitioners nationwide the tools and knowledge they need to close the gender gap for women and girls in STEM classrooms, the CalWomenTech Scale Up Project has the power to change the lives and livelihoods of women for the benefit of all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Advanced Technology Education program.</AbstractNarration>

IWITTS has cracked the code to helping community colleges broaden participation in as little as one semester with this WomenTech Educators Online Training. Six of 7 colleges from the Spring 2015 Online Training reported successful outcomes in only 8 months:      5 of 7 colleges started enrolling an average of 4.8 more female students in their STEM courses 6 of 7 colleges increased female retention from an average baseline of 58% to 100% 5 of the 7 colleges were connected to ATE Projects    Mount Wachusett Community College&mdash;one of these 6 colleges&mdash;went from 1 female student in its introductory manufacturing class to 9 females out of 13 students the next semester. Plus, 100% of both female and male students were retained the next semester!  IWITTS piloted a series of significant improvements&mdash;such as the addition of a live team-building orientation&mdash;in the Spring 2015 Online Training. The 12-week WomenTech Educators Online Training is a combination of asynchronous video modules and assignments combined with live interaction and feedback from the trainer in group Question &amp; Answer Calls and Team-based Coaching Calls.  CWT Scale Up is one of very few projects focused specifically on gender in community college STEM programs that has documented actual increases in female enrollment and completion via its external evaluators. This Project successfully reached over 2,830 STEM educators with its professional development opportunities&mdash;including 5 online trainings, 5 in-person/hybrid trainings hosted by ATE centers, 10 webinars featuring special topics on women in STEM, and the inaugural 2015 STEM Success for Women Telesummit.  The 4-day Telesummit featured virtual conference sessions with 11 experts and educators who have successfully recruited and retained female students in STEM. Over 95% of Telesummit participants who filled out the evaluation rated the sessions as "Good" to "Excellent." The online dissemination techniques piloted in this Project can serve as important examples for other projects and organizations disseminating strategies and demonstrated outcomes to STEM educators, especially at the community college level.  The Project?s professional development opportunities, evidence-based strategies, and resources such as IWITTS?s free, online Proven Practices Collection (PPC) were successfully disseminated to over 22,500 STEM educators across the country through a 5-year marketing and dissemination campaign. The Project used IWITTS?s communication channels to reach out to over 17,480 contacts via IWITTS?s Facebook page and group, LinkedIn profile, LinkedIn STEM education groups, and the WomenTech Educators e-newsletter. The Principal Investigator Donna Milgram was interviewed by 9 different press outlets and made 20 conference presentations during this Project&mdash;at national conferences such as the U.S. Department of Education?s Moving STEM Forward in the Career, Technical and Adult Education Symposium.  The CWT Scale Up Project was co-funded by the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering (GSE) and ATE programs to expand the important work of the original CalWomenTech Project&mdash;which was highlighted by the NSF for demonstrating significant achievement and program effectiveness and chosen as 1 of 3 model projects nationally by the American Association of University Women's research report Women in Community Colleges: Access to Success.  The CWT Scale Up Project will ultimately make a difference in the lives of the female (and male) students that pursue STEM careers because of the efforts of the many community college educators impacted by this Project.
