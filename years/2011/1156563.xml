<AbstractNarration>This funding renews a highly-successful CISE Research Experiences for&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa.  This&lt;br/&gt;site focuses on empirical software engineering and its projects span&lt;br/&gt;several exciting areas of inquiry, including text retrieval based&lt;br/&gt;feature location, code clone evolution, software engineering techniques&lt;br/&gt;and tools for computational science &amp; engineering, and open-source&lt;br/&gt;developer communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will allow 30 students (over three years) to experience&lt;br/&gt;Software Engineering research.  Participating students will attend&lt;br/&gt;research training and professional development seminars.  Students will&lt;br/&gt;have the opportunity to submit their research to quality conferences and&lt;br/&gt;to present their work, if accepted.  The project team is committed to&lt;br/&gt;including under-represented minority students in their research.  Thus&lt;br/&gt;this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding&lt;br/&gt;while promoting learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goals of this REU program were to provide summer research opportunities for students in the area of empirical software engineering. In addition to recruiting the best students available, we also had a special emphasis on increasing the participation from underrepresented minorities and those that do not have access to research programs at their own undergraduate institutions. To that end we can report the following outcome highlights:  38% of the summer research participants were underrepresented minorities 62% of the summer research participants were drawn from undergraduate institutions that do not provide significant research opportunities   By involving a number of different mentors, we were able to expose the students to research in various areas of empirical software engineering including: Mining Software Repositories, Human-Based Empirical Studies, Scientific Software, and Software Security.  In addition, of those that have already graduated, at least 10 have enrolled in Masters or PhD programs at various universities including Notre Dame, Georgia Tech, and the University of Alabama.  Based at least partially upon the work performed during their summer research projects, REU participants have been co-authors on the following publications:  Journal papers - 1 Conference papers - 2 Workshop papers - 2   We anticiate additional publications on which some of the REU students will be co-authors.
