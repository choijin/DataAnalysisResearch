<AbstractNarration>In the current project the PI intends to  explore  some open problems about self-similar fractals and related geometric structures. The fractals considered often arise from the dynamics of groups or the dynamics of  maps under iteration, and often a better understanding  of their quasiconformal geometry is  of crucial relevance. Specific topics for investigation  include the geometry of Sierpinski carpets, dynamics of expanding Thurston maps, and instances of entropy rigidity in coarse  and metric geometry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fractal and self-similar features  can be seen in many natural phenomena such as coast- and fault lines, snowflakes and crystal growth, electric discharge or  plant growth patterns.  This projects intends to contribute to the development of basic methods and tools that  are necessary for a deeper understanding of such structures. An important part of this activity  is the involvement of  young researchers. The goal is to provide them with the mathematical expertise necessary for independent investigations of fractal phenomena.</AbstractNarration>
