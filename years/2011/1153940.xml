<AbstractNarration>The project is a collaborative program of research, education and training based on the Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI) Workshop and the Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling (GSMM) Camp.  These annual meetings, held during successive weeks in June, attract mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from academic institutions and from indusry.  University participants include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty.  The focus of the MPI Workshop is a set of problems brought by contributing participants from industry.  These problems span a wide range of areas of applications, often in fluid and solid mechanics but also in mathematical biology, data analysis, and mathematical finance, among others.  Recent problems have included, for example, mathematical models for electromagnetic wave interactions with nanostructures, mathematical problems related to drawing of glass sheets, medical ultrasonic imaging, and automatic defect recognition in industrial inspection applications.  The work on the problems is done in vertically integrated teams consisting of the representatives from industry, senior and junior faculty, postdocs and graduate students.  The scientific objective of the activity generated by the Workshop and its intellectual merit is the study of mathematical problems of significant interest for industrial applications.  The GSMM Camp is held during the week prior to the Workshop, and graduate students attending the Camp also attend the Workshop.  The main objective of the Camp is graduate student education and training.  At the Camp, graduate students work together in teams, with the guidance of invited faculty mentors, on interdisciplinary problems typically inspired by industrial applications.  The problems are carefully chosen to promote a rich set of problem-solving skills, both analytical and numerical, and to provide a warm-up for the difficult problems considered at the Workshop.  The two meetings complement each other and form a comprehensive program of interdisciplinary research, education and training that is unique amongst universities in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is an ongoing effort organized by the principal investigators at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, University of Delaware, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and New Jersey Institute of Technology.  The MPI Workshop has run annually for the past 26 years with the principal aim of promoting research and education in applied mathematics and of developing links between academics and industry for the mutual benefit of both sides.  For the past 8 years, the research and educational activities of the Workshop have been enhanced by the introduction of the GSMM Camp.  In addition to these established meetings, the project involves a number of new activities associated with the Workshop and Camp designed to further advance the research and educational objectives of the collaborative program.  These activities include the introduction of a graduate student fellowship program, support for early-career mathematicians to attend the meetings, and the development of a graduate student exchange program in cooperation with the Oxford Center for Collaborative Applied Mathematics.  Overall, the Workshop and Camp, and its associated activities, have a broad impact on the education and development of early-career mathematicians, and on the interdisciplinary research and educational activities of participating faculty.  The Workshop also promotes collaborations with industry and has an impact on the development and analysis of new technologies in industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative project builds deep connections between mathematics faculty and students and industrial practicioners by supporting Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI) workshop and the Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling (GSMM) camp.   The MPI workshop is the oldest mathematics/industry workshops in North America and has been enormously successful at bringing contemporary mathematical problems from industry to the attention of world-class mathematicians in the academe. During the intense five-day workshop program, faculty and grad students engage with industrial presenters to model, formulate, analyze and simulate processes that are inaccessible to traditional engineering approaches.  The GSMM camp is unique bridge program that prepares early career mathematicians for the rigors of the workshop environment.  This project supported the 2012 GSMM camp at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  and 2012 MPI workshop at the University of Delaware.  Residual funds retains through cost-savings were used to partially support the 2013 GSMM camp and 2013 MPI workshop at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  The 2012 MPI workshop attracted presenters from diverse sectors:  Pall, New Way Precision/Glaston, Standard and Poor's and Bloom Energy.   Characteristically, three of the presenters had contributed to MPI in the past and are committed to supporting the workshop for the foreseeable future.  Bloom Energy was a new presenter and is taking steps to continue to the collaborations forged during MPI.   The workshop attracted more than 70 participants including approximately 40 graduate students.  During this workshop, we supported our inaugural MPI Graduate Fellow who continued to develop and augment the New Way Precision/Glaston workshop results throughout the 2012-2013 academic year.  The 2013 MPI workshop saw the reach of MPI continue to grow with projects presented by Corning, Pall, O-Max and Gore.  Once again, the workshop was successful in drawing both experienced corporate sponsors (Corning, Pall and Gore) and new presenters (O-Max).  In summary, our project activities have successfully achieved a number of goals:  It has brought useful mathematical methodologies and techniques to companies that otherwise would not have access to this level of mathematical expertise.  Also, our project gives industry access to promising students with whom they would otherwise not have contact. It has brought new, exciting contemporary problems from industry into university research programs and courses. It has exposed graduate students to industrial mathematics, as it is truly practiced.  Furthermore, through the GSMM camp and fellowship program, we have created a pipeline of activities for earlier career mathematics to pursue these interests over the course of their graduate studies. It has helped industrial scientists, faculty and graduate students expand their collaborative networks across traditional barriers.
