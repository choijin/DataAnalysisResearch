<AbstractNarration>SES-1155221&lt;br/&gt;Steven Brint&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Riverside&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Higher Education during the Great Recession&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores how U.S. four-year colleges and universities have adapted since 2007, the start of a period of exceptional economic challenges.  Specifically, the project collects and analyzes institutional data on how institutions have responded to declines in educational spending , complemented by survey data with presidents and provosts.  The project also serves a data infrastructure purposes, adding 42 for-profit organizations to two pre-existing databases, reflecting the growing share of higher education enrollments in the for-profit sector.  Previous work by the project team led to the construction of two databases that are widely used by higher education researchers: the Institutional Data Archive on American Higher Education (IDA) and the College Catalog Study (CCS) database.  In the process, the project will examine various organizational changes experienced by this sample of institutions: changes in hierarchies and decision-making structures, curricular and programmatic changes, as well as the priorities and outlooks of the institutional leadership. A central hypothesis is that by academic year 2010-11, interdisciplinary programs were growing most rapidly at financially struggling institutions, as these institutions attempted to consolidate low-enrollment departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Demand for higher education will likely continue to increase in the coming years.  Findings from this project may inform how social scientists and public policy analysts view the (un)intended long-term consequences the recent economic contraction has had for educational institutions and the sector at large.  In particular, findings from this study may help us understand the tension between economic trends and key national policy goals - including research productivity, access and graduation among students from under-represented groups, and human capital development. Moreover, the data infrastructure provided by the IDA and CCS datasets provides wide-ranging, detailed, and well-organized resources for scholars.  The databases are also an ideal source for training graduate students who are interested in organizational and institutional change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was intended to provide information about the consequences of the Great Recession for U.S. higher education.    We produced a new dataset on consequences of the Great Recession coding every article in LexisNexis on a sample of 311 four-year colleges and universities.  We coded 93 variables.  Several of these variables mirrored variables in the federal IPEDS data, but the large majority added information to what we can know from IPEDS.  These new variables included several, for example, on changes in benefit structures, capital projects, and sustainability efforts.  We promised to produce three papers: one analyzying changes in decision-making structures between 2001 and 2012.  We produced this paper, which was published in 2013 by Tertiary Education and Management, a well-respected European journal.  The citation is: Jacob Apkarian, Kerry Mulligan, Matthew B. Rotondi. 2013. "Who Governs? Academic Governance in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 2000-2012. Tertiary Education and Management 20 (2): 151-64.   The paper is based on provosts' identifications of patterns of decision making on 13 common types of academic decisions.  We used matched samples of universities whose provosts responded to the survey in both 2001 and 2012.  The study finds moderately higher levels of managerial control of college and university decision-making and a contrary trend toward more parties being involved in decision making.  We identify four decision making clusters in each period, two of which in each year can be identified as managerially-dominated and high faculty participation clusters.  The identities of the other clusters change over time.   We did not find significant differences by institutional characteristics in cluster location or number of decisions made exclusively by managers.  Based on these data fears about managerial control of higher education institutions do not appear to be warranted.  We also  produced the third of the intended papers.  This paper analyzes both IPEDS data and LexisNexis data to determine consequences of the Great Recession for U.S. higher education institutions.   The paper is entitled "Growing And Greening: The Unexpected Consequences of the Great Recession for U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities."  The authors are Steven Brint, Sarah Yoshikawa, Matthew B. Rotondi, Tiffany Viggiano, and John Maldonado.  The higher education industry press emphasized the highly negative consequences of the Recession, particularly in public universities.  By contrast, IPEDS data showed higher student-faculty ratios, smaller tenure and tenure-track faculties, and greater employment of contingent faculty.  It also shows higher average enrollments, strong growth of international enrollments, higher faculty salaries and higher average operating budgets per student.  The LexisNexis analysis finds that most institutions developed approaches not only to survive but to thrive during the Recession period.  Cluster analysis indicates four approaches: enhancement of customer service, increasing entrepreneurship, revenues for increased sustainability, and what we call "the complete arsenal" (or employment of all major approaches).   Higher status and larger institutions were more likely to employ a larger variety of means.  The paper includes case studies of four representative instiutions.  Higher education is a growth industry.  It is not dependent on a single source of revenue.  While the data clearly indicate higher levels of privatized support for higher education institutions during the period and arguably some decline in quality (judging by student-faculty ratios and the composition of the teaching force), U.S. higher education did not experience levels of hardship that many predicted and certainly we find no basis to expect the fundamental transformation that theorists such as Clayton Christensen have foreseen.  We were unable to produce the second of the intended papers.  The second paper intended to comp...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
