<AbstractNarration>Paleoclimatology is a rapidly evolving field, with a sustained production of records with improved accuracy and chronology. As the number of such records increases, the question of how to interpret them in the presence of a dynamical model has emerged. This work, led by a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, develops an inverse method for assimilating long time series of sea surface temperature and other oceanic properties, such as those generated from the analysis of sediment cores, into three-dimensional models of ocean circulation. The computational challenge posed by data assimilation over geologic time scales will be addressed by relying on a model with simplified dynamics and on a partitioned Kalman filter &amp; smoother. The filter &amp; smoother will be applied to drive the model with a collection of sediment records over the last 20,000 years from the North Atlantic Ocean. The movements of large-scale hydrographic fronts and the attendant circulation changes over this time interval will be estimated in a manner that is consistent with both sediment data and ocean dynamics, thereby allowing various paleoceanographic hypotheses to be tested. By estimating the time-dependent state of the North Atlantic Ocean over the last 20,000 years, the project will provide a perspective on ongoing changes in ocean circulation that are postulated from instrumental records. This project brings together an ocean modeler, a paleoceanographer, and two physical oceanographers to ensure a robust approach to the various aspects of the project. These participants include two collaborators from French institutions. Funding supports a graduate student and a post-doctoral scholar at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A dynamically-consistent estimate of  the time-dependent distribution of sea surface temperature and of its  error in the North Atlantic over the past 15 kyrs has been obtained from  the quantitative combination of sediment SST records and a surface  ocean circulation model.  For the first time, sequential methods of optimal estimation theory  (Kalman filters and related smoother) have been applied to extract  information about past surface ocean conditions from deep-sea sediment  records. The present study provides evidence that these methods have a  great potential in dynamical paleo-oceanographic reconstructions, in  particular through their ability to consider data and modeling errors  and in their ability to provide error bars for paleo-oceanographic  variables.  An inverse model of surface ocean circulation that is suitable to  analyze long paleo-oceanographic records has been developed, and a  compilation of sediment SST records covering the last deglaciation has  been produced. Both products will be made available shortly to the  community and the public through the NCDC of NOAA.  An undergraduate student worked intensively on this project. Her work  is summarized in a 45-page long document and led to the ocean  model eventually applied to address the major objective this project. A  small portion of the resources from this project were also used to  support interactions of the PI with a graduate student engaged in  complementary research: the PI exposed the student to the methods of  data analysis used in this project, and the student provided to the  results of this project a useful perspective regarding the fundamental  limitations in the information content of marine sediment records.  This project involved scientists with different background and  expertise: a paleo-oceanographer (Claire Waelbroeck, at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement, France), two physical  oceanographers (Alain Colin de Verdiere, Laboratoire de Physique des Oceans, France; and Carl Wunsch, Harvard University), and an ocean  modeler (Principal Investigator Olivier Marchal, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution). Naturally, it also engaged PI's colleagues  at WHOI through multiple discussions.  The results from this project were disseminated through (i) two  manuscripts in the peer-reviewed literature (one published and one to be  submitted in July 2015); (ii) three presentations at the annual general  assemblies of the European Geosciences Union, and (iii) three seminars  at US universities and research institution.
