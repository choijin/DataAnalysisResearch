<AbstractNarration>A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Miami University that will provide research training for 12 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012-14. The program focuses on collaborative research emphasizing ecological questions in landscapes influenced by human activity. Students will conduct individual projects with the guidance of faculty mentors and be part of research "clusters" consisting of 3-4 students and mentors. Clusters form collaborative teams focused on themes that tie together their individual research topics. Thus, students will have the opportunity to work in multi-disciplinary research teams, structured similarly to research groups solving real-world problems.  One workshop will be offered in collaboration with the Myaamia Project, a tribal initiative to enhance the understanding of and appreciation for the history, language, and culture of the pre-European people that occupied SW Ohio, which will enable students to explore alternative relationships with the land that result in different approaches to environmental problems.  Another workshop will examine aspects of the scientific profession, including careers in ecology, preparation and delivery of scientific presentations, and responsible conduct in research.  Students will also participate in sessions on scientific and environmental ethics and field trips to sites of local ecological interest.  Finally, each student will present his or her research as an oral presentation, an electronic poster, and a written paper that will be developed into a manuscript for publication. The project will recruit a diverse group of students including underrepresented minorities, first-generation college students, and students from colleges with little research opportunities.  Students are selected based on academic record as well as their interest in and potential for research. Students are tracked to determine their further participation in academic study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool.  Miami has a long and excellent history of involving undergraduates in research and has excellent facilities for executing this REU site, including a diverse array of human-dominated ecosystems (including a nearby field station), and state-of-the-art laboratory facilities.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF REU   Ecology in Human-Dominated Landscapes   (NSF 1156703)  Ann L. Rypstra and David J. Berg, Department of Biology  Miami University, Oxford, Ohio     Project Outcomes  The Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at Miami University helps students become scientists who are also citizens and leaders in the global community.  In our program we (1) build collaborative teams of undergraduate scientists conducting transformative research on landscapes that have been altered by human activity; (2) broaden student perspectives about how humans interact with nature so that they understand what ecologists and environmental scientists must do in the 21st century to become ecoliterate citizens and leaders in an ever-changing global society; and (3) provide opportunities to an ethnically and economically diverse group of students from institutions where the possibilities for scientific research are limited.     Intellectual Merit:  Thirty-seven projects were completed by student participants during the funding period from 2012 through 2014.  Each project examined the manner in which human alterations to the Midwestern landscape have impacted ecological processes.   For example, 15 projects focused on the impact of pollutants in aquatic environments, 10 projects attempted to understand how modern agriculture has affected the behavior and diversity of insects and spiders, 6 projects delved into the stressors that affect the success of vertebrate populations, 3 looked at the biology of invasive species, and 2 dealt with the genetics of plants important to humans.  An additional project, funded by a supplement to this grant, enabled three Iraqi students to collaborate with our US participants in a study of the diversity of aquatic organisms in the Tigris River.   The results of eleven of these projects were shared with the scientific community at professional meetings.  A total of 10 peer reviewed publications were produced from our REU program during the grant period in question.      Broader Impacts:  While the research project is the centerpiece of the program, students participated in a variety of enrichment activities that served to broaden their perspective on the world.   We started the summer with a workshop led by members of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma entitled "a People and their Homeland." This workshop was meant to help the REU participants understand an alternative relationship that humans have with the landscape of this region and to expose them to ways of knowing and a sense of place that is more intuitive and emotional than is typical of modern science.   The workshop was followed with discussion sessions in which we explored ethical issues faced by environmental scientists.  On surveys the students responded very positively to these activities (mean = 4.5/5.0).  To help participants understand more about what ecologists do, we have a seminar course that meets weekly.  This course was designed specifically for the REU participants to provide a formal context in which to explore the scientific process.  We added to their understanding of science by bringing in guest speakers, and taking the students on a variety of field trips throughout the summer.  Students reacted very positively to all of these activities (mean scores 4.3/5); they commented that our program was "well-designed" and helped them "grow as scientists and citizens."     In the three years of this grant, we averaged 114 applicants per year who boasted a mean grade point average of 3.4 (on a 4-point scale).  Twenty-five percent of these applicants self -identified as minority and 26% were first generation college students.  In addition, more than 65% of applicants were from institutions where they would have limited access to research opportunities.  From this applicant pool, we recruited 36 exceptional participants. Sixty-nine percent came from schools where research options are limited.  Sixty-seven percent were members of minority groups and 36% were first-generation college students.   Thus, we provided an intensive scientific experience to a significant number of students from groups that have not typically been engaged in research in the environmental sciences. Notably, all of the students went on to complete their undergraduate program and 64% are in graduate school or working in science.      Supplement:  In 2014 we entered into a collaboration with a faculty member from the American University of Iraq, Sulaimani who received funding from a US AID Program entitled Partnership for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER).  We received a supplement from the NSF that made it possible for us to include three Iraqi students in our summer program.  In spite of considerable turmoil in Iraq, three undergraduate students (2 females, 1 male) came to Miami University for six weeks, interacted with our American REU students, participated in our enrichment activities, and collaborated on an aquatic biodiversity research project.  Notably these students were able to learn cutting edge DNA barcoding techniques, which will ultimately enable them to characterize the largely unknown fauna of the upper Tigris River.
