<AbstractNarration>Larval connectivity, which quantifies the intensity and pathways of connections among populations through the dispersal of larvae, is a critical factor in marine population dynamics and has broad reaching consequences for marine spatial planning and fisheries management. Biophysical models, consisting of ocean circulation models combined with Lagrangian particle tracking, are now widely used to provide insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of larval connectivity that remain unobtainable through empirical approaches. However, many of the biological assumptions used to characterize larval life history in these models are quite general and the impacts of these assumptions have yet to be rigorously tested. The goal of this project is to quantify How important are the details of larval biology in estimates of connectivity and long-term population dynamics? To answer this question, the investigators will study the spatial and temporal impacts of larval biological factors on site-to-site connectivity and long-term population growth using a biophysical model for near shore species in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Four major, larval biological factors will be investigated: (1) temperature effects on larval growth, maturation and mortality, (2) vertical swimming behavior, (3) spatial/temporal variability in larval production, and (4) role of habitat on settlement. Using a biophysical model of the SCB, differences in larval connectivity due to the biological factors will be assessed statistically by comparing connectivity estimates that incorporate the additional biological factors to a baseline of connectivity estimates calculated from passive, neutrally buoyant particles. The investigators will also employ a spatial demographic model, driven by the connectivity estimates, to quantify the influence of biological factors on long-term population dynamics. The project will generate significant insights into the various aspects of larval biology that are critical for determining larval connectivity and for projecting population dynamics into the future. The results of this project will improve the credible application of biophysical modeling approaches to scientific studies of coastal species as well as to marine spatial planning and fisheries management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will contribute greatly to our scientific understanding of the role of circulation in dynamics of marine organisms and population connectivity. As importantly, the results will have direct management applications. Siegel and Kendall have both been involved in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary's and the State of California's processes to designate marine protected areas (MPAs) and this study is expected to contribute as the State's Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) process moves into its monitoring and evaluation phase in the Southern California Bight. The PIs have extensive experience involving undergraduate and graduate students in research and ~20 students a year from diverse backgrounds participate in research in their labs. This project will also maintain diversity in the sciences by supporting the research of one female PI with no prior NSF support (Simons) and a female graduate student.  The investigators will continue weekly group meetings in spatial marine ecology at UCSB that have become a nexus of activity for graduate students, postdocs and faculty. In addition, the connectivity estimates produced for the SCB from this project will be made freely available to all interested investigators via the SBC LTER information management system (http://sbc.lternet.edu/data). There is a great need for these connectivity estimates by both academics and resource managers throughout the SCB. This collaboration with SBC LTER will also expand the types of analyses they can conduct and provide added value to both the present project and the SBC LTER.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many marine invertebrates and fish begin life in a planktonic larval stage than can range from days to months.  The transport patterns of these early life larvae in the ocean is a critical part of the organismsÆ lifecycle as the larvae can be moved by the oceanÆs currents 10s to 100s of kilometers from one habitat to another.  The goal of our project is to provide a better understanding of the transport of marine larvae between habitats in the coastal ocean.  Our study area is the Southern California Bight (SCB), which is located off the coast of southern California.  For this project, we used complex computer models of ocean currents in the SCB to predict transport patterns of marine larvae.  There were three main areas of research in this project.  The first area of research was an investigation of how sensitive the modeling results were to settings required for the computer models related to the life history of the larvae.  These settings included the ocean depth where the larvae are first released, the number of larvae to release, and the length of time the larvae can be transported in the ocean.  We developed guidelines on how to select model settings to produce the most accurate results.  These guidelines are available to other scientists who run similar computer models and have been used for ocean models in different regions around the world.  The second area of research was the development of a data set for the scientific community that provided travel times for larvae between coastal habitats throughout the coastline of the SCB, which is 700 kilometers.  This data set divided the coastline of the SCB into 135 patches and provided transport times between these patches for twelve modeled years.  The third area of research used modeling to understand why high numbers of larval fish were found inside an ocean eddy (~40 km diameter) off the coast of the SCB in one year but not in the next.  An ocean eddy occurs when ocean currents form a closed circular pattern of flow.  We discovered that the three-dimensional flow of the eddy was very different in the two years and that the eddy flow allowed the fish to be retained in the eddy one year but not the other.  The results of this work is important to a wide range of disciplines including environmental protection, management of exploited stocks, invasive species control, and the planning and design of marine protected areas.
