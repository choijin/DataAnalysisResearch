<AbstractNarration>The project is designed to develop a training program for the growing field of electronic data application in the U.S. beef industry. Colby Community College, located in Northwest Kansas, is at the center of this large industry. The project is the first of its kind, attracting more students to this rural community. Graduates of the program are certified as Feed Efficiency Data technicians. Specifically, students are trained on how to use and maintain the GrowSafe® Feed Intake and Behavior Monitoring Systems (GrowSafe Systems Ltd.). These systems measure efficiency based on how well cattle convert feed to pounds of gain through digital monitoring. Beyond the training component, students understand the basic principles of research. Students are involved in conducting studies that demonstrate intake, behavior, and genetic parameters in cattle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The global impacts of increased population and energy demand have forced livestock producers to become more efficient. The project offers valuable applied research for producers to help improve efficiency of their operations. More importantly, students understand the impact of genetic selection on efficiency. This unique opportunity will help them, as future technicians or beef producers. There is a wide range of employment opportunities for graduates. The GrowSafe® Company is growing, with systems in both research and production settings around the world. The project introduces students to applied research, allows them interaction with industry personnel, and helps them graduate with skills unique and valuable to the beef industry as a whole.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Cattle Feed Efficiency Data Technician Program was originally designed to be a standalone program with two key objectives in mind. Train students on the latest in feed efficiency monitoring for cattle, and introduce them to the basics of research in animal agriculture.  As the project proceeded, it became clear that all students in the Farm and Ranch Management programs should benefit from the technology. Therefore, the use of the technology was incorporated into current curriculums.  A full separate program was not developed.  Three research studies were conducted in the two year time frame of the project.  Students were trained on the technology while conducting research. From general operation to basic repairs, students were exposed to the whole function of the technology.  Data generated from the system was also discussed in cattle management and nutrition courses within the Farm and Ranch Management programs. From this, students gained an appreciation for differences in genetics and how they can impact production and economic systems in the beef industry.  Colby Community College also educated local cattle producers about the importance of selecting cattle that were more efficient at converting feed to gain.  Students presented results from their studies to cattle producers at local and region events. The information this technology provides allows cattle producers to select for more efficient cattle. Genetic selection for efficiency in cattle could have dramatic impacts on the environment. Efficient cattle require fewer inputs and as a result have fewer outputs.  Fewer inputs mean less competition for grains with humans. Fewer outputs imply less effect on the environment.  This National Science Foundation project provided valuable information to students and cattle producers from the region that was not readily available.  Additionally, information gained in one study, if repeated, could provide beneficial information on a national level. Though specifics of the project changed over time, the initial outcome objectives of training and research did not. The technology provided through the Advanced Technology Education funding will continue to educate students long after the project has concluded.
