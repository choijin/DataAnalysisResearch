<AbstractNarration>This proposal leverages prior NSF funded work that resulted in the patent of a self-powered piezo-floating-gate (PFG) wireless sensor. The sensor is ultra low power and capable of storing strain data, making it highly suitable for embedding in safety-critical physical structures and infrastructure for structural health monitoring via wireless RFID readers over the lifetime of the structure. The proposed effort will address the technological gaps necessary to lead to a robust prototype and subsequent manufacture and commercialization, namely development of all supporting sensing circuitry and wireless interface circuitry and software, demonstrating remote configuration and interrogation of the PFG wireless sensor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PFG wireless sensor when incorporated into a prototype system via the proposed work, has the potential to have significant impact in the health monitoring and fault diagnosis of large classes of systems for which such monitoring systems must be autonomous, self-contained, generate their own power and be zero-maintenance. As a result such sectors as civil infrastructure, biomedical devices and systems, individual and civil transportation, and energy represent potential markets. Adoption of such embedded sensor elements in the safety critical systems used in these sectors can ultimately result in fewer injuries and fatalities arising from unexpected system failures.</AbstractNarration>
