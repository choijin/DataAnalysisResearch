<AbstractNarration>This is a three-year project to carry out a data analysis and modeling study of the electromagnetic coupling between the Earth?s magnetosphere and the ionosphere-thermosphere system of its extended atmosphere.  The mid-latitude ionosphere is a complicated overlap region of processes initiated at high and low latitudes, with each playing a dominant role in the electrodynamics at different times depending on the current level of geomagnetic activity, as well as the pre-conditioning of the system. The overarching goal of this effort is to advance understanding of the physics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling in this region by addressing a number of specific outstanding science questions: 1) how ionospheric conductance and neutral winds affect ring current dynamics and penetration electric fields, 2) how ionospheric conductance and neutral winds impact current closure between the ring current and the ionosphere that drive sub-auroral plasma flows, and 3) mechanisms of corotation lag in the plasmasphere.  A framework of models that self-consistently couples the ionosphere-thermosphere with the inner magnetosphere and ring current will be utilized.  This capability was recently developed by the proposing team.  It will be complemented through this effort by a component that allows for direct comparisons with a large, diverse set of ground-based and satellite measurements, including observations from the newly established mid-latitude radar stations of the SuperDARN network and the newly available global observations of near-Earth magnetic field variations provided by the AMPERE project.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will foster extended collaborations between the proposing team of modelers and the many NSF supported community facilities providing the multitude of observational data that will be utilized for this study.   This will help demonstrate the versatility of these measurements</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An impact of active ionospheric conductivity and thermospheric wind on electric fields and currents in the near-Earth magnetosphere was investigated in this project.  Intellectual merit:  Simulations from a ring current model including the coupling to active ionosphere and thermosphere show that the response of the inner magnetospheric electric field to magnetic storms is modified when the ionosphere and thermosphere had been activated due to previous geomagnetic activity. Sub-Auroral Polarization Stream (SAPS), an enhancement of the magnetospheric/ionospheric electric field in the subauroral region from dusk to midnight local time sector during magnetic storms is found to extend to lower latitude within the plasmasphere. The currently suggested mechanism of SAPS requires the low conductivity within the SAPS to enhance the electric field, while the ionospheric conductivity is higher within the plasmasphere. This SAPS extension is explained by the midlatitude flywheel effect, in which neutral particles accelerate plasma (ionized particles) to generate the extended electric field because the neutral particles have a bigger inertia.      Broader impacts:  The development of the capability to calculate three dimensional ionospheric currents and associated geomagnetic perturbations will contribute to the development of the diagnostic capabilities of the community models TIEGCM (http://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/tgcm/) and WACCM (http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/WACCM/). The development of a new ionosphere plasmasphere electrodynamics (IPE) model will contribute to the development of the coupled WAM-IPE model, which is planed to be transitioned to an operation in the near future at NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (http://cog-esgf.esrl.noaa.gov/projects/couplednems/wam-ipe).
