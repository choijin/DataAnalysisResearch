<AbstractNarration>The project is developing and testing a model for improving the preparation of undergraduate pre-service teachers who will go on to teach earth science in grades K-8.  Prior semester-length courses in physical geology and educational science methods are being combined into a year-long course taught by both Geology and Education faculty. The course integrates learning of earth-science content with the methodology of how to teach it, producing a next generation of K-8 science educators who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic. In conjunction with revised classes and laboratory experiences, pre-service teachers are developing shared digital portfolios of teaching resources. An additional effort is testing the impact of a preparatory, four-day intensive field experience on learning by pre-service teachers who enroll in the year-long course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through explicit integration of content and pedagogy, the project is directly addressing the lack of preparation in physical science and learning about the nature of science among many pre-service elementary and middle-school teachers. Beyond contributing to the future teacher workforce in the region, the project is also disseminating the model of a collaborative, integrated science/education course to a national audience through web resources and conference workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Science education at the K-8 level has been recognized as a national concern.  Almost all K-8 teachers are required to teach science as part of their instructional duties to their students.  Many to most lack the requisite background in science to adequately teach science topics and/or many have a fear of science.   Compounding the problem is the fact that, at the college level, education departments and science departments do not intentionally interact to educate K-8 pre-service teachers.  In fact, most science departments and education departments do not interact at all.  St. Norbert College (SNC) is a small liberal arts college located in the Green Bay, WI metropolitan area that is addressing this problem.  Four years ago, in an effort to improve instruction to K-8 education majors, a 4-credit introductory geology course and a 4-credit science methods course were combined into a single, required, 8-credit, year-long course, including a three-day, pre-course geology field. The proposition was that the content specialist (geology) would teach a topic and the pedagogy specialist (education) would teach the students how to teach what they had just learned. The overall goal of the project was to instill targeted competence and a passion for science in the pre-service teachers, and to get the education department and the science department cooperatively engaged in this endeavor.  The process of integrating courses and faculty from two separate departments was not trivial.  The following are some of the lessons learned over the last four years. It is important to have the strong commitment of at least one person from each department to lead the innovation.  A common language between geology and education is critical in order to develop shared goals and objectives for the new course. We used the Next Generation Science Standards.  It is imperative to have the overall support from each department and support from the respective divisions/colleges involved.  Continuity of the course should be systemic and not dependent upon individual faculty.  There are a remarkable number of administrative obstacles, many hidden, to overcome throughout the process including; registrar issues, scheduling within and between departments, approval of the new course by multiple committees, compatibility of the new course with the core curriculum, workload distribution, and budgeting.  We were able to successfully and systematically navigate these obstacles in order to integrate the respective departments and establish a combined course that met our goals and objectives.   Assessment of the new course is critical and continuous. Our new year-long paradigm has been implemented and assessed for four years, with approximately 70 students participating in the process.  Preliminary assessment suggests that participants have a better understanding of science and relate to the themes of and nature of science at a higher level than our control group.  The knowledge, skills, and dispositions of the students also seem to be higher than our control group.  Assessment is on-going and we continue to use assessment results to further refine the educational experience for our students.   An important component of our project is disseminating it to the wider community and establishing a framework for replicability.  To that end on the national level, we have published a paper in the Journal of College Science Teaching outlining the project and the initial outcomes of the project; have a paper in preparation outlining the pathway for integration of courses and departments; have presented our in-progress work at seven national meetings; have hosted a national workshop; and have an active website with resources for K-8 educators and pre-service K-8 educators.  At our institution, we have formally proposed adding physics as another pathway for K-8 education students to obtain the requisite course work/background in science methods and science.  The same model of a year-long integrated course for mathematics is in discussion.   In sum, seventy of our students have participated in this new delivery system for future K-8 teachers.  Most of these students have or will go on to become K-8 teachers.  Preliminary assessment data indicates that our new combined course is a better paradigm than two separate independent courses, i.e. the old format.  Significantly, students are better able to understand and relate to science and hence pass that "enthusiasm" for science to their students.  That is the ultimate significance of our project.  It is the ripple effect from us, to our students, to their future K-8 students.   The sum total significance will be hard to measure, but it will be exponential.  Finally, we would not have been able undertake this project without the support of the NSF.          Last Modified: 10/24/2016       Submitted by: Timothy P Flood]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
