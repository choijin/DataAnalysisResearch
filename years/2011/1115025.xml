<AbstractNarration>Water is an essential building block of the Earth system and critical to human prosperity.  At the same time, humans are rapidly embedding themselves into the basic character of the water cycle without full knowledge of the consequences.  Major sources of water system change include mismanagement and overuse, river flow distortion, pollution, watershed disturbance, invasive species, and greenhouse warming.  Defining the collective significance of such change constitutes a major challenge for the Earth and social sciences alike.  This project will advance current understanding of the ways in which humans control, degrade or enhance water-related ecosystem services, and in turn impact the global economic system and aquatic biodiversity.  These goals will be addressed through an integrated, interdisciplinary study of human-water interactions that includes modeling, data integration, and assessment tools as well as synthesis across water resource management, biology, and environmental economics perspectives.  Model projections will be used to extend recent trends into the future, and assess the degree to which alternative management strategies can lead to more sustainable futures over a 100-year time horizon.  The interdisciplinary aspects of the many forces shaping modern river systems provide a rich intellectual environment for collaboration, and lessons learned through this project's cross-disciplinary approaches constitute an important byproduct of the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the central role of water in our environment and human well-being, results from this project will have immediate value to efforts to manage freshwater resources.  Beyond its scientific value, a synthetic understanding of the state of the rivers systems--the single largest renewable water supply serving humankind--is of strategic importance to the public policy sector, given a growing sense of urgency regarding water as an international security issue.  The benefits of such synthesis will inform global social and environmental management challenges: coping with climate extremes; preserving ecosystem services and biodiversity; food and energy security; economic competitiveness; and, protecting human health.  This project will have lasting benefits by targeting policy-relevant science, educating the next generation of students in strategic resource assessment, and informing the citizenry about major environmental challenges and solutions for the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Human activities have redefined the state of rivers and drainage basins that supply the bulk of renewable fresh water to society. Chief among these activities are widespread land use change, urbanization, industrialization, and pollution. An increasingly human-controlled water cycle based on traditional engineering infrastructure, such as dams and irrigation, has evolved to secure reliable water supplies for human well-being and economic productivity. Although these infrastructure investments can be effective tools to secure needed water resources, substituting engineered fixes in lieu of preserving natural freshwater ecosystem services, such as water purification and flood prevention, can be enormously expensive and wastes the economic benefits of services provided by wetlands, forests, mangroves, and other ecosystems. Furthermore, freshwater ecosystems are a critical biodiversity hotspot; occupying less than 1% of the Earth's surface, they provide habitat to more than 125,000 catalogued species and 1/3 of all vertebrates and affiliated taxa. The intimate connection and importance of rivers, lakes and wetlands to human society, coupled with their mismanagement, results in the highest potential loss of species on the planet, by some estimates 10,000-20,000 to date.  Human-derived water security threats are anticipated to intensify over the 21st century, impacting freshwater ecosystems that support both humans and biodiversity, increasing the costs for their remediation, and limiting and shifting the geography of key economic sector outputs. As part of the intellectual merit of the project, we developed multiple models and datasets to (i) predict the state of future water security and river threats through the 21st century; (ii) map the state of freshwater ecosystem services supporting humans and biodiversity; and, (iii) assess how the condition of freshwater ecosystem services influences the world economy across individual sectors (food, energy, domestic water supply, fisheries), and global trade. Some of the key outcomes and findings of this work include:  Key Outcome 1: This project developed a compendium of spatially explicit maps of future water security threats to humans and biodiversity, based on quantitative projections of environmental and socioeconomic scenarios. Results from these maps show threats intensifying throughout the 21st century in regions already experiencing elevated threat levels and in those areas hosting a rising middle class.  Key Outcome 2: A new global scale water indicator, the freshwater provisioning index for humans (FPIh), was developed to map the capacity of freshwater ecosystem services to provide water to downstream human populations. This index combined with maps of water security threats shows nearly the entire world is served by water source areas under moderate to high threat, with ~82% of population relying on water sources exposed to high levels of threat.  Key Outcome 3: This project created the first global geography of future deployments of traditional engineering to mitigate water-related threat and the contributions of natural capital as freshwater ecosystem services to meet water needs. It is estimated that by 2050 annual investments in traditional water engineering will require a tripling of 2005 expenditures to $1.5 trillion, with one-third representing costs to recoup lost ecosystem services.  Key Outcome 4: This project produced an unprecedented synthesis of species distribution maps for freshwater-dependent vertebrates.  When intersected with project maps of river ecosystem stress, these maps suggest a high level of imperilment of freshwater biodiversity.  Subsequently, current and proposed hydropower dams were mapped in the three mega-diverse basins (Amazon, Congo, Mekong), demonstrating that biodiversity impacts can be minimized using existing data in new ways.  Key Outcome 5: The global distribution and nutritional value of inland fisheries was mapped, with the resulting anaylsis providing little evidence that fish richness boosts catches, but affirming the enormous impact that intensive fisheries can have on biodiversity. Moreover, this work showed that inland fisheries are an irreplaceable source of protein for 158 million poor people worldwide.   Key Outcome 6: If water quality continues to diminish, the already high global costs of treatment before use are likely to increase steeply from this point forward. This is due to both growing demand for water for consumption and production and the need for more intensive treatment technologies as quality declines.    Key Outcome 7: The loss of animal protein from fish in the diet will be costly if it needs to be replaced by protein from raising livestock. This is a timely concern because plans to bring electrification to many parts of the developing world via large dams puts freshwater fish at great risk. Considering both high reliance on freshwater fish in the current diet and prospect for more dams, Southeast Asia is especially at risk.  Beyond the results described above, results have been published in over 25 articles in peer-reviewed journals, 3 book chapters on websites and presentations at multiple scientific conferences thought the world. This work also supported the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers that participated in project research activities.
