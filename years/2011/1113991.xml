<AbstractNarration>Calls for preserving cultural and biological diversity regularly appear in the news.  The preservation of diversity is not just a subject of study by ecologists, anthropologists, conservationists, and land managers; it is an explicit goal of social movements and governmental policies.  This research project will examine how social and ecological diversity interact to influence the resilience of societies facing major changes in their social or environmental circumstances.  The goal of the investigators conducting this project is to discover configurations of diversity in ecological landscapes and in forms of social organization that make systems more or less able to cope with significant  environmental or social changes without undergoing an unpleasant transformation.  The researchers will focus on a few important variables indicating both social diversity (integration, conformity, and hierarchy) and ecological diversity (diversity of plant and animal species and of patches on the landscape).  To understand the relationships of interest, they will develop mathematical models of the interactions of key variables and conduct extensive quantitative analysis of data from empirical studies of millennium-long societal trajectories.  They will examine five archaeological cases from the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico as long-term "experiments" to see how diversity in the social and ecological realms affected these societies' abilities to thrive or forced them into dramatic transformations when faced with different environmental or social stimuli.  The outcomes of these analyses will provide the basis for dynamic modeling designed to investigate the broad range of conditions in which these domains of diversity contribute to varying responses to change across different time scales.  Model analyses conducted using dynamical systems and numerical techniques will begin with simple social situations coupled with simple landscapes followed by step-wise modifications designed to "complexify" both social and ecological modeled landscapes.  The project will move iteratively between archaeological analysis and mathematical modeling.  Patterns observed in the empirical studies will inform the modeling, which will examine those relationships more abstractly.  The effects predicted by the modeling then will be explored with respect to the empirical details of the case studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insights about diversity in contemporary research on interacting social and ecological systems have overwhelmingly relied upon studies and observations over short time spans.  This project's emphasis on case-specific, comparative analysis of long-term, regional-scale archaeological sequences in the Americas will yield new perspectives regarding important episodes in human history.  This project will demonstrate the value of integrating insights from ecology and archaeology, the importance of balancing concerns for social and ecological processes, and the ability of archaeology to contribute to understanding the role of diversity in the resilience of social-ecological systems.  As societies cope with inevitable change, their actions generate vulnerabilities.  Lack of awareness of these dynamics can contribute to the need for costly transformations.  When made more aware of the complex dynamics of change as they have functioned in the past, people can better weigh the implications of their decisions and build resilience to such vulnerabilities.  This project will demonstrate how interactions associated with social and ecological diversity can inform contemporary policies dealing with sustainability, robustness, vulnerability, and transformative change.  This project also will enhance education from pre-collegiate through graduate levels as students and teachers integrate knowledge derived from both the social and natural sciences and benefit from primary datasets of richly documented social and ecological analyses of diversity.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Calls for preserving cultural and biological diversity appear almost daily in the news.  The preservation of diversity is not just a subject of study by ecologists, anthropologists, conservationists, and land managers, it is an explicit goal of social movements and governmental policies. This research examined how social and ecological diversity interacted to influence the resilience of prehispanic societies facing major changes in their social or environmental circumstances. The goal of this project was to discover configurations of diversity in ecological landscapes and in forms of social organization that make systems more or less able to cope with significant  environmental or social changes without undergoing an unpleasant transformation.    Toward this end we studied five prehispanic regions in the Northern Mexico and the US Southwest using the tools of archaeology and ecology.  We examined how spatial variability of precipitation would have affected the success of prehispanic agriculture and whether these varying precipitation patterns were linked to established prehispanic social networks. For instance, we tested whether prehispanic farmers set up social networks to offset food shortages in time of crisis (or, low precipitation) with other farmers whose food production was simultaneously high. In addition, we built models of agri-shed dynamics (the watershed of agricultural land areas) that show how combining  rainfall patterns with topography can generate correlation patterns in maize production that enable settlements to reduce food shortfall through sharing/exchange. We found that people preferentially interacted with distant communities when they were faced with challenging spatial and temporal patterns of maize production.     The social networks were, in part, facilitated through long-distance exchange that both takes advantage of and introduces social diversity.  This social diversity is not necessarily good nor bad.  It affects people and their social relations in various ways.  Long-term social stability is associated with flexibility, including the ability or willingness to cope with both socially diverse and socially homogeneous situations.     This work demonstrates the value of integrating insights from ecology and archaeology, the importance of balancing concerns for social and ecological processes, and the ability of archaeology to contribute to understanding the role of diversity in the resilience of social-ecological systems.      Beyond the specific analyses conducted by our team, our work contributed substantially to the development, under another NSF grant, of  SKOPE (Synthesized Knowledge of Past Environments).  This is a publically-accessible web-based tool (http://demo.envirecon.org/browse/) that provides high resolution paleoclimatic reconstructions for the last 2000 years for four southwestern states (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah), expanding access to environmental data over long time spans.   Our research has also been the foundation for several educational tools, including games and curricula for 4th grade, high school, and college, that challenge students to explore risks and trade-offs made by prehispanic groups in their irrigation practices, cooperation with others, and trade networks.
