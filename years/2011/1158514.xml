<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Turbulent convection plays a major role in numerous geophysical, astrophysical, and industrial processes, and yet its understanding remains incomplete. The proposed work will primarily extend its investigation to fluids with Prandtl numbers Pr [(kinematic viscosity)/(thermal diffusivity)] in the range from 0.17 to 1.0 which remains relatively unexplored and which is accessible in gases and gas mixtures. This range includes the Prandtl number of 0.7 relevant to Earth's atmosphere. Investigations will be extended to samples of large aspect ratio (diameter/height) up to 20 and to exceptionally large Rayleigh numbers Ra (Ra is a dimensionless measure of the applied temperature difference) up to 10^15. The effect of rotation about a vertical axis, which introduces the Coriolis force and modifies the behavior of the system, will be studied (rotation is relevant for instance to the formation of hurricanes in Earth's atmosphere). These experiments require the construction of complex apparatus and the automatic computer control of numerous intricate processes. Thus they are an exceptionally good training ground for our young coworkers.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;****Non-technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Turbulent convection in a fluid heated from below is of utmost importance in many natural phenomena and in industry. It occurs in Earth's mantle where it contributes to the motion of continental plates and influences vulcanism. In the outer core of the Earth it determines the magnetic field in which we live. It is the important heat-transport mechanism in the outer layer of the Sun and thus impacts the temperature of our environment. It plays a significant role in many industrial processes, where its enhancement or inhibition may have significant economic consequences. These applications range from miniature heat-transport devices in computer applications to the giant cooling systems of power plants. And yet much remains unknown to the scientist and engineer about these processes. The proposed work will extend our understanding of turbulent convection to fluids with properties similar to the Earth's atmosphere; this property range has remained relatively unexplored in the laboratory. The work will also be extended to samples that are rotated about their vertical axis. The rotation will exert a force on the fluid known as the Coriolis force and thus will change the behavior of the system in a manner related to how Earth's rotation modifies the nature of hurricanes and ocean currents. These experiments require the construction of complex apparatus and the automatic computer-control of numerous intricate processes. Thus they are an exceptionally good training ground for our young coworkers, many of whom will evolve into the leaders of the next generation of scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Turbulence in a fluid heated from below is of great importance in many industrial processes as well as for the understading of astro- and geo-physical systems such as the outer core of the Earth and the outer layer of the Sun. Our studies were aimed at developing a deeper understanding of this process.  We made quantitative measurements of temperature fluctuations in a turbulent fluid heated from below. These results are important for the development of a theory that describes this process.   We measured time-averaged temperatures in a turbulent fluid heated from below and discovered that this temperature dependa logarithmically on the distance from the heated plate. This finding is analogous to the famous Law of the Wall for turbulent shear flow first enunciated by Prandtl and von Karman about 90 years ago.   We obtained quantitative information under highly controlled laboratory conditions aout the efficiency of heat transport by boiling in a turbulent fluid heated from below. This information is needed to design a variety of industrial systems involving cooling by boiling liquids. It is also of fundamental interest for the understanding of the physics of boiling by heterogeneous nucleation.  We studied the influence of rotation about a vertical axis on the heat transport, temperature profile, and temperature fluctuations of a turbulent fluid heated from below. Rotation has a major effect on turbulent convection in many geo- and astro-physical systems. For instance, we found that modest rotation increases and stronger rotation decreases the heat transport, and we were able to offer reasonable theoretical explanations of these findings.
