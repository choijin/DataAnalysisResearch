<AbstractNarration>Deep observational surveys at several wavelengths have shown that the early universe was a very different place than what we experience today.  Space was crowded with newly-formed galaxies, those galaxies were forming stars at a prodigious rate - sometimes throughout the galaxy at once, and central black holes were rapidly consuming gas and stars in the innermost regions.  Active sites were heavily enshrouded by dust, so today radiation is most easily detected in the far-infrared and sub-mm spectral regions, especially for objects at high redshift.  The sub-mm grating spectrometer ZEUS-2, constructed by a team led by Dr. G. Stacey at Cornell University, is especially well-suited to studying these active regions of distant galaxies.  It offers very high sensitivity, multi-object capability, and spectral resolution high enough to evaluate the conditions in the star-forming regions through the emission lines that are produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Stacey now intends to complete ZEUS-2 with a second Transition Edge Sensor (TES) detector array for the region 215/645 microns, as well as associated optics and electronics to operate this channel.  The new capability opens spectral windows from 200 to 850 microns and samples several important lines of [N II], CO, and [CI], which are diagnostic of the physical conditions (temperature, density, etc.) in the emitting gas.  Because the instrument is already fully functional in its single-array mode, the skills of Stacey's technical team are proven, and the goal of a two-detector system is relatively straightforward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TES arrays are cutting edge technology requiring the integration of key elements from industry, national centers, and academia.  Indeed, the ZEUS instrument as a whole provides a fertile environment for the training of young scientists and students in state-of-the-art electronics and instrumentation, and undergraduate students will carry out several of the key aspects of the upgrade project.  Funding for this work is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF funding for this investigation enabled our team at Cornell University to build and use critical components for our uniquely sensitive spectrometer, ZEUS-2.  ZEUS-2 is a grating spectrometer for use in the submillimeter windows at 200 to 600 um that open in the atmosphere at the highest and driest sites(Figure 1) .  The grating spectrometer enables detection of spectral lines from galaxies in the early Universe.  The lines of interest arise from ionized oxygen ([OIII]), nitrogen ([NII]), and carbon ([CII]) emitted from galaxies at rest wavelengths of 88 um ([OIII]], 122 and 205 um ([NII]) and 158 um ([CII]) that is redshifted into the submillimeter windows by the expansion of the Universe.  We have detected lines at redshifts between 1 and 4.3 with ZEUS-2 and its antecedent, ZEUS, so that our program looks back in time 7.7 to 12.2 billion years to within 1.5 billion years of the Big Bang. This is the epoch during which the star formation rate of the Universe peaked at values 30 times the current rate, the epoch during which most of the stars that have ever existed formed, and the epoch during which our own galaxy, the Milky Way formed.  ZEUS-2 is uniquely sensitive since the optical design of the grating system was optimized for the detection of these lines, and ZEUS-2 employs state-of-the-art bolometers that directly detect the energy of submillimeter photons (Figure 2).  Both ZEUS and ZEUS-2 were designed, constructed, tested and used entirely by our research team here at Cornell (Figure 3).  The research efforts described here extend a line of NSF funded research begun in 2006, and encompass construction and upgrades to both spectrometers and their use on the 10.4 m diameter CSO telescope on Mauna Kea (4100 meters elevation) and on the 12 m diameter APEX telescope (5100 meters elevation) on the Atacama Plateau in northern Chile (Figure 4).  Science highlights include: (1) the first detection of the 13CO(6-5) line from a galaxy other than our own.  We detected it from the nearby "starbursting" galaxy NGC 253.  Our measurements suggest that the starburst is disrupting the molecular gas from which the stars formed so much that the clouds can no longer form stars.  The next generation of star formations is therefore quenched;  (2)  the first detections and surveys of the [CII] line from galaxies in the epoch of peak star formation.  We showed that unlike the local Universe, where the most luminous star forming galaxies are created by the collisions and mergers of two Milky Way-sized galaxies, the most luminous star forming galaxies in the distant past were likely created by the accretion of gas that infalls from the intergalactic "cosmic web" onto proto-galaxies creating enormously massive molecular disks.  These disks produce stars at rates hundreds, and even thousands of times  faster than in the Milky Way galaxy; (3) the first detections of the [OIII] 88 um and [NII] 122 um lines from galaxies at high redshift.  These lines measure the age of the most recent star formation events in galaxies.  Our new survey of these lines suggests that the highest luminosity systems at early times have stellar populations that are only 3 million years old (Figure 5).  This means that the very high rates of star formation we find are nearly continual, perhaps lasting billions of years.  The specific work done during the current award was to complete ZEUS-2 by designing, procuring, and installing at 215/630 um superconducting transition-edge sensed (TES) array that extends the utility of ZEUS-2 from the 350/450 um windows to include the 200, 230, and 645 um windows in the atmosphere (Figure 6).  This enables us to widen the temporal scope of our science to look-back times of 3 to 12.8 billion years.  The award also enabled us to improve the sensitivity and reliability of ZEUS-2 on the sky through extensive laboratory tests and observations using the APEX telescope in Chile.
