<AbstractNarration>The proposal concerns some aspects on the interactions among the spectrum, topology and geometry of Riemannian manifolds. One of them is the behavior of eigenfunctions, both on compact and non-compact manifolds. It aims to gain a better understanding of the structure of spectrum on complete manifolds. The study will also lead to sharp estimates of the higher eigenvalues. Another aspect is on the size of the bottom spectrum of complete manifolds. The issues to be addressed include finding an optimal upper bound in terms of the curvature lower bounds and uncovering the effect on the geometry and topology when such an upper bound is attained. Particular emphasis is on complete resolution of some of the remaining open problems from the recent studies in this direction. The principal investigator also proposes to develop a corresponding theory for the Hodge Laplacian on complete manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spectrum or the vibrating frequencies of an geometric object is closely related to its shape and structure. The proposal is to study some aspects of this relation via new mathematical formulations and approaches. Of particular interest here is to determine the size and structure of the spectrum via curvature, a quantity that can be measured locally and describes how curved the geometric object is. Successful completion of the project will provide deeper insight into this important relation. It will also have interesting applications in both physics theory and other sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since its introduction in early eighties by Hamilton, the Ricci flows have developed into a very powerful theory. Among many other things, it has led to the succcessful resolution of the Poincar\'e and geometrization conjecture for three manifolds by Perelman. It has also been used by Brendle and Schoen to classify manifolds with pointwise quarter pinched curvature. In the last several years, we have been studying gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with an emphasis on the four dimensional ones and made good progress. Arising from the singularity models, Ricci solitons play an important role in the singularity analysis of the Ricci flows. As natural generalization of the Einstein manifolds, they are certainly of their own interest as well. They also serve as model spaces of metric measure spaces with Ricci curvature bounded from below.  Our work suggests that a classification is within reach, at least for the four dimensional, complete, noncompact ones. The main findings include  1) For a four dimensional gradient shrinking Ricci soliton, its curvature is controlled by the scalar curavture alone and becomes asymptotically nonnegative at infinity. Moreover, the manifold must be asymptotically conical if its scalar curvature goes to zero at infinity.  2) A complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton with positive sectional curvature must be compact.   3) A complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton with sufficiently small Ricci curavture at infinity is asymptotically conical.  4) A Kahler gradient Ricci soliton must be connected at infinity. So is a steady gradient Ricci soliton unless it is a Ricci flat cylinder.  Other findings include volume estimates for smooth metric measure spaces in terms of Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature lower bound; a Hessian estimate for the eigenfunctions on a compact manifold in terms of its curvature bound; a sharp gradient estimate for the eigenfunction corresponding to the principal eigenvalue of the p-Laplacian.
