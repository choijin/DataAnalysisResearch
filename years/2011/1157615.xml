<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on two fundamental quantum biological phenomena in nature that are related by similar physical mechanisms involving interaction of light with living systems. The first phenomenon to be examined is animal magnetoreception, the process by which certain animals employ a magnetic compass for navigation.  A specific protein, cryptochrome, is proposed to be responsible for the magnetic sense. This project will determine how cryptochrome can function as a magnetic sensor in the presence of thermal motion. The second phenomenon to be studied is photosynthetic light harvesting, the primary process by which the energy of sunlight is funneled into the life processes of living cells. Again the effect of thermal disorder on light harvesting will be investigated along with the role that quantum coherence plays. Extensive stochastic quantum dynamics calculations will be carried out to account for realistic system-environment interactions during light harvesting. The composition and organization of a complete photosynthetic apparatus, the chromatophore, of so-called purple bacteria, will be determined along with the dynamics of its light-harvesting function, thereby connecting the photosynthetic process across scales from individual pigments to entire cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have two primary beneficial impacts. First, solar energy, received on Earth at a rate of 120,000 TW, far exceeds the current worldwide energy consumption rate of 15 TW. Therefore, solar energy, harvested by biological, artificial, and bio-hybrid systems, constitutes a potential renewable source for mankind's current and foreseeable future energy needs. The project will guide efforts into biomimetic light harvesting materials for more cost-effective solar technology. Second, damage by birds and other wildlife striking aircraft, annually amounts to well over $600 million for US civil and military aviation; over 219 people have been killed worldwide as a result of wildlife strikes since 1988. Determining the mechanisms of animal navigation may reduce the property damage as well as harm to wildlife. Additionally, this project offers a basis for interdisciplinary cooperation between experimental biologists, theoretical physicists, theoretical chemists, and computer scientists, providing an excellent training opportunity for researchers. Lastly, planned activities will complement an existing strong outreach program for bringing science to the public at large. Advanced visualization and analysis tools will be added to the freely available leading molecular visualization and analysis tools developed by the PI and will be  made available to an existing base of 167,000 users.  This project is jointly supported by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division.</AbstractNarration>

Computational approaches, hand-in-hand with experiment, are necessary to learn how these requirements are achieved, as experiment alone cannot resolve the details.     Outcomes  Intellectual merit. Over the last funding period, a comprehensive molecular description of photosynthesis in the purple bacteria chromatophore has been put together (Fig. 1). At the heart of this description is an atomic-level model of an entire Rb. sphaeroides chromatophore, which was completed and simulated over the last funding period to describe the overall energy harvesting process. The construction of the chromatophore model proceeded in tandem with the development of tools for visualizing and modeling such a large system using petascale computer platforms such as Blue Waters. Work on the chromatophore also included key sub-processes, namely energy and charge transfer across the chromatophore membrane and quinol binding to the bc1 complex. A parallel implementation of the so-called Hierarchy Equation of Motion (HEOM) formulation has been developed to examine the roles of coherence and thermal disorder on excitation transfer; the aforementioned formulation has been applied to a wide variety of light harvesting systems.  The photosynthetic systems that were studied involve excitation and electron transfer processes addressed by the PI since four decades, including processes in cyanobacterial and plant photosynthetic proteins. Building on past work, coherent excitation transfer between light harvesting complexes and the effects of thermal noise were studied with stochastic quantum methods. The quinol binding motifs of the bc1 complex and mechanism of quinol oxidation have been described, building on earlier work on the proton transfer in the bc1-complex. The conformational transitions that mediate the recognition of the charge carrier cytochrome c2 and its binding and unbinding to the bc1 complex have been determined (Fig. 2), extending earlier studies on the role of water molecules in binding cytochrome c to RC.  Advances were also made during the last funding period by ab initio quantum chemistry and classical all-atom MD simulations on how the visual system of birds functions as a magnetic compass through electromagnetic and chemical interactions involving the photoreceptor cryptochrome (Fig. 3). Simulations demonstrated the role of electron-hole separation in enhancing photoreceptor signalling and sensitivity to magnetic fields.
