<AbstractNarration>The State University of New York at Stony Brook (SUNY-Stony Brook), lead institution for the SUNY Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (SUNY LSAMP) will leverage existing infrastructure, networks, and lessons learned to build better pathways to increased student preparation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines targeted to historically underrepresented minority populations, especially first generation college students.  Recruitment emphasis will be placed on the community college to 4-year college transition during the project period.  SUNY-LSAMP will also increase the number of LSAMP students prepared for entry into STEM graduate programs and ultimately the STEM workforce, particularly the professoriate.  The alliance will engage in building better STEM pathways by:&lt;br/&gt;--working to support seamless transitions at critical junctures (high school to college, lower division to upper division, 2- year to 4-year, UG to graduate, graduate to professional) with special emphasis on increasing and improving transfers from 2 to 4 -year colleges.&lt;br/&gt;--providing innovative integrated academic and disciplinary socialization experiences for historically underrepresented minority STEM students designed to encourage and then support them in undertaking a STEM undergraduate/graduate course of study.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the project will prepare global scholars by implementing new activities to strengthen the alliance and individual institutions and promote transformative change at the local, state and national level by;&lt;br/&gt;--continuing to increase other sources of financial support for SUNY-LSAMP so that the program can continue after NSF funding ends; and,&lt;br/&gt;--taking a leadership role in key New York State initiatives aimed at reforming UREP STEM curriculum and pedagogy, disseminating best practices in UREP STEM education, improving transfer success and increasing and improving international research opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Leveraging SUNY LSAMP to Build Better STEM Pathways and Prepare Global STEM Scholars     The State University of New York Louis Stokes Alliance for Participation (SUNY LSAMP) consisted of sixteen two and four year institutions across 400 miles of New York State in urban, suburban and rural settings, in the State University of New York (SUNY) System.  In addition, the Alliance partnered with Brookhaven National Lab (BNL); a major federal research lab for research placements and shared STEM educational projects; with SUNY System Administration for broad efforts to increase diversity; with the state funded Science and Technology Entry programs for high school and community college recruitment and shared program operation and SUNY AGEP for preparation for and transition to graduate study.     Building on our successes since 1996, we have leveraged our infrastructure, networks, and lessons learned to build better STEM pathways with emphasis on the community college to four year college transition and prepared global STEM scholars by developing opportunities that have prepared our students for and placed them in international research experiences. SUNY LSAMP provided a comprehensive program of services in all the key areas necessary to help students achieve success so that they completed STEM bachelor?s degrees, went on to STEM graduate study and to the high technology workplace.     Outcomes  Since 1997 in SUNY LAMP, 9514 UREP STEM students have received Bachelors' Degrees, 1106 have received Masters' Degree and 276 have received Doctoral Degrees. SUNY LSAMP students won prestigious fellowships and awards including the NSF Graduate Research Fellowships, are placed in excellent graduate schools, complete STEM graduate degrees and achieve positions in high technology corporations and in government and university settings     SUNY LSAMP has:  Increased the number of underrepresented minority (UREP) STEM bachelors? degrees by 152% from Phase 4 baseline and 395% from project inception  Increased UREP STEM undergraduate enrollment by 72% from the Phase 4 baseline and 640% since project inception Increased 333%  the number SUNY LSAMP Level 1 students engaged in international research and study from the Phase 4 baseline  Increased by 379 %  the number of UREP STEM first time transfers from the Phase 3 baseline Provided comprehensive services and stipend support to 400-500 students a year.       Broader Impact   SUNY LSAMP has promoted transformative change on the local, state and national level by positioning itself as one of the leading forces in New York State in enhancing the participation of UREP STEM students.  It has collaborated with programs in the New York State Education Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, SUNY System Administration, CUNY LSAMP, SUNY AGEP and businesses and industries.     This collaboration created new synergy and offered unprecedented opportunities to scale up by leveraging the immense STEM infrastructure--both within and outside of New York State in order to  enhance the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM education (undergraduate and graduate) and expand the STEM workforce.     SUNY LSAMP has:   Addressed key issues that affect UREP students on the undergraduate and graduate level on the campus, state and national level Acted as advocates on minority issues in areas such as scholarship distribution, use of campus resources and many other key areas  Used the lessons learned from this project to develop and refine strategies that will increase the recruitment and retention of UREP STEM students. These strategies will help to increase the number of UREP STEM students who successfully complete degrees in STEM disciplines and make changes in STEM departmental culture and practice      Intellectual Merit  The project has added to current efforts by SUNY LSAMP to build research capacity in the area of UREP STEM education and identify best practices to build new components and activities.      SUNY LSAMP has:  Taken a leadership role in STEM curricular and pedagogical reform on the SUNY campuses. The effort has led to engagement among faculty, staff, administrators and heads of academic departments to create new infrastructures on campuses to enhance UREP students? pursuit of STEM higher education Continued to  add to the research base on UREP STEM Education through the current Fostering Identity  Through Transition (FIT) model that examines when and why enrichment programming buffers participants against identity threats and how the programming might be further developed to solidify STEM identity and success Developed new evaluation instruments specifically targeted to issues related to international study and research and transfer students.      Conclusion  This project has significantly increased the number of UREP students who have received degrees in STEM fields then go on to STEM graduate school and the high technology STEM workplace. These efforts are part of a national effort to diversify the STEM workforce and provide access to education for groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM. These efforts will help this country have the viable STEM workforce necessary to have a strong economy in the 21st century.
