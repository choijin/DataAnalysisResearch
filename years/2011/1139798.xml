<AbstractNarration>In observance of the 2011 International Year of Chemistry, this symposium is being convened to recognize the contributions of scientists, policy decision makers, industry, and intergovernmental agencies to characterize and counteract the threat that industrially produced halocarbons posed to the Earth's protective stratospheric ozone layer. The American Meteorological Society (AMS), American Geophysical Union (AGU), and American Chemical Society (ACS) are the primary co-sponsors for this symposium. International co-sponsors include the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP - Ozone Secretariat), World Meteorological Organization (WMO - Research Department), and the International Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution (ICACGP) of the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science (IAMAS). World-renowned atmospheric chemists and other scientists, who have made important contributions to stratospheric ozone research, will be invited to deliver keynote speeches. In addition, invited presentations on the regulatory and policy aspects of stratospheric ozone and climate changes will be planned from the policy and industry communities. The last day of the symposium will be dedicated to a young scientist forum: the agenda will include both oral and poster presentations from young scientists, covering the topics of research in stratospheric ozone and climate change, policy decision making, and integration between science and policy.</AbstractNarration>
