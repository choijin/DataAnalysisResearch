<AbstractNarration>This University of New Hampshire project entitled: Learning Mathematics through Teaching proposes to develop new curriculum modules for an existing undergraduate level course for future secondary teachers that are based on experiences with student difficulties in this course, as well as on current literature on mathematics teacher preparation.  In addition the project provides prospective teachers with a practicum experience with experienced  teaching assistants who have been trained in mentoring preservice teachers and in planning and facilitating classroom practices.  It is also developing, implementing, and carrying out research on a professional development program for teaching assistants who instruct precalculus.  These teaching assistants are being trained in facilitating inquiry-based student-centered teaching strategies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Learning Mathematics through Teaching project team developed, implemented, and researched the effectiveness of a capstone mathematics content course (focused on the mathematics foundational to high school precalculus curriculum) for preservice secondary mathematics teachers. The course includes a series of five curriculum modules as well as a practicum experience focused on the content of these modules.  Our research and findings are based on two implementations of the course over two years, each implementation involving a different practicum experience. The team investigated the preservice teachersÆ mathematical knowledge for teaching, including changes to their knowledge during their enrollment in the course. The project web site makes available the curriculum modules as well as presentations and publications, http://www.math.unh.edu/lmtt-research-project  An analysis of the preservice teachersÆ work on the pre- and post-test revealed a substantial increase in content knowledge. Each test was scored on an identical 50-point rubric. The class mean score on the post-test, 33.8, was significantly higher (at the p = 0.001 level) than the pre-test class mean score of 21.7 This increase is fueled disproportionately by the interview participants, as controlling for interview participation reveals that the scores of those who participated in the full set of interviews increased by approximately twice the scores of those who did not participate. This suggests that the act of reflecting on the mathematics of the class in a structured manner outside of the classroom setting may have a positive impact on content knowledge. The mean score on the pre-test suggests a serious lack of precalculus content knowledge amongst the prospective teachers. If the test were given in a standard precalculus class with a minimum passing score of 60%, only four of the prospective teachers would have passed. When one considers that the design of the pre- and post-tests covered a wide range of precalculus material, the increase in content knowledge was not only significant, but substantial as well.  In addition to these quantitative observations, a qualitative analysis of the preservice teachers examinations of student work revealed:  A focus on procedure; their inability or unwillingness to consider student work holistically. A strong reliance on their previous experiences with student misconceptions when interpreting student work. A wide variety and degree to which affective traits (e.g., curiosity, persistence, empathy) were apparent while examining student work.   We also found evidence that some of the preservice teachers believe that:  Student-centered approaches to teaching do not count as teaching.  Use of group work was for review or practice of previously learned procedures. Board-work is preferable over group-work for delivery of new content.   The project team has disseminated these results through professional meetings (see the project web site) and is preparing articles for publication. The curriculum modules are available for use by others preparing secondary mathematics teachers and the team is willing to work with others who would like to implement this approach in their mathematics teacher preparation programs.
