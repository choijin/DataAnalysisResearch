<AbstractNarration>Funds are requested to provide travel and subsistence support for 12 U.S. graduates&lt;br/&gt;students to attend the 2011 International IEEE Magnetics Society Summer School in New&lt;br/&gt;Orleans. The International Magnetism Summer School is the IEEE Magnetics Society?s main&lt;br/&gt;outreach effort to promote education in the field of magnetism and attract more young scientists&lt;br/&gt;to choose a research career in magnetism and related areas. The one-week Magnetism Summer&lt;br/&gt;School is designed for graduate students studying magnetism and related areas. It will consist of&lt;br/&gt;lectures by international experts and will include poster presentations by participating graduate&lt;br/&gt;students. The program will cover fundamentals and advanced topics in magnetism. The summer&lt;br/&gt;school is a unique opportunity for young scientists to meet leaders in their field in a relaxed and&lt;br/&gt;collegial atmosphere and to begin establishing a network of colleagues in the research&lt;br/&gt;community.&lt;br/&gt;The Magnetics Society has allocated $106,000 which will be used primarily to provide&lt;br/&gt;with free room and board and reimburse for most of the travel expenses for 65 students from all&lt;br/&gt;over the world including the United States. The funds requested from NSF will allow additional&lt;br/&gt;U.S. graduate students to attend the Summer School and interact with peers internationally.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The Summer School provides a forum for exchange of information in the field of&lt;br/&gt;magnetics research. In addition to formal lectures, each participating student is required to&lt;br/&gt;present a poster about their current research. These topics are discussed amongst the students and&lt;br/&gt;lecturers during poster sessions.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the Summer School lies in the education of young scientists and&lt;br/&gt;researchers in a fast-moving and economically important field. Participants will learn both&lt;br/&gt;fundamental as well as advanced topics through lectures delivered by internationally-renowned&lt;br/&gt;experts. In addition, there is a degree of cultural education, teaching young scientists to interact&lt;br/&gt;with and respect their colleagues from other countries. The students will be co-housed with peers&lt;br/&gt;from different nationalities fostering interaction and cultural exchange.&lt;br/&gt;The organizers of the Summer School particularly encourage women and&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities to apply. The program committee also strives for diversity in the&lt;br/&gt;lecturers selected for the summer school to provide role models for female and minority students.</AbstractNarration>
