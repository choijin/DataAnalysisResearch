<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Martin Minelli from Grinnell College and colleagues Charles Cunningham, T. Andrew Mobley and Stephen Sieck will acquire a benchtop X-ray diffractometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially structure studies in areas such as (a)  molybdenum coordination complexes, (b) bimetallic organometallic compounds, (c) organic nitrogen (nitrone) compounds, and (d) intermetallic compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research in the chemistry and physics departments.</AbstractNarration>
