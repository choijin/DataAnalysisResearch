<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use resins, additives, and process aids shown by PlastiPure to be free of estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activity (EA**) to create innovative and novel flexible plastic films and products for the preparation and storage of food and beverages that leach no chemicals having EA**. These films and products should remain free of EA** when extracted by common solvents and food simulants, and remain EA**-free after the stresses of manufacturing and exposure to common-use stresses (microwaving, thermal cycling, and UV light). PlastiPure also proposes to produce prototype products which would be specifically targeted for pregnant women, infants, and young children, whom are particularly vulnerable to the potentially adverse health effects of EA**. These highly desirable end products are already being sought by PlastiPure licensees and interested retailers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are development and commercialization of food and beverage packaging that are significantly safer, especially for pregnant women, infants, and young children. Fetal or juvenile mammals, including humans, are especially sensitive to effects of chemicals having EA** at very low dosages and hence should not indiscriminately ingest such chemicals. EA** has been strongly linked to higher rates of certain cancers, birth and learning disorders, obesity, and reproductive issues. PlastiPure's data show that the vast majority of plastic food packaging leaches chemicals with EA**, including those advertised as BPA-free. This NSF SBIR grant should facilitate a comprehensive reduction of risks to public health and reduced environmental impact from chemicals having EA.</AbstractNarration>

Current attempts to solve the EA problem by removing chemicals one at a time, such as BPA or parabens, do not remove or replace the many other chemicals that may also have EA.   In this completed SBIR project, PlastiPure found or formulated base resins (polyolefins), additives (e.g., antioxidants, cling enhancers), and process aids (e.g., slip agents, anti-blocks) to be free of EA as measured by state-of-the-art methods (a roboticized MCF-7 cell proliferation assay) to create innovative and novel flexible plastic films and products for the preparation and storage of food and beverages that leach no chemicals having EA. These formulations were designed to produce films that are free of EA when extracted by common solvents and food simulants, and remain EA-free after the stresses of manufacturing and exposure to common-use stresses (microwaving, thermal cycling, and UV light).  Specifically:  Two resin formulations were developed and film cast for producing baby bottled liner bags, one of which one has proven acceptable fitness-for-use properties and remains EA-free after exposure to different stresses and extractants Four resins were formulated and cast into cling/stretch wraps. One resin was selected as having the best commercial appeal because of its physical properties and cost. This resin also remained EA-free after exposure to different stresses and extractants. Two resins were formulated and film cast for producing the food preparation and packaging bag. One was selected that tested EA-free after exposure to stresses and extractants, while retaining acceptable physical properties. Two resins were formulated and film cast for producing food storage bags. One was selected as the best candidate having comparable qualities to commercial food storage bags and continuing to test negative for EA.   Because of the high level of concerns that researchers and consumers have on the safety of their products and packaging, especially that of plastics, PlastiPure has published much EA data on materials and consumer products in peer reviewed journals. It has also has a new website to better educate consumers on the issues and solutions associated with leaching of chemicals with EA. In addition, PlastiPure has continued to work with consumer groups to provide information and test key consumer products.   In 2015, PlastiPure spun off a safe-products company called productpure. productpure&trade; consumer products will be available in late 2015 beginning with worldÆs first certified EA-free baby bottle (see attached). This bottle will quickly followed by other products such as water bottles and packaging.   PlastiPure believes that when a large variety of EA-free packaging and products become available to the public, like those developed in this grant, potential health problems ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
