<AbstractNarration>1111196&lt;br/&gt;Liang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant provides support for leading scientists, early-career faculty, and graduate students to participate discussions on thermal energy transfer for energy harvesting, at the Materials Research Society (MRS) annual spring meeting, San Francisco, CA in April 25-29, 2011. The symposium will bring researchers together from two communities, materials and thermal energy. The current needs in energy and waste heat recovery have challenged mechanical engineers and materials scientists in design of engineering components and fabrication of novel materials for heat transfer and energy harvesting. This symposium provides an opportunity for participants to discuss important issues in thermal energy transfer and materials development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this grant will provide a venue for examination of energy transfer, waster energy recovery, and needs for materials development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impacts of the grant are in enabling the participation of students and early career scientists in the symposium, thereby providing the education and training opportunities for next generation scientists.</AbstractNarration>
