<AbstractNarration>This project is focusing on the development, implementation, and assessment of five core courses in Geographic Information Science (GISc), which are building the foundation for the future development and implementation of a full-scale GISc program at the CUNY Borough of Manhattan Community College.  The PIs have engaged appropriate expert assistance from nearby CUNY Hunter College, and also are working with representatives from the National Center for Geospatial Technology (NGTC), other two-year and four-year institutions, local private industries, and federal, state, and city agencies to develop, adapt, and implement exemplary educational materials and key pedagogical strategies in GISc. The short-term activities are aimed at creating, adapting, and disseminating new learning materials and teaching strategies to reflect advances in geospatial technology, and the project is serving the dual purpose of preparing students for entry level employment in a variety of industries and facilitating student transfer to local baccalaureate degree programs in Geographical Information Science (GISc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is also attempting to increase critical thinking and problem solving skills among students in addition to improving their geospatial literacy.  This is being done through the innovative use of emerging technologies, cases studies, and hands-on instruction and in-class research. These instructional methods build upon and extend in new ways research already being undertaken by the NGTC's network of community colleges. The GISc courses that are being developed by the project are significantly enhancing student learning in a large urban area and are providing a new pool of highly trained technicians able to join and enhance the local and regional workforce.  Likewise, the instructional methods and strategies being developed by the project PIs have the potential to become a national model suitable for replication in other urban areas and at institutions serving groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Product  Five up-to-date GIS courses were developed, four of them were piloted and assessed, and one of them was further modified after the first pilot. These five core courses form the foundation of the Geographic Information Science (GISc) program at the CUNY Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC). The GISc program is the first AS degree program of its kind created in the New York City area.   The skills and competencies that are required in local geospatial job markets were surveyed and identified by using the Geospatial Technology Competency Model (GTCM) Assessment Tool which was prepared by National Center for Geospatial Technology (NGTC). This information drives the team to design the contents for these five courses.  In this unique program, exemplary educational materials and key pedagogical strategies in GISc were developed and implemented by closely consulting CUNY Hunter College. We also collaborated with representatives from the NGTC and local stakeholders including other two-year and four-year institutions, federal, state and city agencies and local private industries. The educational material is disseminated on a website.   Articulation  A 2+2 articulation agreement was achieved between BMCC/GISc program and Hunter College/Geography program to facilitate transferring students. Graduates of the program have options to seek an entry level employment in a variety of industries and/or transfer to local baccalaureate degree programs in GISc or related programs.  Student Service  This unique GISc program can be fully accessed by BMCC students which is comprised of minorities and groups that are historically underrepresented in collegiate programs. More than two-thirds of the students at BMCC are women. There were about 30 students who took one of the GIS courses and 94% of them successfully passed the course. One student failed in GIS 261 and one student withdrew unofficially in GIS 361. The sample size is actually too small to be able to make a conclusion. From the indirect assessment in each course, all the students agreed that their knowledge of GIS have significantly increased, they had good progress towards achieving course objectives, their interests in the subject area increased, the course helped them think independently about the subject matter, and the course actively involved them in what they were learning. Some good suggestions for improving the course were collected as well for future implementation.  Two exit interviews were conducted for two students who completed all the GIS courses. They both feel confident that they are prepared for either transferring to four-year College or entering into an entry level job. One student enrolled into a two-credit internship course and successfully completed it within a local industry. According to the employer evaluation, the student received an excellent review for his overall performance including great comments on the following areas as a team player: professional skills, self-motivation, and excellent problem solving skills.   Professional Development  The professional development activities included three intensive Geospatial workshops, two outside trainings in remote sensing, and several online training courses. With the assistance from CUNY Hunter College, three faculty members have developed sufficient professional skills and knowledge to be able to teach GIS courses. Two faculty members instructed the piloted GIS courses with very good feedback from students.  Although the grant support has expired, however, the effort in fostering student success in geospatial technology still continues. The next focus will be the recruitment and retention so that more students can benefit from this program. 000515386       Last Modified: 09/19/2015       Submitted by: Ching-Song D Wei]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
