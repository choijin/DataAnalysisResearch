<AbstractNarration>Rising sea levels, reduced precipitation in watersheds, and global increases in water consumption are resulting in widespread saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater wetlands. The movement of saline water into these historically freshwater ecosystems is likely to impact plant productivity, the decomposition of roots and litter, the metabolism of soil microbial communities, and, as a result, the rate of organic matter accumulation. Organic matter accumulation is an important factor determining the rate of vertical accretion in tidal freshwater wetlands, and whether these wetlands will be able to "keep up" with rising sea levels. The overall goal of this project is to understand how saltwater intrusion will impact the fate of organic carbon in tidal freshwater wetlands. Several tidal freshwater wetlands in Virginia and South Carolina that cover a range of soil types, plant communities, and potential responses to saltwater intrusion will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coastal marshes supply a number of important ecosystem goods and services, including water quality improvement, floodwater buffering, and habitat for economically and ecologically important plants and animals. As sea level rises, it is critical to understand whether and how freshwater tidal wetlands will be able to keep pace by building soil volume. This research will allow us to understand and perhaps respond to the effects of climate change on tidal freshwater wetlands.</AbstractNarration>

Cores were collected to measure differences in CO2 and CH4 emissions in fresh and brackish waters and the amount of OC desorbed from soils and its subsequent consumption by microbes was measured at core multiple depths.    The mean CO2 flux was greater from the SC sites (1.22 mg C m-2 min-1) than the VA sites (0.57 mg C m-2 min-1) whereas there was no difference between the states in terms of CH4 fluxes from the cores.  Similarly, the consumption of desorbed C was also greater in soils from SC indicating higher rates of microbial respiration.  There was a consistent decrease in both the amount of OC desorbed and its microbial bioavailability with depth from the surface to ~ 35-40 cm.

This tends to suggest marsh and soil-derived OC is not inherently recalcitrant but instead is protected from degradation by associations with minerals.  Once OC is released from associations with minerals it is readily available for microbial consumption.  The concept of priming has been proposed as an additional mechanism to enhance the decomposition of refractory OC whereby the addition of a labile OC sources provides energy to degrade the background OC. We found the addition of a terrestrial pollen leachate can prime the uptake of marsh-derived OC by as much as 37% within a short time period (hours-days).

Carbon emissions are a cause for growing concern amoung scientists and citizens alike. This program allowed high school students and teachers, as well as undergraduates, graduate students, and primary investigators to work together to spread carbon awareness.   The program generated research opportunities for high school and post-secondary students in a dynamic collaboration with graduates and primary investigators.  It included a mix of lecture, field research and data collection, experimental design, data analysis, and hypothesis testing.  Additionally, the short courses which were developed were produced as a video series and made available to a large group of post-secondary students, teachers, and community members to elevate their understanding of the carbon cycle and burning of fossil fuels.  The primary goals of CAP were 1) to provide Virginia high school teachers with strong lesson plans and hands-on activities that focus on C cycle, and 2) to investigate the impact increased emissions might have at a local, regional and global levels.  Our secondary goal was to expand scientific literacy and competency in VA teachers through their collaborative partnership with VCU researchers and VCU students.
