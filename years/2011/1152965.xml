<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry supports Joseph J. Reczek of Denison University in this project to design, synthesize and characterize new donor-acceptor columnar liquid crystals as organic electronic materials.  The approach involves development of synthetic methodologies for the generation of highly substituted aromatic compounds with the ability to self-assemble into a variety of ordered, functional materials.  The optical and electrical properties of these fundamentally new materials will be investigated towards novel components for photovoltaics and other optoelectronic applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will engage a cohort of undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research at Denison University, a primarily undergraduate institution.  These students will be trained in cutting-edge techniques and instrumentation related to several branches of chemistry, including organic synthesis, molecular self-assembly, materials chemistry, and device fabrication.  Students will gain experience in teamwork, leadership, and project management, as well as giving scientific presentations in the local community and at national conferences.  New instrumentation supported will broadly affect research and teaching at Denison.  The proposed work could significantly impact the fields of self-assembly, organic electronic materials, and photovoltaics, while training undergraduate students for success in scientific careers and post-graduate education as well as raising awareness of alternative energy research in the community.</AbstractNarration>
