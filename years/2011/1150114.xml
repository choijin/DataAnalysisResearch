<AbstractNarration>This project examines the professional development of graduate students in emerging but contentious scientific fields, and the possible implications for their future careers in science.  For this project, contentious science is science for which there are "substantive ethical concerns that may lead scientists as well as the broader public to call the value of scientific inquiry into question and inspire policy responses that hinder rather than advance scientific progress." The project focuses on two specific fields of contentious science: stem cell science and bio-nanotechnology. This work has potential to inform training of future scientists for research in contentious fields and, thus, to contribute to long-term efforts to stimulate innovative research in these emerging areas of research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's activities will include two phases of research.  In the first phase, the PI will conduct interview studies with graduate students and early-career scientists.  The purpose of this phase is to refine a theoretical framework about the factors that may influence graduate students' decisions to enter, stay in, or leave research programs in contentious science.  The findings will inform the second phase, a three-wave panel survey of graduate students.  This panel survey will provide data on graduate students in contentious science fields, compared to students in similar but non-contentious research areas.  Results will be analyzed to understand the relative influence of factors that influence career choices and research decisions.  The extent to which ethical controversy disproportionately affects the graduate education and career development of women and underrepresented minorities will also be addressed.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many scientific fields raise ethical questions yet the impact working in a controversial area has on scientists early in their careers is largely unknown. In this project, we aimed to understand how frequently graduate students in the life sciences found themselves working on ethically contentious science and how this experience affected their graduate education and the development of their careers. To address these questions, we conducted two major research&nbsp;activities. First we conducted a series of open-ended interviews with early career scientists in contentious fields, such as stem cell research and nanotechnology. Our interviews identified a range of strategies early career scientists used to cope with ethical controversy and highlighted a number of ongoing challenges they faced. Next, we conducted a panel survey of graduate students in the life sciences where we asked questions of students while they were in graduate school and then contacted them again later to assess how their graduate education had progressed and, in some cases, learn about their transition from graduate school to the workforce. In our surveys, we found that ethical controversy was relatively common among life science graduate students in the United States. Roughly 15% of students reported that their research raised ethical concerns for them personally and nearly a quarter indicated that their research would raise ethical concerns for the general public, should it be made public. We explored multiple ways that these forms of ethical controversy could affect students? experiences and success in graduate school. One notable relationship was that between working in a contentious area and satisfaction with one?s graduate advisor. Students who worked in areas they considered to be ethically contentious reported lower satisfaction with their advisors. Our surveys also examined students? experiences with research ethics training. We found that the most frequently used online training approaches are, in students? judgment, among the less effective and that more effective approaches (again, based on student self-assessment) are underutilized. This project also included several educational components, including redesigning a graduate level course on stem cell ethics and policy and developing a new course titled "The Engaged Scientist" providing an opportunity for graduate students in any field to think about what it means to be an ?engaged scientist? and practice these skills.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/31/2020<br>      Modified by: Aaron&nbsp;D&nbsp;Levine</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
