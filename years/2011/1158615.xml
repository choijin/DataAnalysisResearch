<AbstractNarration>Technology educators from Black Hills State University (SD) and Purdue University partner with science educators from the University of Massachusetts at Boston and Stevens Institute of Technology to determine the viability of an engineering concept-based approach to teacher professional development for secondary school science teachers in life science and in physical science.  The project refines the conceptual base for engineering at the secondary level learning (previously developed by the PIs) to increase the understanding of engineering concepts by the science teachers.  In a pilot test of two weeks of professional development with ten teachers from each discipline, teachers become familiar with engineering concepts and study the process of infusing engineering concepts into science curricula so that they can develop modules in their discipline to be taught during the following in the school year.  The following summer the teachers debrief the process and develop additional modules for their discipline.  The process is revised and repeated with 22 teachers from each discipline.  Teachers are explicitly provided strategies to help them meet the needs of diverse learners.  The outputs of this project include: 1) a preliminary framework for secondary level engineering education to be published in both research and practitioner journals; 2) a pilot tested and validated Engineering Concept Assessment; 3) engineering-infused curriculum modules in life and physical science; and 4) a professional development model to prepare science teachers to infuse engineering in their teaching.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project compares student learning when particular concepts in physics and biology are taught through engineering design with learning the same concepts taught an earlier group of students with present reform techniques used in the discipline.  The hypothesis is that when teachers and students engage with engineering design activities their understanding of science concepts and inquiry are also enhanced.  The research component of the project employs an iterative design with the design of activities followed by development and implementation.  An engineering concept assessment is developed and tested to examine teacher learning and to determine how engineering concepts can be infused into the science curricula for life and physical science.  Other quantitative and qualitative instruments are developed to assess the teachers? understandings of the engineering concepts and their pedagogical implications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is increasing emphasis on integrative STEM education.  New national and international assessments are developing engineering strands and emphasizing non-routine problem solving.  The framework for the Next Generation Science Standards includes engineering as one of four strands.  Stand alone engineering course are not likely to be widely used.  This project develops engineering infused science units and determines the professional development needed to use them effectively.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
