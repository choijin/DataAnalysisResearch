<AbstractNarration>1137186 Ren&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Bacteria are well known to obtain intrinsic tolerance to antibiotics and disinfectants by forming surfaceattached&lt;br/&gt;sessile colonies embedded in an extracellular matrix, known as biofilms, and by forming&lt;br/&gt;metabolically inactive cells, known as persister cells. Such intrinsic tolerance also facilitates the&lt;br/&gt;development of multidrug resistance through acquired mechanisms, presenting a great challenge to&lt;br/&gt;microbial control.&lt;br/&gt;Despite the well recognized significance, research on biofilms and persister cells is still in its infancy.&lt;br/&gt;Distribution of persisters in biofilms and the effects of environmental/host factors and cell-cell signaling&lt;br/&gt;on such distribution and biofilm-associated stress tolerance are unknown, mostly due to the heterogeneity&lt;br/&gt;in biofilm structure, spatial and temporal variation in gene expression, and redundancy in persister and&lt;br/&gt;biofilm genes. The objective of this EFRI project is therefore to understand and manipulate the&lt;br/&gt;multicellular and inter-kingdom signaling processes in such complex systems by addressing these key&lt;br/&gt;challenges using well integrated multidisciplinary approaches.&lt;br/&gt;Based on recent successes in surface engineering, patterned biofilm formation, systems biology and&lt;br/&gt;molecular simulation, this research team will conduct the first-of-its-kind research to: (1) systematically&lt;br/&gt;characterize persister formation during biofilm development, (2) identify the roles of key genes and&lt;br/&gt;signaling processes in persister formation, (3) develop an unprecedented computational capability to&lt;br/&gt;accurately predict signaling factor translocation through the extracellular matrix of the biofilms, and (4)&lt;br/&gt;synthesize and characterize functional nanoparticles for controlled release of signaling modulators to&lt;br/&gt;eliminate persister cells. A number of important questions will be answered for the first time. These&lt;br/&gt;discoveries will have a transformative impact in designing more effective knowledge-based strategies for&lt;br/&gt;the manipulation and control of bacterial multicellular behaviors and bacteria-host interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;In addition to fundamental understanding of biofilm development and persister formation, the findings&lt;br/&gt;from this study will also improve the general knowledge of bacterial physiology with the potential to shift&lt;br/&gt;the paradigm of microbial control. Furthermore, the results of this research as pertains to deleterious&lt;br/&gt;biofilms of pathogenic and corrosive bacteria can be extended to the development of better biofilm&lt;br/&gt;systems of environmentally friendly bacteria, which have broad applications in bioremediation of toxic&lt;br/&gt;chemicals and economical production of renewable biofuels. Due to the broad spectrum of problems and&lt;br/&gt;opportunities associated with persister cells and biofilms, the proposed work will have significant impacts&lt;br/&gt;on basic science, economy, biosecurity and health care.&lt;br/&gt;Beyond any technical achievements, this project will also play an important role in transforming college&lt;br/&gt;engineering education. Unlike traditional projects that focus on relatively narrow topics, this project&lt;br/&gt;targets multicellular and inter-kingdom signaling, a highly interdisciplinary area. The advanced topics&lt;br/&gt;associated with this research will provide invaluable materials to teach modern biotechnology, molecular&lt;br/&gt;simulation, synthetic biology and bioinformatics, providing the students with crucial knowledge and skills&lt;br/&gt;to address the scientific, engineering and societal challenges. This research will also create exciting&lt;br/&gt;outreach opportunities and bring talented young people, especially underrepresented groups, into science&lt;br/&gt;and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
