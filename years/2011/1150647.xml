<AbstractNarration>In this work we investigate a new qubit system ideal for realizing an optically connected quantum network: single acceptor-bound holes (A0) in III-V quantum wells (QW). This system has the potential to combine millisecond long spin coherence times with strong, homogeneous optical transitions in a nanofabrication-ready material. Far-field super-resolution optical techniques will be developed in order to isolate single impurity-bound excitons (A0X), with the goal of reaching optical resolutions on the order of the effective mass Bohr radius. These techniques will be combined with ultrafast optical spin control to study the effect of QW confinement and nearby surfaces on the optical and spin coherence properties of the A0-A0X system.  Knowledge gained from these studies will guide research on integrating single impurities into optical nanocavities. The longer term goal of the project is to realize optically-connected few qubit devices in a scalable architecture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quantum information network based on photons and spins would enable quantum simulation, secure long-distance quantum communication, and quantum computation. In this work we study single impurities in semiconductors as potential quantum bits for such a network. Nanoscale low temperature imaging techniques will be developed to isolate single impurities.  Ultrafast optical techniques will be used to study the impurity qubit lifetime. The longer term goal of the project is to realize a few qubit network in which spins are connected through on-chip optical devices. The research program will involve, teach, and train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates in experimental physics, quantum optics, and nanoscience. In addition to training undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs in quantum optics, physics and nanotechnology, an integral part of the broader impact of this program includes community outreach at a local elementary school. University of Washington physics and electrical engineering students, working closely with a Sansislo elementary school science teacher, are engaging 4th-5th grade students in weekly science activites aimed at understanding light.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The award sought to determine the suitability of several semiconductor platforms for applications in quantum information.  Semiconductors which efficiently emit light, otherwise known as direct bandgap semiconductors, were targeted due to their suitability for photon-enabled applications. These applications include quantum communication and photon-mediated computational gates for quantum computation.   The following lists specific outcomes related to the Intellectual Merit of the project. Determination of the suitability of acceptors as qubit candidates:  We experimentally confirmed the excited state structure and radiative lifetimes of acceptor-bound excitons in the semiconductor gallium arsenide (GaAs). The agreement with theory confirms that the dominant relaxation measurement is radiative which is important for photon-mediated applications. In strained GaAs, longitudinal spin relaxation measurements were performed showing showing microsecond relaxation times.

These spin measurements indicate that shallow acceptors in strained III-V semiconductors do not exhibit the desirable spin properties for quantum applications. Determination of the donor electron longitudinal spin relaxation times and mechanisms in 4 semiconductors. These results quantitatively determine the mechanism for spin relaxation in the high B-field limit for donors in GaAs, CdTe, InP, and ZnO. A theoretical framework is developed that can be applied to a larger class off direct bandgap semiconductors, serving as a predictive tool for the suitability of donors as qubits in a targeted direct bandgap semiconductor.
