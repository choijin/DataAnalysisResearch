<AbstractNarration>Frank Brown of the University of California, Santa Barbara is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program within the Division of Chemistry (MPS/CHE) and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology (BIO/MCB) for the development of theoretical tools to model lipid bilayers and biomembranes for use in simulating complex biochemical and biophysical phenomena. Dr. Brown's algorithms allow hydrodynamically and thermodynamically consistent modeling of inhomogeneous membrane surfaces over a range of "mesocopic" length scales (tens of nanometers to tens of microns) and time scales (tens of nanoseconds to tens of seconds and longer). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is having a broad impact on the interpretation of experiments that enhance our understanding of biological phenomena such as the diffusion of membrane proteins in complex cellular environments and the structure and dynamics of human red blood cells. Dr. Brown communicates the excitement and importance of science to grade school children through his participation in the Physics Circus and Chemistry Outreach programs at UCSB. Dr. Brown also serves as co-director of the UCSB center for scientific computing, which oversees and maintains shared scientific computing facilities for the UCSB campus, for use in both research and classroom teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF award 1153096 was used to carry out fundamental theoretical research related to the mechanics and dynamics of lpid bilayer membranes and related biophysical problems.  A significant outcome of this research was the development of a theory relating the orientational fluctuations of lipids within the bilayer to the bending modulus of the membrane.  This theory was then used to develop an explicit algorithm to extract bending moduli from fully atomistic simulations of lipid bilayers, which enabled, for the first time, determination of membrane bending moduli from fully detailed simulations.  This is in an important advance in the study of membrane biophysics because it enables direct comparison (and refinement) between experiment, theory and detailed simulations.   A second outcome of this research was the developement of two complementary numerical strategies to study the dynamics of proteins and lipids on membrane surfaces (see figure).  These methods allow for the study of complex membrane systems involving coexisting lipid phases and membrane proteins and spanning length scales from nanometers to microns and time scales up to seconds and longer.  The ability to model such relatively long length and time scales is critical for making direct comparison to the various microscopy experiments that are conventionally used in membrane biophysics.  Other work was also completed related to understanding and modeling specific experiments in the fields of membrane dynamics, single-molecule spectroscopy and enzyme kinetics.     Seven graduate students and postdoctoral scholars were trained in the fields of theoretical chemistry and theoretical biophysics during their participation in the above research.  The principal investigator regularly participated in the Physics Circus, Chemistry Outreach and Soccer to Science programs at UCSB.  These programs expose grade-school-age students to scientific/engineering principles through visually exciting presentations and hands-on activities.  Many of the students that participate in these programs come from agricultural regions of Santa Barbara county and from homes where neither parent has attended college or even set foot on a UC campus.  A high percentage of these students are underrepresented minorities.  These outreach efforts expose a diverse range of children to the UC system and show them that a college education is within their reach.
