<AbstractNarration>This Noyce Phase II project continues the Noyce Phase I TEMS work currently in progress through collaboration between California State University (CSU), Chico and CSU Sacramento, in partnership with three area school districts. The Northeastern California Curriculum Committee, representing all the rural schools of Northeastern California, is also a collaborator in this project. In conjunction with other existing programs, the Noyce Scholars program has assisted Chico and Sacramento in efforts to increase the number of mathematics and science teachers they produce each year as part of a larger statewide goal of the CSU system. The project is providing scholarships to 37 preservice students at the two campuses, including both undergraduates and post-baccalaureate students.  Noyce Scholars participate in enhanced and expanded activities including Hands-On Lab science teaching experiences, Project M.A.T.H. (Mathematics And Teaching on the Horizon), new courses for STEM professionals allowing them to gain teaching credentials, expanded teacher recruitment activities, expanded early field experiences for preservice teachers, and collaborative efforts with existing programs such as the Alliance for Minority Participation, the Mathematics and Science Teaching Initiative, and the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment induction programs. Mentoring and advising are also greatly expanded to insure the success of Noyce scholars from underrepresented groups.  TEMS II brings the scholars and faculty from two different environments together to learn from each other, thus increasing their capacity to effectively teach populations of students throughout California.  The evaluation plan is designed to be a prototype evaluation model for the California State University System, adding to the body of knowledge about widening the pipeline to the teaching profession in mathematics and science. Evaluation efforts lead to new information regarding the effectiveness of recruitment strategies and the teaching success of the Noyce Scholars once they have been teaching for one year, in comparison to new teachers who have not participated in the Noyce program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Teaching Excellence in Math and Science Phase II (TEMSII) was a joint program from California State Universities, Chico and Sacramento, in partnership with six area school districts.  The two CSU campuses have long been leaders in providing highly qualified mathematics and science teachers for a service region larger than the size of Ohio, that includes both rural remote regions as well as large urban areas with large populations of low income, culturally and linguistically diverse students. In conjunction with other existing programs, the Noyce Scholars program assisted Chico and Sacramento in doubling the number of mathematics and science teachers produced over the five years of the program to meet a California statewide goal for the twenty-three campus CSU system.  TEMSII added to the scholarly work at both campuses by providing support to create and enhance programs for all math and science preservice teachers, not only Noyce scholars.  Programs and activities were expanded through Noyce including:  Hands-On Lab science teaching and K-12 field trip experiences, Project M.A.T.H. (Mathematics And Teaching on the Horizon), new courses for STEM professionals allowing them to gain teaching credentials, expanded teacher recruitment activities, expanded early field experiences for preservice teachers, collaborative efforts with existing programs such as the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, the Mathematics and Science Teaching Initiative, California Postsecondary Education Commission grant programs for retaining new math and science teachers on both campuses, and the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment induction programs.

TEMSII has had an impact on the Northern California region by providing students with the needed scholarships to support them toward a teaching career and to ensure their success and their availability to complete their education. The enhanced project activities associated with the scholarships also attract a significant number of new students into math and science teaching.  The significant increase in the number of highly qualified teachers produced by CSU, Chico and CSU, Sacramento has had a broad impact on the quality of teachers in our area, potentially on the number of secondary students who will eventually attend college themselves, and on the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) pipeline.
