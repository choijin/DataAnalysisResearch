<AbstractNarration>Species vary enormously in the complexity of their vocal repertoire. Unfortunately, we know very little about how this variation is matched by auditory capabilities. Moreover, individuals can vary enormously in how much their vocal repertoire changes over the course of the year, yet we know almost nothing about correlated changes in auditory capability. This comparative study of the plasticity of the auditory system will give us insight into both of these issues. This research program will focus on properties of hearing in songbirds using auditory evoked potentials, how those properties change across seasons, and how they differ between individuals. The research will include an unprecedented array of tests of hearing performance in eight species of songbirds..    First, the experiment will test whether hearing is ?tuned? to species-specific aspects of song, and the characteristics of the species habitats, and if hearing is conserved among closely related species. Experiments will also test whether individuals vary more when processing song than when they process contact calls. Second, the experiments will evaluate whether seasonality in hearing matches the use of vocal signals,  habitat changes that affect how sound carries through an environment, follows taxonomic similarities between species, and  whether seasonality reflects seasonal variation in social interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Given the broad similarities between avian and mammalian auditory systems, understanding the plasticity of the avian auditory system is likely to help us understand plasticity in the human auditory system, and thereby provide avenues of research in the treatment of hearing disorders. Our work on hearing has been the focus of a series of workshops on communication geared to high school students. One goal of this program is explicitly to include students from disadvantaged areas. We will also train graduate students and undergraduates in cross-disciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Our research program focused on understanding the adaptive significance of the auditory system of birds in the context of the vocal repertoire of a given species and seasonal dynamics of the processing of different types of vocal signals.  Properties of the vocal repertoire, in turn, reflect constraints imposed by the habitat on the propagation of vocal signals.   We showed that details of the processing of sound were strongly influenced by habitat.  In particular, woodland-adapted birds have very good resolution of tonal information, and these birds also have fairly tonal songs.  Open-adapted birds tend to have very good temporal resolution (i.e. an ability to hear very rapid elements in song), and these also have fairly complex sounds.  In some species, sexes appear to differ in their auditory physiology.  Indeed, cowbird females have auditory processing that is consistent with a species that lives in woodlands, and males have auditory processing that is consistent with a species that lives in open habitats.  This is important because our results suggest that the auditory system is an important contributor to the adaptive significance of vocal communication, and therefore more broadly of the social system.  Individual differences in sensory biology can have a profound influence on the behavior of a given individual.  These differences can result from differences in hormone profiles or rearing conditions.  In a mating context, individual differences in signal processing can affect the pace and details of the evolution of mating signals themselves.  We showed that there is also variation within individuals caused by seasonal variation in auditory processing.  This is important in two ways.  First, it tells us that the information that birds derive from sounds change from one season to the next, thus their ability to locate conspecifics or predators, and their ability to detect fine details about those sources (e.g. individual recognition) can change over time.  Second, seasonal variation in auditory physiology can give us an exciting insight into the design of vocal signals.  In particular, aspects of the reorganization of the auditory system can give us an index of the spectral and temporal properties of mating signals that are used to convey information about the sender.  For example, house sparrow females (but not males) are better at processing tonal information in the mating season compared to auditory processing out of the mating season.  This suggests that the tonal properties of a malesÆ song conveys information about the quality of the male.  Similarly, the song of the white-breasted nuthatch has a fairly rapid amplitude modulation rate.  The auditory system of female white-breasted nuthatches is retuned in the mating season to be able to process this AM rate to a much higher degree than females out of the mating season.  All of these results were derived from the use of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), a non-invasive method of characterizing auditory processing.  Our research program has shown that AEPs are an extremely efficient and non-lethal way to characterize auditory physiology.     Broader Impacts  Our research program has offered an important contribution to the broader society.  We trained 24 undergraduates on how to read scientific papers, design experiments, analyze data and write a scientific report.  The writing component included several drafts of a proposal that we read by the PI, returned to the student, then rewritten and subject to further feedback.  This feedback is critical in a studentÆs progress as a scientific writer.  Many of these students were involved with presentation and a number were co-authors on published papers.  We also trained a graduate student and two postdocs.  This training enabled the students to go on to a tenure-track teaching position at Vassar College and further post-doctoral work at Washington University.  We contributed to the diversification of ou...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
