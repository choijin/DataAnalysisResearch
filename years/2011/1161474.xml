<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to develop feature-based simplification of computer-aided-design models, specifically to accelerate and automate downstream finite-element-analysis. In particular, the research will create algorithmic foundations for learning conservative feature suppression rules from demonstrations performed by human experts. The effect of simplification on simulation accuracy will be formally characterized and this understanding will be used to create robust algorithms for feature suppression within computer-aided design models. Research findings will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate curriculum. The research will ultimately lead to a framework to automatically learn, validate, and apply context dependent model simplification rules that can be audited by human experts, and deployed to automate the model simplification task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will significantly speed up model simplification, and enhance the automated use of engineering analysis tools in the design process. Potential applications include design of heat exchangers, aircraft structures, and semi-conductor equipment. The planned research and education integration activities and outreach activities will familiarize graduate, undergraduate, and high school students with the use of model simplification technologies in challenging engineering design projects. This project will also increase awareness among practicing engineers about the potential usage of automated model simplification in complex engineering design projects. Students working on this project will also participate in Badger Camp and Engineering Expo events at the University of Wisconsin campus and Maryland Day at the University of Maryland to enhance the public understanding of the science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  The intellectual outcome of this study that  "simplified models" in engineering analysis depend critically on the objective/goal of study. Thus a simplified model for a particular study may not be appropriate for a different study.   Inferring and discovering such "context-dependent" simplified models,in an automated manner, was one of the major outcomes of the research.In the process of discovering simplified models, we uncovered a novel preconditioning method, namely, deflation that can now be interpreted as a efficient model simplification method. Furthermore, through the proposed research, we were able to generalize deflation to classes of problems that have not been considered before.  Intellectually, we now have a better understanding on classic deflation techniques and its relationship to model reduction techniques. Thus, we can know extend both deflation and model reduction, by unifying both methods. It will also help researchers explain some of the subtleties through concepts from either disciplines. The primary field of impact is in structural analysis and optimization.  Broader Impact:  The broader outcome of this study was in the training of two gradiuate students (PhD) on the interplay between dimensional reduction (simplified models) and preconditioning techniques. The assembly-free deflation method that resulted from this study has a wide range of applications. The tool has been embedded within a finite element framework, and is currently being commercialized through a start-up.  Numerous publications have resulted from this research, and their dissemination has helped reached engineers from all over the world. Software plugins was developed for SolidWorks, a popular CAD/CAE packages such as SolidWorks. This is being used by 20+ universities around the world.
