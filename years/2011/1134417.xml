<AbstractNarration>1133965/1134417&lt;br/&gt;Wilson/Landes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to understand protein chromatography by observing the adsorption and transport of single protein molecules in realistic adsorbents, which has not previously been possible. Specifically, the proposed work will: (1) observe the adsorption and desorption of single protein molecules on thousands of adsorbent sites, (2) determine the distribution of dwell times at each site, (3) directly observe site heterogeneity, (4) measure activation energetics, (5) test the effects of ligand density and type, (6) characterize competition among proteins of different surface affinity but the same size and shape, and (7) measure single-molecule transport. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to open an entirely new way of investigating protein chromatography (and immunoassays, microarrays, biosensors, etc.), through the use of single-molecule fluorescence. Building on the co-PI?s experience in single-molecule spectroscopy, and our previous successful collaboration on single-molecule affinity recognition of proteins, we have developed methods for single-molecule imaging and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) transport studies in realistic agarose ionexchange adsorbents. Particular elements of the investigation include the determination of the residence times of single proteins on single adsorbent sites, the distributions of these residence times, and the effects of ligand density, ligand clustering, ionic strength, and the presence of competitors. Transport behavior inside the agarose gel will be characterized by FCS. This approach will support the development of a predictive moleculartheoretic approach to modeling chromatographic processes. It will illuminate the molecular origins of the superior performance of clustered-charge adsorbents, and should shed considerable light on the competitive protein adsorption and displacement processes which underlie all chromatographic separations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed work should be extensive. Bioseparations, and chromatography in particular, dominate the cost and process complexity of manufacturing of modern biopharmaceuticals, and consume enormous effort in biomedical and biotechnological research. There is a felt shortage of trained investigators and process developers in this interdisciplinary area. The clustered-charge adsorbents to be characterized as an element of the work show promise for broader applications. The results and methods should be directly applicable to separations of nucleic acids and bioconjugates, and to other methods including HIC, IMAC, and Protein A affinity. These methods could also be applied to studies of non-separation technologies such as immunoassays, biosensors, and DNA microarrays. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide excellent training opportunities for students to work at the interface of bioseparations/biochemical technology and nanobiology/nanobiotechnology. Each of these areas enjoys rapid employment growth, and the interface should be a very productive one for the foreseeable future. The University of Houston is one of the very most ethnically-diverse urban research universities in the United States, and the students involved in this research will reflect that diversity. Opportunities for integration with education are abundant, with multiple REU and RET programs in relevant areas.</AbstractNarration>
