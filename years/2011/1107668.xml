<AbstractNarration>The Jackson State University (JSU) Geosciences Department, in partnership with the Mississippi Regional Science Fair, the greater Jackson Metropolitan area schools, and the Jackson, MS National Weather Service (NWS), is working to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in atmospheric science, through research, application and partnership (IMAS-RAP). The project targets future STEM leaders at the 6th-12th grade levels, and provides them with opportunities to engage in multi-disciplinary, inquiry-based activities that increases their engagement with the atmospheric sciences and related STEM disciplines and improves their knowledge about geoscience careers.  It also prepares freshmen to senior geoscience undergraduates to become stewards and act as mentors, group leaders and community-based researchers. The project utilizes geoscience, community-based research and informal hands-on science to attract and retain students. The 2-year project directly affects forty 6th-12th grade students and at least 4 undergraduates at varies stages of matriculation.  The overall goal of the project is to establish a sustainable, minority geoscience pipeline for students in middle school and high school, and to increase enrollment of students in JSU STEM disciplines, primarily in the geoscience department. To achieve these outcomes, the project utilizes both an informal after-school program and summer science camp based on hands-on activities in physical science, meteorology, engineering, and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
