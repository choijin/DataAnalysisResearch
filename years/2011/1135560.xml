<AbstractNarration>This project will continue operating the Low-latitude Ionosphere Sensor Network (LISN) and utilize its regional measurements to investigate the day-to-day variability and formation of structures and dynamics in the low-latitude ionosphere. LISN is a distributed observatory composed of GPS receivers, flux gate magnetometers, and Vertical Incidence Pulsed Ionospheric Radar (VIPIR) ionosondes installed principally in the western half of South America. The work carried out under this grant will collect, store, and disseminate real-time ionospheric observables - a nowcast - and to conduct dedicated campaigns and investigations leading toward developing a predictive capability - a forecast - of the electrodynamics and stability of the low- latitude ionosphere over South America.</AbstractNarration>

The LISN ionosondes are part of the entire LISN distributed observatory.  These ionosondes are radar systems that transmit radio energy in the range of 1 to 25 MHz upward into the overhead ionosphere, where the radio signals resonate with the Earth&rsquo;s ionosphere and magnetic field and the radio energy is reflected back to the ground.  In the reflection process, the ionosphere induces changes to the radio signal which allow measurement of plasma density versus height as well as motion in the plasma.   Effort was focused on instruments in southern Bolivia and northern Argentina.  In this location, the dynamics of the ionosphere cause greatly increased plasma densities, enhancing the effects of the ionosphere on radio wave propagation for communication and navigation.</p> <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%;">The ionosondes are physically large, with multiple 35m tall towers and requiring a land area of at least 100x100m.  As sensitive and sophisticated research instruments that operate in a radio frequency environment that is crowded with other users and increasingly crowded by man-made electrical noise, the instruments are difficult to install, calibrate, operate and maintain, especially in these remote areas of the world.  The majority effort under this award was spent on improving the quality of the data obtained through field site visits.  The signal cables 150m in length leading to multiple spaced antennas must be calibrated to a few centimeters in length and kept calibrated through changes in temperature, rainfall and over long periods of time.  Sources of radio frequency interference appear and must be mitigated.  The instrument is susceptible to damage from nearby lightning strikes.  In addition these difficult engineering challenges the training of student observers and the collection and archive of data into a public access database was a priority.</p> <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%;">A significant development was the optimization of an inverted delta transmitting antenna that is approximately 10 times better than the traditional delta antenna at only two times the cost.</p> <!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; direction: ltr; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 120%; }p.western { font-family: "Liberation Serif","Times New Roman",serif; font-size: 12pt; }p.cjk { font-family: "Droid Sans Fallback"; font-size: 12pt; }p.ctl { font-family: "FreeSans"; font-size: 12pt; }a:link {  } --> <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%;">As a proof of concept, the instruments in Tucuman, Argentina and Tupiza, Bolivia were synchronized to successfully perform an oblique propagation measurement that observes the ionosphere at the midpoint of the 600 km path between these two stations.</p> <!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; direction: ltr; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 120%; }p.western { font-family: "Liberation Serif","Times New Roman",serif; font-size: 12pt; }p.cjk { font-family: "Droid Sans Fallback"; font-size: 12pt; }p.ctl { font-family: "FreeSans"; font-size: 12pt; }a:link {  } --><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Terence&nbsp;W&nbsp;Bullett</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135560/1135560_10217857_1485714112584_Tucuman-iDelta--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135560/1135560_10217857_1485714112584_Tucuman-iDelta--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Inverted Delta Transmit Antenna"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1135560/1135560_10217857_1485714112584_Tucuman-iDelta--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Inverted Delta Transmit Antenna"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The inverted delta transmitting antenna at Tucuman, Argentina.
