<AbstractNarration>This project will examine results from direct-imaging surveys of exoplanets (planets orbiting other stars), and produce a distribution of planets from a star that expands out to 1000 astronomical units from the parent star, where an astronomical unit is approximately the average distance between the Sun and Earth. New direct-imaging observations will be obtained, and data will also be used from archival sources, as well as orbital measurements of planets detected by other means, such as microlensing, radial velocity and transit techniques. When feasible, follow-up spectroscopy will be performed of newly detected planets.  The modeling efforts will focus on whether there is a continuous distribution of planets, or instead, any significant breaks are evident. The team will also search for variations of planetary distance populations as a function of stellar mass, age and iron content. The outcomes from these studies are intended to provide strong tests of standard models of core-accretion planet formation. As part of the process of identifying new planets from direct-imaging, and ruling out background objects, the project is also expected to reveal new high proper motion galactic halo stars. This project will provide publicly-available software tools useful to the exoplanet and stellar stronomy community. The PI will supervise and mentor undergraduate students, two doctoral students, and a postdoctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>
