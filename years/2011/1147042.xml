<AbstractNarration>In the morning people wake up and have breakfast, they eat lunch around noon, and in the evening they eat dinner. If it is too hot, or too cold, one turns on the air conditioner or the furnace.  When people are sick or suffering from a laceration, they seek treatment with antibiotics (if appropriate) or rest in bed. However, in the natural environment for wild outbred populations of organisms, life has many more unexpected environmental variations. For the fish Fundulus heteroclitus (the focus of this proposed study), the environment is both unpredictable and extremely variable. In their natural habitat Fundulus live in a constantly changing environment because they feed in the upper estuaries of coastal North America. At low tides they are either in deeper tidal creeks experiencing lower ocean temperatures (10-25°C) or, especially in spring and summer, can become temporarily lodged in the upper estuaries in warm tidal pools (25-35°C). They experience daily variation in salinity as they move with the tide up into marshes, from full strength seawater (33 parts per thousand, ppt) to less than 3 ppt if it is raining heavily. This application focuses on how environmental variation affects phenotypic variation in mRNA expression. The hypothesis proposed in this application is that much variation is hidden by the variable ecological settings where most natural populations exist.  The counter-intuitive hypothesis is that for a subset of genes, the physiological responses to variable environments constrain inter-individual variation in mRNA expression, and in so doing mask functional genetic variation or polymorphisms. If correct, then physiological canalization of gene expression hides genetic variation. Thus, this research provides a novel perspective on how so much hidden genetic variation arises and why it persists in natural populations. There are no prior analyses aimed at understanding how the environment affects the variance in mRNA expression, and a major impediment to such studies is that estimating variance requires specific experimental designs with large sample sizes. This application overcomes the design challenges, and will yield unique statistical analyses of how the variance in gene expression is a function of the environment, and in turn affects evolutionary processes. The fundamental importance of this proposed research is that it explores mechanisms whereby much genetic variation may be hidden, and addresses how large amounts of genetic variation can be maintained in natural species populations. The findings have the potential to significantly alter views of the results of experiments conducted under standard, well-controlled laboratory conditions, and thus influence physiological, evolutionary and human health research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has broader impacts in three areas. First, contributions to the scientific community include a large dataset on gene expression, cDNA sequences, and proximal promoters that can be used in other studies on metabolism, physiological acclimation and the regulation of gene expression. These data will be made available publically. Second, a graduate student will be trained in a diversity of biological fields, including  genomics, ecology and physiology, and in statistical analyses. Finally, undergraduate students will be attracted to this project through interactions with programs at the University of Miami that recruit students from underrepresented groups and engage them in hands-on scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The major hypothesis was that increased environmental variation reduces the inter-individual variation in gene expression and thus hides genetic variation. The two major goals were to compare mRNA expression in 1) field acclimatized and laboratory acclimated fish from three distinct populations and 2) fish acclimate to 12, 20, 28 and cycling temperature (12-28C daily).      1st Goal:  The mRNA from 300 field and acclimated individuals (2 treatments, x 3 populations x 50 individuals) have been isolated and analyzed using our NEW 3Æ RNA-Seq. We have optimizing a 3Æ RNA-Seq protocol to analyze 100s of individual per lane of Illumina High-Seq reducing the cost per individual to 20-30$-- less than the least expensive microarrays.      The analyses of these data are being written up for publication (1: 3Æ-RNA-Seq: Molecular and Bioinformatic approaches to enhance mRNA quantification; 2: The effects of environmental variation on mRNA Expression).         The most important outcomes from these data are:  A)   that acclimation and population have orthogonal effects on gene expression,  B)    environmental effects are population specifics (Fig. 1)  C)   difference among populations are for the most part independent of the environment (Fig. 2)  D)   that there is a decrease in the variation in field environments.   This finding supports suggest strong GxE effects: the genes that respond to the environment are dependent on the population and that differences among populations affect more genes and are insensitive to the environment.  The last point supports our major hypothesis in this grant application.        2nd Goal: The second major goal examined fish acclimated to 12&deg;C, 20&deg;C, 28&deg;C and 12&deg;-28&deg;C cycling period.  RNA has been isolated from 450 individual, cDNA libraries were sent out for high-throughput sequencing (NGS), and the NGS sequences are being analyzed.  Major Activities:  -  Protocol development for 3'RNA Seq  -Bioinformatics:  learning and teaching methodologies to analyze 3Æ RNA-Seq: eight students and faculty have been involved  -Analysis and publication of 3Æ RNA-Seq methods and outcome.  Two publications are planned  -Involvement of undergraduates in molecular approaches and data analyses  -Initiate of collaboration with an under-representative college (Miami_Dade: both instructors and undergraduates).  - Training of visiting Scientist  (Tammy LaBerg) from Miami-Dade College (minority serving institution).   - The ability to analyze many more (approximately 10x as many) individual using mRNA-Seq provide a stronger statistical methods to understand how the evolution, ecology and physiology effect mRNA expression.  -  Among three populations, there is significant differences in mRNA expression for 100s of genes for acclimation versus field acclimatize fish. Yet ,few are shared among population. The differences in mRNA expression among population in both conditions are much larger (1,000 of genes) than the difference between field and laboratory.  Yet, although there are few differences in mRNA expression between field and laboratory acclimated fish, there is a difference in the variance.  The reduced variation in field acclimatized fish support the primary hypothesis of this grant.            Last Modified: 10/21/2015       Submitted by: Douglas L Crawford]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
