<AbstractNarration>The third International Conference on Design of Experiments (ICODOE-2011) will be hosted by the Department of Mathematical Sciences, The University of Memphis during May 10 ? 13, 2011. The principal aims of the conference are to bring together leading researchers from all over the world in the area of design and analysis of experiments and practitioners in the pharmaceutical, chemometrics, physical, biological, medical, social, psychological, economic, engineering and manufacturing sciences. The conference will also provide support and encouragement to junior researchers in the field of design and analysis of experiments. The focus of ICODOE-2011 is on emerging areas of research in experimental design, as well as novel innovations in traditional areas.  The conference will cover topics of importance to the academic and industrial community, such as design and analysis of experiments in Genomics, dose ? finding studies, adaptive designs for clinical trials, event related fMRI, designs for linear, non-linear and generalized linear mixed models, screening experiments, computer experiments and multi ? stratum designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design and analysis of experiments is at the foundation of the scientific method. It is used in applications across all scientific disciplines and engineering. It is used throughout business and industry to improve the reliability of processes and equipment and to identify and understand how process factors affect output. It is used in many scientific disciplines such as in medicine, especially in the design of clinical trials, dose ? finding studies and biomedical experiments. The advancement of statistical theory and methodology over the past years has resulted in the development of sophisticated methods capable of analyzing complex experiments. This has given rise to a demand for efficient designs for these experiments. At the same time, a new generation of enthusiastic and talented researchers in design of experiments is needed in the years to come to carry out original theoretical and applied research in the emerging areas. The junior researchers of today need to be nurtured and encouraged to assume this role. The researchers in the area of experimental design from the Universities and industry will also get an opportunity to meet together and discuss problems of mutual interest. ICODOE-2011 will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, mainly minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>
