<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award creates an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in bio-innovation that will cultivate trainees? abilities to develop clinically relevant biomedical technologies and devices leading to commercial products.  This program couples research with entrepreneurship to develop graduates who can lead the creation of innovative and cost-effective solutions to complex biomedical problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Trainees will complete a bio-innovation curriculum that includes courses in entrepreneurship, marketing and intellectual property, and an FDA internship where they will learn device regulation and establish non-academic research collaborations. Business plans will be developed with colleagues in Tulane?s schools of Business, Law and Medicine. Research projects will center on drug delivery with application in regenerative medicine, biosensors or therapeutic materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project will provide exceptional opportunities to a wide variety of students. IGERT trainees will learn first-hand about entrepreneurship, intellectual property and regulation. Teamwork interactions will educate non-scientists about transformational research approaches. Historically underrepresented groups will be recruited through established relationships with diversity programs at Tulane University and through direct ties to SACNAS and Xavier University. Finally, the development of new technologies and devices will expand economic development and reinforce the burgeoning biomedical industry of the New Orleans region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated to innovations for societal benefit.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Graduate education in the sciences and engineering rarely offers the training and experiences necessary to fully prepare graduates to enter directly into non-academic research and leadership positions. We developed a new interdisciplinary PhD program in BioInnovation to challenge this paradigm by coupling research with entrepreneurship towards the career development goal of training graduates who can lead the creation of innovative and cost-effective solutions to complex biomedical problems at the interface of academia and industry. We used the NSF IGERT training program to cultivate and assess our trainee?s abilities to develop clinically relevant biomedical technologies and devices leading to marketable products. We evaluated our career development objective through a direct measurement of our students? post-graduate career success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Tulane?s new interdisciplinary PhD program in BioInnovation spans the Schools of Science and Engineering, Medicine, and Public Health and Tropical Medicine. Twenty-five IGERT-supported trainees completed our BioInnovation curriculum, and these students received direct mentorship by thirty-five faculty members within these schools. The BioInnovation curriculum includes courses in science and engineering, entrepreneurship, marketing, and intellectual property. Our program includes an FDA internship where trainees learn about the regulatory pathway and establish non-academic research collaborations. Business plans were developed with colleagues in Tulane?s schools of Business, Law and Medicine. Research projects centered on drug delivery with application in regenerative medicine, biosensors or therapeutic materials.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our project created new training approaches and experiences to more fully prepare PhD graduates to enter directly into non-academic research and leadership positions. To do so, this project created a tightly interwoven program that connects research and broad experiences to train individuals with ?<em>T-shaped?</em> skills. As such, our graduates have deep experience in an area of focus, and the breadth necessary to collaborate across disciplines with experts in other areas and to apply knowledge in areas of expertise other than their own. To do so, we connected three objectives: 1) Research, 2) Education, and 3) Community. Our Research objective provided the essential expertise in an area of focus, while Education and Community objectives provided the breadth that is essential to collaborate. Assessments by independent evaluators confirmed the efficacy of this approach and indicated that BioInnovation students positively affected the training of other graduate students in affiliated laboratories.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our students have been highly productive in terms of academia?s conventional scholarship metric, and this has resulted in the publication of nearly fifty manuscripts, with many more in development. Our trainee?s research provided the scientific capital that was used successfully to apply for project support for research translation to the marketplace. At least six projects have been funded, providing a total of $750k in additional research support.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our goal was to create an environment that would foster entrepreneurship linked to high-quality research, and the results were outstanding. Our IGERT trainees have been exceptionally active in this regard with our trainees receiving five $50,000 I-CORPS grants to support advanced investigation into customer discovery. In addition, our trainees were involved in national and international business model competitions that have helped to develop and translate their technology. Our students were winners of at least fifteen competitions, and awards provided substantial financial support for our students? entrepreneurship ventures.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our trainees have been highly effective in technology transfer and startup company development. To date, they have been awarded seven patents, and created two new companies:</p> <ul> <li>Bioaesthetics: a company developed to commercialize its nipple-areola graft (NACgraft biologic matrix)? a regenerative nipple graft for breast cancer survivors. </li> <li>Instapath: a company developing an integrated technology platform that automates the entire process of tissue histology and creates digital pathology images. </li> </ul> <p>Our trainees have successfully competed for substantial funding to support these companies through NSF SBIR (Phase I and II) and private sources.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, our career development goal was validated.
