<AbstractNarration>This work will utilize meso-scale analysis techniques to study indentation driven nucleation of dislocations in perfect crystals. In particular, the linear mechanical response of mesoscale regions, intermediate between the atomic scale and full system size, will be probed in order to search for embryonic defects.  Atomistic computer simulations will be performed using classical empirical potentials to study the process in a perfect thin-film under a smooth, nanometer-scale, indenter.  Furthermore, the nucleation phenomenon will be studied within a continuum framework, field dislocation mechanics (FDM).  Direct comparisons will be made with in-situ electron microscopy imaging during indentation of single-crystal Al.  The ultimate goal is to construct a simple analytical framework which would be able to predict thermal activation barriers governing nucleation given a few simple material parameters and geometrical loading conditions as inputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current state-of-the-art for predicting plastic deformation in ductile metals remains largely empirical and phenomenological.  A "first principles," bottom-up, quantitative understanding of plasticity would allow for the design of materials with optimal mechanical properties such as increased strength and toughness.  The work will also involve secondary education outreach co-ordinated through the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and targeted at under-represented populations in the urban core of Pittsburgh.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Intellectual merit:  This subject of this project was the initial creation of dislocations in perfect crystals during nano-indentation using atomistic computer simulations and theoretical analysis.  Nanoindentation is a mechanical test performed on materials by pushing hard atomic-scale probes into materials and measuring the force required to push a given distance.  It is the nano-scale analog of conventional hardness tests performed on materials at the macroscopic scale.  Dislocations are the defects in crystals which govern the mechanical response and allow for permanent (plastic) deformation.  The key object in the study was the dislocation embryo, the unstable motion responsible for initiating mechanical instability.  The outcomes were: + A set of scaling laws relating various properties of the embryo to the radius of curvature of the indenter, including: size of the embryo, location of the embryo, nominal indenter contact area at the point of nucleation. + A surprisingly robust validation of linear elastic contact mechanics up to the nucleation event.  + Verification that the scaling laws were general across a broad class of atomistic interaction potentials including realistic many-body embedded atom potentials representing Aluminum, simple pair potentials representing atoms interacting through van der Waals forces, and finally simple harmonic springs. + Verification that the scaling laws were general across arbitrary crystallographic indentation orientations. + Partial validation of a previously proposed nucleation criterion based on phonon stability + Development of a new stability criterion based on field dislocation mechanics + Discovery of a transition from dislocation mediated instability to a buckling-type instability governed by the indenter radius in thin films or free standing columns.  The work established a new set of important unsolved questions: + What underlying principles set the observed scaling laws for the embryo geometry? + How general are the scaling laws?  Do they extend to: fcc metals with potentials other than the ones the PIs studied (EAM-Aluminum)? bcc and hcp metals? complex alloys? ceramics?  Broader impact:  The scaling laws and nucleation criterion discovered in this work can be used as inputs to coarse-grained models of plasticity in metals.  The coarse-grained models can be used to predict mechanical response.  The award supported one graduate student who was mentored during the course of the work and successfully defended her dissertation at the end. The student was a woman. Women are particularly under-represented in both the subfields of solid mechanics and computational materials, and for this reason it was particularly impactful that a female graduate student was selected to work on this particular project. The PIs encouraged her to pursue an academic career path, and she has gone on to a post-doc position in a high caliber research group.  The student was very involved with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) throughout her graduate studies.  She participated in the SWE high school day event and demonstrated the formation of dislocations using breakfast cereal.  She devised the demonstration in consultation with the PIs as a way to get young women excited about potential future careers in STEM fields.
