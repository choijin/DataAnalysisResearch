<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project will address the challenge of introducing complexity in photonic slab arrangements. Vertical variation throughout the thickness of quasi-2D slabs will be introduced via colloidal processing under confinement. Freezing between two and three dimensions accesses structural transitions in gap regions incommensurate with integral layer spacing of thin particulate films. From confocal microscopy of fluorescent-shell modified particles in wedge cell geometry, the real space phase organization will be investigated as a function of particle morphology, system density and cell height. The synthesis of shape anisotropic colloids will be performed to prepare building blocks for unconventionally ordered solids in addition to crystals under the imposed packing constraints. Quantitative evaluation of order parameters and correlation functions determined experimentally and from Monte Carlo simulations of the confined states will inform simulation models to evaluate the optical properties of the slab patterns and their various inverse embodimentsÂ¯ for example, residual volume-, shell-, and skeleton inverse structures. Sol-gel and nanoparticle precursors for solution processing as well as vapor phase depositions will be applied in backfilling and co-assembly routes to inversion to obtain high-refractive index contrast. The project will enhance the understanding of how reduced symmetry, expanded dimensionality, and novel classes of partial order structuring impact light-matter interactions in photonic crystal slabs. To this aim, photonic band structures will be calculated and the relative influence of structural parameters such as positional ordering, orientation ordering, motif morphology, basis complexity, dielectric filling fraction, refractive index contrast on the behavior of photonic bands at high symmetry points in reciprocal space will be explored. Complimentary analysis of mode field distributions will be applied to rationalize the formation of full 2D photonic band gaps. A powerful experimental technique in its infancy for application to photonic slab structures will be used to confirm stop band and band gap frequencies, modified density of photonic states, in addition to the experimental field distribution of photonic modes. Namely, the Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy technique applied in a Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope will enable the photonic characterization at high spatial resolution. For investigation of refraction properties of the slabs, equal frequency contour plots will also be calculated and the light propagation in-plane through atypical structures will be simulated to determine frequency and directions for left-handed, right-handed, positive- and negative refraction behavior as a function of structural parameter variants. Point source imaging for appropriately indicated configurations defined by self-assembly will be studied to evaluate resolution in the flat lens application of the photonic slab materials. Through this project the structure-property-processing-performance relationships will be established. &lt;br/&gt; NonTechnical: This award will enhance undergraduate research opportunities for students in Historically Black Colleges and Universities as well as Women's Colleges. The PI plans to engage undergraduates to conduct research from these institutions through the REU programs associated with the Cornell Shared Facilities. Enrichment will also be offered through conference support for presenting research and for professional development workshops. Lasting relationships with researchers in the home institution will be sought for continued collaboration involving the visiting student and potentially providing additional recruiting opportunities to Cornell's graduate programs. An informal public education project is planned around a distributed research and "Science as Art" model to place images of materials research in public library exhibits which will promote the field. As well, the organization of seminar series hosted by URM graduate fellows to invite distinguished underrepresented minority (URM) faculty for research talks and professional development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Colloidal self-assembly offers a large scale, low cost approach where the particle dimensions are determined by synthesis and the basis complexity can be controlled using particle morphology.  High yield, monodisperse particle suspensions of many anisotropic shapes have become available. However, the understanding of how reduced symmetry, expanded dimensionality, and partial order impact light-matter interactions in photonic solids is lacking. These structure-property correlations are investigated through the NSF Award #DMR-1105243.  This work investiaged the photonic properties of arrangements that have been realized experimentally using wedge cell confinement with nonspherical colloidal particles, including dimers (two overlapping spheres) and cut-spheres (e.g., hemisphere, three-fourths of a sphere). These building blocks self-organize on periodic patterns such as rectangular and square, respectively.  The structures were modeled using photonic crystal slabs with finite height because they capture the true height limitations in fabricated systems. The allowed modes and forbidden frequencies (i.e., band gap) for photons were calculated as a function of the particle shape parameters and lattice symmetry.

Recent theroretical studies indicated that certain types of disorder enhance rather that destroy photonic properties.  This work focused on strudies of rotator mesophases with random rotational order and periodic positional order. Photonic band structure (i.e., frequency vs. wavevector) calculations indicate that the bands bounding the gaps maintain high isotropy with less that 1.6% change in frequency across the Brillouin zone.  Such bands may provide low group velocity and high density of states for amplifying non-linear effects, self-tuned lasing, increasing the efficiency of photocatalysis and light-harvesting in solar cells. Slow light properties in waveguide geometry are confirmed by time domain simulations and enhancement of 250% in electric field intensity above the initial amplitude was found.
