<AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;During embryonic development, the identity of cells in tissues and organs is determined by a series of asymmetric divisions. Cell asymmetry is controlled by two mechanisms: cell polarity and cytokinesis. Errors in these events often lead to changes in cell proliferation and growth. The plasma membrane and underlying cell cortex play an important role in cell polarity and cytokinesis, yet very little is known about how it is regulated and maintained during development. To address this issue, the project is focused on the protein dynamin, which has an essential role in both of these events. It is hypothesized that dynamin influences cell polarity and facilitates the temporal and spatial control of the cytokinesis machinery through its role in endocytosis and actin dynamics. This project will employ an interdisciplinary strategy to reveal the role of the dynamin using a combination of genetics, cell and molecular biology and high-resolution, in vivo microscopy techniques. The project will focus on the early divisions of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;The work outlined in this proposal will be used in numerous minority outreach opportunities and scientific art shows. The P.I., Dr. Ahna Skop has extensive experience with outreach to minority groups at the local, state and national levels. Through her consistent involvement in the SACNAS, AISES and MARC programs at New Mexico State University, she has contributed to a very positive trend in minority graduate student enrollment on the UW-Madison campus. The P.I.'s dedication to increasing and retaining minority, undergraduate and graduate students in the STEM fields is a priority, and part of her mission is to make science accessible to every race and group and welcome these students any chance she gets. In addition, the P.I. has continued to pursue the curation of various scientific art shows nationally and internationally, which inherently promote the beauty of science and provide public access to scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Cell division is an important event in the development of all multicellular species. It is a process that simply divides a cell into two equal or unequal cells. The mechanisms to regulate this simple event remains unclear on the cell and molecular level. We are interested in how RNA Binding Proteins mediate the final separation of the cells during division. The research supported by this award was designed to study the role of a gene called Ataxin-2. We studied the role of this gene in both the <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> embryo and also in <em>Drosophila</em> neurons. The results of our experiments gave us a number of new insights into how RNA binding proteins mediate the process of cell division, including how factors are targeted to the division site.&nbsp; We also uncovered a new role for these proteins in mediating Endoplasmic Reticulum morphology during mitosis, suggesting that Endoplasmic Reticulum disruption in Ataxin-2 mutated cells may lead to age-related neurodegeneration. Our broader impacts have been extensive, including undergraduate research opportunities, scientific art collaborations, social media engagement, and public outreach events for local and Wisconsin middle and high school students at the Wisconsin Science Festival, for example. My lab works directly with the Wisconsin Science Musuem to produce displays and events for the Wisconsin community in the form of pop-ups and installation at the musuem. My lab is also actively involved with SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science) and I serve as the UW-Madison SACNAS chapter advisor. Lastly, this award funded the summer research of four underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students, including a summer student from Puerto Rico.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Ahna&nbsp;R&nbsp;Skop</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1158003/1158003_10177240_1532978144726_MidbodyCake-Best-1024x614--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1158003/1158003_10177240_1532978144726_MidbodyCake-Best-1024x614--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Midbody cake"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1158003/1158003_10177240_1532978144726_MidbodyCake-Best-1024x614--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Midbody cake"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cell in the process of dividing.
