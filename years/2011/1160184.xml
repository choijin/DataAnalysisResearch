<AbstractNarration>1160184/1160117   &lt;br/&gt;Mayfield/Nikolov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scalable and low-cost production platforms are of growing importance for the development of affordable recombinant protein molecules.  This is especially true in the case of complex recombinant proteins that are often difficult and expensive to produce in commercial protein production platforms, such as mammalian cell culture and E. coli.  Protein production by mammalian cell cultures is still expensive because of stringent nutritional and growth requirements, specialized bioreactor design and environmental conditions, coupled with often low expression levels.  E. coli, although able to produce large quantities of protein inexpensively, is generally inefficient at producing properly folded, complex proteins as soluble molecules.  The single-cell eukaryotic alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has simple growth requirements (light, carbon dioxide, and salts) and its use as a production platform for complex recombinant proteins combines many of the most advantageous features of fermentation and cell cultures.  The specific features of C. reinhardtii chloroplast expression include: rapid generation of stably transformed master cell lines, efficient mammalian protein folding in a non-reducing environment, a host metabolism that is tolerant of "difficult-to-express" proteins, a low propensity for undesirable post-translational modifications and formation of insoluble aggregates, cell doubling times under 10 h using completely defined protein-free inorganic media, demonstrated scalability, and absence of endotoxin  and mammalian virus contamination.  We have already demonstrated that C. reinhardtii is able to produce complex, multi-domain proteins that cannot be efficiently expressed in and purified from other heterologous systems.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the expression and purification of two unique and therapeutically important recombinant proteins that will serve to demonstrate the utility of the platform, and that could have high-impact provided they can be produced and purified at a competitive cost.  To develop C. reinhardtii as a broad and competitive platform for producing a unique class of recombinant proteins, the interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise will address challenges related to protein production, recovery, and purification.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop technologies and processes for an efficient, rapid, and scalable recombinant protein production platform for using C. reinhardtii.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Algae are among the most ancient and diverse organisms on the planet.  Algae evolved to adapt to a wide range of environments and consequently have proven to be a rich source of genetic and chemical diversity. This diversity has been exploited as a unique source of bioactive compounds, including antioxidants, omega 3 fatty acids, and novel therapeutic drugs. In addition, algae have also proven to be cost-effective and safe hosts for producing a wide array of recombinant proteins, including human and animal therapeutics, and industrial enzymes.  These attributes make algae a potential economic and renewable source of a wide range of bioproducts including biofuels, nutraceuticals, industrial enzymes, and therapeutic proteins. However, optimization of strains for commercial production is still required to make microalgae economically viable at scale.  Algae possess a suite of characteristics that make them ideal hosts for production of high-value bioproducts and biofuels. In particular, the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a rapid doubling time, sequenced and transformable genomes, and eukaryotic machinery to fold and post-translationally modify complex human proteins.  Algae are photosynthetic, can be grown in closed containers, are not susceptible to transmissible human or animal diseases, and can potentially produce high-value protein products several orders of magnitudes cheaper than mammalian cultures.   We are developing the tools that will allow algae to become an economically viable, sustainable, and renewal source of bio-prducts.
