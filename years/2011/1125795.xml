<AbstractNarration>Speech is, in many respects, a socially constructed behavior, a fact which has important policy as well as scientific implications since a range of public policies affect the degree of racial and economic segregation found in all aspects of American life. Previous research in sociolinguistics has documented substantial variation in language patterns across social class lines, and across neighborhoods of different socio-economic and racial compositions as well. However it is important to note that this observed variation in language patterns across neighborhoods need not reflect the causal influences of neighborhood environments themselves. Many families have at least some degree of choice about where they live. Neighborhood attributes could be correlated with speech patterns simply because certain types of families wind up selecting to live (or being selected by housing agencies to live) in particular neighborhoods. This study offers a rare opportunity to understand the causal effects of neighborhood social environments on speech through the inclusion of speech and language measures as part of the large-scale data collection carried out for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Moving to Opportunity (MTO) residential mobility experiment. Between 1994 and 1998, MTO enrolled a sample of low-income African-American and Latino families living in public housing and randomly assigned the chance to use a housing voucher to move to lower-poverty areas, while others received no additional mobility assistance. Speech measures were collected as part of the 10-15 year follow-up study of MTO adults and youth. In the current project, sociolinguist John R. Rickford of Stanford and economist Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago will explore the linguistic correlates of HUD's large-scale social experiment. The findings could inform our understanding of the long-term effects of geographic dislocation on displaced populations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many African Americans and Latina/os who live in poor US neighborhoods speak very non-standard or vernacular varieties of English, sometimes pronouncing "teeth" as teef,  for instance, or saying Didn' nobody leave instead of "Nobody left." Although these vernacular ways of speaking are systematic, related to these groups' history, and valuable as identity markers and expressive resources, they can also trigger discrimination in schools, courts, job and apartment searches.  The "Neighborhood Moves and Sociolinguistic Mobility" project began in July 2011 to see whether moving poor African American and Latino families to neighborhoods that were not quite as poor would make their speech more versatile, and increase their ability to switch to Standard or Mainstream English when necessary.   Our project was a subset of a larger "Moving to Opportunity" [MTO] project, funded by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], to see whether similar moves would enhance the lives of the moved populations in other ways (e.g. health, education, crime).  For our inguistic project, 1200 African Americans and 500 Latina/o speakers were studied between 1994 and 2008/2012 in five MTO cities: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. They were divided into an Experimental Group, who was given vouchers to move to Lower Poverty neighborhoods, and a Control Group, which was not given vouchers. We studied (a) their free speech (in response to questions, e.g. about the Happiest moments they could remember), (b) their ability to repeat sentences in Standard English, and (c) their ability to read a short text, "Ray and his Cat Come Back."  Our most important and interesting finding, written up and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS1500176112, published 9.8.2015) is that, of the 629 non-Hispanic African American youth in our study, those in the Experimental group showed a marginally significant reduction (about 3 percentage points) in their use of features of African American Vernacular English over the period of the study, compared with youth in the Control group.  The MTO effect on AAVE use is about half of that between youth whose parents have a high school diploma and those who do not.  And to the extent that AAVE use affects income, this neighborhood effect could increase lifetime earnings by approximately $18,000 per individual (~3 to 4% of lifetime income).     It is difficult to say exactly what aspects of the neighborhood social environment led to the changes in AAVE/SE use over time (maybe the presence of more highly educated adults, better and more integrated schools, differences in social network and so on).  And tit is likely that the youth who use less AAVE in their relatively formal interview speech use more AAVE in animated conversations with family and friends.  But the experiment does seem to establish that their linguistic versatility and code switching ability has been increased, which is theoretically interesting for linguists studying the factors that influence language variation and change, and practically interesing for social scientists and policy makers seeking to enhance the life chances of the poor.  While highlighting our most striking success, it should be noted where we did NOT find significant differences between the Experimental and Control Groups:  among Latinas/os, among adult African Americans, and in the sentence repetition and reading components of our study.  The non-signifcant effect among adults may be partly due to the fact that adults in general show less ability to learn new dialects and languages than children and teenagers do, and the limited effect among Latinas/os may be due in part to the smallness of the sample (500 Latinas/os, vs. 1200 for African Americans).  It is also possible that with longer free speech samples (e.g. an hour long, vs. three to five minutes) we would find more robust effects of moving to a better/lower poverty neighborhood. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
