<AbstractNarration>Conventional climate models continue to struggle to properly represent large-scale tropical moist convective systems including convectively coupled equatorial waves) and the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). Because these disturbances have global impacts on weather and climate through atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections, this casts a shadow of doubt on the reliability of climate prediction on different timescales ranging from intraseasonal to seasonal and longer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project has the goals of improving understanding of the dynamics of these disturbances, and enhancing the ability to simulate them by using a new Lagrangian atmospheric model that simulates atmospheric circulations by predicting motions of individual air parcels. Educational impacts of this project will include further development of climate modeling capabilities at Yale and Susquehanna Universities, which will benefit both undergraduate and graduate students by introducing them to cutting edge techniques in atmospheric modeling and convective parametrization. In addition there is a plan to educate the general public about the fundamentals of weather and climate modeling. Thus the project has substantial broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provided funding for a faculty member at an undergraduate-only institution and three undergraduate students, over four years, to significantly contribute to a collaborative research project on the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The three undergraduate students were Computer Science, Ecology, and Earth and Environmental Sciences majors, respectively.  The MJO is a phenomenon in the tropical atmosphere in which a large-scale "envelope" of clouds and rainfall, 10,000 km wide, moves slowly eastward from the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific over a 15-30 day period, and is followed by a similarly sized but unusually dry area which moves eastward on the same time scale. The entire oscillation occurs over a period of 30-70 days.  Although the MJO has been studied since it was first observed in the early 1970Ã†s, its size, speed, and onset mechanisms are still not well understood. Sophisticated global climate models do not yet represent the MJO well, so research is being done to understand why.  Our work provided historical observations of the MJO with which to compare model runs generated by a novel Lagrangian Atmospheric Model (LAM), which is an unusually low-resolution global model. We analyzed 34 years of daily radiosonde data from 150+ tropical stations, which were then composited into MJO structures representing the developing, mature, and dissipating stages of a typical MJO event. Our results show a clear circumnavigating wind and temperature signal that precedes MJO events in the Indian Ocean, suggesting that the initiation of many MJO events is triggered by the previous event.  These in-situ observations were then compared with model runs of the LAM. Despite the fact that the LAM treats clouds in a significantly different manner than traditional global climate models, and runs at a much lower resolution, it is able to reproduce observations of the MJO much better than most sophisticated models. Because of its simplicity, we can better understand why the LAM produces MJOs. It appears that both the circumnavigating signal and the simulated MJOÃ†s ability to respond to large-scale differences in moisture and upward motion are important features regulating the MJOÃ†s periodicity.

Our research helped to redefine the utility of these different measures, which will be helpful moving forward as others try to better understand the MJO.  Research from this project was presented at conferences of the American Geophysical Union, the American Meteorological Society, the Center for Multiscale Modeling of Atmospheric Processes, and the Landmark Symposium.
