<AbstractNarration>PI: Pease, Leonard&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1125490&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a key role in the processing of nutrients, absorption of pharmaceuticals and protection of the body from disease. Despite the importance of GI tract permeability to each of these processes, very little is understood about how mechanical motion of this organ (e.g. peristalsis) affects its permeability. Here we address this gap in our knowledge by systematically studying the influence of peristalsis on molecular and nanoparticle transport through the esophageal wall. Although our long-term goal is to understand permeability throughout the GI tract and its role in disease and disease interventions, our initial focus and the focus of this BRIGE application is on permeability of the esophagus because the esophagus is chronically understudied relative to other portions of the GI tract, yet relatively more accessible through esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD or endoscopy). We evaluate the hypothesis that peristalsis enhances permeability and that esophageal permeability is size dependent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This application is intellectually meritorious because it provides the first quantitative and mechanistic framework to evaluate the influence of pressure driven &amp; stress driven pericellular perfusion (associated with peristalsis) on the transit of disease markers (e.g. the protein MBP-1), pharmaceutical agents, and nanoparticles of various sizes through the esophageal wall. The proposed systematic treatment couples experimental exploration with quantitative theory to provide comprehensive and quantitative insights into the biophysical mechanisms governing esophageal permeability. This work is critical to understanding the role of peristalsis in the etiology and pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases including eosinophilic esophagitis, a rapidly emerging orphan disease. The PI has full access to the resources of affiliated departments, the Health Sciences Core Facilities, and Center for Comparative Medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research program will have a variety of broad impacts.&lt;br/&gt;First, the proposed project will provide a quantitative infrastructure to design treatments to a variety of GI tract diseases ranging from esophageal diseases to autoimmune diseases including Crone?s diseases, where the esophageal lining is also compromised. The program will begin to elucidate the scientific principles necessary to understand the biological fate of environmental nanoparticles within the GI tract and the potential of nanoparticles as oral medicinal agents. The improved understanding of esophageal function will be broadly disseminated through high impact factor journal publications and public presentations. A key feature of the broadening participation plan is the inclusion of aspiring women and minority engineers, who will be invited to present their research at national meetings to reward their efforts, stimulate their excitement toward future research, and recognize their connectivity to other women and minorities in science. The graduate and undergraduates students funded through this proposal will be selected from underrepresented groups to broaden their participation. Women, Black, Hispanic, and Native American students will be specifically invited to apply for the positions this proposal creates. They will be asked to present their work in courses taught by the PI and to MESA clubs to provide direct role models for other underrepresented students. The proposed research will enhance the partnership between Chemical Engineering and the Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy. The proposed effort enlightens medicine by providing a better understanding of the function of normal and diseased esophageal models and enhances engineering by providing quantitative analysis of mass transport of biological</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a key role in the processing of nutrients, absorption of pharmaceuticals, and the protection of the body from disease and environmental challenges.  Despite the importance of GI tract permeability to each of these processes, very little is understood about how mechanical motion of this organ (e.g. peristalsis) affects its permeability.  Through this grant mechanism, we began to evaluate the relationship between peristalsis and permeability.  The results of this initial two-year grant suggest that peristalsis does indeed increase permeability.  Mathematical models that quantitatively explore peristalsis and relate peristalsis to transport within the esophagus, as an example GI tract organ, have been generated.  These models explore the role of mucus layers, the magnitude and rate of peristaltic contractions on permeability, and penetration of contrast agents into the esophageal wall.  These models suggest that permeability may be enhanced, explaining recent experimental findings of enhanced permeability through a variety of mucus membranes throughout the body.  Furthermore, initial experiments were performed to determine how permeability of the GI tract changes upon exposure to invading white blood cells.  The permeability of tissue increases upon exposure to the protein major basis protein 1 (MBP-1), one of the primary proteins released by eosinophils, and arguably an essential step in the development of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a rapidly emerging orphan disease.  The results of this grant have been used subsequently to advance a new contrast agent to monitor EoE into initial clinical trials with promising initial results.  So much more remains to be accomplished at this vitally important interface between engineering and medicine for which this grant has been foundational!     Through this grant mechanism, several students were trained including aspiring women and minority engineers who in turn inspired other K12 students to pursue STEM topics.  The PI took several students to the AIChE annual meeting, where undergraduate students presented their cutting edge work in the general sessions usually reserved for faculty and graduate students.  Their presentations were very well received.  High quality journal articles were published with integrity with more in preparation.  As a highlight, the PI with a student supported on this grant received the William H. Corcoran Award, a best paper award in Chemical Engineering Education.
