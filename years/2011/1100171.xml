<AbstractNarration>The main goal in this collaborative research project is to advance the state of the art in realistic robot simulation by developing reasonably accurate contact models for rigid body dynamics that are both robustly and efficiently solvable.  Since the times of Newton and Leibniz, the modeling of rigid body dynamics has been a tremendous success story.  However, when rigid bodies come into contact and when that contact includes Coulomb friction, standard force-acceleration models sometimes fail.  In such cases, a smooth solution is theoretically not even possible.  A set of contact models that address this problem has been developed, derived from the well-established Signorini-Fichera (S-F) complementarity conditions.  However, there is some evidence that these conditions are not accurate for impacting (rather than smoothly contacting) rigid bodies.  This project will investigate situations in which the complementarity conditions are called into question, and will develop a new approach to address three critical shortcomings, present in varying degrees in state of the art contact models: (i.) their exponential worst-case solution times; (ii.) their inability to find solutions even though one exists; (iii.) their numerical brittleness. This project will investigate and evaluate new contact models that, by virtue of eliminating complementarity conditions, may not suffer from these shortcomings; in tandem, the project will use elastodynamic finite element analysis and physical experimentation in order to evaluate model accuracy for impacting rigid bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will impact a broad range of technologies, including aerospace, manufacturing, and civil engineering. In the near term, the project will enable the simulation of complex robot environments that help roboticists fine-tune both mechanical design and control algorithms.  The computational models developed will be made public via the open-source Moby dynamics library. Additionally, participation in STEM is broadened through mentoring of students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The general goals of this project are to understand the trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and numerical consistency of models of collisions and sliding useful for dynamic robotic simulations. Overall, this concerns using Newton's laws to predict how things will move, in particular, things that have collisions. This is useful for robotics, where feet hit the ground and where hands make contact with objects, and for the simulations of machines and, say, aglomerations of particles (like sand).   Newton's laws are accurate enough for accurate modeling of mechanical phenomena,  with errors  of parts per billion .  And computer arithmetic is accurate enough (with errors of parts per million billion). But the properties of objects are not known so accurately, especially the properties associated with collisions.  In elementary calculations these are represented by a coefficient of friction and a coefficient of restitution.  But these two 'constants' are not constant, and calculations using them will be off by large amounts, like a factor of two. So, despite the accuracy of Newton's laws and the accuracy of computer arithmetic, computer calculations of the motions of machines and robots, if they involve intermittent contact,  are not accurate.   The goal of this project is to consider various collision laws that a computationally tracatable (can be calculated quickly) and consider their relative accuracies.  My (Andy Ruina's) role in this computational project  is/was as a mechanics consultant. My funding was a small fraction of the grant total.  The reports from the other PI's are a more comprehensive summary of the outcomes of the project as a whole.   My contributions were primarily with helping the other PIs with understanding mechanics issues, and these are not results, per se.  The outcomes of the project due directly to this PI are related to two previously-little known results:  1) that setting the coefficient of friction to infinity is not the same as requiring no slip;  and 2) that the no-slip boundary condition is self-inconsistent (can lead to paradoxes).   I believe I am the first to realize that these two are two aspects of the same phenomenon.  This then suggests that in situations where slip is maximally inhibited it should be described with an infinite coefficient of friction (the no-slip boundary condition must not  be used, or used only with care).  And that slip is to be expected, sometimes, even when maximally inhibited.  That is, slip with infinite friction is a reasonable possibility in simulations. This realization should help simplify simulations of mechanical systems for better prediction and control.   Again, for the project as a whole, the outcomes reported by the other PI's reflect the final outcomes of the project as a whole.
