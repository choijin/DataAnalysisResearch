<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EPS-1101317&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Adaptation to Climate Change in the Lake Champlain Basin:&lt;br/&gt;New Understanding through Complex Systems Modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Vermont &amp; State Agricultural College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Director: Judith Van Houten&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) proposal from Vermont EPSCoR (VT EPSCoR) is focused on understanding the effects of changing climate and land use on the Lake Champlain Basin through the creation of two centers, the Center for Research on Adaptation to Climate Change (RACC) and the Center for Workforce Development and Diversity (CWDD). Funded participants include Johnson State College (JSC), Middlebury College (MC), St. Michael?s College (SMC), and University of Vermont (UVM). The Community College of Vermont (CCV) is an unfunded partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will build transdisciplinary teams of social and natural scientists to study the Lake Champlain Basin as a coupled human and natural system affected by climate change, with an emphasis on complex systems modeling. Scientists will investigate the relative importance of endogenous in-lake processes (e.g. internal loading, ice cover, and hydrodynamics) versus exogenous to-lake processes (e.g. land use change, snow/rain timing, storm intensity, land management) to algal blooms. Scientists will use extensive scenario testing to investigate how adaptive management can be designed and implemented to respond to climate change and land use. The central theme of ecosystem and water research aligns well with Vermont State Science and technology (S&amp;T plan), as well as national and international interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project will address how the interaction of climate change and land use alter hydrological processes and nutrient transport within the Lake Champlain Basin, and investigate the resulting implications for adaptive management strategies. The RACC will leverage existing watershed studies and biophysical and add significant value through its integration of those studies with socio-economic and governance studies. The project will combine extensive observations and monitoring with modeling of two of the contributing watersheds and 10 smaller catchments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Management of water resources in response to climate and land use changes is a scientific issue that has broad applicability across the US and internationally. The project?s multi-scale approach has the potential to be broadly applicable, in that it includes the investigation of broader global environmental issues of climate change, urban/agricultural change, and the socio-ecological interfaces. The project will be continuing VT?s very successful Streams project for outreach to high school students and teachers and undergraduates, which has shown a significant impact in workforce development and in encouraging underrepresented minorities in STEM to pursue science careers. The CWDD will integrate workforce and diversity efforts, and will offer an extensive suite of approaches to outreach to the general public and work with small businesses to encourage economic development across the state.</AbstractNarration>

In Missisquoi Bay, sediment P is replenished every spring resulting in persistent high water P levels and harmful algal blooms in summer. &nbsp;</p> <p>We were able to offer to policy makers &ldquo;scenario testing&rdquo; through a platform that integrates our set of interacting models of the watershed, lake, and basin residents and managers. We call this the IAM (Integrated Assessment Model). &nbsp;We provided scenarios to policy makers of the effects of proposed policy changes given three climate change models of the future, 20 years, 40 years and farther into the future.</p> <p>The IAM connects land use, hydrology, climate and lake models that we have refined for years to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to each other and share information between them at so that we can simulate the future conditions &nbsp;of the watershed under various policy and climate scenarios. &nbsp;The most important output from the integration of the models is a visual display of the predicted algal blooms in the Missisquoi Bay. &nbsp;A recent paper [Zia, Asim et al, ERL (2016)] that demonstrates the seamless-model-coupling of the IAM highlights our most significant outcome, which we regard as the crowning achievement of the last five years of research work. &nbsp;We have chosen to focus on Missisquoi Bay because of its problems with blooms and because it epitomizes the international management of the Basin. &nbsp;</p> <p>The current outputs of the IAM are for the predicted results for algal blooms in 2020 and 2040 using climate models that reflect three levels of the state of carbon and warming: &nbsp;hopeful reductions in carbon, status quo emission and more rapid warming due to enhanced carbon emission. The IAM l also evaluates land use scenarios that promote agriculture, urbanization, and reforestation. &nbsp;We have no way of knowing exactly how climate and land use will change in the future. Therefore, the IAM output cannot be interpreted as an absolute. &nbsp;Rather, it can be used to test different sets of data to help us envision what might lie ahead depending on the decisions that we make today. &nbsp;</p> <p>We also have robust private sector outreach, workforce development and educational outreach programs. &nbsp;The VT EPSCoR Center for Workforce Development and Diversity (VT EPSCoR CWDD) is located at Saint Michael&rsquo;s College. &nbsp;From 2011-2015, RACC has engaged 536 Vermont participants, which includes 27 new jobs and 54 Pilot/Private sector awards. Partners from four Vermont institutions (University of Vermont, Saint Michael&rsquo;s College, Middlebury College and Johnson State College) are also major stakeholders. &nbsp;Eight graduate students and 8 post doctoral associates were funded in addition to one graduate student working with entrepreneurs at the Vermont Center for Emerging Technologies.</p> <p>The VT EPSCoR CWDD integrates students and teachers into RACC research while increasing the diversity of participants including students who are under-represented in STEM research; veterans, economically disadvantaged, first generation, racial minorities and disabled. In 2015-2016, 48 undergraduate students received summer research funding, 41 high school students participated in research, 19 high school teachers received research stipends, and 6 middle school teachers connected with the research program to augment their curricula.
