<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to achieve three major goals. &lt;br/&gt;1. To synthesize data from the BEST-BSIERP coordinated programs in the Bering Sea and data from other sources, collected during the same time period (2007-2010), via modeling and data assimilation. Two joint data assimilation systems will be applied to reconstruct the physical oceanographic fields of the eastern Bering ice-ocean system. The first system will be configured to reconstruct the large-scale circulation in the eastern Bering Sea and to accurately describe the large-scale processes in the South Eastern Bering Sea Shelf. The second will be configured for the eastern Bering Sea Shelf and will explicitly resolve eddy and tidal dynamics, thus leading to a better understanding of the nonlinear interaction processes between the deep basin and the shelf region of the eastern Bering Sea. &lt;br/&gt;2. To analyze the reconstructed fields and identify processes important for causing observed variability. &lt;br/&gt;3. To determine the impact of assimilating data with different origins on the estimation of near-surface transports of volume, momentum, heat, and material. This will be accomplished through adjoint sensitivity analysis. Results will help optimize Bering Sea mooring observations in future studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bering Sea is the largest commercial and subsistence fishery of the United States.  Management of this fishery in the face of ongoing climate variability requires an understanding of all the processes impacting the fishery.  Amongst these are the changing water temperature, which influences the growth rate of fish, and the current field, which carries fish eggs and larvae from their spawning regions to their nursery grounds.  This project will contribute to an understanding of how these fields change in response to other external forcing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The eastern Bering Sea (EBS) supports the United States' most valuable fisheries, immense populations of marine birds and mammals, and subsistence activities of Native communities. This extraordinarily productive ecosystem is vulnerable to the significant climate variability that has occurred over recent decades. To assess the vulnerability of this ecosystem, it is essential to understand how the eastern Bering Sea physical and ecological dynamics responds to climate change. Since 2007, two major research programs have been launched: the Bering Sea Ecosystem STudy (BEST), supported by the NSF, and the Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (BSIERP), supported by the NPRB. The BEST-BSIERP research has yielded an unprecedented number of observations of sea ice, the ocean, and the ecosystem in the EBS.  Intellectual Merit: The rich collection of BEST-BSIERP observations and other sources of data provide an excellent opportunity for synthesis through modeling and Data Assimilation (DA) to improve our understanding of changes in the physical forcings of the Bering ecosystem in response to climate change. As part of the NSF BEST program, this collaborative research project was aimed to develop two joint DA systems for the EBS.  These two joint DA systems consist of the Bering Ecosystem STudy ice-ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (BESTMAS) linked to the Semi-Implicit Ocean Model (SIOM) four-dimensional variational (4DVar) DA system and to the Regional Ocean Modeling SystemÆs (ROMS) DA system. They were used as a tool to maximize the impact of BEST-BSIERP research by synthesizing the BEST-BSIERP data and data from other sources via modeling and DA, and therefore to enhance our understanding of climate variability and change in the EBS sea ice&ndash;ocean system.  Broader Impacts: Three collaborating teams were involved in this project: lead PI Dr. Gleb Panteleev at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (SIOM), PI Dr. Alexandr Kurapov at Oregon State University (ROMS), and PI Dr. Jinlun Zhang at the University of Washington (BESTMAS).

In particular, the SIOM 4DVar DA system is able to provide gridded data sets that are physically consistent and constrained to the observations of sea ice and ocean parameters.  This project also contributed, fully or partially, to 11 journal publications, 2 book chapters, and 34 oral or poster presentations at scientific conferences (also see http://people.iarc.uaf.edu/~gleb/best_reanalysis/final_report/final_report.htm). These publications and presentations inform the scientific community and general public of our research results, including the variability of Pacific water outflow at Bering Strait, the abrupt climate changes and emerging ice-ocean processes in the Pacific Arctic region and the Bering Sea, the high-resolution circulation pattern in the EBS seen in observations and model simulations, and changes in ocean temperature and salinity in the cold and warm periods that the EBS has experienced in recent years. In particular, in an inverse study of the circulation in the EBS over the BEST-BSIERP period of 2007&ndash;2010 using the SIOM 4DVar DA system driven by BESTMAS forcing, a great deal of BEST-BSIERP and other sources of observations were used, including data from 19 moorings deployed on the EBS shelf and in Bering Strait, 1705 hydrographic stations made during eight surveys, and remotely sensed sea surface temperature and sea surface height. The infusion of these observations into the SIOM 4DVar DA system helps to accurately...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
