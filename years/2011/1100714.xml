<AbstractNarration>The principle investigator will study properties of the Loewner differential equation.  More specifically, via conformal maps the Loewner equation provides a correspondence between increasing families of 2-dimensional sets and continuous 1-dimensional functions (called driving functions). The nature of this correspondence is not well understood and is the source of several questions. How, for example, do properties of the driving functions affect the 2-dimensional growth? And how is 2-dimensional geometry converted into 1-dimensional data? One of the ways in which this work will address these questions is by studying how deformations of the driving function affect the corresponding geometry.  A further goal of this research is to build on the exciting recent probabilistic work involving the Loewner equation and to explore deterministic properties that can be recovered from the current probabilistic understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Loewner differential equation is a long-standing tool in complex analysis.  In the past ten years, a new use of the Loewner equation has attracted attention not only inside complex analysis, but also in probability and theoretical physics: the Loewner equation is an integral part of the random processes called Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE).  Introduced by O. Schramm in 2000, these processes have been a tool in the solution of several open problems of interest to both mathematicians and theoretical physicists.  This research will lead to a deeper comprehension of the Loewner equation and will further the work in this collaborative field.  In addition, this project will contribute to human resource development in the training and mentoring of undergraduate students, with a goal of encouraging a broader participation of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This NSF project supported research on the Loewner differential equation and the training of undergraduate students. The Loewner equation, a long-standing tool in complex analysis, has attracted significant attention not only in complex analysis, but also in probability and theoretical physics.  In fact, the Loewner equation is an integral part of the random processes called Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE).  Introduced by Oded Schramm in 2000, these processes have been a tool in the solution of several open problems of interest to both mathematicians and theoretical physicists.   The research supported by this project has deepened our understanding of the Loewner equation, which has proven to be a significant tool in both mathematics and physics.  More specifically, the Loewner equation provides a correspondence between increasing families of 2-dimensional sets and continuous 1-dimensional functions (called driving functions). The nature of this correspondence was not well understood and was the source of many questions. How, for example, do properties of the driving functions affect the 2-dimensional growth? And how is 2-dimensional geometry converted into 1-dimensional data? The supported work addressed this problem by clarifying relationships between the geometry of the 2-dimensional sets and properties of the driving functions. This work has been presented at a variety of conferences and will appear in publications including "Loewner Curvature" (joint with Steffen Rohde) and "Regularity of Loewner Curves" (joint with Huy Tran.)  Another benefit of this project was human resource development in the training and mentoring of undergraduate students.  The PI worked with six undergraduate students on research projects (4 women, 2 men).  Many of these students spoke about their research at undergraduate research conferences, two wrote about their work in undergraduate honors theses, and one has submitted a paper about her results for publication.  Of the six students, three have gone on to graduate school in mathematics, one is working as an actuary, and the two most recent graduates plan to pursue STEM careers.
