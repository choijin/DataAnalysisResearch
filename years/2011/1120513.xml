<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit of Project: Trafficking of regulatory proteins into the cell nucleus, where genetic information is stored and processed, is fundamental to the organization and functioning of all living cells. Not surprisingly, this cellular traffic control is highly regulated and is directed by special signals called nuclear localization signals (NLS's), found within proteins destined for the nucleus. The NLS's directly interact with special transport proteins called importins that help guide the cargo into the nucleus. This project explores the signals regulating traffic control of thyroid hormone receptors, essential proteins which either activate or silence the expression of target genes in response to thyroid hormone, and play a pivotal role in development and metabolism. Specifically, the project will determine: 1) which importin serves as the primary carrier for the two NLS's in the thyroid hormone receptor; 2) the role that multiple NLS's play in regulating thyroid hormone receptor distribution and functional diversification, and 3) whether protein turn-over and routing to the proteasome, a special cellular component that acts like a garbage disposal system, play a role in thyroid hormone receptor trafficking. The thyroid hormone receptor provides an excellent model system for studying the role of multiple import and export signals in mediating traffic control of key regulatory proteins in the cell. This research will enhance general understanding of NLS structure and function, refine predictive tools, and provide insight into how a dynamic balance between nuclear import, retention, and degradation of regulatory proteins modulates the expression of essential genes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of Project: A fruitful collaboration with faculty and undergraduates at Hampton University, an HBCU, will be continued. Opportunity for a diversity of undergraduates to gain hands-on experience with the scientific process will be provided. In the wider context, new techniques will be introduced to the departmental confocal microscope user group, and research activities will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course taught each Fall. Master's students will have the opportunity to gain experience in lab management and to develop their teaching skills through training and supervising undergraduates in the lab. This project will contribute substantially to human resource development in science, by preparing undergraduates and graduate students to go on to other graduate programs, medical school, veterinary school, secondary education, and industry, to name a few. In particular, this project will enhance the professional development of participants from groups underrepresented in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Trafficking of regulatory proteins into and out of the cell nucleus, where genetic information is stored and processed, is fundamental to the function of all living cells. This project explored the signals regulating traffic control of the thyroid hormone receptor, an essential protein which either activates or represses the expression of its target genes in response to thyroid hormone. By mediating the cellular response to thyroid hormone, the thyroid hormone receptor plays a pivotal role in the development, growth, and metabolism of many animals, including humans. In cancer and endocrine disorders this highly regulated traffic control may be disrupted. We have described in detail the mechanisms regulating the intricate journey of the thyroid hormone receptor from the cytoplasm where it is synthesized, to the nucleus where it functions. Our comprehensive, systematic analysis identified two nuclear localization signals (specific sequence of the amino acid subunits that comprise a protein) and multiple nuclear export signals within the thryoid hormone receptor that interact with a specific suite of transport factors. Our findings reveal how a dynamic balance between nuclear import, nuclear retention, and nuclear export is central to coordinating cell signaling and gene expression. Undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds were engaged first-hand in the process of science, and fruitful collaborations were developed with faculty at Hampton University, a local historically black university. Four research articles, one review, and one invited book chapter report on work performed with undergraduate and graduate student coauthors from William &amp; Mary and Hampton University.
