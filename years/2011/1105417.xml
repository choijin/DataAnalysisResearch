<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is easy to perfectly tile a flat surface with hexagons, as in parks and playgrounds and bathroom floors. But when you try to tile a curved surface, the hexagonal tiling is frustrated and the defects, for example pentagons, are essential for relieving the stresses and strains. Witness the 12 pentagons required to close an otherwise hexagonally tiled geodesic dome, or a soccer ball or a C60 molecule. The present study introduces a unique system whereby particles bound to a surface of arbitrary curvature solve the geometric problem and create a relaxed structure with defects arranged optimally. The study involves colloidal particles, thirty times smaller than a human hair, which arrange themselves on different shaped water droplets a tenth of a millimeter in diameter. The particles are imaged microscopically and added or moved with focused light, optical tweezers. Students working on this project are trained in the latest optical techniques. The video imaging of defects and their dynamics in crystals is a great pedagogical tool for instructing students and researchers at all levels as to the basic properties of liquids and solids. Since geometry is important for structures at all length scales these results will be important for designing new molecules, for assembling nano and colloidal particles and for engineering new architectural structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology plays a crucial role in the geometry and order of materials and topological defects, disclinations and dislocations, determine many of the mechanical properties of crystals. Curvature tends to frustrate periodic order, and here topological defects play an important role in relieving the resulting stresses and strains. Witness the 12 pentagons required to close an otherwise hexagonally tiled geodesic dome, or a soccer ball or a C60 molecule, curvature requires the introduction of topological defects, pentagons - disclinations, which force reorientation. But within the past several years it has been realized that although topology constrains the net number of defects it is energetics that dictates the actual arrangements. The present study introduces a system and a number of techniques to experimentally observe and manipulate mobile colloidal particles which are bound to an arbitrarily curved surface oil-water interface. Students involved will be trained in the latest soft matter and optical techniques. The video images are great pedagogically for students and researchers at all levels. These topological results will be important for designing new molecules, for assembling nano and colloidal particles and for engineering new architectural structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Crystals and Defects on Curved surfaces.     While it is natural to make a hexagonal crystal such as graphene (1a) in flat space, curved surfaces require defects such as the12 pentagons on a soccer ball (1b) or the fivefold vertices on an icosahedral HIV virus (1c).     It is known from studies on flat surfaces and three dimensional crystals that defects allow particles to move from their lattice positions and that in two dimensions the defect mediated motion melts the crystal to fluid. The flat two dimensional crystal only exists when the defects are gone. But as in figures 1a and 1b on a sphere it is impossible topologically to get rid of all defects.     Charged Particles on an emulsion droplet:  How then can we image the formation of a crystal on a sphere? In flat space crystals melt in the presence of unbound defects such as the pentagons needed from curvature (and their complements - heptagons). Our experiments, Fig.2, indicate that charged particles on a sphere "look" ordered with strong interactions but "look" like a liquid when the interactions are weak. Interaction strength is measured by &Gamma; = particle repulsion/thermal energy.     Icosahedral order:  We begin with the idea that to have a crystal on the curved surface the defects will also have to be organized and sequestered. We suspect icosahedral order as in Fig. 3 and search for the arrangement of the 5 and 7 fold defects. A five fold defect is a particle with 5 rather than 6 neighbors. Here we see that the defects aggregate and segregate themselves into regions with the arrangement of the vertices of an icosahedron, the same as the arrangement of the pentagons on a soccer ball. In these regions the particles should be fluid like as we see in figure 4.     Inland seas:  In Fig. 4 we see that particles dynamics is strongly correlated with the location of the defect scars. The defected regions are fluid like and located in soccer-ball like patches. These are surrounded by an ordered array of solid like particles .     CONCLUSIONS:  Freezing or crystallization on a curved surface is frustrated by defects forced by the curvature. Nature solves this problem on a sphere by sequestering the defects in inland seas held apart by one globe spanning rigid and crystalline continent.   Principles used by viruses and architects (Buckminsterfuller) now enable self-assembly of microscopic droplets with organized fluid and solid regions.
