<AbstractNarration>This award addresses the question of the nature of Dark Matter (DM) in the Universe with an experimental direct detection search for Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) using two-phase xenon detectors within the XENON program. This Collaboration is currently at the 100 kg mass scale with the XENON100 experiment at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory (LNGS), Italy. The next phase will be a detector at the ton scale (XENON1T) with a sensitivity goal of more than two orders of magnitude better than the current best limits from XENON100, currently the lowest background and largest mass direct detection experiment operating underground. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These funds will enable these groups to continue the XENON100 experiment to reach the design sensitivity for the spin-independent cross-section and to study other WIMP interaction scenarios. They plan to take data for at least one continuous year throughout 2011 to search for both spin-independent and spin-dependent DM, for inelastic DM and low mass DM and for an annual modulation signal in the XENON100 data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The XENON science, addressing questions about fundamental properties of the Universe, has all the ingredients to captivate the interest and imagination of students and the general public alike. Technical-related work can impact society in a number of ways: liquid xenon imaging detectors and related technologies find applications in several fields outside particle astrophysics, including national security and medical imaging research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Multiple astronomical observations tell us that majority of the matter in the Universe is not made of known particles. This so-called Dark Matter could be a new type of elementary particles. We developed a model to explain visible matter and interaction among them. It is called standard model of particle physics.  Dark Matter does not fit in this model. We seek for Dark Matter  and clues for any possible extensions of our particle physics model. Similarly we developed a model to explain the evolution of the Universe. It is called standard model of cosmology. Dark Matter plays a profound role and is crucial for evolution galaxies, and hence is a very indirect way us.  One idea of what Dark Matter could be is weakly interacting massive particle so-called WIMP. Being weakly interacting WIMPs would be left over from the big bang, and would be present in our solar system.   They could occasionally scatter off of an ordinary atom or electron in detector on Earth, forcing atom or electron into weakly recoil. One such dark matter detector, the XENON100 detector, was constructed and installed about one mile deep underground, in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in central Italy, to shield it from cosmic radiation as shown in attached figure. XENON100 consists of a target made of 62 kg of ultra-pure liquid xenon. Each particle interaction within the detector can be localized in three dimensions. The main challenge is that dark matter particles will mostly pass right through ordinary matter, while interactions due to known particles, so-called background events, could be prevalent.  This proposal provided the funds to continue operation of the XENON100 detector. The extremely low background and overall stability of the experiment enabled us to search for WIMPs in a wide parameter space from very light to very heavy particles and from weakly to sub-weakly interacting. We also searched for many other dark matter particle candidates and challenged claims of detection of dark matter particles by another experiment.
