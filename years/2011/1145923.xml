<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the 2nd CPS National Principal Investigators Meeting, held August 1-2, 2011, at the Gaylord National Hotel, National Harbor, Maryland. The purpose of this meeting is to review research progress, enhance research interaction among projects funded under the NSF Cyber-Physical Systems program, and to provide a forum for stakeholders in academia, industry and federal agencies to review new developments in CPS foundations and domains.  It provides an opportunty for the CPS community to promote new, emerging applications, and to collectively identify technology gaps and barriers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation established the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program with the vision of developing a scientific and engineering foundation for routinely building cyber-enabled engineered systems in which cyber capabilities are deeply embedded at all scales, yet which remain safe, secure, and dependable -- "systems you can bet your life on." The CPS challenge spans essentially every engineering domain. It requires the integration of knowledge and engineering principles across many computational and engineering research disciplines (computing, networking, control, human interaction, learning theory, as well as mechanical, chemical, biomedical, and other engineering disciplines) to develop a "new CPS system science."     Achieving such an ambitious goal is challenging. In order to accelerate the process, NSF has established the CPS "virtual organization" (CPS-VO) with the purpose of actively building and supporting the multidisciplinary community needed to underpin this new research discipline and enable international and interagency collaboration on CPS. The  CPS-VO is a community-driven organization. Its mission is to develop strategies and mechanisms to:  (i) facilitate and foster interaction and exchange among CPS researchers across a broad range of institutions, programs and disciplines,  (ii) enable sharing of knowledge generated by CPS research with the broader engineering and scientific communities, sharing and integrating experimental tools, platforms and simulators among researchers and stakeholders,  (iii) facilitate and foster collaboration and information exchange between CPS researchers and industry and  (iv) help international collaboration.     The 2nd CPS National Principle Investigator Meeting, CPS-PIM 2011, was held on 1-2 August 2011.  CPS-PIM 2011 emphasized fostering collaboration and promoting close interaction between academia and industry, spurred interactions across CPS disciplines, on the discovery of needs that are shared among CPS application sectors, and stimulated the cross-fertilization of research in CPS Core Science with CPS research in domain- and mission-oriented problems in a multi-agency setting.
