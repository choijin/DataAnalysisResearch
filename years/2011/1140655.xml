<AbstractNarration>This project is designing an integrated curriculum between general chemistry and biology laboratories unified by writing to create a common theme of STEM inquiry for first-year students.  It investigates how a cohesive first-year science and writing curriculum can help students improve their capacities to synthesize knowledge across disciplines, build contextual frameworks for assimilating new knowledge, develop proficiency in laboratory and writing skills, and improve attitudes toward science and communication. Project goals are met through the development and assessment of integrated biology and chemistry laboratories, writing modules relating to skills development (e.g., microscopy and other lab techniques, data management and analysis, source analysis and integration, scientific writing, peer review, oral communication), and investigation of biochemical principles and processes (e.g., chemical nature of biomolecules, oxidation-reduction and enzymatic reactions, light absorption by pigments, chemical effects on cellular structures). This model for lower-division interdisciplinary study is being developed to be broadly transferable to a wide variety of post-secondary institutions, and contributes to an emerging paradigm of coordinated scientific teaching among current and future faculty and associated teaching assistants.  The laboratory modules and integration pedagogy are peer-reviewed, made publicly available, and disseminated to networks of STEM and writing educators.</AbstractNarration>
