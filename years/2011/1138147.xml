<AbstractNarration>The Phytochemical Society of North America will hold its 50th anniversary meeting on December 10-15, 2011, at Kohala Coast in Hawaii.  The focus of this meeting is on advancing phytochemistry research by bringing together the established and upcoming scientists in the field. This meeting is anticipated to attract a broad range of researchers from both the United States and worldwide. The Society has a long tradition in the study of plant biochemistry, chemistry, and natural products (e.g. food and fiber sources, commodity chemicals, renewable energy, nutraceuticals), and this meeting will address major topics in the field, including: Biofuels and Bioengineering; Metabolism and Metabolomics; Biosynthesis; Transcriptome Profiling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The Phytochemical Society of North America has a tradition of supporting young scientists (including undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) to attend their meetings and make presentations.  This meeting will continue that tradition by providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, women and members of underrepresented groups in phytochemistry to present their research findings and exchange ideas with scientific colleagues, including leaders in the field.  The PSNA Young Members Committee has a program whose topics are focused on enhancing the skills and career advancement of junior researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Phytochemical Society of North America held its 50th Anniversary meeting in December 2011 in Hawaii.  Members of this society have made historic contributions to the field and members continue to pioneer critical advances.  There was a record attendance of approximately 500 scientists from around the world.  Sessions were held on cutting edge topics in plant science including plant metabolism and metabolomics, transcriptomics, biofuels and bioengineering, natural product biosynthesis, chemoprevention of disease, and more.  In honor of the 50th anniversary , a session was devoted to the history of the society and early ground-breaking discoveries.  This conference brought together a diverse group of scientists including the best and the brightest established researchers and young scientists to discuss the current and future directions of research.  Many opportunities for discussion led to new collaborations in research. Additionally, the PSNA Young Members Subcommittee put on two luncheon programs, one on Strategies for Choosing a Graduate Program and the other a workshop on Grant Writing Strategies.  NSF Program Director Dr. Wendy Boss also gave a luncheon presentation on Funding Opportunities for International Research Collaborations.     The NSF funds were used to support travel and participation costs for undergraduate students, graduate students, and pre-tenure (early career) women doctoral scientists.  These funds paid for the meeting registration of a total of 18 persons all of whom gave presentations at the conference and were recognized at the conference banquet.
