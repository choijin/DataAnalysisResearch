<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the phylogeny of green lacewings (Family Chrysopidae) using DNA sequences combined with external characteristics for all types of living and fossil species. Although there are a number of widespread, common species, the family includes at least 1200 species, many of which are poorly known and still undescribed and we lack a clear understanding of evolutionary patterns and processes in the group.  The phylogeny will be used to explore how chrysopids evolved trash-carrying in larvae and how adults use chemicals from flowers and insect prey to attract mates. A vocabulary of descriptive morphological terms for lacewings will be defined, with terms related to each other and to those used for other insects, so that they have universal meaning when related back to gene expression. This effort will deliver products such as web-based identification tools and a monograph on world genera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green lacewings are used widely throughout the world in Integrative Pest Management in both field and horticultural cropping systems as generalist predators. Thus, the phylogenetic results from this project may lead to the discovery of new species that may also be of economic importance in agriculture. The findings will also enable greater understanding of lacewing evolution, including how and when certain behaviors and biology appeared. The project will contribute to the broader goal of developing a Common Arthropod Ontology, linking phenotype (i.e. appearance) to genotype (i.e. genetics) in all insect-like organisms. This project will also provide training for two community college interns, a PhD student, and a postdoctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Green lacewings (family Chrysopidae) are a diverse lineage of familiar insects found throughout the world.  The family is of considerable importance as certain species are used in biological control programs, as the larvae are voracious predators of many pest species such as aphids, whiteflies, mites, and scale insects.  Despite their significance, expertise in the basic identification of these insects has dwindled in recent decades necessitating the training of a new generation of authorities in lacewing systematics.  In addition, the existing classification of the family has hindered their study as a result of many historical errors and the lack of robust hypotheses regarding their evolutionary relationships.  These have collectively impeded attempts to revise the classification, to understand the family?s evolutionary history or to place critical fossils, or to clarify how traits have evolved throughout the family, such as the behavior of their larvae to build camouflage from materials within the environment for their own protection as well as to better approach their prey (and therefore critically tied to the success of these larvae in feeding on agricultural pests).  Our project specifically trained a new generation of expertise in green lacewing biology and systematics.  The project lead and student developed a robust estimation of evolutionary relationships among all green lacewings using both anatomical traits and DNA sequence data, and these results were used to develop a revised worldwide classification of the family as well as tools for the identification of Chrysopidae.  These tools can be used by ecologists, behaviorists, evolutionary biologists, and agricultural researchers to identify green lacewings pertinent to their own investigations.  In addition, we were able to reinterpret and clarify historical misunderstandings in regards to the anatomy of lacewings, particularly in the complex structures of their genitalia (critical to the identification of species and, in some cases, larger groups such as genera) and the wing veins (several of which result from complex fusions of different vein elements).  We explored the fossil history of the family in order to determine the time of divergence between major lineages of green lacewings, and thereby attempt to explain their diversification in terms of the historical periods in which different phases of this evolution took place, along with the time of origin for particular traits.  It was determined that Chrysopidae are at least 130 million years old, with primitive ancestral forms extending back a further 40 million years.  The behavior and anatomical traits of larvae associated with building camouflage appeared once in the ancestor of all Chrysopidae, with several subsequent losses of such features in particular genera and during the course of the family?s long evolution.  Interestingly, two extinct examples of such losses demonstrate anatomical and behavioral repertoires that did not survive to present &ndash; specifically specialized predation on spiders (unknown today among living green lacewings) and anatomical mimicry of liverworts (unknown today among all insects).  Our results provide a framework for future studies on the evolution, behavior, ecology, biogeography, and conservation of green lacewings worldwide.
