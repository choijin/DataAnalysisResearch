<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project builds from previous research on how computer-aided feedback to students improves how the students learn drawing-related concepts in engineering statics.  By researching how to integrate rapid feedback between instructor and student, this project will enable computer-assisted drawing tools to be utilized in introductory engineering statics courses to improve student learning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to overcome barriers for integrating effective software tools into critical, large enrollment engineering courses early in the curriculum.  The collaborative project engages two universities with different educational missions to ensure that the results are widely applicable.  The needs of students typically under-represented in engineering are addressed in the proposed research project.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by enhancing research infrastructure and data access to broaden research capabilities.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>

Mechanix provides immediate feedback to students on their hand-drawn homework assignments that are crucial to the learning process. Mechanix can correct hand-drawn student homework without instructor involvement, saving students&rsquo; time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A large number of data was collected on how engineering students sketch to develop sketch recognition algorithms. Professors and statics instructors from several universities participated in interviews to help develop the most efficient design of the system. Feedback from the users and testers helped improve and update the system as it was being developed. The work on Mechanix was performed at three levels: university level, K-12 level and improving instructor interfaces.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Mechanix was integrated into TAMU Engineering 111 for four semesters in 2010, into La Tourneau University for two semesters in 2012-2014, and later in 2014 to Georgia Tech for 1 semester. In 2015 Mechanix was introduced into Lovejoy High school statics course.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project provided ample opportunities for training and professional development to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as professionals. Graduate and undergraduate students gained experience in working with data analysis, presenting their results, with some of their papers receiving the awards. Postdoctoral researchers helped integrate and test Mechanix and evaluate its marketability.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key research outcomes include the following:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It was shown that Mechanix increase homework completion and motivation in non-honor students. Mechanix provided equal concept learning in all classes when compared to straight paper learning. Teachers were able to assign additional problems since they were corrected automatically.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Data analysis showed that certain students attempt to &ldquo;game&rdquo; the system, repeatedly submitting and asking for new feedback. These students were typically unsuccessful and did not complete their work. Conversely, students who paused at least a minute between submissions and think about a problem, are likely to complete their homework. Other features of student behavior were identified, such as when a student wants to leave a difficult problem incomplete and move to another (flexibility), or when a student persists on a single problem until it is solved (persistence). The number of times a student is willing to attempt a problem after errant submissions (error rate) is also a significant measure of performance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We believe that these findings will enable instructors to identify low-performing students and help them develop other problem-solving techniques. Another approach would be to modify the Mechanix feedback method that will suggest concepts to review or problems to visit so that students benefit even more from the system behaving as an intelligent tutor.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Deployment of Mechanix in Lovejoy High School showed great results. The data obtained from pre- and post-tests showed that there is an average increase of 1.65 points on a 12-point scale between a pre- and post-tests (p &lt; .005). A greater increase was found in the &ldquo;A-level&rdquo; students while historical studies suggest significant progress may be realized at all levels versus current tutoring techniques as the students continue to utilize Mechanix.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Mechanix interface was being continuously improved. It allows instructors to easily create new problems simply by drawing the result. They can provide reference images, sample text and fill in equations and numbers, see Figs. 1-3. The instructor can see the submissions of any student: what they drew, when they submitted, and how often they submitted. It detects gaps in student understanding, while still providing auto-graded results, Fig. 4. A new web interface now allows instructors to easily create classes and register students. The login screen is shown in Fig. 1. Another benefit to instructors is the database of problems and sketches assembled during the years of Mechanix deployment, as well the creation of the library of the sketch recognition shapes, generated from student submissions to Mechanix. These tools will enable better sketch recognition techniques for the next iteration of Mechanix and other ITS. The new interface for students allows personalized feedback and viewing Mechanix data as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/16/2017<br>      Modified by: Tracy&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hammond</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1129525/1129525_10121639_1507668858385_Fig1Outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1129525/1129525_10121639_1507668858385_Fig1Outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1129525/1129525_10121639_1507668858385_Fig1Outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Instructor Interactions interface: instructor web interface login screen for student management.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Tracy Hammond</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tracy&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hammond</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1129525/1129525_10121639_1507668960136_Fig2Outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1129525/1129525_10121639_1507668960136_Fig2Outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1129525/1129525_10121639_1507668960136_Fig2Outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Instructor Interactions: The instructor interface following login and showing section and user management.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Tracy Hammond</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tracy&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hammond</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1129525/1129525_10121639_1507669291185_Fig3Outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1129525/1129525_10121639_1507669291185_Fig3Outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1129525/1129525_10121639_1507669291185_Fig3Outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Instructor Interactions: the redesigned instructor interface for creating homework and assignment sets.
