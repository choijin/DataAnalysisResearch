<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a robust metric for measuring and forecasting short-term intra-hour variability of wind power with the ultimate goal of managing the variability to the desired level.  The proposed metric uses the statistical range as a measure of dispersion for the varying wind power output.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The merit of the proposed work lies in a novel metric to quantify and forecast intra-hour wind power variability and methods to manage it to the desired level.  The new metric, appropriately termed conditional range metric, provides the largest wind power excursion over given duration, wind power production level, and coverage rate.  New methods for allocating system reserve and sizing and control of distributed energy storage systems will be developed to demonstrate the efficacy of the metric in managing variability at the transmission and distribution system levels, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The outcome of the proposed work is expected to provide fundamental understanding of wind power variability.  The novel conditional range metric makes possible the analysis of factors and conditions such as time (season) of interests, duration of observation, level of wind power production, and coverage rates affecting variability.  The new metric is expected to aid system planners and operators to quantify variability accurately, and thus allows for better integration and management of variable wind power.  The proposed work also provides additional resources to develop new undergraduate- and graduate-level learning materials.  Examples include but not limited to undergraduate-level class projects and hands-on senior-design level projects in simulating and managing variability using a battery system, as well as development of a new graduate-level course in wind power integration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Wind power generation has been increasing steadily in recent years.  In 2008, wind power contributed less than 1% of total electricity in the U.S. Within five years, it grew to about 5%.  Although wind power provides an environmentally friendly source of electricity, its power output varies with the wind. As more wind power plants are interconnected to utility transmission systems, wind power variation could become a major concern.  In spite of this concern, there is currently no method available to accurately quantify the level of variability.  We proposed a new metric to systematically characterize and measure wind power variability using the statistical range as a measure of dispersion conditioned on influential variables.  The new metric, called the conditional range metric, measures the largest wind power excursion for a specific wind power production level and probabilistic coverage rate over a duration of interest.  Using the metric, we showed that higher wind power variation mostly occurs at the mid-level generation. For example, when a 100-MW wind farm is delivering an average of 59 MW of power, 95 percent of the time, its power varies 22.5 MW within 15 minutes.   Our analysis also shows that wind turbine size and technology do affect wind power variability.  The conditional range metric shows that for the same nameplate power rating (i.e. size), wind turbines with a full-converter technology (Type 4) have the least variability, while those with a fixed speed wind turbine technology (Type 1) have the greatest variability.  In fact, wind power produced by a Type 1 wind turbine is 15% more variable than that of a Type 4 wind turbine under the same operating conditions.  Further, it was shown that smaller wind turbines exhibit slightly higher variability than larger wind turbines of the same technology and that wind power aggregation offers a significant reduction in wind power variability for all wind turbine technologies and sizes.  Our proposed metric can also be utilized to determine the size of energy storage and help develop their control mechanisms to lessen wind power variation.  Another application is to help determine ancillary reserve requirements of traditional fossil-fuel based power plants.  The metric is expected to aid system planners and operators to better integrate and manage variable wind power.  As a result, more wind power can be accommodated into the power grid thus reducing greenhouse gases that would have been produced from fossil-fueled power plants.   Wind power generation has been increasing steadily in recent years.  In 2008, wind power contributed less than 1% of total electricity in the U.S. Within five years, it grew to about 5%.  Although wind power provides an environmentally friendly source of electricity, its power output varies with the wind. As more wind power plants are interconnected to utility transmission systems, wind power variation could become a major concern.
