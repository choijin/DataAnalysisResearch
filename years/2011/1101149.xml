<AbstractNarration>The Principle Investigator proposes to work on three directions in algebraic and complex geometry. The first is on investigation of properties related to hyperbolicity of moduli spaces of canonically polarized manifolds, such as a conjecture of Viehweg that the spaces are of log-general type. The idea is to study moduli of higher dimensional varieties guided by principles known for the moduli spaces of curves, though completely new approaches have to be taken.  The main tools to be used are algebraic geometric and differential geometric in nature.  The second is on the classification and understanding of special surfaces, such as fake projective planes, exotic quadrics, and complex ball quotients in general. Fake projective planes have been classified algebraically by Gopal Prasad and the PI in a project  partially supported by a prior NSF grant. The goal here is to understand them geometrically.  The project involves techniques from algebraic geometry, number theory, Bruhat-Tits theory and computer aided computations. The third is on development and application of analytic tools to problems which are algebraic or topological in nature. This includes a quest for classification of exotic quadrics and development of analytic tools for existence of rational curves on some varieties. The main techniques to be used are analytic in nature, such as estimates in partial differential equations and geometric analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting aspect of mathematics is its intrinsic coherence and beauty.  Time and again, ideas and tools from different areas of mathematics are brought together to solve seemingly unrelated problems spectacularly.  A goal of the proposal is to study more in this direction by developing and applying techniques from various mathematical disciplines to understand various algebraic and complex geometric problems, some of which are long standing.  It varies from investigation of general properties of moduli spaces which are collections of varieties of the same topological type, to detailed study and classification of special varieties such as fake projective planes and exotic quadrics which are algebraic surfaces with small topological invariants. The PI expects his graduate students to be actively involved in the mathematical projects proposed and to learn to appreciate the process of research. He also hopes that the interests in mathematics may be passed to other students through seminar talks and summer school presentations, both in US and in foreign countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     To understand the properties of a mathematical object, a lot of times one needs to group families of objects of similar nature together and study the family as a whole. This is the concept of moduli and arises naturally from other disciplines in modern science such as in quantum physics and string theory as well.   Geometric properties of a moduli is reflected by the way it is curved.  The curvature properties of a moduli of complex one-dimensional manifolds was known in the 80's, but the situation for higher dimenional manifolds had been essentially open.  The problem was settled to a certain extent by the PI an his collaborator in this proposal.  An outcome is that a moduli of higher dimensional manifolds enjoys some curvature negativity properties, generalizing one dimensional situations.  In another direction, it is known that concrete examples are important and essential in understanding and developing various mathematical concepts.  They are usually difficult to come by.  Following their earlier work, the PI and colloborators constructed and classified some specific geometric objects known as fake projective planes and their higher dmensional analogues.  These examples provide testing grounds for various problems from algebraic, geometric and representation theoretical points of views.      As several disciplines of mathematics meet in the research proposed, the PI was able to exchange ideas and collaborate extensively with mathematicians of different background.  It leads to several collaborated projects of the PI and other mathematicians, including some postdoctorates in his home institute.  The project has attracted two graduate students to work with him as well.       Last Modified: 08/15/2015       Submitted by: Sai Kee Yeung]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
