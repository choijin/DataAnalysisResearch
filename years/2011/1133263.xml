<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Disaster Resilience for Rural Communities (DRRC) collaborative research project is to examine the obstacles to and opportunities for the use of seasonal climate forecasts in flood planning and management in U.S. rural areas, focusing on the 1) characteristics that make scientific and technical information likely to be used by rural practitioners; 2) structure and function of networks of rural users of forecast information and; 3) influence of group decision processes in decision making about how and whether to employ climate forecasts in rural flood management. The approach begins with four case studies of rural regions that have attempted to use seasonal climate information.  After that, a national-level survey of stakeholders engaged in flood planning and emergency management in rural areas to investigate experiences with and factors affecting the use of climate information will be implemented. Finally, in-person simulations of local, regional, and state-level stakeholders in two US rural regions to investigate how network features, group biases, and decision structures influence climate forecast use in rural flood planning and management will be conducted.  The chief intellectual merit of this project lies in enhancing understanding of the development of trust and collaboration in weak and strong network administrative organization and in extending the literature on emergency management decision-making in tightly-knit urban response networks to dispersed rural pre-disaster planning and mitigation.  This work also advances approaches to capture and measure preferences related to characteristics of uncertain information and to compare individual-based stated preferences and group decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seasonal climate information such as forecasts of El Ni√±o conditions months ahead of time can be used to improve planning and management of weather-related extreme events such as floods. Unfortunately, even when seasonal forecast information appears clear, putting knowledge about likely climate conditions into practice to improve planning for extreme events before they happen poses difficulties. Flood and other emergency managers typically work in situations with tight budgets, and they also must make decisions quickly.  In addition, managers may find it difficult to clearly communicate to the public and policymakers the range of possible outcomes from events that are highly uncertain.  This may be particularly the case in rural areas, where geographic distances complicate communication and technical expertise disperses more widely than in concentrated urban areas.  This project examines whether the way in which forecast information is presented and the way in which those involved in emergency management in rural areas interact with each other influence the ability to use seasonal climate information to improve planning and management to reduce societal losses from floods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Emergency managers in local governments who work on floods face uncertain environmental conditions that seasonal climate and shorter-term weather forecasts can help inform.  Yet, effective use of both short- and longer-term forecast information is not automatic.  Meteorologists, psychologists, and others in the disaster community for decades have conducted studies on challenges in communicating weather-related forecasts to the general public, with this work showing that information processing and decision shortcuts often lead forecast users in the general public to behave "irrationally" or predictably wrong when faced with uncertain forecast information.  For example, users may interpret probabilities differently than forecast providers intend them to, or anchor on initial estimates and not adjust when new information becomes available.  More broadly, the public?s use of available forecast information to reduce weather-related disaster damages appears to depend critically on risk perception and communication.  Our project asks two related questions.  First, do the challenges in processing information found in the general public extend to emergency managers (EMs) in county governments, a group of professionals who must routinely process uncertain forecast information as part of their work?  These EMs are front line responders who must apply science, technology, planning, and management to deal with floods that can cause property damage, disrupt community life, and kill or injure people, so their effective use of forecast information has important, on-the-ground implications for the quality of life in communities across the nation.  Second, do EMs effectively use longer-term seasonal forecasts&mdash;in this context these mean multiple-month lead time forecasts of precipitation or temperature that deviates from normal trends&mdash;to better prepare for floods?  Such forecasts are less familiar to many EMs and typically have even more uncertainty associated with them than shorter-term weather forecasts.   Through case studies, structured group meetings with EMs, and a nationwide survey, we find that the short answers to our question are "yes" and "yes."  Emergency managers do 1) face many of the same difficulties in interpreting uncertain forecast information as do members of the general public; and 2) sometimes use seasonal climate forecasts to better prepare for floods.  The more complex version of these answers have several implications for both our intellectual understanding of decision making under uncertainty by experts and for broader impacts in society at large.   For the research community, our experimental evidence documents the impact of uncertainty about threatening events on expert decision-making, enhancing our understanding of how several long-established decision heuristics influence the choices made by public sector managers to protect their communities.  For example, emergency managers interpret equivalent uncertainties express as probabilities (e.g., 80% chance of a flood) differently than when they are expressed as frequencies (80 out of 100).  They also appear more likely to pursue aggressive, risky actions to reduce threats when perceived potential losses are involved than pursue aggressive, risky actions when perceived potential gains are at stake.  In the field of network decision processes, our work also demonstrates how both weak and strong network administrative organizations can build trust and collaboration in pre-disaster mitigation, and how structured decision processes can improve the use of climate forecast information in emergency management. The project breaks new empirical ground by analyzing in depth a thick institutional network for the use of climate and weather information in a state-wide network.  For society at large, our work shows that the promise of seasonal climate forecasts can be realized through informal networks of emergency managers, other public officials, and citizens that work cooperatively to take advantage of advance notice of wet winter weather.  This depends on a high level of cooperation among network participants, as well as forms of information that communicate risk and probability in a way that EMs and others interpret as actionable.  In addition, our work shows that for both longer-term seasonal and shorter-term weather forecasts, deliberately designed decision making processes can help improve the use of relevant forecast information to reduce flood damages; that is, more structured group decision processes hold out promise for improving decision making and making it more likely that forecast products will be used.  This in turn suggests that forecast producers take decision biases into consideration when developing forecast products.
