<AbstractNarration>Darwin's finches of the Gal√°pagos Islands stand as one of the most impressive examples of evolution.  After colonizing the islands, a single ancestral finch species eventually diversified into 13 species of different sizes, bill shapes, and ecologies.  The suboscine passerine birds exhibit a similar history, but their diversification was not limited to a small set of islands; instead they are found throughout South America, Central America, North America, and parts of the Old World. There are now 1,300 species that differ dramatically in body shape and size, feeding behavior, and nest architecture. The primary goal of this project is to use DNA sequences to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these species, and to use this model system to investigate why the tropics are so biologically diverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vital component of this collaborative project between U.S. and Brazilian scientists is the research training it will provide. With fieldwork planned in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, and Viet Nam, young scientists from a diversity of countries will be exposed not only to a diversity of natural environments but will also interact and forge relationships with their international peers.  By working together to reconstruct perhaps the most spectacular evolutionary radiations of birds in the world, the researchers will learn how evolution works on a continental scale while training a new generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bird diversity in the New World, especially in the tropical regions, is dominated by the suboscine perching birds (the Tyranni), comprising over 1200 species in numerous families, including flycatchers, manakins, and ant birds.  Nearly 60% of all New World avian diversity belongs to this group.  Consequently, understanding their history and relationships to each other is of paramount importance for providing a comparative framework for ecological and behavioral studies but also for deciphering the environmental factors, such as climate, that have influenced their distributions over time.  The analyses undertaken in this large collaborative project aim to understand the relationships of species of Tyranni in fine detail.  Using large-scale genomic data built upon ultra-conserved element (UCE) probes of DNA, we can now build an evolutionary tree based on similarities and differences from over a million base-pairs of DNA for each species.  Our results are already being used by other researchers investigating the behavioral ecology of manakins (family Pipridae).  Our results are also allowing us to examine the spatial biogeographic history of the Tyranni, which, because of their high diversity, will shed light on the environmental history of South and Middle America over the past 30 million years.  By analyzing their spatial history and comparing tthat to our understanding of paleovegetation change, paleoclimate, and landscape-level geological changes, we are able to construct hypotheses about how the Neotropical habitats have changed over time and how that has affected the biota.  This research involved the active participation of over a dozen undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, including underserved students in the United States as well as in Latin America.  The results of the research were presented at numerous scientific meetings and to the general public at our institutions, including the three largest natural history museums in the United States.
