<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to develop methods to quantify and improve the generalizability of findings from STEM educational evaluation and research.   A central problem in educational evaluation is how to determine whether the results of a well-designed experiment or quasi-experiment evaluating the effect of a STEM educational intervention (e.g., curricula, instructional strategies, professional development, or technologies) will apply to a different policy-relevant population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will build on propensity score methods and a database of national covariates to create a statistical approach that uses study samples to estimate parameters of the distribution of treatment effects in an inference population. In short, this method will make it possible to use results from one study to make statistical claims in another population or place.  This is something that cannot be done in most cases using current methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the mathematical derivation of new statistical methods, the project will develop a public-use database containing NCES Common Core of Data and census data linked to it as a resource for establishing covariate values for inference populations.  The method will be tested and validated by analyzing secondary data from 20 field studies supported by NSF and the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the US Department of Education.  The investigator will increase the field's capacity to use the new methods by conducting training workshops at four national educational conferences for other researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Field experiments in education and the social sciences are conducted to provide evidence about the impact of programs, interventions, or products. Randomized experiments provide the strongest evidence about the causal effects of programs, interventions, or products.  For important practical reasons, the sites or contexts in which randomized experiments are typically conducted may not be the same as the ones in which policy alternatives are being considered.  For example, a trial may be conducted in one state, but other states may become interested in applying the evidence to their own policy choices.  If all of the potential applications of a trial are known in advance, random (probability) sampling into the trial has considerable advantages.    However, it is often teh case that all of the potential applications of field experiments are not known in advance (as when one state or locality becomes aware of a study after it has been completed and wishes to apply the evidence to their own situation). In such cases, are needed to understand the extent to which the results of a trial might apply in other settings, not anticipated by the designers of the original trial.  This project developed methods to formalize subjective ideas about generalization of experimental results to populations that may not have been anticiapted in planning the trial. An important part of formalizing ideas is that it makes explicit the assumptions that are required for the methods to provide valid results. These methods permit estimation of both average treatment impacts and the statistical uncertainty of those impacts in policy-relevant populations that might not have been anticiated in the design of the trial.This project demonstrated how well those methods work in examples of trials that had already been conducted.  The project also showed how the same theoretical framework could be used to design trials for greater generalizability to populations that were known in advance but where random (probability) sampling is not carried out.  It carried out examples of such planning in real field experiments.  To help other researchers use these methods, we not only published articles and presented papers at professional meetings describing the methods, we conducted four professional development courses for researchers interested in learning how to use them.  We made sure that the methods have become part of other training courses supported by other government agencies and briefed the progam staff of the US Institute of Education Sciences on these methods.
