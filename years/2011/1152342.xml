<AbstractNarration>Graeme Henkelman from the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods (CTMC) Program and the Office of Cyber Infrastructure (OCI) in developing algorithms for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations. For rare event systems, such as diffusion in solids and reactions at surfaces, transition state theory (TST) allows for a separation of time scales between that of molecular vibrations and the reactive events of interest. When reactive mechanisms are not known, an adaptive version of the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method is used to find saddle points and rates are evaluated with harmonic TST.  To reduce the computational cost, a database is employed to store kinetic events and to make them available for later use in separate calculations with similar chemistry. When the reaction mechanisms for a class of system are known, the computational cost is low because all events are drawn from the database. To further accelerate the simulations, groups of states connected by fast rates are escaped using an analytic solution to the master equation. Storing the local connectivity of these states is essential for efficiency.  Accuracy will be improved with a set of methods ranging from harmonic TST to the (classically) exact full TST plus dynamical corrections. The challenge of TST is finding a dividing surface that separates reactants from any product state. A support vector machine is being developed to provide an analytic classification function based upon learned data.  Sampled points around the decision surface will be used to train the machine so that it can provide an accurate transition state without prior knowledge of reaction mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is directed at alleviating the ultralong computational times needed for simulation of realistic chemical or material processes, e.g., catalysis, protein folding, molecular diffusion and so on.  The characteristic times for basic molecular motion are many, many times faster than the time scales we measure in the laboratory, and so acceleration algorithms must be developed.  EON2 is being developed as a distributed open-source program developed by the PI and collaborators to calculate long-timescale molecular dynamics in systems, for example, undergoing catalys and clustering on metal substrates.  It will use advanced database techniques and machine learning, and will be usable in conjunction with other software through customized interfaces.  A discussion forum is hosted by the PI for anyone with questions about the algorithms, software or science.  The project has been opened up so that computers on campus, supercomputers with idle time, and anyone from the public can contribute computational resources to accelerate dynamics simulations at the atomic scale. This aspect of the outreach program gives the public direct access to the research being done as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The outcome of this project was the development of the adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC) method for modeling the long time state-to-state dynamics of atomic systems, as well as new methods for transition state finding and accelerated molecular dynamics that go beyond the harmonic (saddle point) approximation to transition state theory.  Specific outcomes are:   1) Basin constrained kappa-dimer:  For AKMC simulations, the goal is to find all low energy reaction mechanisms that lead from a reactant state. A requirement for a saddle to contribute to the escape rate from a state is that it is on the boundary of the state.  One problem with the dimer min-mode following method is that it can find disconnected saddles even when initiated well within the initial state.  The source of the problem is that the dimer method is sensitive to local ridges, where the gradient is perpendicular to the lowest curvature mode. These local ridges, however, can deviate from the true ridge, defined by the boundary of points which minimize to the initial state. In the kappa-dimer approach, a second local measure of the true ridge is introduced, the isocontour curvature, kappa.  Near the minimum, contour lines curve towards the minimum and near ridges they curve away.  The kappa=0 surface does not cross the true ridge except at the saddles.  Restraining the dimer to the kappa&lt;0 region eliminates the problem of disconnected saddles, as well as reducing the number of force evaluations required to find connected saddles in high dimensional systems.  2) Transition State Finding Benchmarks: A benchmark webpage, www.optbench.org, provides a set of standardized benchmarks that anyone with atomic optimization or transition state finding codes can compare to. The use of subversion machinery allows contributors to add their code and data to the benchmarks repository for comparison with other codes, as well as automatic updates of the webpage. Our community has long discussed the need for such benchmark systems, and it is exciting to have some momentum behind this project including several groups. This work represents a collaboration with the Wales group at Cambridge University, and the J&oacute;nsson group at the University of Iceland.   3) Dynamics of a solid-solid phase transition in molybdenum: The A15 to BCC phase transition in molybdenum is modeled at the atomic scale.  At room temperature, the transition of atomic layers occurs in microseconds.  Since this time scale is inaccessible by classical molecular dynamics, the kinetics were followed using the adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo approach. Initially, a disordered region forms between the crystalline phases.  Phase boundary migration was found to involve hundreds of states within the disordered region.  An effective layer transition barrier of 0.5~eV was determined as a collective property of the complex potential energy surface.   4) Ridge-based hyperdynamics: A powerful way to accelerate rare events in molecular dynamics simulations is to apply a bias potential which destabilizes minima without biasing the transitions between stable states.  This approach, called hyperdynamics, is limited by our ability to construct general bias potentials without having to understand the reaction mechanisms available to the system.  A common problem with current bias potentials is that their effectiveness decreases rapidly with system size.  We attribute this problem to a diminishing volume defined by the metrics around a reactant minimum as compared to the total volume of the reactant state basin.  Here we defined a bias potential based upon the distance to the boundary of the reactant basin, quantified in two ways: (i) by following the minimum mode direction up the ridge of the potential surface and (ii) by training a machine learning algorithm to give an analytic expression for the boundary to which the distance can be calculated.  Both of these ridge-based bias potentials are demonstrated to scale qualitatively better with dimensionality than existing methods.  We attribute this difference to a greater filling fraction of the reactant state using the ridge-based bias potentials as compared to the standard potentials.   5) Analytic approximation of anharmonic corrections to TST:  It is well known that TST can overestimate reaction rates due to the recrossing of trajectories through the transition state. The theory that we developed correctly accounts for this recrossing based upon how the curvatures of the potential change near the transition state, and provides a simple analytic correction factor to TST.  This correction is demonstrated to be accurate and efficient in that it can be evaluated along with harmonic TST rates with little additional computational cost.  Specifically, using perturbation theory we solve the equations of motion in the neighborhood of the transition state and derive a simple condition that determines whether a trajectory is truly reactive or not. We apply our theory to adatom diffusion on an aluminum surface and show that our analytical results compare well with those of a direct dynamical simulation.
