<AbstractNarration>****Technical abstract****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this grant will investigate the nature of the boundary between classical and quantum physics by study of systems consisting of a macroscopic oscillator strongly coupled to a microscopic electrical device.  The microscopic device will be driven by application of an electrical signal, and its effects (or backaction) on the macroscopic oscillator will then be observed.  Two systems are envisioned: in one the microscopic part is a quantum point contact (a microscopic electrical constriction in a semiconductor) and the oscillator is the macroscopic crystal in which the point contact is embedded. In the other, the microscopic part is a single Cooper pair transistor (a superconducting device that transfers Cooper pairs one by one) coupled to a superconducting microwave resonator.  In each case, applying an electrical drive to the microscopic device is expected to lead to oscillations in the macroscopic oscillator.  A detailed study of this interaction could lead to a better understanding of the interface between quantum and classical behavior.  Two graduate students will be supported by this project, and will be trained in such experimental techniques as microwave measurement, nanoscale fabrication and low-temperature physics that are widely used both in academia and in high-technology industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-technical abstract****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is well understood that the physical behavior of macroscopic objects like baseballs or planets is described very accurately by the laws of classical physics developed by Newton and familiar to many from a course in freshman physics.  It is equally well understood that the behavior of microscopic objects like atoms and molecules is described by the much more mysterious and counterintuitive laws of quantum physics.  What is not clear is exactly where the boundary between classical behavior and quantum behavior lies.  In order to investigate this question, this research will examine the behavior of systems made up of two pieces, one that by itself would behave classically, and another that on its own would behave quantum mechanically. By design, the two pieces will interact strongly with each other, so that the behavior of the combined system will be different from that of either piece in isolation.  Investigations of this sort will better delineate the border between classical and quantum physics, and help us understand the influence of quantum phenomena on the everyday world around us.  Two graduate students will be supported by this project, and will be trained in such experimental techniques as microwave measurement, nanoscale fabrication and low-temperature physics that are widely used both in academia and in high-technology industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research has been to learn more about the mysterious dividing line between the quantum world of atoms and molecules on the one hand, and the more familiar classical world of baseballs and basketballs on the other.       To investigate this boundary, we produced a new kind of laser based on a superconducting device called a Josephson junction.   By putting this device between two superconducting "mirrors" and applying just the right voltage, we we able to create a new kind of laser in which photons (quanta of light) are emitted one by one by pairs of electrons as they pass through our Josephson junctions.       This laser is different from the usual kind we find in laser pointers because there is only one "atom", our Josephson junction device, that is giving off the photons.  That means that our laser could be intrinsically different from standard lasers by, for instance, having far less noise, and producing states of light that are intrinsically quantum mechanical.     Such quantum states of light, if they could be easily produced as in our device, could someday be used to help transmit and process information in more efficient and secure ways than can be done using the classical states of light that we have access to today.     In addition, during the last year, we have begun work to add a nanoscale mechanical resonator to our system.  By using our Josephson junction system to couple light to the mechanical resonator, we hope to boost their interaction to the point that single photons can be used to measure single quanta of mechanical vibration.  This ability might allow us to cause the mechanical resonator, a macroscopic object, to move in a way that is definitely not classical, greatly expanding our knowledge of where the boundary between quantum and classical really lies.     In addition to expanding knowledge in our own field, the work sponsored by this funding has allowed training of graduate and undergraduate students in nanoscale fabrication techniques, and also in high-sensitivity electrical and microwave measurement techniques.       Furthermore, the PI has been involved in multiple outreach activities, including performing demonstrations and giving talks in local public schools, working with a local high school teacher on incorporating error analysis into the high school curriculum, becoming involved with the New Hampshire Science Teachers Association, and involving many freshman women in his research through Dartmouth's Women in Science Project.
