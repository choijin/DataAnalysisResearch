<AbstractNarration>This is a supplement to a RAPID proposal to support analysis completion, preparation of journal publications, and subvention of a publication of the Wales Archaeological Report.  This would allow for the PI to bring over a decade of archaeological excavation at a key site near the village of Wales in Northwest Alaska to conclusion.  The Wales site is unique in its faunal preservation, architectural features, organic materials, artifact assemblage, and the potential for understanding prehistoric social relationships between coastal and interior cultural groups.  The PI has been working at Wales for over a decade and has created model relationships with the community.  This supplement would give him the resources necessary to complete the data analysis; prepare several papers for publication, as well as a major site report; and prepare the artifacts for curation at the Museum of the Arctic, Fairbanks, Alaska, as agreed by the Wales community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Wales is known historically as an important whaling village during early contact times and it is of particular archaeological interest because of its proximity to Siberian Eskimo areas only 31 km across the Bering Strait. The substantial size of contact period Wales -- consisting of at least 500 individuals -- and early historic accounts indicate that the village functioned as a primary socioeconomic center in northwest Alaska in early contact times (Harritt 2003).  Historically Wales people hunted bowhead and gray whales, as well as walrus and seals. The three main Wales sites, or 'villages', are located within the modern community.  The Hillside Site is situated on the edge of a bluff at the base of Cape Mountain; and, Kurigitavik Mound and the Beach site are situated on the Cape Prince of Wales beach ridge system.  The sites also have Inupiat names which are Agianamiut for the Hillside Site, Kiatanamiut for the Beach Site, and Kashigatavik for Kurigitavik Mound. Kurigitavik was abandoned prior to historic contact in the late 18th century. In the case of the historic Kiatanamiut and Agianamiut factions living adjacent to each other, each was a distinctive social unit, based on the historic self-distinctions and contact-period accounts.  Prior analyses indicate that the late prehistoric inhabitants of Kurigitavik Mound also comprised a distinctive societal entity, with a language dialect distinctive from that of the inhabitants of the Beach and Hillside sites.  The basic analyses of the artifact and faunal collections from the three sites were completed in May, 2012.  The final tally for artifacts and material samples is 9,981; the final tally for whole and fragmentary bones and other tissues such as baleen number 66,673. The continuing analyses of the date are focused on distinguishing differences between artistic designs and styles of the artifacts from the sites, and examining the types of animals that were hunted to determine if there are differences in the species that were used. The artifacts that were made and the animals that were by the inhabitants of each site appear to reflect distinctive histories for each group of inhabitants, their social and cultural characteristics, and their preferences. Intellectual merits of the work include reporting the results of the field work of seven field seasons and analysis of social interactions, socioterritorial organization, and subsistence economies in a large whaling village.  The analyses data for the collections that have been completed and the collections themsefves will be maintained at the Museum of the North, Fairbanks, and other researchers will have access to these new data for their own studies. The project is also illuminating the nature of Siberian influences on Wales inhabitants. The results will help define the cultural relationships between the inhabitants of eastern Bering Strait, during a period of prehistory when major changes occurred in the cultural development the historic Eskimo including the development of Inupiat social and territorial organization, subsistence patterns and technology.  The faunal analyses have yielded insights into the types of prey species that were exploited in a whaling settlement.  The results that have emerged provide an increasingly clear picture of the role whaling played in the late prehistoric  whale hunting cultures against the backdrop of other prey species that were utilized.  The new information therefore illuminates the cultural context of modern whaling by Alaska Natives. The broader impacts of the project include defining the prehistoric interactions between the occupants of each of the sites who lived adjacent to one another relate closely to the same types of interactions between groups in historic circumstances, and to those of modern societies, in which enclaves of immigrants exist in a larger society.  The results of the investigation of the prehistoric Wales inter-ethnic social interactions will therefore inform f...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
