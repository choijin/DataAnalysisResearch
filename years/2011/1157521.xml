<AbstractNarration>Land-change research has identified a number of factors that influence deforestation and forest fragmentation, including fiscal incentives, infrastructure development, migration, and household processes.  This research project will expand the explanatory power of land-change research by considering a factor that has not been adequately studied, namely social processes stemming from unequal access to land resources.  The project's investigators will broaden the concept of land-change agency or responsibility, often deployed uncritically in land-change research, by considering social actions and reactions occurring over decadal time periods and by actors who do not always behave in economically "rational" ways.  The researchers will develop a comprehensive perspective on land change for southeastern Para state of northern Brazil, a laboratory and battleground for myriad Amazonian development initiatives.  To characterize land change between 1984 and 2010, including deforestation, reforestation, and forest patch dynamics, the researchers will employ remote sensing and landscape ecology techniques.  To examine the social process aspects of land change, especially contention over land, they will conduct a thorough news media analysis covering more than 5,000 news accounts of conflict.  They will complement this archival research with field interviews and intensive case-studies involving at least five landowners and many local key informants.  By mixing field interviews with remote sensing and landscape ecology, the researchers will treat Amazonian land change as an integrated system of processes, not just a singular process of deforestation driven by "rational" economic decisions. The investigators expect to find that properties that play host to contention displayed greater overall deforestation and increased (or different) forest fragmentation patterns than for properties that were not contested.  The researchers will seek to ascertain whether contention has led to a forest structure shift, creating a more complex forest landscape with negative implications for the region's ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will reframe land change in the study area as a process occurring within a context of social contention, and it will shed light on how social processes and multiple, sometimes simultaneous, land managers affect land change.  The project will help extend accepted theories and perspectives in land-change science, specifically responding to recent calls for opening behavior-based explanations of land change to the influences of social processes and power relations.  By evaluating the environmental implications of land conflict, the project will shed light on how conflict could affect the contribution of tropical deforestation to global climate change.  It will provide new perspectives for evaluating initiatives to reduce deforestation via the UN's REDD program and have policy relevance in many other nations.  By adopting an active learning paradigm, students will study complex issues of societal import in all their "real world" messiness in undergraduate courses in the U.S. and Brazil.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Contentious Land Change (CLC) is a process by which social conflict over land resources results in enhanced land change. In the context of this project the land change of interest was forest change -- deforestation, forest regrowth, and forest fragmentation. Overall, the outcome of this project shows that land conflict does significantly affect deforestation, reforestation, and forest fragmentation processes in the study area (the Eastern Brazilian Amazon). The project addressed the hypotheses below using a 27-year long annual longitudinal dataset of 180 large ranches in the Brazilian state of Par&aacute; from 1984 through 2010.  In this part of the Amazon, and many others, contention over land rights as part of an ongoing agrarian reform struggle takes a very public form, with large landholders and landless social movements facing off. This conflict induces a number of different behaviors regarding forest cover, regrowth, and forest fragmentation, which the project addressed through the following hypotheses.  HYPOTHESES REGARDING DEFORESTATION AND LAND CONFLICT (CONTENTION)  The hypotheses focusing on conflict and deforestation were divided into long-run and short-run timescales.  Long Run (LR) Hypotheses: H-LR-1 states that, given two identical properties (same sizes, soil qualities, etc.), one with contention and one without, the contentious property deforests more quickly (H-LR-1a), and ultimately achieves a greater amount of deforestation than the property without contention (H-LR-1b).  Results:  H-LR-1: Land conflict (contention) significantly enhances deforestation in the study area. Hypothesis Supported. H-LR-1a: Contentious properties do not deforest more quickly than those which do not have contention, over the entire time period. Hypothesis not Supported. H-LR-1b: Contentious properties do not achieve greater total deforestation than those without contention. By the end of the study period deforestation is almost total (i.e., very little forest cover remains). Hypothesis not Supported.   Short Run (SR) Hypotheses: Our first short-run hypothesis is divided into two sub-hypotheses, namely that deforestation rates under DALR (Direct Action Land Reform) and owner controlled intervals are identical (H-SR-1a), but rate variance is greater for owner controlled intervals than DALR controlled ones (H-SR-1b). The second short-run hypothesis (H-SR-2) asserts that secondary regrowth is more likely during owner-controlled regimes, given an ownerÆs propensity for a wait-and-see response as compared to DALR partisans, who must show productive use and farm for their own subsistence.   Results:  H-SR-1a: Deforestation rates under DALR and owner controlled intervals are identical. Hypothesis Supported. H-SR-1b: Deforestation rate variance is identical during owner-controlled intervals and DALR controlled intervals. Hypothesis not Supported. H-SR-2: Secondary regrowth is more likely during owner-controlled regimes. Supported.   HYPOTHESES REGARDING FOREST FRAGMENTATION AND LAND CONFLICT (CONTENTION)  Hypotheses focusing on conflict and forest fragmentation were not divided according to long-run and short-run timescales.  Forest Fragmentation Hypotheses: H-FF-1a states that as properties remain free of DALR activities, they evidence forest fragmentation consistent with a large-holder pattern, while H-FF-1b asserts that fragmentation structure shifts with the onset of DALR to an independent settlement pattern. HFF-2, states that a break in fractal dimension is present in the Brazil-Nut Polygon, with agricultural patches less than about 1200 ha showing great complexity (high perimeter-to-area ratio) than larger ones.  Results:  H-FF-1a: Forest fragmentation is greater on properties which experience DALR activities. There are more, larger, and less complex patches on properties which remain free of DALR activities, which is consistent with a largeholder pattern. Supported. H-FF-1b: Analysis is ongoing given the exploratory and temporal n...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
