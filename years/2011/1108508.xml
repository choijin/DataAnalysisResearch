My proposed research project was to apply synthetic methodology that I have developed during my Ph.D. work in the laboratory of Professor Jin-Quan Yu at The Scripps Research Institute to streamline the synthesize of poly(<em>p</em>-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivatives, an important class of conducting polymers with electroluminescent properties.</p> <p>Upon my arrival in the Nozaki lab, I began my work by preparing a key test substrate in three steps using using routine chemistry.

Several years ago, the Nozaki lab discovered an iridium complex that is the most efficient catalyst reported to date for this reaction, and my efforts centered on developing the next generation of catalysts with improved reactivity.
