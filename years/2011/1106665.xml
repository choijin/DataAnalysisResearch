<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy was held in Oakland CA on May 22 &ndash; 25, 2011. Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for the presentation of developments in computer security and electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field.  The Symposium consisted of 34 technical papers, a series of work in progress presentations and a poster session.  In addition to the core research papers, the symposium also featured Systematization of Knowledge papers.  These papers provided a high value to the community and to students in particular.  Systematization papers include survey papers that provide useful perspectives on major research areas, papers that support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, or papers that provide an extensive and realistic evaluation of competing approaches to solving specific problems.  These are particularly useful to students and provided the opportunity for the students to gain a broad understanding of the field.  This grant provided funding to assist 15 US-based students to attend this meeting. Participation in symposia like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  A goal of the travel grant program was to encourage participation in the conference by students that would normally ?nd it difficult to attend. Criteria included evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. We encouraged participation of women and under-represented minorities.  The amount of support provided to each student was on average $1000.  This amount covered a portion of the studentÃ†s travel (economy airfare), lodging for two nights and conference registration.  Student participation in the conference benefited the students as well as other conference attendees who benefited from the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with a new generation of researchers.
