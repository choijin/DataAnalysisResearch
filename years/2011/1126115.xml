<AbstractNarration>Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS and UPS, respectively) provide information on chemical composition, chemical states, and electronic properties of surfaces and interfaces, which are critical to assist the understanding and further development of materials for a broad range of applications.  The UPS capability coupled with the C60 ion sputtering source further expands the instrumentation capability to 'soft materials' such as organic, polymeric, and biological materials, which have received great scientific interests in recent decades. Examples of current NSF sponsored projects at the University of Florida that will greatly benefit from this instrument include: (1) characterization of organic-based semiconductors and interfaces for electronic and optoelectronic applications; (2) surfaces and interfaces of metal phosphonate and cyanometallate materials; (3) molecular approaches to directional growth of nanostructures for nanoelectronics; (4) microstructure-informed design methodology for advanced magnesium alloys; (5) graphene and other carbon-based materials and interfaces; (6) self-assembled colloidal nanoparticles for magnetic/biosensing applications. The Major Analytical Instrumentation Center (MAIC) is a user facility providing analytical microscopy and spectrometry instrumentation support to all disciplines at the university and the surrounding community. The state-of-the-art XPS/UPS instrument requested in this proposal replaces a 25-year-old XPS system, which not only accelerates the progress in various research programs through the vastly increased efficiency, but also provides new information through spatial imaging, high resolution chemical profiling, and vast expansion of the realm of materials to be characterized. The broader impacts of this instrumentation are also realized through a number of educational and outreach activities at the University of Florida and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Summary:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advancement of many modern technologies, such as various energy solutions (storage, conversion, and conservation), nanotechnology, electronics and photonics, biomaterials and biotechnology, and transportation, rests upon the fundamental understanding of surfaces of the relevant materials and/or interfaces between different material components.  One of the most informative surface analytical techniques is the x-ray or ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS, respectively), in which an x-ray or ultraviolet light is shone on the targeted materials and the types of atoms and the local chemical environment and physical properties of these atoms in the material near the surface are revealed by analyzing the energy of electrons ejected from the material surface.  Buried material interfaces can also be probed when combining XPS/UPS with appropriate material deposition or removal techniques.  The state-of-the-art XPS/UPS instrument requested in this proposal replaces a 25-year-old XPS system at the Major Analytical Instrumentation Center (MAIC), a user facility at the University of Florida which hosts an array of analytical instrumentation for the study of various types of materials. The new instrument provides vastly increased efficiency, new information through spatial imaging, higher energy resolution, and vast expansion of the realm of materials to be characterized. Furthermore, the new instrument provides unique opportunities for the cross-disciplinary research training and education of many graduate and undergraduate students, as well as opportunities for outreach to K-12 students and teachers and the general science and engineering community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this MRI project, the University of Florida (UF) acquired a user-facility X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) system, a PHI 5000 VersaProbe II Scanning ESCA Microprobe system, to support multidisciplinary materials characterization efforts at the University. The monochromatic X-ray source provides high energy resolution for the analysis of elemental composition and chemical structures of many different classes of materials.  The small-spot X-ray source further provides two-dimensional imaging (scanning) capabilities of such materials information with spatial resolution of several microns.  The UPS capability coupled with the C60 ion sputtering source further expands the instrumentation capability to "soft materials" such as organic, polymeric, and biological materials.  The new state-of-the-art XPS/UPS instrument is housed in the Major Analytical Instrumentation Center (MAIC), a materials characterization and analysis user facility which has more than 20 years of history providing analytical support for Florida's scientific and engineering community in meeting the challenge of technology development.  It replaces a 25-year-old XPS system at UF, which not only accelerates the progress in various research programs through the vastly increased efficiency, but also provides new information through spatial imaging, high resolution chemical profiling, and vast expansion of the realm of materials to be characterized.  The new instrument was delivered and installed in September 2012, and became open for general use in Fall 2013 after the initial installation and testing period.  Three graduate students including two female worked closely with the PIs and the MAIC staff in the acquisition and installation of the new instrument.  Users of this new instrument now includes 31 graduate students and 4 postdoctoral fellows from 18 different research groups in 6 departments at the University of Florida, as well as external users from two other universities and two companies in the State of Florida.  Research results obtained using this instrument has been incorporated into publications in high-impact journals such as Nature Photonics, Journal of the American Chemical Society, and Chemistry of Materials, as well as in multiple Ph.D. and M.S. dissertations and in multiple invited presentations or seminars at international conferences and international/domestic universities.  This state-of-the-art instrument also enhanced various outreach activities at the University of Florida to high school students and their parents/teachers.
