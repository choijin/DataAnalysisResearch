<AbstractNarration>Government corruption is widespread in Africa. However, as spectacular as scandals&lt;br/&gt;involving corruption in the central government might be, it is the behavior of local officials that&lt;br/&gt;most citizens directly experience, and it is at this level that government officials may be&lt;br/&gt;especially susceptible given the lack of media presence and bureaucratic oversight. A culture of&lt;br/&gt;corruption promotes short-term, selfish behavior and punishes behavior that citizens would&lt;br/&gt;consider fair and oriented towards the common good, such as egalitarianism and trust. The&lt;br/&gt;consequences of such behavior can be disastrous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what causes corruption? Is the widespread corruption in African politics the product&lt;br/&gt;of political institutions or of the type of individuals who seek office? Do individuals prone to&lt;br/&gt;corruption self-select into government positions or does holding office condition traits that&lt;br/&gt;underlie corrupt behavior? Some researchers in political science assert that political institutions&lt;br/&gt;are responsible for corruption in Africa. Others argue that Africa faces widespread corruption&lt;br/&gt;because Africans are corrupt, that their culture embeds corruption in tradition and interactions.&lt;br/&gt;According to the viewpoint of the former group, that of the institutionalists, corruption arises&lt;br/&gt;after political officials take office. According to the latter viewpoint, the cultural viewpoint,&lt;br/&gt;corruption is ever-present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For my dissertation, I plan to test whether political institutions cause corruption using a&lt;br/&gt;novel series of experiments with local-level political leaders in Zambia and Tanzania. Since&lt;br/&gt;Zambia and Tanzania have similar national levels of corruption but different corruption&lt;br/&gt;environments at the local level, they are compelling comparison cases. Designing research to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the origins of corruption is difficult, since most of the existing data is based on&lt;br/&gt;surveys of citizens, not based on the behaviors of government officials. Fortunately, there is an&lt;br/&gt;alternative approach that I plan to utilize in my dissertation. I will gather real politicians to&lt;br/&gt;observe their choices in person, allowing me to observe how choices are made and where&lt;br/&gt;corruption arises. This method of data collection will allow me to observe the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;government officials rather than studying corruption via third party surveys. I will recruit a&lt;br/&gt;sample of politicians who ran for local government in Zambia and Tanzania. Some of the&lt;br/&gt;subjects will have won the last election and some of them will have lost, providing me with&lt;br/&gt;comparison groups. With carefully chosen comparison groups, any differences in behavior in my&lt;br/&gt;experiments can be attributed to the political institutions associated with holding office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work holds promise for both policymaking and science. Donors and&lt;br/&gt;international organizations believe that corruption undermines prosperous and peaceful&lt;br/&gt;governments in Africa. While some members of this group believe that the creation and support&lt;br/&gt;of well-designed political institutions can reduce the level and extent of unethical behavior,&lt;br/&gt;others believe that such behavior is too culturally entrenched to change. There is little rigorous&lt;br/&gt;research to inform these positions. My dissertation will help provide a theoretically informed and&lt;br/&gt;methodologically sound examination of the foundations of corruption. Understanding the causes&lt;br/&gt;of corruption can enable policymakers to create institutions designed to moderate its existence&lt;br/&gt;and effects. The project also takes an important step forward in the use of politicians as&lt;br/&gt;participants in the study of corruption. Hundreds of research projects have been designed to&lt;br/&gt;tackle issues of politics, but none that we know of use actual politicians to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;foundations of the choices of the political elite.</AbstractNarration>
