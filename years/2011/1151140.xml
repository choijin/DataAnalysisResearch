<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to address some major issues of polymer solar cells related to the efficiency and reliability, and enrich current understanding of the fundamental structure-property relationships involved in polymer photovoltaics. The approach is to engineer active layer morphology in both lateral and vertical directions using polymer brush structure with incorporation of block copolymer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: With controlled morphology from nanodomain pre-patterning followed by polymer brush growth, a composite bilayer structure will be built to facilitate both exciton dissociation and charge transport. The polymer brushes in the down layer provide direct pathways for hole transport, while the up donor-acceptor blend layer mediated by block copolymer keeps the large interfacial area for efficient exciton dissociation and harvesting. Moreover, the enhanced crystallinity and optimized vertical composition profile facilitate charge transport and collection. The fundamental structure-property relationships, such as how chain conformation and packing from polymer brush and block copolymer affect efficiency and thermal stability, will be systematically studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project presents synergistic integration of interdisciplinary research and education. The outcome will impact society by implementing multidisciplinary education and outreach programs. It will provide graduate and undergraduate students with substantial multidisciplinary trainings which are essential for success in their future careers. The outreach to 7th-12th grade minority students will be accomplished through the PI?s participation in Alabama Black Belt program, in which the PI develops scientific modules on nanotechnology and solar energy and provides trainings for teachers from secondary schools in Alabama.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project, we systematically studied the P3HT polymer brushes growth and the correlation between annealing conditions and thickness of brushes. As annealing temperature increases, both grafting density and brush thickness increase. For the best charge transport in polymer brushes, the brush thickness should be low while the grafting density should be high. When P3HT brushes are grafted on ITO substrate serving as anode buffer layer, organic P3HT/PCBM bulk heterojunction solar cells show a remarkable improvement in the short-circuit current, which suggests that polymer brushes as an interfacial, hole transporting layer offer considerable potential in organic photovoltaics. We also investigated the effect of vertical compositional profile on the performance of organic solar cells. Organic solar cells with either uniform or charge transport favorable configuration have demonstrated the highest efficiency among five variations of vertical compositions. This conclusion applies for both regular and inverted organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells. With partial support of this five year CAREER grant, five students completed their graduate study and graduated with PhD degree. Multiple research papers have been published in well-circulated journals. The research results were also disseminated to communities by conference presentations and invited seminar talks.</p> <p>As accomplishments of broader impacts, the PI supervised over ten undergraduate researchers, REU students and two senior capstone design teams, where one undergraduate researcher published two papers in top journals, another undergraduate student won the first place twice in the engineering poster competition, Undergraduate Research &amp; Creative Activity Conference at the University of Alabama (UA) in year 2014 and 2015. Also, one graduate-level course, ECE 630 Organic Materials and Devices, has been developed and well accepted with overall evaluation of 5.0/5.0. In addition, the PI is active in outreach activities, in particular he participated in Alabama Black Belt program. Over the last five years, the PI developed five scientific modules, including "The Power of Nano - Size Effect", "Big Science from the Small World of Atom - Understanding Atomic Structure with 3D Visualization", &ldquo;ABCs of Nano&rdquo;, "How Catalyst Works in Water Splitting", and &ldquo;Color Magic&rdquo;. These modules were demonstrated in middle school classrooms in the Black Belt Region of Alabama. Each year the PI also joined SECME (Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering) Summer Institute (2012-2017) to train secondary school teachers from minority and economically disadvantaged public schools to outreach and promote STEM education of minority students. &nbsp;The PI has advised over five high school summer interns from the MINT center outreach program at UA. One high school summer intern was a 2015 national semifinalist of The Intel Science Talent Search (Intel STS), and two won the best presentation award from the MINT center.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/20/2018<br>      Modified by: Dawen&nbsp;Li</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1151140/1151140_10152939_1532037845667_P3HTbrushesandannealing--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1151140/1151140_10152939_1532037845667_P3HTbrushesandannealing--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Polymer brushes and annealing"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1151140/1151140_10152939_1532037845667_P3HTbrushesandannealing--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Polymer brushes and annealing"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic of P3HT polymer brushes and annealing</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dawen Li</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dawen&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Polymer brushes and annealing</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1151140/1151140_10152939_1532038009364_Verticalcompositionprofilessubmitted--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1151140/1151140_10152939_1532038009364_Verticalcompositionprofilessubmitted--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Vertical composition profile"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1151140/1151140_10152939_1532038009364_Verticalcompositionprofilessubmitted--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Vertical composition profile"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic of vertical composition profile for both regular and inverted organic bulk heterojunction solar cells</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dawen Li</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dawen&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Vertical composition profile</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1151140/1151140_10152939_1532038138222_J-Vcurvessubmitted--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1151140/1151140_10152939_1532038138222_J-Vcurvessubmitted--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Current versus voltage characteristics of organic solar cells"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1151140/1151140_10152939_1532038138222_J-Vcurvessubmitted--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Current versus voltage characteristics of organic solar cells"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Current versus voltage characteristics of organic solar cells with both regular and inverted structures</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dawen Li</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dawen&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Current versus voltage characteristics of organic solar cells</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
