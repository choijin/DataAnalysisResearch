<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to study two rapidly disappearing languages, Jernih-Sarolangun and Lolo-Kecil, spoken in isolated locations in Sumatra (Indonesia). These languages have unique grammatical properties that make them important for the scientific study of cognitive/cultural variation, despite the small number of speakers they have.  They display a mixture of grammatical characteristics typical of their language family (Malayic), and grammatical characteristics that are otherwise unknown in frequently studied Malayic languages like Malay/Indonesian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jernih-Sarolangun and Lolo-Kecil differ from Malay/Indonesian in that most words in the languages have two systematically different forms (technical term: ablaut).  A major focus of this project is to document, describe and analyze the different grammatical factors that determine speakers' choice between these forms in each language.  For example, in Jernih-Sarolangun, one verb form appears if the verb takes a full noun phrase as an object, or if the verb is used intransitively. The second verb form is employed if the object is a pronoun (which might be null). In comparison, the choice in Lolo Kecil is determined largely by transitivity alone, regardless of whether the object is full noun phrase or pronoun. However, if the verb is understood as contrasting with another verb, the form which normally appears without a direct object can also appear with an overt object.  These variations are important in determining the ways that languages can differ from each other and the ways that languages are alike (possibly due to human genetic endowment).  This project will sharpen our understanding of these and other grammatical alternations in these endangered languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes the collection and archiving of samples of each language, and detailed description of the grammar and sound systems of the languages.  In addition, theoretical studies will be submitted for journal publication.  The archived data will be deposited in a publicly available archive of digital linguistic data.  The research is an international collaboration that will be carried out by linguists from the University of Delaware and the Jakarta Field Station of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project focused on the Malayic languages spoken in rural areas of southern and central Sumatra in Indonesia. Sumatra is a large island (1110 miles in length) on which more than 50 languages are spoken (in addition to the official language of Indonesia, Bahasa Indonesia). While many of the languages of Indonesia have been viewed as dialects of a single language, Malay, these languages differ from each other as much as e.g. French does from Portuguese; that is, they are not mutually comprehensible.  Thus, we refer to all such langauges as Malayic languages rather than as Malay.  Our emphasis was on a subgroup of languages that are unique among the Malayic languages because they they exhibit an unusual morphological ablaut phenomenon: In these languages words have more than one form depending on what words and word endings (suffixes) are found nearby.  These languages were almost completely unstudied prior to our project.  The objective of the project was to understand the conditions under which the different languages chose one form or another of a word, and how these unusual grammatical systems developed over time.  We also tried to map the geographical distribution of the different systems. In addition to conducting descriptive and theoretical research, this project has resulted in the development of the first databases of natural speech (personal narratives, stories etc.) for these varieties and the training of native speakers in how to document (record, transcribe and describe) their native languages.      The most important achievement of the project was to document six previously unstudied Malayic languages.  We collected stories and narratives in each of these languages, provided a word-by-word gloss (translation) of each of the texts, as well as a free translation.  All of the languages we documented are in danger of disappearing in the near future as many speakers are switching from their local language to the national language, Indonesian.  The texts we documented have been deposited and made publically available for schilars of all disciplines in an archive of endangered languages in the Netherlands (TLA, The Language Archive).      The second goal of the project was to describe the grammars of the languages we documented and to compare them with previously studied varieties.  We published eight articles in internationally refereed journals in which we described these languages and discussed the theoretical significance of the results for linguistics as a discipline.  We also gave many presentations of our results at international conferences and elsewhere, and published a variety of chapters in volumes dealing with related topics.      The project also led to the publication of a volume of stories in one of the languages we studied, Jambi Malay.  This book was made available to speakers of the language (the local community) and there are plans to make use of the book in local schools etc.  The project also led to the training of native speakers of the languages studied in language documentation and linguistics.
