<AbstractNarration>Shippensburg University is a teaching institution that will partner with regional campuses in the central Pennsylvania area to promote the recruitment, retention and advancement of women in the academic STEM disciplines.  The proposed ADVANCE PAID institutional partners are Elizabethtown College and Harrisburg University of Science and Technology.  The primary goals of this project are to assess the climate among central Pennsylvania institutions and develop a web based resource to support gender equity strategies.  This project seeks to link all partner institutions in a professional network through the statewide Innovation Transfer Network (ITN), a shared entity that creates opportunities for technology transfer in the central Pennsylvania region.  Additionally, the ITN serves nine other regional institutions, including a community college.  Collectively, the ITN represents over 3,000 faculty, thus, the Shippensburg University PAID project consists of a broad base for transformation and relevant outcomes assessment of gender equity activity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the focus on analysis, modification and adoption of proven ADVANCE best practices for promoting and supporting the advancement of women faculty at non research intensive institutions.  The highly developed and synergistic partnership is a strong asset to the project and will, ultimately, impact thousands of faculty across the central Pennsylvania region and serve as a model for the remainder of the state's higher education system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;Because of the focus of this project on teaching, non research intensive institutions, the Shippensburg ADVANCE PAID project will have a dramatic impact on promoting gender equity at all institutions of similar type in the US.  This is particularly significant given the disproportionately high number of women faculty who are employed at these institution types.</AbstractNarration>

Research  The project research team focused on the topic of policy affecting gender equity in five (SU, EC, HU, Wilson College, Franklin &amp; Marshall College) participating institutions and in higher education more broadly.  A literature review was conducted to define likely policy barriers and promising approaches to improvement as a framework for the project study.  Data collection surveys and interviews were based on this framework. Research findings were shared both with individual campus leadership teams and publicly, and in the aggregate, with regional stakeholders to include recommendations for policy improvement. Results were also shared at two national conferences, as well as at the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) Human Resources Conference.   Recruitment  STEM-UP PA partnered with WISELI at University of Wisconsin to develop an evidence-based workshop, train-the-trainer modules, and written guidelines targeting innovative recruitment practices that promote the hiring of women STEM faculty, as well as lifting up issues of unconscious bias in the recruitment process.  The availability of this workshop and training was disseminated through the STEM-UP PA network and institutions within ITN. The materials developed were delivered at three campus-specific workshops, multiple sessions at STEM-UP summits, a workshop as a part of PASSHE?s Diversity Conference, and a webinar entitled Retaining Women in the STEM Fields. Additionally, in 2012-2013, a presentation of the workshop was held for the region with 32 participants from 12 schools attending. Overall approximately 135 individuals received this training.  Retention  STEM-UP PA, based on models from other ADVANCE programs, developed the STEM-UP PA Mentoring Network to include an Executive Committee (MNEC), an application and matching process for mentors and mentees, a required orientation program, a check-in system with members, an online portal for mentoring pairs, and an annual evaluation process for the program.  In its first year, the Mentoring Network hosted 7 mentor/mentee pairs (14 members from 5 institutions); in now its third year, the Mentoring Network is hosting 26 pairs (52 participants from 20 institutions).  The MNEC has developed and delivered core workshops and summits on a variety of topics, e.g. engaged teaching strategies, self-advocacy, innovative teaching strategies, writing productivity, career advancement, managing competing work/life priorities, and navigating promotion and tenure.  Active participants are expected to attend at least one of  three core workshops offered annually; network members are also invited to participate.   This program is being continued beyond the grant with some financial support from SU and ITN.   Professional Development  In partnership with Rutgers University?s OASIS program, now in its ninth year, STEM-UP PA created a leadership development program in Pennsylvania that is specific to academic women.  The program spans a semester and combines one-to-one coaching with peer learning group activities, and formal workshops to build skills in leadership, self-advocacy and efficacy, teamwork, personal branding, negotiation, networking, and developing strategies for navigating competing priorities. The program has been offered three times (only two offerings were projected in the grant) in the past three years to 35 academic women in Pennsylvania. A summer 2016 offering is currently being promoted with some support from HU.  Beyond the Grant  The project leadership team continues to meet and provide programming with support, but minimal funding, from participating institutions.  The project team submitted a proposal and draft plan to the Social Entrepreneurship Institute (SEI) at Elizabethtown College and has been accepted as a client with SEI to build out the STEM-UP plan in order to seek future funding and investments to continue our work in support of academic women.  Long-term assessment of the program?s impacts on individual participants in the various programs is planned and will be executed over the summer of 2016.  Continued exploration of how to grow and maintain the network?s presence and utility on the internet and in social media is also in planning.
