<AbstractNarration>The researchers aim to construct a high resolution sea level curve for the western Mediterranean Basin as part of an effort to better understand global sea level variations. The island of Mallorca contains coastal caves that capture present and past sea level through the deposition of unique carbonate encrustations that form precisely at the sea level position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coastal caves of Mallorca were chosen for this study because of their demonstrated ability to obtain a high resolution sea-level history and the importance of the locality for addressing the issue of eustatic sea level change due to its unique tectonic and isostatic setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study will be of broad interest to a wide range of scientists interested in sea level variability and the vulnerability of ice sheets under a range of boundary conditions. The project will also foster strong collaborations among American and Spanish scientists and will support graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
