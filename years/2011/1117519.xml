<AbstractNarration>The project exploits the sophisticated and robust machinery of bacteria for actuation, sensing, communication, and control of a new class of micron scale robotic systems called BacteriaBots.  This is achieved through (1) computational modeling of bio-actuation and sensing, (2) use of quorum sensing-based behaviors, and (3) use of mobile networks of BacteriaBots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort contributes to the critical understanding required to advance the science of bio-hybrid micro-robotics and distributed control at reduced length scales. This holds enormous promise for socio-economic benefit by significantly impacting the fields of bio-sensing, medicine, micro-manufacturing and assembly, microelectronics, and bio-materials. A multi-tier education and outreach plan integrates research elements and discoveries into multi-disciplinary educational research experiences for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Control and communication for a distributed network of robotic agents is a challenging problem to solve at the microscale. In nature, bacteria utilize chemical signaling to execute controlled movement, communication, and collaborative task completion. Chemotactic response (i.e. biased random walk of bacteria towards a chemo-attractant source) enables effective sensing and creates a biased distribution of bacteria in a field. Quorum sensing allows a robust collective response to be achieved at specific bacteria number densities. In this project, we developed the scientific knowledge and the technology needed in order to exploit the sophisticated and robust machinery of bacteria for actuation, sensing, communication, and control of a new class of micron scale (characteristic length: 2-10 &mu;m) robotic systems called &ldquo;BacteriaBots&rdquo;.
