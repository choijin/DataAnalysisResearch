<AbstractNarration>The investigator plans to investigate several questions linked by the common themes of local Tb Theorems, and the interplay between singular integral estimates, Poisson kernel estimates, square function estimates, and the regularity of boundaries. Among the main directions of the proposed research are: 1. To investigate the relationships among boundedness of layer potentials, properties of harmonic measure, and uniform rectifiability. 2. To investigate the structure of uniformly rectifiable sets. 3. To develop and apply "local" Tb theorems to study the regularity of free boundaries and the solvability of elliptic boundary value problems. 4. To develop techniques to study the solvability of boundary value problems for complex elliptic equations, or more generally, for strongly elliptic systems, with bounded measurable coefficients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project lies within the field of harmonic analysis and its application to, and interaction with, geometric measure theory and the theory of elliptic partial differential equations.  Roughly speaking, in harmonic analysis one investigates properties of functions and "operators" (i.e., mappings which transform one function into another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces, which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the pieces.  The name itself arose by analogy to the decomposition of a musical sound into its various frequency components ("harmonics").  Geometric measure theory involves the study of the relationship between geometric properties of sets, and their "measures" (the latter are generalizations of the notions of length, area, and volume).  Partial differential equations and systems of elliptic type describe a wide variety of phenoma in the real world, including electrostatics, and steady-state temperature distributions and elastic deformations.  A particular focus of the present proposal is to explore further the relationship between geometry and properties of "harmonic measure." The latter area of investigation has already found application in recent work in acoustical engineering, in particular in the design of a room with desirable acoustic properties. Progress on the problems to be considered would in all likelihood open up further avenues of investigation. All such progress will be disseminated by the investigator via lectures at conferences, seminars and graduate courses, and via electronic preprints posted on his website and on the ArXiv web site.  The investigator will involve Ph.D. students and a postdoc on problems related to the proposed work. Two former postdocs are already involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, the PI treated several problems in the theory of partial differential equations("PDE") of elliptic type, in particular exploring the interplay between the behavior of solutions of such equations,and the geometry of the region in space (the "domain") in which they act, using techniques of harmonic analysis. Elliptic PDE arise in the mathematical analysis of steady state phenomena, e.g., electrostatics or steady state heat conduction.      The project is motivated by the following guiding principle:  that the geometry of the boundary of the domain affects the behavior of solutions at the boundary, and conversely,  that knowledge of the boundary behavior of solutions may allow one to glean insight into the boundary's geometric properties.  Ideally, one would like to quantify  this interaction between PDE and geometry, the understanding of which can have practical applications:  for example, in acoustical engineering, to design a room with suitable acoustic properties.   Let us discuss these notions a bit more precisely, using the steady state heat conduction model for purposes of illustration. It turns out that, in seeking to understand the connection with the geometry of the boundary,  the natural sort of solution to consider is one that is constant on the boundary,   (i.e., the surface temperature is constant), in which case the relationship that one investigates is that between the geometry of the boundary and the "heat flux" (the rate of change of temperature perpendicular to the boundary).  The constant temperature assumption at the boundary arises, e.g., at the liquid/solid interface of a material undergoing a phase transition.  In this project, the PI has obtained quantitative relationships between the heat flux of such a solution, and the "rectifiability" of the boundary; the latter notion entails an appropriate sort of local approximability by hyperplanes.   In the course of the project, the PI has supervised 4 graduate students and 2 postdoctoral fellows.       Last Modified: 08/22/2015       Submitted by: Steven C Hofmann]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
