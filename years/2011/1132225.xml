<AbstractNarration>1132225&lt;br/&gt;Cunningham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The PI proposes a development of a new type of optical biosensor that utilizes a photonic crystal (PC) surface as one end facet of a diode-pumped external cavity laser that is capable of both high resolution label-free detection and fluorescence enhancement. The PC is fabricated inexpensively using plastic materials over large surface areas by nanoreplica molding for incorporation into multiwell microplates, and is designed to operate as a resonant reflection filter. For label-free biosensing, adsorption of biomaterial onto the PC surface results in a shift in its resonant wavelength, producing tuning of the external cavity laser operating wavelength. For enhanced fluorescence, rapid buildup of optical standing waves upon the PC surface at the laser emission wavelength will be designed to coincide with the optical absorption wavelength of fluorescent dye molecules used as biomolecule tags, resulting in amplified fluorophore excitation compared to an ordinary glass surface. The external cavity configuration provides single mode, continuous wave, widely tunable, narrowband laser output in which the stimulated emission process, with gain provided by a semiconductor diode, generates an active optical biosensor, in contrast to the wide variety of previous generations of passive reflectors/transmitters. The approach described in this proposal represents an unprecedented combination of high sensitivity + high resolution label-free detection. The project will expand upon recent preliminary demonstration of the external cavity laser biosensor to implement PC sensor surfaces and detection instrumentation capable of multi-mode operation for highly accurate referencing, sub-pm wavelength tuning, and reduction in detection limits for both label-free and fluorescence-tagged biomolecular assays.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we developed the first biosensing lasers, in which a nanostructured photonic crystal surface served as one mirror of a laser cavity, in which the lasing wavelength is tuned by addition of biomaterial to the photonic crystal surface.  Importantly, the photonic crystal surfaces can be inexpensively manufactured from flexible sheets of plastic film and incorporated into standard liquid handling labware that is used in the drug reserach industry.  The technology is aimed at some of the most challenging detection problems, in which researchers wish to measure how small molecules (such as drugs) interact with larger protein molecules that represent the specific target of a drug inside the body.  Because it is not possible to measure such interactions by applying a labeling material (such as a fluorescent dye molecule) to the small molecule, these types of interactions are best measured using "label-free" biosensing technologies.  The value of the External Cavity Laser (ECL) biosensor technology developed in this project is its ability to measure small molecule binding with immobilized protein targets with better signal-to-noise ratio than other methods, and to perform these measurements in a rapid, high throughput manner, as required in drug reserach.  The approach enables a variety of noise sources to be eliminated by allowing multiple sensors to lase at the same time, where one sensor can serve as a reference for the sensor performing the binding measurement.  We also demonstrated that the photonic crystal sensor signals could be enhanced ~4 times by fabricating the sensors from a porous material that allows the analytes to permeate into the sensor structure, rather than simply binding to the surface.
