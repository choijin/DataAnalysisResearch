<AbstractNarration>How do the morphological and physiological traits of organisms determine their responses to climate change?  Which traits are more likely to evolve?  To address these questions this project will integrate lab and field experiments with mathematical models for two species of Colias butterflies in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.  How temperature affects larval feeding, development, and heat tolerance will be measured and these results will be compared to historical lab data (30-50 years) to detect evolutionary changes.  This project will also compare adult morphological traits and heat tolerance to historical data and museum specimens (&gt;100 years).  To examine how traits influence performance, reciprocal transplant of larvae and adults across sites at different elevations will be conducted.  These data will be used to develop models that predict how traits determine survival and reproduction in changing climate conditions.  To predict the impact of future environmental change on Colias model simulations with and without trait evolution will be applied.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will train undergraduate and graduate students to conduct interdisciplinary environmental change research.  The project will continue initiatives for undergraduates to report current evolutionary research via articles and podcasts and to train high school teachers in global change ecology. We will apply our models to Colias in Rocky Mountain National Park and publically disseminate our predictions of possible climate change impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The researchers combined lab and field experiments with mathematical models to quantify the connections among climate, phenotype, population demography and microevolution, for two species of Colias butterflies in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.  In one species, Colias eriphyle, the researchers found evidence of evolution in response to recent climate change in a subset of developmental traits studied. Repeating a historic lab experiment showed that C. eriphyle larvae can now feed at warmer temperatures than they could 40 years ago, associated with an increase in the incident of extreme heat events during this time period.  To evaluate heat tolerance, the researchers exposed larvae from populations of C. eriphyle along an elevational (and climate) gradient. For the lower elevation population, they found that larval heat shock and temporarily increased larval expression of heat shock protein and decreased pupal mass.  By contrast for the higher elevation population, larval heat shock did not affect either larval expression of heat shock protein or pupal mass.  Adult butterflies of C. eriphyle utilize melanin on their hindwings to increase and regulate their body temperatures, and populations from higher elevation have great wing melanin. Past lab experiments showed that increasing temperatures during pupal development decreases adult wing melanin, a form of developmental plasticity. By repeating these historic experiments the researchers found no evidence that either mean or plasticity of wing melanin has evolved over the past 40 years in this species, despite increasing temperatures during this time period.  These results suggest that larval but not adult traits have evolved in response to recent climate in this system.     The researchers examined whether morphological traits that influence thermoregulation and body temperatures have evolved in response to recent climate change over the past 60 years in Colias meadii, a high-elevation species. They found that all three thermoregulatory traits increased in museum specimens despite climate warming.  Phenological shifts and fitness increases in formerly marginal high elevation habitats may have contributed to the increase.  In both the museum collections and field, the researchers found evidence of phenotypic plasticity shaping trait variation across seasons and years.     The researchers combined laboratory and field experiments with both species to translate these findings for traits into fitness implications.  They documented how differences in morphology, behavior and physiology among populations and species enable flight, which is related to fitness, in a variety of thermal conditions. Common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments revealed that Colias butterflies can achieve flight at lower temperatures than previously documented.  Morphological differences in thermoregulatory traits account for most of the differences in flight initiation among species, but differences in thermal sensitivity also contribute: Colias meadii, a high elevation species, initiated flight at a cooler average body temperature relative to C. eriphyle, a low elevation species.  C. meadii adults survived laboratory heat shocks better than C. eriphyle. However, morphology caused adult C. meadii to initiate heat avoidance earlier in the day in field common garden experiments.     The researchers coupled microclimate, biophysical and demographic models for adult butterflies to examine ecological, evolutionary, and plastic responses to climatic gradients and change. Environmental variability both within seasons and across years can drive variation in selection that slows evolution, consistent with our failure to document evolutionary shifts in phenotypes.  Contrary to theoretical models, the empirically informed model suggests plasticity can facilitate evolution in response to climate change by reducing variation in selection. The model results show that both the phenotypic and adaptive consequences of plasticity vary with elevation. In response to climate change in the past 60 years, our models predict evolutionary declines in mean absorptivity (but little change in plasticity) at high elevations, and evolutionary increases in plasticity (but little change in mean) at low elevation.  Our modeling results suggest that the interplay between seasonal variation and unpredictability determines the contributions of evolution and plasticity for adaptation to climate along environmental gradients.  Overall, our project illustrates how considering the complex interplay of environmental conditions and biological attributes may be essential to forecasting ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.     The project made significant contributions to research, education, and outreach. The project trained numerous students and provided professional development and mentoring opportunities to graduate students and postdocs.  Project scientists disseminated key results though presentations at workshops, scientific conferences, and universities as well as public presentations and blogging.  They contributed to a climate change education training program for high school teachers. They designed and conducted a hands-on science activity at museums, schools, and science outreach events and developed a butterfly garden to introduce Girl Scouts to ecology.  Kingsolver participated in professional development as Acting Associate Director of Informatics at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) and Buckley co-directed initiatives to advance interdisciplinary climate science.
