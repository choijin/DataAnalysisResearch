<AbstractNarration>Niezrecki 1129719 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan to hold a Wind Energy Research Workshop to take place mid-August 2011 in Lowell, Massachusetts.  This workshop will bring together a diverse audience with a collective wealth of knowledge that will:  &lt;br/&gt; (1) identify research gaps that currently exist in the wind industry &lt;br/&gt; (2) determine future research directions that will provide immediate and long-term benefits to the nations? ability to harness wind energy &lt;br/&gt; (3) exchange information via several panel sessions with distinguished and knowledgeable speakers &lt;br/&gt; (4) educate the wind-energy community about the relevant issues that need to be addressed to reduce the cost of wind harvested energy &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will focus on topics not covered by other conferences.  These topics include: Manufacturing, Structural Health Monitoring, NDI, Computational Modeling, Energy Storage, Workforce Development, and Offshore Wind.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exchange of knowledge and ideas by speakers and participants will advance the research of the participants and their institutions, agencies, and companies.  It will also foster collaborations leading to basic and applied research that increases the intellectual merit of the wind energy community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will award approximately 40 travel supplements to applicants that meet certain selection criteria. The funding to support participants, especially junior faculty and students, will be leveraged to support as large a number and as diverse a group as possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop discussions will not only enhance participants? understanding of the Wind-Energy field, they will also promote the development of research collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;A report highlighting the workshop outcomes will be published and participants? presentations will be posted on a website.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special effort will be made to ensure that the student awardees represent a significant number of underrepresented groups, as well as a diversity of institutions and geographic locations.</AbstractNarration>
