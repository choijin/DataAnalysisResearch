<AbstractNarration>This project will address the "frontier problem-solving" aspect missing in interdisciplinary research, and create a model of a course where experts from several disciplines collaborate on a complex project, particularly a field project. Today's science is increasingly an interdisciplinary endeavor, with researchers from several disciplines collaborating on a project. Yes, current graduate (and undergraduate) education is discipline-centered, with few opportunities for team projects, especially from outside the field. As a result, students are unprepared for the realities of cutting edge research. This problem is starting to be addressed by many institutions in a variety of ways. This work will design a highly integrated interdisciplinary field course, centered around computational and field biology research. The proposed course will be offered by the University of Illinois - Chicago, Princeton, and University of Nairobi where graduate students in biology (primarily ecology and evolutionary biology) and engineering (primarily in computer science and bioinformatics) work with faculty in both disciplines to learn how to ask questions, frame hypotheses and understand how and why the disciplines and cultures do this differently. Fieldwork will be conducted in Kenya.</AbstractNarration>

The group is in communication with the Smithsonian Institute to develop a general tablet-based application for field data collection.    Harvester ants group used video processing software to ask questions about how ants navigate in their environment. The developed software allowed students to track individual ants and measure such things as velocity, directions and the angle of turns, and how much an ant weaved back and forth over the course of its route. To facilitate scientific insight, the results were visualized using an innovative stereoscopic approach. Students found that when ants are put in test arenas those removed from trails were disoriented showing that they were on "autopilot" or "using cruise control" when on the trails but that ants off trail searching for food seemed to use environmental cues to navigate when not on their pre-existing trail networks: http://www.evl.uic.edu/kreda/field_entomology/   The Virtual Mpala group used advanced filming ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
