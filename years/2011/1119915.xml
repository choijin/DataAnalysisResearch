<AbstractNarration>Theory predicts that geographically complex regions should harbor exceptional biological diversity, and that past Earth history events such as climatic fluctuations will affect the diversification and maintenance of genetic variation.  The island of Madagascar represents one such complex region.  Only four groups of native terrestrial mammals exist on Madagascar; each colonized Madagascar a single time and then diversified to exhibit spectacular morphological and ecological variation.  This proposal focuses on the small insectivore-like mammals, especially on those species distributed throughout Madagascar's mountainous, humid-forest belt.  The project will use DNA sequences from multiple genes to determine how many genetically distinct sets of populations exist within each species, and to provide an estimate of how long ago they diverged.  The researchers will use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to model the niche of each species using climatic data sets to estimate the species' current ranges and to reconstruct their distributions during past glacial cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the forces that shape regional biodiversity is one of the key goals of modern biology.  This project will illuminate the importance of past climatic events in shaping present-day patterns of biodiversity.  It will reveal the extent of small-mammal diversity in Madagascar's humid forests and identify areas containing unexpected genetic variation, providing critical information for designing protected areas and conservation strategies in one of the world?s foremost biodiversity hotspots.  The researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students in DNA sequencing and analysis and GIS, including students from groups underrepresented in science.</AbstractNarration>

The mammals found only there include tenrecs and an enigmatic group of rodents (called nesomyines), both of which remain poorly known. The research aims of this project were to collaborate with other investigators (who focused on analyses using DNA and morphology/anatomy) to understand how many species exist in each group, where they are found, and how past environmental change affected their evolution and geographic ranges. Specifically, the activities conducted here focused on improving techniques for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer analyses that characterize the climatic requirements of a species, and use them to reconstruct the regions of Madagascar that are suitable for these species today and those that were in the past. The researchers produced computer code that automates this kind of analysis, also leading to a pilot version of a point-and-click/graphical-user-interface computer program that researchers and the interested public can use to learn about species ranges. The results for tenrecs and nesomyine rodents indicate that most species are currently restricted to high, wet areas in the mountains, with populations of each species typically isolated from each other by lowland gaps between the mountain ranges. In contrast, based on reconstructions of climate at the Last Glacial Maximum (the last &ldquo;Ice Age&rdquo;) approximately 21,000 years ago, the analyses indicate that larger portions of Madagascar were suitable for these species then, with populations connected across many lowland areas that were cooler at that time. These findings coincide with results of the DNA studies conducted by collaborators, which show that for most species the isolated populations are genetically different from each other (with the splits older than the Last Glacial Maximum).
