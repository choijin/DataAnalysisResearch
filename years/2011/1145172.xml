<AbstractNarration>There is mounting evidence that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a dramatic superluminal "Inflation" of a subnuclear volume. This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a Cosmic Gravitational-wave Background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale at which Inflation occurred. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with the amplitude parameterized by the ratio of tensor-to-scalar modes, r = T/S. Many theoretically favored models of Inflation produce this ratio between 0.01 and 0.1, corresponding to average amplitude from 30 to 100 nanoKelvins for the resulting CMB B-mode polarization patterns where they peak on scales of degrees. With this award, researchers from three U.S. institutions will focus on exploring and ultimately detecting the CGB polarization signature, which is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. In 2005, the Community Task Force on CMB Research identified a target sensitivity of that ratio equaling to 0.02 as an immediate goal to detect the Inflationary gravitational waves imprint in the CMB polarization that pertain to the standard cosmological model. The newly installed 'Small Polarimeter Upgrades for DASI' (SPUD) reconfigured a five- receivers telescope to the "South Pole Inflationary Cosmology Experiment" (SPICE) that  will: (a) Complete the CGB search in CMB B-mode polarization at 150 GHz, reaching depths which based on current sensitivity performance, that will detect the Inflationary CGB for r &gt; 0.02; (b) Prove that this signal is cosmic in origin while separately measuring the Galactic foreground contamination at its minimum; (c) Detect gravitational lensing of CMB polarization on scales of ~1 degree, probing the CGB to the lensing confusion limit for degree-scale observations (r &lt; 0.01) if the energy scale of Inflation is low; and (d) Surpass the instrumental sensitivity goals set forth for 2013 by the 2005 CMB Task Force recommendations. Detection of the CGB waves would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB radiation was to the Big Bang theory. Indeed, its impact may be even broader as nuclear physics had matured enough prior to the establishment of the "hot" Big Bang model, while Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics: the union of general relativity and quantum mechanics, string theory, and the highest accessible energies. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science and train students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Faint signatures imprinted in the polarization of the microwave sky can address questions at the forefront of modern cosmology.  If the entire observable Universe was spawned in a fraction of a second by the exponential ?inflation? of a subnuclear volume, as many cosmologists believe, quantum fluctuations are expected to produce a Cosmic Gravitational-wave Background (CGB) that may be detectable now via the faint signature imprinted in ?B-mode? patterns of degree-scale CMB polarization.  The strength of this B-mode microwave signature, measured in billionths of a degree, directly constrains the energy scale of the inflationary Big Bang.    This project enabled an array of telescopes at the South Pole to make the world?s most sensitive polarization maps in pursuit of this science goal.  By the end of the award period, these ultra-deep polarization maps now cover a variety of frequencies (or colors of light) between 90 and 270 GHz, to allow rigorous comparisons to confirm consistency and to allow a disentangling of the different contributions to the B-mode signature, including polarized Galactic emission and gravitational lensing, ultimately placing the best possible limits on the inflationary signal.  The telescopes have pioneered a ?small aperture? approach to making these measurements that is both efficient in enabling many detectors for extremely high sensitivities, and clean in allowing exquisitely precise control of instrumental effects to ensure accuracy of measurements.  This ?small aperture? approach is now widely considered the best way to make such measurements.  Our measurements have also benefitted from the uniquely stable, dry atmosphere offered by our South Pole observing site.  Results from these maps have produced best current constraints on primordial gravitational waves, published in a series of papers by our project, most recently in November 2018 (based on data taken through the end of 2015, see attached image).  Observations and analysis continue, and are expected to reach sensitivity levels in coming years that will thoroughly probe the possibility of primordial gravitational waves arising from inflation at high energy scales.
