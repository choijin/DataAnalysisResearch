<AbstractNarration>Indian River State College establishes a Regional Center for Nuclear Education and Training (RC-NET). The Center ensures the demand for skilled nuclear technicians is met in a unified, systematic way in the Southeastern United States. Some of the goals of RC-NET are to create a comprehensive curriculum for technician tracks, develop or enhance training programs at the regional colleges, provide career paths to higher education and undergraduate research, and provide remote access to expensive and unique training components. This Regional Center serves the nuclear industry as a training resource, curriculum repository, and source of expertise, while improving communications and collaboration across the industry. RC-NET is supported by partnerships with colleges across the region.  The partnerships include fifteen colleges, three universities and twenty seven industry partners. Collectively, this group represents a critical mass of training and industry experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By coordinating and supporting a network of dynamic training facilities capable of scaling up to meet the energy industry's needs, the Center reduces the risk associated with serious shortages in trained technicians. Traditionally, minority and female populations in the nuclear industry have been low; however, enrollment in IRSC's programs are above the national average. Highly qualified minority and female students are targeted to continue their education through scholarships, summer bridge programs, 2/3 articulation, and undergraduate research opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ RCNET?s mission was to standardize the curriculum material for the 1,104 NUCP approved objectives.   Since the start of the grant, RCNET has spent considerable effort, money, and time achieving this goal.   RCNET first created, sourced and purchased energy curriculum and then worked to enhance its best-in-class curriculum in two specific ways: embedding advanced, emerging, and interdisciplinary technologies into the nuclear classroom and combining training tracks to make a more sustainable college program and a more hirable graduate, specifically the combination of the instrumentation and controls (INC) and electrical tracks into an ICE track and the combination of the chemistry and the radiation protection tracks into the CRP track.   In partnership with the NRC, RCNET contributed to the development of a combined CRP track.  A gap analysis was completed, overlapping Learning Objectives (LO) were identified, and course material was condensed to offer all LO of the combined track in a comprehensive series.  Sixteen courses were identified and complete course packets were developed.   RCNET added three unique elements to its curriculum:  a biography textbook focused on departing ownership to the next generation of nuclear technicians; curriculum competitions designed to promote adoption of emerging technologies into nuclear training programs; and access to curriculum material from other disciplines with a focus on increasing the breadth of nuclear technicians.  RCNET maintained and updated its learning repository at www.GoNuke.org and hosted additional professional development events to train college educators, industry trainers, and subject matter experts on how to utilize RCNET?s curriculum, resources, and learning repository.   RCNET provided opportunities for educators, trainers, subject matter experts, and administrators to improve their college training programs and pipeline through professional development events.  These events covered a variety of topics including how to utilize RCNET curriculum, operations training, QA/QC training, a Fukushima series, entrepreneurship in the nuclear classroom, utilizing data to increase college key performance indicators, introduction to curriculum in other fields (primarily through other ATE centers), and emerging technologies.   RCNET has put considerable effort into incorporating PBL, hands on learning, and emerging technology into the college classroom.  RCNET developed a series of 4 comprehensive technology modules focused on robotics, sensors, cyber security and genomics and match current nuclear learning objectives with the applications of advanced technologies.  These modules combine traditional classroom study with nuclear case studies and lab activities to incorporate skill and PBL.  These modules were very well received and Professional Development (PD) sessions focused on how to incorporate them into classrooms were attended by faculty from 27 different colleges.   Academic articulations with Thomas Edison State College, University of Florida, Excelsior College, Chattanooga State Community College, Florida International University, Bismark State College, and Idaho State University continue to be promoted by RCNET.  This articulations cover a variety of degrees (B.S., B.A.S., B.A.T., and M.S.) offered online, in blended classrooms, and on campus.  Over the last 5 years, 3,607 students have graduated RCNET programs with 2,789 of them finding employment at one of RCNET?s 100 industry partners. This is a result of extensive efforts to build nuclear partnerships at conferences, through direct marketing, face to face meetings, and any other available avenue.  Also, RCNET provided career assistance resources for students, such as videos on how to interview for nuclear careers and resume assistance.  RCNET continued to engage in a spectrum of secondary outreach and diversity recruitment activities, including directly promoting and recruiting targeted populations at the secondary level; building partnerships with other agencies, schools, and non-profit organization; developing and disseminating marketing materials; offering professional development and other resources to help partners (RCNET and 55 partner colleges) recruit from secondary institutions; and hosting summer STEM camps.  RCNET piloted a program to increase the recruitment and completion rate of underserved populations in nuclear programs.  In the pilot, both math and the guided pathway for a cohort of students with a numeracy deficiency was customized to allow enrollment.   Focus was specifically placed on enrolling underserved African American populations.  The program was designed to identify students who showed an aptitude for the skills required in the work force but who would not gain normal program entry due to their math deficiency.   The RCNET textbook, Nuclear Mavericks, is a tool for career assistance. A 2015 survey of over 100 nuclear industry trainers revealed that a sense of ownership was the single largest void identified in recent technician hires.  RCNET teamed with 9 technician leaders in varying nuclear fields to publish a collection of biographies with a goal of relating the experiences it took to build the nuclear industry.  RCNET has expanded into two additional nuclear fields: environmental management and plant/life sciences.  This expansion addressed three challenges common across all nuclear fields: a pending workforce shortage, a need to embed emerging technology into nuclear, and the need to make college programs across the country sustainable (i.e. jobs for graduates).
