<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p style="text-align: left;">The goal for this EAPSI project was to create a template in silicon using milling instrumentation for the design of a nano-sized reaction chamber that would be used in a DNA sequencing device. This silicon reaction chamber template would be used to create a replica stamp that would subsequently be used to transfer this device design into plastics. This work is a component of a larger project that is geared towards the creation of a tool that can disassemble and detect individual DNA molecules, and result in the sequencing of one&rsquo;s personal genetic profile. The first DNA sequencing efforts of the Human Genome Project initiated worldwide interest in not only understanding the human genetic makeup, but also how to identify genetic abnormalities and signs of disease. This project builds on this foundation by expanding accessibility to DNA sequencing tools and making these technologies more affordable, while also increasing their throughput of accessing such important data in a variety of applications. This EAPSI fellowship opportunity has aided in the creation of technology that could assist in identifying diseases that in many cases affect underrepresented groups, thus making this alternative technology most impressive for these communities. This activity has the capability to enhance the infrastructure for research by providing novel nanoscale instrumentation for the study of genetics and the diseases that arise from malfunctions in the genetic machinery. This type of technology will promote learning and acceptance in the emerging field of nanotechnology and nanofabrication, as well as contribute new research to this field.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Also, the EAPSI fellowship allowed me to go to South Korea and explore a different part of the world, learn about the people and culture, and perform research through a means that created international ties. I am so glad for the wealth of knowledge I was able to gain from this experience, because I feel as though I am more equipped with tools that not only will benefit me personally, but as a scientist as well. I learned that kindness is a universal language that all can speak in their own way. This made me feel welcomed in South Korea during my time there. I discovered that understanding the everyday life of someone else could broaden one&rsquo;s own perspective, and always give you something to add to your life, and hopefully for the better. My experience showed me that a faithful heart can be found anywhere around the world, and an instant bond is waiting in that common belief. Lastly, I learned that consideration, open-mindedness, and effort, could create memories that are positive, lasting, and meaningful to all who are willing to get involved. As a scientist, I have taken away an understanding of scientific policy as a foundation that must not only thrive for the field in which you work, but also for the culture and society in which you live. I realize that there are many resources that can be at your disposal, if you are willing to create international connections.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Because of this opportunity, I can say with confidence that my new understanding of my field was shaped and affected by living in South Korea this summer. I can now add to the body of science, with an international perspective, in a way that that will allow me to reach much further with the work I do as a scientist and it was all because of the opportunity provided with this fellowship.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/30/2011<br>      Modified by: Nyote&nbsp;J&nbsp;Oliver</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="...]]></DRECONTENT>
