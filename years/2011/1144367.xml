<AbstractNarration>The PIs propose to measure and interpret U-Pb crystallization ages of a varied suite of volcanic and plutonic rocks recovered from water depths of 300-3500m at several hundred sites on the submerged and previously unsampled rifted continental crust that underlies most of the southern Gulf of California. Many samples were collected along traverses up fault scarps and across volcanic features by a remotely operated vehicle; 50 dredge hauls also recovered igneous rock. All relevant samples have been petrographically described and geochemically analyzed. These samples record a long and complex magmatic history in this region, which in the past 20 Myr has changed from a volcanic arc to a subaerial intra-continental rift, been flooded by a marine incursion, and developed a chain of axial basins growing by seafloor spreading. Radiometric dates are needed to define this history, and to test hypotheses that up till now have been solely derived from still-subaerial outcrops at the margins of the rift. Existing dating show striking discordance between the age estimates, hinting at interesting cooling histories with likely tectonic implications. Targeted zircon (U-Th)/He and K-feldspar 40Ar/39Ar thermochronologic analyses and modeling will constrain thermal histories, thereby contributing to understanding rift tectonics including continental uplift and subsidence in the gulf rift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will very likely deepen our understanding of rifting history of the southern Gulf of California. Funding will also provide research opportunities for graduate students, foster collaboration with Mexican scientists and the results will be used in ongoing education and outreach programs, such as SDSU's K-8 project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Gulf of California formed over the past five million years by oblique rifting along the Pacific-North American plate boundary that pulled Baja California away from mainland Mexico.  The rifting history recorded here is a basic process involved in the growth an evolution of the continents.  It is also a process with broad societal relevance because of associated petroleum and geothermal reserves, ore mineralization, and seismic hazards associated with active rifts.  This investigation provides a large body of zircon U-Pb crystallization ages that provide a chronology of volcanic and plutonic activity essential to understanding the details of rift history.  Samples were collected from submerged continental crust within the rift by dredging and by use of a remotely operated vehicle (JASON) with the capability of retrieving samples directly from outcrops.  These samples were supplemented by samples collected from a series of islands in the Gulf as well as samples from the edge of the Baja California mainland immediately adjacent to the Gulf.  The discovery of extensive early Miocene plutonic rocks in the deepest parts of the Gulf and the nearly complete restriction of distinctive voluminous late Cretaceous high-Na batholithic rocks to the Baja California side of the rift are two of the key findings of this study. The extensive collaboration of students and senior investigators from both Mexico and the United States constitutes an important broader impact of the work.
