<AbstractNarration>One characteristic of invasive weeds that may contribute to their success is their ability to actively respond to herbivores.  Understanding the spread of weeds therefore requires studying how these responses, called "induced defenses", may evolve.  While many invasive weeds live for many years and can reproduce asexually through underground stems, previous studies of defense evolution have only measured sexual reproduction (seed set) over one year.  This project examines the evolution of induced defenses in the weed Solanum carolinense by using genetic analysis to measure both sexual and asexual reproduction.  Sexual reproduction and defenses have already been measured in an ongoing field experiment over one year; re-sprouts from this experiment will be identified using microsatellite DNA analysis to quantify reproduction in a second year.  The relationship between defenses and combined reproduction will indicate how induced defenses are expected to evolve in natural populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address how herbivores affect the evolution and asexual spread of a noxious weed that is also a host for several economically important insect pests, including the Colorado potato beetle.  Better understanding of how weeds succeed is relevant to developing better management of weeds and invasive species. Additionally, this project will develop genetic markers for future studies and provide undergraduate research training.</AbstractNarration>

Plasticity benefits organisms that live in variable environments, allowing them to optimally respond to a variety of conditions. Human impacts on natural ecosystems (e.g., climate change and habitat fragmentation) often increase environmental variability.

Our project investigated the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in the defense response of plants to their insect herbivores. Many plants have the ability to respond to insect damage by increasing the production of chemical and mechanical defenses.  This plasticity in defense is termed "induced defense".  Plants can also respond to damage by allocating resources to growth and reproduction to maintain fitness after damage; this is termed "tolerance".  Induced defenses and tolerance are model examples of phenotypic plasticity and much is known about their ecological effects on insect herbivores; however, little is understood about how these plasticities evolve. In particular, it is often assumed that pathways required for plasticity are costly to maintain, but there are very few demonstrations of costs of plasticity in these traits.

We detected costs of plasticity for both asexual and sexual tolerance, but there were not costs of plasticity in any other defense trait. For two defenses (leaf toughness and stem prickle production) we found the opposite of plasticity costs &ndash; the ability to maintain defenses after damage was costly to reproduction.
