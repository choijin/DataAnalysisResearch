<AbstractNarration>An intensive 1.5 day workshop will be held at the National Science Foundation in Arlington (Virginia) August 18-19, 2011. The objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I. To bring together leading researchers in atomic, molecular and optical physics to assess the state of theoretical research in the field and to formulate a vision for theoretical atomic, molecular, and optical physics (TAMOP) for the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;II. To survey the current organizational and funding landscape in TAMOP, including the balance between individual investigators, groups of investigators, centers and institutes, and types of institutions, and to suggest general guidelines for the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the workshop lies in the discussion of the state-of-the-art in frontier research areas of atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics and quantum information science, including: atomic and molecular structure and collisions; strong-field and ultrafast processes; cold atoms and degenerate gases, including cold collisions; quantum optics and quantum information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the workshop will be its anticipated impact on the future of AMO physics. An important educational impact will be to inform researchers in the various subareas about the overall state of the field and hence support cross fertilization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop had two major goals:  I. To bring together leading researchers in atomic, molecular, and optical physics to assess the state of theoretical research in the field and to formulate a vision for theoretical atomic, molecular, and optical physics (TAMOP) for the next decade. II. To survey the current organizational and funding landscape in TAMOP, including the balance between individual investigators, groups of investigators, centers and institutes, and types of institutions, and to suggest general guidelines for the next decade.  The workshop was held at the headquarters of the National Science Foundation in Arlington, VA, on August 18-19, 2011. There were about 100 participants on-site; another 30 participated  remotely. The presentations were given by key members of the community. The on-line discussion had 146 members and 127 posts to a discussion website. A 40-page report was produced.  It was published in print by the American Institute of Physics and then sent to grant agencies and physics departments all over the country.  It is currently available for download from  https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx0YW1vY3BoeXNpY3N8Z3g6MjFkZDM0YTE0OWU0OGJmYQ  The report should raise awareness of the significant value of (Theoretical) Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics in many other disciplines of science, technology, mathematics, and engineering.  Consequently, it should have a positive impact on funding and hiring decisions made by agencies, private foundations, and universities.  Finally, an extension of the scope of the project was authorized. The remaining funds were used to support students  attending important conferences in the field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.  This enhanced the education/training of students in the field.       Last Modified: 07/23/2014       Submitted by: Klaus R Bartschat]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
