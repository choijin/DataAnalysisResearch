<AbstractNarration>The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (SUMSRI) is a program conducted by the Department of Mathematics at Miami University.  Each year, SUMSRI prepares about 15 students, recruited from institutions across the nation, for graduate programs in the mathematical sciences by providing them with intensive exposure to research and graduate-level mathematics.  At the core of this experience is a seminar in which students conduct research under the guidance of a faculty member; each year, three different seminars are offered and students are placed in seminars according to their interests.  The program is supplemented by short courses in Real Analysis, Algebra, Mathematical Writing, and GRE Preparation and a colloquium series featuring (primarily) female and minority mathematical scientists.  In the year following their participation in the program, participants are asked to present their research at regional and national meetings, with financial support from SUMSRI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;African Americans and Hispanics, who now comprise over 25% of the U.S. population, together received less than 6% of the 500 mathematics PhDs awarded to U.S. citizens in 2009.  The percentage of PhDs earned by female U.S. Citizens was slightly over 30% of the total.  Because of the shortage of minority and female mathematicians, SUMSRI is especially interested in, but not limited to, underrepresented minorities and women, with the goal of exposing them to research and graduate education in the mathematical sciences.  In the past twelve years, SUMSRI has proven its effectiveness in preparing students for the challenges of graduate education.  Of the 173 graduates of the program, 45.7% are from underrepresented minority groups; among these, 60.8% are either in a graduate program or have completed a graduate degree, while 11.3% are still undergraduates.  Women comprise 75.1% of program graduates, of whom 73.8% are either in a graduate program or have completed a graduate degree, while 11.5% are still undergraduates.  SUMSRI can now count 16 graduates who have received the Ph.D. degree; of these, 12 are women and 6 are from underrepresented ethnic groups.  Eight of these have found employment in mathematical science departments within academia, 2 in non-mathematical science departments, and 5 in industry / government.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (SUMSRI) was established in 1999 with the goal of increasing the number of students -- particularly those from underrepresented groups -- pursuing graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences.  The program was structured to provide exposure to graduate-level mathematics and experience in research to talented, motivated studentswho may not otherwisehave considered a career in the mathematical sciences.This group of students includes not only those from underrepresented minority groups but also students from small institutions offering limited academic opportunities, as well as students studying in isolated areas of the country.  The objectives of SUMSRI may be summarized as follows:  To address the shortage of mathematical scientists from underrepresented groups by encouraging them to pursue research careers in the mathematical sciences.  To provide students with a research enviornment to help cultivate their research skills.  To provide role models for aspiring students in the mathematical sciences.  To expose students to professionals in the mathematical sciences, both in academia and in business, industry and government.  To develop and improve students' mathematical writing skills.  To expose participants to meetings of professional societies in the mathematical sciences, and to provide them with the opportunity to give a research presentation and write a research paper.  To familiarize students with graduate programs and inform them about financial aid for graduate school.  To prepare students for the GRE.  To make students aware of career opportunities in the mathematical sciences, both within and outside academia.     This award covers three summers of SUMSRI -- 2011, 2012 and 2013.  During that time period, a total of 45 undergraduates participated in SUMSRI.  Each student participated in all the SUMSRI activities (short courses in algebra, analysis, mathematical writing, GRE preparation, colloquia, graduate school informations sessions, etc.) and most attended and presented a research poster the the Joint Mathematics Meetings.  Each student was part of a research seminar and wrote a research paper.  The research papers can be seen at http://www.units.miamioh.edu/sumsri/sumj/Journal.html.
