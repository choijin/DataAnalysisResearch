<AbstractNarration>SES - 1130035&lt;br/&gt;Francisco Ramirez (PI)&lt;br/&gt;Elizabeth Bruckner (co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: The Worldwide Rise of Private Higher Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Private higher education is now the fastest growing segment of higher education. The massive expansion of private higher education institutions (PHEI) is a relatively new, and somewhat unexpected, phenomenon in the history of higher education. This dissertation examines the growth of private higher education worldwide, and asks: What explains the worldwide expansion of private higher education? Specifically, under which conditions do nation-states shift responsibilities for structuring educational opportunities away from the state towards the market? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To that end, the project focuses on the role of international governmental organizations (IGOs) in the diffusion of global models for higher education policies. My project relies on a combination of sources: It draws on policy documents produced by various stakeholders to examine dominant models for higher education systems. It also examines the effect of national budgets as well as international pressures on the decisions of nations to promote the expansion of the private higher education sector. Finally, the dissertation includes an explicitly comparative case study of nations that have predominantly public higher education systems with nations relying primarily on private non-profit, and private for-profit institutions. This project will be the first of its kind to apply a combination of qualitative and quantitative, longitudinal analysis to investigate the factors that have furthered the privatization of higher education around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research may advance our understanding of how complex globalization dynamics affect social policies pursued by nation states. In addition, this research project will produce original dataset to be disseminated not only in the academic community, but also among national and international policy makers. By collecting never-before-compiled data on the year of privatization, the dataset will be the first step towards conducting causal analysis of the effects of privatization on outcomes such as access and equity.  As such, findings from this research will provide insights for international and national policies that may ultimately contribute to improve access and equity in systems of higher education worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examines the worldwide rise of private higher education sectors. Rejecting the idea that nations independently decide to expand their private higher education sectors solely because of national buget pressures, this research project aimed to understand the global discourse that encourages the founding of private universities, and then, what nation-level factors affect founding rates.   The project compiled a database of 600+ documents on higher education policy from UNESCO and the World Bank. These documents were then analyzed using qualitative and quantitative research methods.  The analysis suggests that prior to the 1990s, higher education was considered a "national" enterprise, and was structured around higher education for building the local political leaders, and training individuals for their future roles in the economy. During the era of globalization (post-1990), the fall of the USSR and the rise of neoliberalism brought an acceptance of the private market as a provider of public goods. Globalization brought the opening of markets, increasing inter-connectedness, and mobility, and so, higher education discourse is increasingly oriented towards global competitiveness. In this world, the result is that the whole definition of "sector" occurs &mdash; the private sector is defined in relation to the public sector. Emphasis on the public sector does not disappear, but its role is redefined to be a "strategic" role.  The second part of this project examines where and when private universities have expanded around the world, to understand how global discourse is being diffused to nations with very different economic realities and different cultural histories.
