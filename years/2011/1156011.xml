<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigators (PIs) will continue their highly successful "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" (REU) program in solar physics at Montana State University (MSU). The main activity of this program is the mentoring and supervision of undergraduate students who will perform individual research projects in solar physics for ten weeks during the summer. Most of these student projects will involve the analysis of data from spacecraft and from ground-based solar observatories. The PIs' target group will be undergraduates majoring in Physics, Astronomy, Mathematics, and Computer Sciences. The Montana State summer program will introduce these undergraduates to solar physics research through independent science projects performed with a faculty mentor, and frequently with a graduate student co-mentor. During the summer, REU students will take an introductory course in solar physics which includes lectures by visiting scholars, and the students' final research reports will be posted online. These student projects also frequently result in joint professional publications and confernece presentations with the MSU faculty mentor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSU mentors have been highly successful in recruiting women into this REU experience, and program activities have also included Native American students and teachers. This REU program's "Ethics in Science" training component has developed into a successful element presented by a specialist in that field.  Prior REU student feedback concerning the utility of this ethics component indicates that this training has left an indelible imprint that will serve these students well, regardless of their future career choices.  Previous REU participants at MSU have also reported that their exposure to professional research in a university environment encouraged them to continue their graduate education and to pursue research as a profession. With its strong space science component, the program offers benefits to society by providing citizens and future researchers with an understanding of space weather impacts on Earth's space environment. Since solar physics is taught at relatively few colleges and universities in the US, the Montana State REU Program provides an important service to this discipline.</AbstractNarration>

In the past 18 years, 171 students have participated in this program to experience first-hand, state-of-the-art research in solar and space physics, strengthen practical research skills, and develop independence, creativity, and interest in physics and astronomy research. The program encourages participation of under-represented minorities, and more than 40% participants have been female students.</p> <p>Students in this program have conducted cutting-edge research in a diverse range of topics involving magnetohydrodynamic numerical modeling, analyzing a large variety of astronomical observations from many satellites, and building and operating space instruments. With their research, students have tried to answer these questions: how is a vast amount of magnetic energy rapidly released in the Sun's atmosphere in just a few minutes? How is this energy converted to heating plasmas to more than 10 million degrees, generating electrons that travel at a fraction of the speed of light, and ejecting 10 billion tons of plasmas at the speed of a few thousand kilometers per second into the heliosphere? How do the magnetic field and radiation output of the Sun vary over a solar cycle? Students have also participated in building and calibrating instruments that are sent to space to observe the Sun, the magnetosphere, the ionosphere, and the atmosphere. In 2017 August, they launched balloons to observe the Great Solar Eclipse.&nbsp;</p> <p>The REU research addresses fundamental problems in space and astro-physics such as the physical process of magnetic reconnection and particle energization, as well as issues related to the space weather forecast, which has a broader and societal impact.&nbsp;</p> <p>Students frequently present and discuss their research with their mentors, the research group in the department, and the larger research communities at professional conferences. More than a quarter of our REU students have published altogether 36 papers in scientific journals, and close to one half of the students have co-authored 60 talks or posters presented at conferences such as the American Geophysical Union meeting and the American Astronomical Society meeting.&nbsp;Through these activities, they have disseminated their research results and improved skills to communicate and collaborate with scientists as well as the general public.</p> <p>Many of the REU students have continued research with their mentors after the summer, and more than 40% of our REU alumni have been admitted to graduate programs in STEM areas. Some students from earlier classes have already become seasoned researchers and leaders in the solar and space physics community.</p> <p>Likewise, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers working for the program as REU mentors have grown academically with the valuable early-career experience in supervising undergraduate research. Our alumni mentors have become staff scientists and faculty members in various institutes.</p> <p>For the past 18 years, the Solar and Space Physics REU program at Montana State University has achieved reputation in the international research community for its dedication to education and training of the next-generation solar and space physicists. The program has also contributed to NSF's broader goal to cultivate interest and strengthen skills in STEM areas among a diverse population of undergraduate students.</p> <p>The complete information of the program, including the program objectives, research projects, participant information, student activities, and lists of student publications and presentations, can be viewed at&nbsp;http://solar.physics.montana.edu/REU/</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/28/2019<br>      Modified by: Jiong&nbsp;Qiu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1156011/1156011_10157913_1548681431318_REU_2018_boulder--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1156011/1156011_10157913_1548681431318_REU_2018_boulder--rgov-800width.jpg" title="research"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1156011/1156011_10157913_1548681431318_REU_2018_boulder--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="research"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Solar Physics Research with REU students from 2001 through 2018</div> <div class="imageCredit">MSU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jiong&nbsp;Qiu</div> <div class="imageTitle">research</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1156011/1156011_10157913_1548679502852_publication_stat_to2018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1156011/1156011_10157913_1548679502852_publication_stat_to2018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="publications"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1156011/1156011_10157913_1548679502852_publication_stat_to2018--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="publications"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Statistics of REU publications and conference presentations from 2003 through 2018.
