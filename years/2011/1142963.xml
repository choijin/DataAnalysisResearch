<AbstractNarration>The climatic changes of late Precambrian time, 600-800 million years ago, included episodes of extreme glaciation, during which ice may have covered nearly the entire ocean for several million years, according to the Snowball Earth hypothesis.  These episodes would hold an important place in Earth?s evolutionary history; they could have encouraged biodiversity by trapping life forms in small isolated ice-free areas, or they could have caused massive extinctions that cleared the path for new life forms to fill empty niches.  What caused the Earth to become iced over, and what later caused the ice to melt?  Scientific investigation of these questions will result in greater understanding of the climatic changes that the Earth can experience, and will enable better predictions of future climate.  This project involves Antarctic field observations as well as laboratory studies and computer modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is not to prove or disprove the Snowball Earth hypothesis but rather to quantify processes that are important for simulating snowball events in climate models.  The principal goal is to identify the types of ice that would have been present on the frozen ocean, and to determine how much sunlight they would reflect back to space.  Reflection of sunlight by bright surfaces of snow and ice is what would maintain the cold climate at low latitudes.  The melting of the ocean required buildup of greenhouse gases, but it was probably aided by deposition of desert dust and volcanic ash darkening the snow and ice.  With so much ice on the Earth?s surface, even small differences in the amount of light that the ice absorbed or reflected could cause significant changes in climate.  The properties of the ice would also determine where, and in what circumstances, photosynthetic life could have survived. Some kinds of ice that are rare on the modern Earth may have been pivotal in allowing the tropical ocean to freeze.  The ocean surfaces would have included some ice types that now exist only in Antarctica:  bare cold sea ice with precipitated salts, and "blue ice" areas of the Transantarctic Mountains that were exposed by sublimation and have not experienced melting.  Field expeditions were mounted to examine these ice types, and the data analysis is underway.  A third ice type, sea ice with a salt crust, is being studied in a freezer laboratory.  Modeling will show how sunlight would interact with ice containing light-absorbing dust and volcanic ash. Aside from its reflection of sunlight, ice on the Snowball ocean would have been thick enough to flow under its own weight, invading all parts of the ocean.  Yet evidence for the survival of photosynthetic life indicates that some regions of liquid water were maintained at the ocean surface.  One possible refuge for photosynthetic organisms is a bay at the far end of a nearly enclosed tropical sea, formed by continental rifting and surrounded by desert, such as the modern Red Sea.  A model of glacier flow is being developed to determine the dimensions of the channel, connecting the sea to the ocean, necessary to prevent invasion by the flowing ice yet maintain a water supply to replenish evaporation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The climatic changes of the Neoproterozoic time, 600-800 million years ago, included episodes of extreme glaciation, during which ice may have covered nearly the entire ocean for several million years, according to the "snowball earth" hypothesis.  The goals of this project were to study processes that would have been important on the ice-covered ocean during such an event.  The study focused on the albedos (reflectivity for sunlight) of snow and ice surfaces, which, because of their amplifying feedback, are crucial to the initiation, maintenance, and termination of a snowball event, as well as determining the ice thickness on the ocean.  Some kinds of ice that are rare on the modern Earth may have been pivotal in allowing the tropical ocean to glaciate.  The results of this research will aid in evaluation of the snowball-earth hypothesis, and help identify possible liquid-water refugia for photosynthetic surface life that apparently survived these events.  The refugia may have been small and isolated, thereby causing extinctions, or promoting evolution of diversity, or both.  Alternatively, the refugia may have been widespread and connected.  To evaluate these alternatives, the oceanic surfaces that would have existed at various times and places during a snowball event were investigated, with fieldwork in Antarctica, laboratory work in a coldroom, and modeling of radiative transfer, heat transfer, and ice flow. In tropical regions where evaporation (sublimation) exceeded precipitation, ice surfaces may have included (a) bare sea ice, cold enough that salts precipitated, (b) sea ice with a salt crust left on the surface as the ice sublimated, and (c) cold glacier ice exposed by sublimation of "sea-glaciers" (self-sustaining ice shelves) flowing from polar seas into the dry tropics.  Two of these three now exist in Antarctica:  bare cold sea ice near the coast of Antarctica in early spring, and "blue ice" areas of the Transantarctic Mountains that have not experienced melting.  Their albedos were investigated, as well as microphysical properties such as bubble content to explain the albedos. The salt crust does not exist in nature on the modern Earth, so it was investigated in the freezer laboratory.  Its albedo is very high, even in the near-infrared, so that its average albedo for total solar energy is even higher than that of snow.  Computer modeling of refraction, reflection, and absorption in the salt crust was used to explain the laboratory measurements.  One proposed refuge for photosynthesis is a bay at the far end of a nearly enclosed tropical sea, formed by continental rifting and surrounded by desert, such as the modern Red Sea.  A model of glacier flow was used to determine the dimensions of the inlet necessary to allow the sublimation/evaporation rate to exceed the sea-glacier inflow rate.  The conclusion is that realistic geometries can prevent sea-glacier invasion, so that a refuge is possible if the climate of the surrounding desert is warm enough.  At the equator of Snowball Earth, climate models predict thick ice, or thin ice, or open water, depending largely on their albedo parameterizations; .The albedos of ice types in the Transantarctic Mountains representative of tropical sea glaciers appear to be within the range that favors ice hundreds of meters thick in the snowball tropics.  Broader impacts:  The results of this research will be used to constrain climate models of Snowball Earth, thus aiding in understanding the dramatic climate changes of the Neoproterozoic glaciations.  It will have implications for biological evolution through this climatic bottleneck, and for interpretation of Neoproterozoic glacial deposits.  The work has also illuminated processes in sea ice and glacier ice that occur on the modern Earth, and will aid in understanding surface-albedo feedbacks in the present climate.  It may also aid in understanding the behavior of ice and salts on the surfaces of satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.  The project has involved two undergraduates, two graduate students, and one postdoctoral fellow.  Results of the research were incorporated into the curricula for undergraduate and graduate courses on climate, glaciology, and radiative transfer.
