<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by Professor Andrew H. Marcus at the University of Oregon to carry out fundamental studies on the molecular mechanisms of DNA polymerase and helicase, two protein-DNA complexes that are essential elements of the biological processes that enact and regulate gene expression. Pairs of fluorescent nucleic acid base analogues are substituted for native nucleotides at the forks and junctions of double stranded and primer-template DNA. Polarized fluorescence fluctuation measurements of the naked DNA constructs will reveal information about the relative dipole angle of the base analogue sites, and their relative motions on microsecond to sub-second time scales. Subsequent experiments will be carried out on protein-DNA complexes to directly probe the mechanics of the protein enzymatic sites during key steps of the replication process. These studies will provide detailed information about the transition state pathways of DNA synthesis, and investigate the possible existence of intermediate states involved in replication fidelity. A significant component of the research involves active recruitment and mentoring of students from under-represented areas into the undergraduate and graduate training programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will add to our basic understanding of the dynamic processes whereby the macromolecular machines of gene expression operate in performing their biological functions. Potential benefits range from an improved understanding of the molecular level interface between chemical and biological behavior, to new general insights about the underlying principles of nano-machines.</AbstractNarration>

This approach will be especially useful for applications involving labeled biological macromolecules for which distinct conformations can have functional (and disease-related) significance. We found that self-assembled dimers of porphyrin molecules in phospholipid bilayer membranes unexpectedly form "T-shaped" complexes. We were able to understand the underlying physical principles of the self-assembly process, and to observe the flow of electronic energy through the molecular complex. The latter depends on the T-shape of the molecular complex, and is significant to the mechanisms of natural photosynthesis and to the design of new solar energy devices.

Our results will be useful to the community of researchers developing and applying such analogues to study nucleic acid structure-function. Already, other researchers around the world are adopting our 2DFS method.        Our single-molecule studies of the phage T4 DNA primosome system has lead to new insights about the assembly pathway and mechanism of the DNA-primosome replication complex. The T4 system is a useful model to study DNA replication in all higher organisms, including humans. Our recently ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
