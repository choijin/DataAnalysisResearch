<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on climate change effects on northern forests. Many studies have evaluated the impacts of variation in climate on forests within a single season, but few have examined the impacts across seasons and how these impacts may interact. Seasonal impacts may differ, and they may interact in ways that are either antagonistic or synergistic. For example, soil warming in summer may increase root growth, but warming in winter may increase the frequency of freeze/thaw cycles and damage plant root systems. The goal of this project is to determine the interactive effects of winter and growing season climate change on nutrient and carbon uptake in northern hardwood forests. This will be accomplished by establishing an ecosystem warming experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, and a greenhouse experiment at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, MA. Data generated from these experiments will be used to modify an existing ecosystem-scale model (PnET-BGC) to improve its ability to predict ecosystem nutrient retention and carbon storage. This combination of experimentation and modeling will improve our understanding of the interactive effects of increased soil temperatures in the growing season and more frequent freeze/thaw cycles in winter, and may transform our thinking of how climate change will affect northeastern forests and other temperate ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project will integrate research, teaching, and outreach. In particular, twenty-five high school teachers will be trained in forest ecology through formal lectures and field exercises. Ten high school students, ten undergraduates, and two graduate students will perform the hands-on laboratory and field experiments. Up to 240 undergraduate students at Boston University will participate in weekend field trips to learn about forest ecology and gain field research experience. Together, these activities will enhance scientific literacy and foster an understanding of the relationship between variation in climate and ecological processes for both students and high school teachers. Additionally, a new 'Sap-Net' network of maple syrup producers will be established to gain a better understanding of how variation in climate influences maple syrup production and quality.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>Nitrogen and carbon are essential elements for plants and soil micro-organisms and therefore these cycles are among the most widely studied biogeochemical cycles across the globe. However, these cycles are altered by changes in climate. Mean annual air temperatures for the northeastern U.S. are projected to increase 5 degrees Celsius over the next century, leading to warmer growing season soil temperatures, a reduced snowpack, and increased frequency of soil freeze/thaw cycles in winter. Warmer soils have been shown to stimulate rates of net nitrogen mineralization (breakdown of organic matter to inorganic forms of nitrogen that trees can take up), nitrogen uptake by trees, and carbon storage in nitrogen-limited temperate forest ecosystems. However, wintertime soil freeze/thaw cycles have been shown to damage tree roots, which impairs the ability of trees to take up nitrogen and water, and thus their ability to take up and sequester carbon in the following growing season. Compared to our understanding of growing season or winter climate effects on northern temperate forests, we know little about the combined effects of these changes across seasons, which are important to determine since they may be additive, synergistic, or cancel each other out.</p> <p>We set up the Climate Change Across Seasons Experiment (CCASE) at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire in 2012 to determine the combined effects of winter and growing season climate changes on the functioning of northern hardwood forests. We established six plots (11 X 14 m) in a red maple (<em>Acer rubrum</em>) dominated forest. In this ongoing experiment, we warm soils five degrees Celsius above ambient temperatures with buried heating cables in two of the plots during the snow-free season. In two additional plots, we similarly warm soils five degrees Celsius above ambient temperatures during the snow-free season, and also remove snow in winter by shoveling within 48 hours following snowfall. Once soils in these snow removal plots are frozen for 72 hours, buried heating cables are activated to thaw the soils to one degree C. After soil temperatures in the plots are maintained at one degree C for 72 hours, the cables are switched off again, completing one induced freeze-thaw cycle. We successfully induced between one and four soil freeze/thaw cycles in each winter between 2013-2019. The two remaining plots have no soil warming or snow removal and serve as a reference for the experiment.</p> <p>To date, we found that growing season soil warming stimulates many biological processes, including rates of water uptake by red maple trees, soil and stem respiration, soil mineralization, tree growth, and carbon sequestration. However, these warming induced increases are offset by as much as two thirds by soil freeze/thaw cycles in winter. These results demonstrate that warmer growing seasons are likely to have strong positive impacts on rates of carbon sequestration in northern hardwood forests, but these effects will be offset by the negative effects of a smaller winter snowpack on the health of trees and functioning of soil microbes.
