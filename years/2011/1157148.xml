<AbstractNarration>Most plants cannot grow when soil temperatures reach levels that are above 100 °F.  However, in Yellowstone National Park soil temperatures can be much higher in the geothermal areas, and occasionally plants can be found growing in soils in temperatures up to 125 °F.  These plants have a fungus, called Curvularia protuberata that grows in them, and they cannot grow in these soil temperatures without the fungus.  The fungus itself is infected with a virus, and the virus also is required for the whole thermal tolerant system of plant, fungus and virus (called a symbiosis) to survive.  However, the interactions between the virus and fungus in this system and other microbe-interacting systems in the environment are very poorly understood.  A crucial key to the understanding of adaptive changes in response to environmental stress is missing.  In addition, very few beneficial viruses have been described or studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of the research is to understand how plants and mutualistic microorganisms interact with one another and their surrounding environments to acquire stress tolerance.  This project will study the physiology and genetics that define the mechanism of this interaction.  Its goals are to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Identify and characterize additional plant-fungus-virus symbionts that are thermotolerant;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Identify the genetic expression and metabolite changes of plants and fungi involved in the three way symbiosis during heat stress;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Study how the proteins from each organism interact;  and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Test the genes  discovered for their effects on tolerance to heat.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With changes in the Earth's climate and the need to produce more and more food for the increasing human population, learning how plants adapt naturally to environmental changes such as are seen in Yellowstone National Park will provide tools with potential application to agriculture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plants can tolerate extreme environments, such as high temperatures, high salt, drought, or extreme cold with the help of microbes that colonize them.  In many cases fungi provide functions that help plants adapt.  However, viruses can also help plants adapt.  In the plants in Yellowstone National Park that grow in soils with temperatures up to 125 &deg;F we found that they are colonized by a fungus that is in turn infected by a virus.  All three, plant, fungus and virus need to be present for this thermotolerance.  We explored several areas of Yellowstone where these plant grow, and found that while the fungus that colonized the plants moves around from site to site the virus does not.  This means that if a non-infected fungus moves to a hot site (this probably occurs when the fungal spores disperse) it must acquire the virus from a fungus already in the hot area in order to survive.  In this study we also explored the potential role of viruses in other plant-fungal relationships.  Fungi and viruses are found in plants in other geothermal areas, such as volcanic regions of Costa Rica, and in plants that tolerate high salt conditions of coastal regions of the Pacific northwest.  However, the role of the viruses in all of these interactions is not fully understood.  With the heat tolerant plants we know that the virus is absolutely required, and that virus-infected fungi make higher levels of compounds like sugars and pigments, that may help protect the plants from thermal stress, compared to uninfected fungi.  We also know that one of the viral proteins that is part of the replication process of the virus interacts with several fungal proteins that regulate the cell cycle of the fungus.  This protein could be expressed on its own in the fungus, without the full virus infection, and confer thermal tolerance.  The type of fungus found in these plants are called class II endophytes. Endophyte means "inside plants", because they are found in nature inside plants, although they can grow on petri dishes in the lab.  Most plants in a natural setting are colonized by fungal and bacterial endophytes as well as viruses, and these microbes do not appear to cause any harm, but rather often provide a benefit to the plants. Class II endophytes can colonize a very wide range of plants, including most agricultural plants. These types of beneficial fungi, along with their viruses, hold promise for the future of agriculture: they could reduce the use of irrigation water, and perhaps help to mitigate the effects of climate change that are resulting in more and more extreme environments on a planet that is required to feed an ever-increasing human population.
