<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1105586&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Daniel M. Burns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the themes emphasized in these research projects are&lt;br/&gt;modern aspects of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory from the early days&lt;br/&gt;of quantum mechanics in the 1920s, value distribution theory and&lt;br/&gt;Ahlfors currents, and Grauert tubes. In physics the&lt;br/&gt;Bohr-Sommerfeld theory was created as a method for quantizing an&lt;br/&gt;integrable classical mechanical system. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator interprets the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions for&lt;br/&gt;quantization as a geometric property, name a triviality condition&lt;br/&gt;on the holonomy of a certain flat bundle. Ongoing work seeks to&lt;br/&gt;understand the connections between singularities of Hamiltonians&lt;br/&gt;and singularities of underlying complex spaces, and the geometry&lt;br/&gt;of the Bohr-Sommerfeld construction seems to be a central focus&lt;br/&gt;of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Value distribution theory is a framework for attempting to count&lt;br/&gt;solutions to an equation in complex variables. The Fundamental&lt;br/&gt;Theorem of Algebra tells us that a polynomial equation of degree&lt;br/&gt;n in one variable has exactly n solutions over the complex&lt;br/&gt;numbers, if you count repeated roots with care. More complicated&lt;br/&gt;equations in a single complex variable can have infinitely many&lt;br/&gt;solutions, but these are spread around the complex plane and the&lt;br/&gt;number of solutions contained in a ball of radius R about the&lt;br/&gt;origin can only grow at a limited rate as R becomes large -- a&lt;br/&gt;situation greatly clarified by ideas introduced by the Finnish&lt;br/&gt;mathematician Rolf Nevanlinna in the 1920s, at about the same&lt;br/&gt;time that the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory was developed in physics.&lt;br/&gt;One of the projects supported by this award is a project that&lt;br/&gt;applies modern geometric tools to study the distribution of&lt;br/&gt;solutions to equations in several variables.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was awarded to study the relations between complex analysis and geometry. Complex analysis revolves around special properties of imaginary numbers in calculus. The geometry harkens back to coordinate geometry as in the Cartesian plane. In recent years that has taken the PI into areas involving Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic geometry, the natural setting for such mechanics. Much of this is motivated, however, not by the mechanical applications, but the underlying geometric structures.   The specifics of the project, as it evolved and it became clearer what could be achieved in the lifetime of the grant, were   1. Singular integrable systems  2. Analytic mappings and cycles  3. Complexifications of real manifolds  4. Rigidity of non-compact Kaehler manifolds  5. (Pluri-)potential theory associated to real convex sets.  Some significant results were achieved in these areas during the course of the grant. A theorem describing the property of being a locus of zeroes of polynomials in complex number space in terms of its growth measured by a potential theoretic function (homogeneous Monge-Ampere solution) was obtained, as well as uniqueness results on the ways a simple topological space can be realized as a zero locus of polynomials [about 3.].
