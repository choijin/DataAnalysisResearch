<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Amanda Ensminger is "Individual variation in visual physiology and foraging behavior of birds." The host institution for this fellowship is Purdue University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Esteban Fernandez-Juricic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan centers on the relationship between individual variation in visual physiology and foraging behavior in birds. Foraging involves a trade-off between searching for food and watching for predators. Previous research has found that variation in retinal characteristics among bird species is related to both diet and habitat. However, little is known about retinal variation among individuals within a species, even though intraspecific variation is key to understanding the evolution of visual systems. This research quantifies the degree and nature of individual variation in retinal physiology in birds and directly tests hypotheses about how individual photoreceptor distribution is related to differences among individuals in their foraging behavior and skills. The findings explicitly link physiology and behavior in the context of foraging and benefit broadly the fields of visual ecology, foraging theory, and animal behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include learning techniques in avian visual physiology and behavioral ecology. Broader impacts include mentoring undergraduates through the host institution?s chapter of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science and visiting local schools to introduce young students to behavioral ecology through hands-on activities.</AbstractNarration>
