<AbstractNarration>The rocks beneath the coastal plain of Georgia were at the center of the most fundamental tectonic events to shape eastern North America: continental collision around 290 million years ago to form the super continent of Pangea; continental breakup leading to the formation of the Atlantic Ocean beginning around 230 million years ago; and one of the biggest magmatic events in Earth's history around 200 million years ago, the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province.  A record of these events and possible relationships between them is preserved by structures in the crust of southern Georgia, including a suture between two different types of continent, the largest failed rift basin along the east coast of North America and igneous rocks from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province.  These investigators and a large team of graduate and undergraduate students are collecting seismic data that can be used to image structures in the crust to understand these tectonic events.  Hundreds of geophones are being deployed along two ~300-km-long profiles across the suture and the basin, which record sound waves generated by a series of explosive charges spaced ~20 km apart. Geophones are also being deployed in a box focused on the basin to record explosive charges arranged in a grid.  The speed that sound waves travel through rocks varies with composition, porosity, and other rock characteristics. The investigators are using travel-time tomography to create velocity models that reveal the distribution of igneous rocks, variations in the thickness of the crust and variations in crustal composition. Besides a better understanding of fundamental tectonic processes, other benefits of this program include training and education of students, and characterization of basins and igneous rocks that might be good targets for carbon sequestration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Suwanee Suture and Georgia Rift Basin Experiment (SUGAR) was an experiment to form an image of the crustal structure in an area which has undergone continental collision with Africa and then rifting which failed as the Atlantic Ocean opened.  Two seismic refraction lines were shot across the rift basin and one seismic reflection line was shot within the basin.  The first line, in southwest Georgia was 325 km long and consisted of 1193 seismographs distributed over this distance (see Fig.1).  The second line, in east Georgia, was 450 km long with 2000 seismographs distributed along it.  Finally, a short reflection profile (100 km) was shot in southeast Georgia with 700 seismographs distributed along it.     Preliminary models derived from the seismic refraction lines indicate that the crust under the South Georgia Basin (the Georgia Rift) has been thinned by 9 km from a thickness of 47 km outside the rift.  This suggests that the crust under the rift has been stretched by 1.5 times its original wide across the rift.  This is significant crustal stretching and thinning which may have made this crust susceptible to magmatic intrusion.  The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) a large, but now buried volcanic field may have been a result of this stretching.     The broader impacts of the SUGAR project at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), a Hispanic majority institution, were large.  About 20 graduate and undergraduate students traveled to Georgia to participate in the deployment of seismographs along the seismic lines in Fig. 1.  In addition, because UTEP was responsible for the 27 seismic shots used to generate the seismic energy for imaging, four graduate students received significant experience preparing and detonating the large crustal seismic shots.
