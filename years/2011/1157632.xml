<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  Plant viruses cause diseases that affect a significant number of food crops world-wide with potentially severe consequences on food supplies and economic conditions. Most viruses 'commandeer' the host cell's protein synthesis machinery to make viral proteins.  Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is one of the two most widespread and economically significant plant viruses, affecting wheat, barley and oat crops worldwide. The aims of this project will advance the basic science of plant viruses, while enabling technologies for the improved control of harmful plant viruses and the engineering of modified viruses for production of high-value  proteins using plants. BYDV contains an unusual RNA structure, a translational enhancer (BTE),  in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA that interacts with a 5' UTR stem loop.  This long-range interaction promotes efficient translation of the viral mRNA by a mechanism that is not yet fully understood.  The project will employ the 3' UTR of BYDV as a model system to elucidate mechanisms of long-range RNA interactions involving 3'UTR elements. The overall goal of the project is to identify the molecular interactions that enable viral mRNA to compete efficiently with the much higher concentrations of cellular RNA for access to ribosomes and translation factors. The three critical steps in the assembly of viral protein synthesis initiation complexes will be investigated: 1) The binding of eIFs (eukaryotic initiation factors) to the viral 3'-BTE; 2) the interaction of ribosomes with viral 3'-BTE and 5'-UTR sequences; and 3) the interaction between viral 3'-BTE and 5'-UTR regions. A library of BYDV mRNAs with varying translational efficiency will be used to determine the correlation between eIF binding and translation, the binding affinity of ribosomes for viral RNA sequences, and the role of the interaction between 3' and 5'-UTRs  in each of these steps. The project will employ a range of biochemical and biophysical techniques to achieve these aims, including ribosome 'toeprint' analysis, direct fluorescence assays, and RNA binding assays analyzed by mass spectroscopic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The significance of the research and the range of experimental approaches employed will provide excellent training opportunities for students, ranging from the high school to the graduate school level, in both biochemical assays and quantitative biophysical measurements. Students at each level will receive appropriate training in molecular biology techniques including expression of cloned proteins, translational assays, and other important biochemical techniques.  Fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry used in this project will provide quantitative and biophysical training for more advanced students. Hunter College recruits and enrolls significant numbers of minority students under-represented in the sciences, and  also sponsors a summer research program for them. Students will be recruited from this program to participate in the research.  Thus, the project will contribute to training a diverse workforce in science and technology. High school teachers will carry out research in the lab during the summers, using quantitative fluorescence measurements to determine equilibrium and thermodynamic properties and enhance their content knowledge of applications of thermodynamics to biological systems. The Principal Investigator will work with faculty from the Borough of Manhattan Community College (an Hispanic serving institution) to increase research opportunities for their faculty and students, providing access to state-of-the-art equipment and research guidance when appropriate. By participating in the research project, high school teachers and community college faculty will increase their knowledge of current research techniques and their abilities to convey to their students the excitement of science.</AbstractNarration>

Luteovirus barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is an aphid-borne threat to barley, wheat and oat crops. Protein synthesis is a key step in viral infection. A plant viral mRNA must out-compete host cell mRNA for necessary machinery to make viral proteins.  In addition, plant RNA virus genomes are among the most efficiently translated mRNA known.  This efficient translation allows whole plants or plant cells to serve as efficient low cost means to produce large amounts of specific protein for industrial or pharmaceutical use (e.g. Ebola antibodies produced in tobacco plants).  Further, plant viruses provide a somewhat simpler and advantageous model system to understand other viral systems as well as basic eukaryotic translation processes. Insights gained from plant viruses may be useful for development of broad based therapeutics. This research has determined some of the key steps in viral protein synthesis that are likely targets for viral inhibition either through pharmaceutical means or genetic modification.              This project focused on understanding the assembly of the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) translation initiation complex (ribosomes, protein initiation factors (called eIFs) and mRNA).  BYDV lacks several features present in "normal" mRNA.  Instead it contains a translational element in the 3Æ UTR (untranslated region) called a Barley Translational Enhancer ( BTE) that interacts through a stem-loop interaction with the 5Æ UTR (kissing loop interaction).  The role of the essential 3Æ BTE structure was largely unknown.  In wheat germ, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F binds to the 5Æ cap and is the rate-limiting step for translation.  This research investigated if the interaction of eIF4F with the 3Æ UTR would play a similar role for BYDV translation.  Alternatively, the eIF4F interaction could be a means of sequestering host cell eIF4F. In collaboration with W. Allen MillerÆs lab, the Goss lab found binding of eIF4F to the wt 3Æ BTE and a number of structural mutants selected because of their differing translational efficiency, correlated with translational efficiency. Kinetics revealed that the slower dissociation rate led to more efficient translation, suggesting that transfer of either the factor or the factor and 40S ribosomal subunit to the 5Æ UTR may be rate-limiting and not the initial binding of eIF4F.         This research found that ribosomes bound to the 3Æ UTR of the viral mRNA. Controls with mutant BTE and disruption of the kissing loop determined that a functional BTE, kissing loop and factors eIF4F, 4A, 4B and ATP were necessary for efficient transfer.  These results indicate a novel mechanism for initiation of protein synthesis.  By identifying unique steps and mechanisms, therapeutic interventions can be developed and biotechnology improved.              Over the past grant period, three post-doctoral associates were trained, Mateen Khan (overseas faculty), Estella Gustilo (lecturer), and Usha Bhardwaj. Three students completed their Ph. D.s (Jia Ma, Post-doc NIH; Bidisha Banerjee, part-time lecturer and Sohani Das Sharma, Columbia U. Post-Doc. All of the students, including undergraduates, have received training in both biophysics and biochemical techniques, e.g. expression of proteins, protein purification, fluorescence spectroscopy, SHAPE analysis and ribosome toeprinting. Students are well equipped to secure employment or post-doctoral positions.  Pei Zhang, Sohani Das Sharma, Qiao Liu, and Bidisha Banerjee all received travel awards to present their research.  Sohani Das Sharma received a poster award at the RiboClub Meeting in Montreal in 2013.  While their research accomplishments are significant, it is equally noteworthy that Jia Ma (2010, 2011), Sohani Das Sharma (2012), and Alex Ruck (2013) have all received the Chemistry Department teaching award.
