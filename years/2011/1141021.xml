<AbstractNarration>In this collaborative project undergraduate students enrolled in senior-level analytical chemistry laboratory courses at St. John Fisher College and Kennesaw State University are creating two novel experiments that are being validated through Analytical Method Transfer (AMT). Students at one college develop the experimental method, standard operating procedures, and figures of merit (i.e., accuracy, precision, specificity, selectivity, sensitivity, repeatability, reproducibility, linearity, range, detection limit, quantitation limit, robustness, and ruggedness). The experiment is transferred to the partnering college to undergo method equivalency testing by students. The experiments involve the dissolution of pharmaceutical dosage forms with the development of dissolution curves (release rates). Using UV-Vis spectroscopy or HPLC methods, the students determine the concentration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the dissolution media. A statistical comparison of the figures of merit determines the success of the AMT. The transferred experiments and student-generated data are being developed into case studies that use POGIL exercises. The student learning outcomes related to the AMT are being assessed through a standard pre-test and post-test method using multiple choice and free-response questions. In addition, students at four other colleges are evaluating the developed POGIL activities but are not using instrumentation. The collected data will be used to determine whether the learning outcomes for students participating in a laboratory POGIL activity (with access to instrumentation) are equivalent to those for students participating in a classroom POGIL activity (with no access to instrumentation). Student interviews are being conducted to determine whether any learning gains in AMT may be attributed to the POGIL activities. The interview results provide contextual information allowing project staff to tailor the POGIL activities to the students' experiences. Site visits also are being used to evaluate the fidelity of the implementation of the POGIL activities by documenting variables such as adherence to project goals and use of effective POGIL. The findings from the project are being disseminated through publications and presentations.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The teaching of AMT places students at the forefront of the global learning environment in analytical chemistry. Students 1) use a new instrument, a dissolution tester, not currently available in most analytical chemistry laboratories, and 2) address the curriculum concept of AMT, which is conducted world-wide but not currently taught to undergraduates. This engages both students and faculty in the discovery of acceptance criteria for an AMT based on figures of merit.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This project is designed to facilitate adaptation of a new laboratory experiment at other sites and promotes a collaborative effort of an inter-institutional faculty-student partnership. The results are being disseminated broadly, helping to build a STEM education community. The technical skills of students are being broadened, enabling them to become competitive in the global market place.</AbstractNarration>

The experiments developed included: 1) Dissolution testing and UV analysis of ibuprofen tablets; 2) Dissolution testing and flame atomic absorption spectrophotometric analysis of potassium gluconate tablets.  The analytical chemistry students at these schools performed method development, validation and statistical analysis and wrote standard operating procedures of the validated methods that were transferred between the two schools to ensure that the data was reproducible at the other location, by a different set of students and that the data met statistical requirements for AMT. Engaging students in performing these experiments presented an opportunity to address the concept of AMT, a practice that is conducted globally. The students were provided with in-depth instruction on a topic that is currently not available in the undergraduate analytical chemistry curriculum. This setting provided a real world experience for the undergraduate analytical chemistry students who do not often have the opportunity to perform work that is done in industry.  The laboratory experiments that were developed and evaluated by the students employed a dissolution tester, an instrument that is not currently available in the analytical chemistry laboratory but used worldwide in pharmaceutical analytical laboratories.  The data that was generated by students from KSU and SJFC was used to create case studies in the form of guided inquiry activities that were evaluated by students from three other colleges, such that these students were also exposed to the concept of AMT and the dissolution testing. Students at the three colleges were provided with a video to walk them through the steps of the experiments and later furnished with the case studies to compute validation results and determine if the AMT between KSU and SJFC was successful.  The laboratory and guided inquiry activities developed and implemented in this project increased the understanding of a fundamental principle, that of AMT, which is a subset of method equivalence studies, and not currently taught in the analytical chemistry curriculum. Teaching AMT to chemistry majors is necessary in placing graduating students at the forefront of the global learning environment.  The results of this work were disseminated broadly by faculty and students at national conferences that included; ACS, PITTCON, POGIL and BCCE. Some of the results have also recently been submitted for publication with the Journal of Chemical Education. In addition, manuscripts for the remaining work are in preparation and are expected to be submitted very soon for publication with the Journal of Chemical Education.
