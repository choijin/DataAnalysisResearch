<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organic electronics include devices like Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) devices and Organic Photovoltaics (OPV)s. OLEDs are similar to traditional light-emitting diodes, except the material that emits light when exposed to current is an organic molecule or polymer.  Traditional solar cells use silicon, but OPVs use polymers or small molecules to generate energy. Organic electronics have the potential for lightweight, flexible, ink-jet printed devices made without expensive metal components.  A critical drawback to the commercialization of OLEDs and OPVs is the rapid degradation of the active layer polymer under operating conditions.  This process causes poor device performance and limits device lifetime.  Poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivatives were synthesized with modified structures to improve the stability of the active layer. PPVs for use in organic electronics often incorporate oxygen on the ring to increase solubility. We propose that replacing the dialkoxy (DAO-PPV) substitution with dialkyl (DA-PPV) will increase device stability as well as shift light emission to blue.  OPV devices were fabricated with both DA-PPV and DAO-PPV. Conditions were optimized to achieve power conversion efficiencies of 0.07% and 1.96% respectively. The low efficiency of DA-PPV is attributed to poor solubility and absorbance. OLED devices fabricated from both polymers exhibited short lifetimes and require further device optimization. DA-PPV does show a significantly blue-shifted emission compared to that of DAO-PPV.
