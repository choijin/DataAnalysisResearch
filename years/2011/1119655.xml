<AbstractNarration>India is the next frontier for partnerships in global resource discovery and management.  Exploration for mineral resources in central India urgently needs broad application of modern geologic understanding.  Specifically, the age of the rocks that host ore minerals, and the timing of introduction of economically important minerals are very poorly constrained.  Age relationships are the foundation for interpretation of the geologic record.  The team builds on preliminary work that has shown, for example, that the introduction of gold ore was nearly two billion years later than previously assumed.  This realization demands new models for ore formation in central India - models that suggest Au formed during breakup of the last major supercontinent, Pangea.  The investigators will concentrate on a study area in central India, roughly mid-way between Mumbai and Kolkata, which straddles a major geologic lineament that cuts across the Indian subcontinent.  This lineament, the Central Indian Tectonic Zone (CITZ), has been active for more than two billion years, and continues to generate earthquakes today.  Because ore deposition is tied to movement of hot fluids in the Earth's crust, dating the ore minerals also dates fluid movement.  This age control will help our understanding of the full geologic history of the CITZ with implications for its on-going seismic activity.  The project brings together a unique multi-disciplinary team with complementary skills.  Two US geoscientists and a PhD student with advanced understanding of tectonics and ore-forming processes will team with two Indian geoscientists and an Indian student with solid knowledge of the regional geology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique tool underpinning this project is rhenium-osmium (Re-Os) geochemistry, as developed for application to mineral exploration and tectonic reconstructions by the AIRIE Program at Colorado State University.  These two rare elements comprise a radioactive pair, as an isotope of Re decays to a specific isotope of Os with a half-life nearly ten times the age of the earth.  Both elements are concentrated in the ore-forming environment, and thus provide a mechanism for dating precious metal-sulfide ore deposits.  In addition, the isotopic composition of Os serves as a tracer, revealing the primary source of the metals in the earth?s crust or upper mantle.  The Re-Os system offers a new window into the tectonic causes and timing of fluid movement in the earth?s crust.  Historically, those working in ore geology have looked to tectonics for understanding of ore-forming processes.  In the proposed reverse approach, the team will use the evidence from the ores to understand the tectonic processes.  The project thus opens a new approach to the broad field of tectonics, while simultaneously providing the geochronologic framework for the next century of sustainable mineral development ? a critical base for the burgeoning global economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2010, armed with an NSF planning grant, the PIs and a student visited India with our colleague and bureaucracy-busting guide, MK Pandit. First we clattered over tracks in eastern Madhya Pradesh to reach the huge Malanjkhand copper mine; samples of molybdenite display a range of textures and their rhenium-osmium (Re-Os) chemistry revealed a 40 m.y. history of reworking of the ore.  We then explored ore deposits in the Sausar and Sakoli mobile belts east of Nagpur, and the complex mineralization along the Aravalli-Delhi mobile belt in northeast Rajasthan.  With this new award, we returned to the latter two sites to unravel metamorphic and ore-forming events with Re-Os geochemistry.  This innocuous pair of elements tells us the age of the samples in geologic time, and traces the source of metals &ndash; from the earth?s mantle to continental crust.  Our renewed investigations, working through the Re-Os radiometric clock, yield significant new understanding of timing and reactivation of junctures and old sutures in India?s continental crust:  The minimum age for cap carbonate overlying glacial diamictites, the record of a major glacial event more than 2.4 billion years ago.  These new Re-Os data help correlate this ancient, apparently global, glacial event cross different continents, including North America.    Gold and platinum-bearing ore veins in the Central Indian Tectonic Zone, were not formed more than 2 billion years ago, as expected.  Rather, in a surprising results, the Re-Os clock showed that metal-bearing fluids from the mantle entered this tectonic zone as India was stretched and ripped away from east Africa and passed over the Marion, Crozet and Kerguelen hot spots before jetting northward toward Asia.  This opens a whole new corridor of thinking.  That is, the formation of gold deposits need not be confined to classical, subduction-related continental margins, but can occur along old tectonic sutures as continents ride over fixed but leaky hot spots.    Metamorphism of rocks in the Sakoli Fold Belt occurred over a ~100-150 m.y. period about 1600 million years ago, and this metamorphism was responsible for the formation of tungsten-molybdenum ore deposits.  The complex ore deposits in the Kehtri copper belt apparently formed (and/or were reworked) during events around 1150-1250 Ma and 850-870 Ma. Meanwhile, back in the lab, new techniques were developed to analyze very low concentrations of Os found in some of the Khetri sulfide samples.  We pre-treated nitric acid used for analyses with peroxide, reducing its Os concentration, and therefore our blanks, by an order of magnitude.   Thus, with the funds from this NSF award, we were able to address several diverse and interdisciplinary issues along ancient geologic junctures preserved in the continental crust in peninsular India.  Resolving the time component is key for global plate tectonic reconstructions, and for assessing periods of global glaciation and ice cover.  Our Re-Os technology is used to date minerals associated with ore deposits and metamorphism, record keepers of plate tectonics.  In addition, the funds from this grant were used to advance our technical capability in the lab, enabling us to work with more challenging samples in the future.
