<AbstractNarration>This project analyzes strategic manipulation of learning players in repeated games. People are not born with optimal strategies, but instead learn to interact in markets and other social situations. Increasingly, humans interact with computerized agents who may be programmed to use some adaptive learning heuristic. Especially when economic success is at stake, resources may be invested to manipulate learning players. First, the Principle Investigator (PI) seeks to find simple adaptive heuristics that are essentially unbeatable by any opponent in generic and economically relevant classes of games. Second, the PI seeks to discover simple adaptive heuristics whose long run outcome can not be manipulated by sophisticated opponents. Such heuristics are of interest to robustly implement outcomes in mechanisms with learning players. Third, the PI will investigate the existence of simple adaptive heuristics whose long run outcome is not only close to Nash equilibrium but which can also not be manipulated by sophisticated opponents in generic and economically relevant classes of games. Prior work on learning in games focuses on simple heuristics that lead in all games to Nash equilibrium. The objective is to settle the important open question whether such learning heuristics themselves can be robust to strategic manipulation. Finally, the PI aims to find dynamically optimal strategies against well-known adaptive heuristics such as myopic best reply, fictitious play, reinforcement learning, imitation, trail &amp; error learning, and regret matching in generic and economically relevant classes of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings developed in this project are not only relevant for the theory of learning in games in economics but they are foremost relevant for the understanding of real-life strategic interaction and the design of interacting learning machines. In reality, players almost always have to learn how to interact and are almost always heterogeneous with respect to knowledge, strategic sophistication and learning abilities. This becomes obvious for instance in the increasing interaction of humans with machines such as calling robots and automated trading. Especially for automated trading in financial markets, one expects simple learning players to be manipulated by other more sophisticated players if the latter can achieve a strategic advantage. The results of this project are expected to influence the design of interacting learning machines robust to manipulation in many environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  Game theory is the most prevalent approach to rigorously analyze strategic interaction in economics, computer science, political science, biology, and national defense. Nash equilibrium is the most frequently used solution concept to games. It is often justified by arguing that learning of players would eventually lead to equilibrium. In the research project we showed that  Players using uncoupled learning heuristics leading to Nash equilibrium can be manipulated.  There are learning heuristics that cannot be manipulated but those learning heuristics do not generally lead to Nash equilibrium and/or are coupled.   During the course of the research, we also characterized the class of games in which tit-for-tat is unbeatable by any other strategy no matter how sophisticated. We also characterized the class of symmetric two-player zero-sum games that possess pure equilibria. Moreover, our results also imply that rational learning selects among equilibria in repeated games.     Intellectual merit  There are several far-reaching implications of our results: First, they suggest that uncoupled learning of Nash equilibrium lacks a strategic foundation. The moment players do not forget that they play a game while learning equilibrium, they may try to manipulate each others? learning input and thus may not reach stage-game equilibrium. Second, the results suggest that uncoupled learning cannot have an evolutionary foundation. That is, players that are "programmed" by evolution to uncoupled learning heuristics may not be evolutionary stable as there are other strategic teaching heuristics that would do strictly better against such learning population. Third, there cannot exist uncoupled learning heuristics that "learn themselves". The last observation is in contrast to the existence of fully self-referential universal learning algorithms in non-strategic contexts from artificial intelligence.
