<AbstractNarration>Tibetans have lived at altitudes above 3000m (~10,000') for at least 10,000 years and consequently have distinctive biological traits, including unexpectedly low levels of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen.  Genes accounting for such hemoglobin levels were recently identified and occur at uniquely high frequency among Tibetans. The likely mechanism for this high frequency is higher fertility and child survival for those people with the low-hemoglobin forms of those genes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will test the hypothesis that Tibetan women at high altitude in Nepal with the low-hemoglobin variants of the genes have more surviving children than those with the other variants.  1350 women of Tibetan ethnicity residing at 3000m or higher who have completed their reproductive careers will provide DNA for typing the genes called EPAS1, EGLN1 and HIF1alpha that were previously found to regulate the response to hypoxia (low oxygen availability), such as that occurring at high altitudes.  In addition, measurements of hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, as well as information on these women's fertility history and the survival of their children, will be collected.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The predicted outcome is that women with the forms of the genes that are most frequent among Tibetans will have lower hemoglobin concentration, higher oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, and more surviving children.  Those results will connect a severe environmental stress to biological and genetic variation and reproductive success, building a case for natural selection operating in a human population and improving our understanding of the processes of adapting to new environments.  This U.S.-Nepalese collaborative research has health implications at all altitudes because these genes are necessary for intrauterine development, and they play central roles in the biology of diseases as diverse as osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, heart failure, and cancer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research tested the hypothesis that ethnically Tibetan women at high altitudes in Nepal with specific genetic variants in genes regulating the response to hypoxia have more surviving children than others.  The findings describe a rare case study involving all the components of adaptive evolution: environmental stress, phenotypic variation, genetic variation, and reproductive success. The components include the stress of high-altitude hypoxia, the hemoglobin concentration, percent of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, and pulse phenotypes, genetic variants in EPAS1, and women?s fertility history, including the probability a pregnancy became a livebirth. High altitude adaptation is a classic model of evolution and adaptation in physical anthropology and physiology.        Intellectual merit:  The study sampled 1006 post-reproductive ethnically Tibetan women residing at 3000-4100 m in Nepal. They responded to reproductive history interviews conducted in their native dialects, provided noninvasive physiological measurements and saliva samples for DNA extraction.  Statistical analyses took into account various socio-cultural factors affecting reproductive success, including marital status, age of first birth, relative wealth and access to health care. The analyses considered such factors and found that a higher percentage of oxygen saturation associated weakly and an unelevated hemoglobin concentration associated strongly with better reproductive success. A higher percent of oxygen saturation and an unelevated hemoglobin concentration suggest a dampened response to the stress of high-altitude hypoxia.     The candidate gene (one chosen based on known biology) analyses detected an association of EPAS1 with hemoglobin concentration:  the most frequent EPAS1 variants associated with unelevated hemoglobin concentration. Those EPAS1 genetic variants occur in high frequency only among Tibetans.  In turn, unelevated hemoglobin concentration associated with a higher probability a pregnancy became a livebirth.  A one-standard-deviation elevation of hemoglobin concentration over the average cost a 2% lower probability that a pregnancy became a livebirth.  Those findings raised the expectation that EPAS1 associated with that measure of reproductivethe same network and their associated phenotypes on the biochemical and physiological mechanisms underlying the associations.  These results confirm that Tibetans live healthy lives at high altitude without the elevation of hemoglobin concentration characteristics of visitors or Andean highlanders. success, but it did not.  That finding suggests the influence of other genes in     Genome-wide association analyses (to discover new biology) and tests for polygenic adaptations (to discover many genes with small effects contributing to these traits), showed evidence of selection for genetic variants associated with more pregnancies and live births and selection against those associated with higher offspring mortality.  The genes and their variants are found throughout the world, suggesting that they could influence women?s reproductive history in many populations.     Four hundred and thirty women participated in a follow-up study to assess the stability of their phenotypes over seven years.  The sample means and standard deviations reported in the original study were virtually identical to those found in the follow-up.  Individual values varied little across those years.  These findings show that hemoglobin concentration, pulse, and percent of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin values were stable throughout post-reproductive life in this sample.  Therefore, the genotype-phenotype analyses conducted on the original sample should also be stable and replicable.     Broader impact:  This research expanded multidisciplinary and international collaborations among U.S. and Nepalese scientists, research volunteers and assistants.  Anthropologists, geneticists, physicians and statisticians collaborated.  U.S. and Nepalese students gained research training and experience in data collection, management, analysis, and publication. More than three dozen presentations at scientific meetings, numerous talks to classrooms of students in many disciplines, five journal articles, as well as book chapters made the results of the research known to the scientific community.  A website provides information on the conduct of the research, the interview protocols, and links to publications with publicly available data.  Concerning public health, the research identified influences of genes likely to influence women?s fertility and fertility outcomes in many populations.
