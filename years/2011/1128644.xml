<AbstractNarration>Overview: We propose to investigate dramatic changes in electronic and photonic&lt;br/&gt;properties of new functional devices based on the reversible metal-insulator transition&lt;br/&gt;(MIT) of vanadium dioxide. The electrical resistivity of VO2 changes by 4 to 5 orders.&lt;br/&gt;Variations in refractive index exceed 15%, giving an index contrast of greater than 3&lt;br/&gt;relative to free space. This unique combination of properties motivates the study of its&lt;br/&gt;phase transition mechanisms, control of its properties, and development of terahertz&lt;br/&gt;(THz) functional components.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: We will explore the fundamental physics of VO2 phase transition,&lt;br/&gt;particularly when driven electrically in pulsed current mode or in gate electric-field mode,&lt;br/&gt;and develop new functional devices for THz switching and modulation applications with&lt;br/&gt;the aim of reconfigurable manipulation. Through the study of phase transition&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms and factors to influence the transition ?speed? we will engineer the material&lt;br/&gt;structure to achieve abrupt ?digital? switching and controllable percolative phase&lt;br/&gt;transition for ?analog? modulation. The result will provide fundamental understanding of&lt;br/&gt;electrically controlled metal-insulator transition and promote the application of phasetransition-&lt;br/&gt;based materials for electronic and photonic applications.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Study of phase transitions will provide new opportunities to achieve&lt;br/&gt;innovative functional devices. These devices will exhibit unprecedented operational&lt;br/&gt;principles for electronic and photonic applications, in addition to fundamental scientific&lt;br/&gt;understanding. The proposed components will find broad applications in THz technology.&lt;br/&gt;The project provides excellent opportunities for interdisciplinary research education and&lt;br/&gt;training. Outreach efforts will attract new students, especially those from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups, to science and engineering fields.</AbstractNarration>
