<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award will extend the theory and applications of comparative statics.  Monotone comparative statics are central to modern economic  analysis.  These mathematical methods allow us to build models that can predict how decisions and results react to changes in the economic environment.  These methods can be used in dynamic environments to study many important economic problems, including capital growth, the timing of investment decisions, search and experimentation, and dynamic asset pricing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will extend the theory and applications of comparative statics, with a focus on (1) the interplay between comparative statics and dynamic methods, (2) generalizations and applications of the single-crossing property, a mathematical concept that underlies much comparative statics theory, (3) the study of similarity and interdependence between economic decision makers, and (4) a variety of applications.  This include applications to political economy, finance, contract theory, and a variety of different search and experimentation models.  The research  also develops new methods for dynamic modeling that can be used to create new dynamic models that can be analyzed with comparative statics methods as opposed to numerical analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award also funds multiple educational activities that are designed to make monotone comparative statics methods available to a broader range of social scientists and students.  This includes course development, a specialized textbook, and a specialized workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main research output of this period is the production of a 130-page manuscript on monotone comparative statics. One of my main "promises" for this research proposal was the creation of a textbook on the topic.  I will briefly note that "monotone comparative statics" stands for a general, cross sectional methodology to analyze problems in many different fields, from political science to finance, with intensive use in trade economics, networks, and so on. In a nutshell, this methodology aims to describe how optimal or equilibrium decisions change in reaction to modifications in the environment.  There is not textbook on this topic however (except for a book published in 1998, which focuses on somewhat dated methods and contains few applications), and researchers often rely on ad hoc methods. There seems to be high demand for this and I am with with researchers working various fields (e.g., trade, political economy, information economics) to incorporate in the textbook applications and methods that can serve these fields.  More work remains to be done on this book, one of the challenges being that it is a methodological (and mathematical) book aimed at a broad audience. This requires a lot work on organizing the material to increase the difficulty very gradually, and choosing the right set of appliations to appeal to a broad audience.  In addition to the book, I have published several papers last year in top economics journals (2 in Econometrica, 1 in the JPE) which use some comparative static techniques in dynamic contexts.
