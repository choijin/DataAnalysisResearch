<AbstractNarration>The Eastern United States is an area of exceptional biodiversity. But for fungi, a critical component of environmental health, this biodiversity is significantly underestimated for two reasons:  1) there is a significant but unknown level of hidden diversity underground and 2) traditional mycologists incorrectly used European names for North American species, assuming that fungal species were widely distributed.  This study uses morphological examination, molecular data and mating studies to estimate levels of hidden diversity in agaric fungi and to evaluate the extent to which European and North American fungi are different species.  The American study area focuses on one of the biodiversity hot spots in the United States, the southern Appalachian Mountains including the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  The European study areas focus on two essential locations for traditional European names.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will provide estimates of hidden diversity in the southern Appalachians and determine if molecular data and methods for estimating species boundaries can be effectively used to evaluate biodiversity in agaric fungi and accelerate taxonomic discovery. By further evaluating and documenting fungal biodiversity in the southern Appalachians, this project will contribute towards understanding the origins and maintenance of the exceptional biodiversity of the region and will contribute to the All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Understanding patterns of biodiversity has become increasingly urgent with the onset of global climate change. Land use and conservation decisions rely on estimates of biodiversity and endemism which are tied to species names. If these are inaccurate, conservation decisions may fail to protect native biodiversity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many fungi provide essential ecosystem services.  Some fungal species degrade materials and return nutrients to the soil; others form essential symbiotic relationships (mycorrhiza) with plants and provide plants with water and minerals.  Some fungi are important because they cause disease in plants or animals and some because they are the source of essential antibiotics and other important medicinal compounds. Many fungi are food sources for much of the world?s population.  Little, however, is known about their total diversity which is currently estimated at 1.5 million species but may be much higher.  The southern Appalachian Mountains are one of three exceptional areas of biodiversity in the United States.  They are especially diverse in fungi, salamanders and mosses. A number of factors are currently impacting the southern Appalachian region including invasive insect pests and climate change.  In order to evaluate the effects of these changes on the overall health of the southern Appalachian forests, it is important to understand the actual biodiversity that currently exists and factors which affect our estimates of biodiversity.  In this study, we evaluated two potential sources of error in biodiversity estimates of macrofungi (mushrooms and their kin) in the Southern Appalachians.  The two potential sources of error are: 1. Historic names.  Early (late 1700s and early 1800s) biologists who explored the southeastern United States gave traditional European names to fungi and assumed that North American fungi were the same species as European fungi.  That concept has been accepted until very recently; 2. Cryptic (hidden) species which superficially are the same but on closer examination, turn out to be different species. We also evaluated different criteria for determining if two entities were different species including morphological differences, ability to interbreed, and genetic (DNA) differences.  We evaluated several computer programs designed to delineate species based on the extent and distribution of genetic differences.  We found that about 87% of the North American fungi we studied were not the same as the European entities with the same name.  The exception to this were boreal fungi which seem to be the same on both continents as indicated by ability to interbreed, morphological similarities and genetic similarities.  We have provided new names for the North American fungi.  We also found that most "species" studied were actually composed of several cryptic or hidden species.  The ratio was 3.4 cryptic species for each "species" studied.  While these ratios will change as further studies are carried out, there is no question that at least for the macrofungi of the southern Appalachians, science has significantly underestimated the total number of species.
