<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigators in this case, Drs. Gary Zank and Jim Spann, are members of the organizing committee for the Thirteenth International Solar Wind Conference ("Solar Wind 13"), being convened by the Center of Space Plasma and Aeronomic Research (CSPAR) of the University of Alabama and the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solar Wind 13 meeting will take place at Sheraton Keauhou Resort on the Big Island of Hawaii, USA, from 17 to 22 June 2012, and it represents an important community conference in the field of solar and heliospheric physics. Approximately 200 to 250 scientists and students typically attend these Solar Wind conferences, which alternate between a US and a European location every 3 to 4 years. The Solar Wind meetings have become a unique and valuable element of solar and space physics research, being organized exclusively to address major problems and progress in the fields of coronal and interplanetary space physics over the preceding 3 to 4 years. These meetings and the scientific publications they ultimately produce have had significant impact on many solar and space scientists in the community today.</AbstractNarration>
