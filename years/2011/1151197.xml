<AbstractNarration>This program will theoretically underpin Advanced LIGO's searches for gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar collapse and core-collapse supernovae and will lay the foundations for a GW-neutrino multimessenger astronomy of core-collapse supernovae in preparation for the next galactic supernova. The project team will develop open-source computer software and efficient algorithms to simulate core-collapse supernovae in full 3D, study the associated emission of gravitational waves and neutrinos, and establish the understanding of how these messengers can be profitably used to probe the astrophysics of supernovae and fundamental physics.  The education program consists of a bi-annual summer school at the California Institute of Technology that will bring together astronomy and gravitational-wave physics graduate students to train them in the physics and astrophysics of gravitational-wave sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core-collapse supernovae are among the most energetic events in the universe. They are triggered by the collapse of supergiant stars and their explosions enrich the interstellar gas with the elements of life (carbon, oxygen, iron).  This research program is motivated by the pressing need to understand how core-collapse supernovae work. It is known that these extreme events are connected to the collapse of massive stars, but it has not yet been clearly established how the initial collapse is reversed and turned into an explosion. An observation of the next galactic core-collapse supernova by Advanced LIGO and by neutrino observatories may shed light on the supernova phenomenon and this research project strives towards creating the theoretical foundation for the interpretation of such signals.  The educational part of this program is motivated by the need, in preparation for Advanced LIGO, of training the first generation of true GW astronomers -- scientists who are trained in the physics and observation of gravitational waves and in the physics and astrophysics of their sources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At the end of a massive star's life, when the nuclear reactions in the star's core can no longer counteract gravity, the core collapses, triggering a powerful explosion known as a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). CCSNe are a key site for the production of elements via nuclear reactions, and also of the distribution of these elements, which can eventually find their way into gas clouds that form stars and planets. The oxygen and sodium atoms in our bodies were once inside the core of a massive star and spread through the universe by a CCSN.  Although CCSNe have been observed for centuries, the details of how the explosion works are only now being figured out.  CCSNe are observed not only via the light they emit, but also via other electromagnetic signals (x-rays, gamma rays, etc.), the detection of low-mass particles called neutrinos, and in the future by gravitational waves observed by instruments such as LIGO.  Our work aims at understanding CCSNe and connecting their observational signatures to their underlying fundamental physics and astrophysics.  This is done through computer solutions of the complicated equations that govern CCSNe: equations for gravity (including general relativity), hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, neutrino emission, and nuclear reactions.  The largest computers are only now becoming powerful enough to do this work.  This project has made a number of contributions to understanding of CCSNe, including:  (1) We have shown that turbulence is a key feature of the supernova mechanism; without turbulence the explosion does not occur.  (2) We have shown that it is not sufficient to solve the relevant equations for CCSNe under the assumption that the supernova is symmetric about an axis of rotation; the equations must be solved in all three dimensions, even though that requires much more computer power.  (3) We have developed and released an open-source code SNEC that is now used by others in the community to predict how the brightness of a supernova fades over time.  (4) We have shown that a particular instability, known as the magnetorotational instability (MRI) operates during rotating CCSNe, can be responsible for driving the explosion, and results in large magnetic fields.  (5) We have made predictions for gravitational waves in CCSNe using particular beyond-Einstein theories of gravity.  These predictions can be used by future gravitational-wave observations to test whether Einstein's equations are indeed the correct theory of gravitation.  (6) We build a public code for handling the equation of state (EOS) in objects like CCSNe and neutron stars.  The EOS is a technical name for how matter behaves when compressed.  We know the EOS for ordinary substances like water or air, but the EOS for the matter in a neutron star is unknown; a key goal of CCSNe and neutron-star binary observations is to figure out the EOS.  (7) We developed a public code Skynet that computes nuclear reactions inside a CCSNe or neutron-star collision.  (8) We showed that binary black hole mergers in stellar-density gas look nothing like black hole mergers in vacuum, disproving theories suggesting that any of LIGO's observed gravitational wave events occurred inside a star.  (9) We carried out the first comparison of different ways to compute neutrino effects in multidimensional CCSNe.  Neutrino effects are critical for the explosion to occur, but are not quite possible to compute with today's computers unless certain approximations are made. This comparison evaluates how accurate those approximations are.  This award also supported the Caltech Gravitational Wave Astrophysics School (CGWAS).  The first of CGWAS was held July 22-26, 2013, and the second was July 6-10, 2015. The second had 60 participants from 11 nations. CGWAS (1) provided education on the astrophysics of gravitational-wave sources, (2) developed a common knowledge base on observational methods, (3) performed hands-on training in data analysis, and (4) furthered collaboration among young scientists.  This project helped train a new generation of scientists and others with STEM related careers. The project involved 10 Ph.D. students and 16 postdoctoral researchers.  We have also communicated our work to the public via lectures, social media posts, newspapers, and magazines.
