<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to develop a fundamental understanding of the role of edge effects in&lt;br/&gt;the electronic and transport properties of graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors (GNR FETs).&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research will ascertain the significance of ideal, atomically smooth edges for&lt;br/&gt;GNR FETs, and thus will help to establish their ultimate intrinsic performance limit. A new approach&lt;br/&gt;will be used to carry out combined electrical transport and scanning tunneling microscopy/ spectroscopy&lt;br/&gt;measurements in situ to understand the edge effects on the electronic and transport properties of GNR FETs.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed devices will i) enable the identification and isolation of the effects of edges and&lt;br/&gt;surface impurities on important device characteristics, such as the carrier mobility and band gap; and ii)&lt;br/&gt;elucidate the correlation between the detailed edge and electronic structures and device characteristics&lt;br/&gt;in GNR FETs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: As the advance of GNR based nanoelectronics critically relies on the detailed&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the edge effects, the prototype devices developed in this project and the knowledge&lt;br/&gt;gained will help to pave the way for the next generation of all carbon electronics. The project tightly&lt;br/&gt;integrates research with graduate and undergraduate education and community outreach. Graduate&lt;br/&gt;students will play a pivotal role in this research, obtaining important training for their future scientific&lt;br/&gt;and technical careers. A special program to enhance K-12 education in science and mathematics will be&lt;br/&gt;instituted to promote the diversity of the future science and engineering workforce.</AbstractNarration>

However, unlike the commonly used silicon, two-dimensional  graphene is not a semiconductor and thus cannot be completely turned off as required for digital electronics applications. One way to make graphene semiconducting is to create very narrow ribbons out of two-dimensional graphene sheets. As the graphene ribbons becomes narrower and narrower, the edges of the ribbons play increasingly important roles.
