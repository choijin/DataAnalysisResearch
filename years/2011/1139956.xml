<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial travel support for students and early-career scientists attending the Third Symposium on Shallow Flows, a joint meeting of scientists and engineers to be held 4-6 June 2012 at the University of Iowa.  This meeting, which is co-sponsored by the International Association of Hydraulic Research, will facilitate exchange of the latest findings and approaches relevant to diverse phenomena including stable atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers, river- and hurricane-induced floods, flow through riparian-zone vegetation and associated hydrological processes, and transport of contaminants by these flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this activity derives from exchange of information focused on the improvement of experimental and eddy-resolving numerical techniques necessary to investigate large-scale quasi two-dimensional coherent structures and their role in the transport of mass, heat and contaminants in the geophysical environment.  Broader Impacts will occur through improved assessment and forecasting of near-surface meteorological, hydrological and ecological processes and associated socio-economic impacts (such as those from flooding), and by furthering the educational development and diverse representation among students and early-career researchers.</AbstractNarration>
