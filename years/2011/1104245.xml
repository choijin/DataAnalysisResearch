<AbstractNarration>"The Engineering Technology Pathways: Food and Foodstuff Supply Chain" project is the first Engineering Technology program in which a community college and major land grant research university offer articulated degrees with a concentration in the food and foodstuff supply chain. Ivy Tech Community College and Purdue University College of Technology recognize that the food and foodstuff supply chain consists of industries that utilize raw material crops in value-added markets such as feed and alternative energy production.  The variety of the supply chain is a crucial characteristic to maintaining sustainability in commodities and processing industries.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this project, high school graduates have the opportunity to begin their education in this field by earning an Associate of Science degree in Engineering Technology (A.S.E.T.) at Ivy Tech Community College and then seamlessly transfer credits to Purdue University in order to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Technology (B.S.E.T.) at Purdue's College of Technology Statewide.  This innovative educational pathway is preparing a technical workforce to address the challenges facing both producers and manufacturers in the food and foodstuff industry, which has an expanding but largely unfilled need.  Through this collaborative approach, Ivy Tech and Purdue students benefit from a Web-compatible curriculum that encompasses the trans-disciplinary nature of the food and foodstuff industry, incorporating fields such as technological innovation, mechanical engineering technology, electrical engineering technology, food studies, and communication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Engineering Technology Pathways: Food and Foodstuff Supply Chain project was amoung the first Engineering Technology pathways to a college degree in which a community college and major land grant research university offered a full articulated degrees with a concentration in the food and foodstuff supply chain. Ivy Tech Community College and Purdue University College of Technology collaborated on this project for the workforce needs of the state of Indiana. The focus of this project was to support students throughout their college career, support faculty in development of curriculum and articulating degrees, engaging with students, industry, faculty, and staff in networking, and sustaining the degree programs after the project was completed.   As a result, articulation between BSET and ASET degrees was done, despite legislative restrictions on student credits, a new model for student college persistance was discovered through online community of learners, the BSET and ASET programs are growing, despite overall enrollment of Indiana residents into college, and global impacts of Advanced Technical Education concepts were discovered through the application of the principles of the food supply chain.  While the ET Pathways programs may benefits companies across Indiana, as well as across the Midwest region, future work is needed.  Comments from industry advisors suggest that the career path potential is strong, and additional outreach is still needed:  Augment outreach to include smaller employers and from a broader geographic area, outside of Indiana. Attention to the professinal student that is geographically restricted should be highlighted. Include more Indiana institutions in the ET Pathways concept, establish better and more partnerships with more employers, and incorporate more online learning. Sinnce some industries anticipate more than 70 percent of their current management could retire within the next five years, the ET Pathways concept sought to build enrollment and interest in the foodstuff industry, an opportunity for future development.  Finally, it is recommended that Ivy Tech and Purdue continue outreach to employers and alumni, seeking ways to increase bachelor degree enrollment.   Both the Bachelor and Associates degree programs at Purdue and Ivy Tech continue to show growth and sustainability, making the ET pathway into an advanced technical career viable for Indiana residents.
