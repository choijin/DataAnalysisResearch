<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funds for a student paper competition and travel fellowships for graduate students from US universities to attend and participate in Phononics 2011: The First International Conference on Phononic Crystals, Metamaterials, and Optomechanics, to be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, May 29 through June 2, 2011).  The study of phonons - although a core discipline in the conventional condensed matter physics literature - is currently being viewed in a new light. Whether examined at the nanoscale, microscale or larger scales, the analysis and manipulation of phonons (aka phononics) is opening up a new technological frontier with a potential impact that could match that of electronics almost half a century ago.  This conference is the world's first conference to bring together the various sub-disciplines related to the study of phonons across the various length scales. The conference covers the following seven themes: (1) phononic crystals, (2) phononic metamaterials, (3) wave propagation in periodic structures, (4) nanoscale phonon transport, (5) phononic MEMS and RF applications, (6) optomechanics, and (7) characterization and fabrication for phononics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this grant NSF supports the conference by (1) provision of travel fellowships for graduate students from US universities to attend and participate in the conference; and (2) sponsorship of a student paper competition, coordinated by the conference organizing committees, for Best, Second Best and Third Best Paper. This support helps the conference in its mission to establish links among the broad and multidisciplinary US and international scientific communities working in phononics, and enhances the educational mission of the conference by encouraging the participation of numerous US-based students pursuing graduate studies in areas directly related to this emerging field.</AbstractNarration>

The conference organization was led by Sandia National Laboratories and the University of Colorado Boulder with active collaboration from the University of New Mexico. In addition to the organizers, the scientific leadership of the conference was augmented with a selection of international researchers widely recognized as "leaders" in the field.  The main topic of the conference was phonons and their manipulation.  The study of phonons &ndash; although a core discipline in the conventional condensed matter physics literature &ndash; has been viewed in new light in recent years. Whether examined at the nanoscale, microscale, or larger scales, the analysis and manipulation of phonons (aka phononics) has been opening up a new technological frontier with a potential impact that could match that of electronics almost half a century ago.

A complete list of invited speakers and their affiliations is available at:  https://phononics2011.org/conf/index.php/phononics/2011/pages/view/invited-speakers.    The co-PIÆs sought NSF support for this conference for two reasons: (1) help establish links between the foundation and the broad and multidisciplinary international scientific community working in the emerging field of phononics, and (2) enhance the educational mission of the conference by supporting young scientist travel fellowships as well as an in-conference student paper competition. As such, the funds were split into two categories: travel fellowships, and prizes and expenses for the student competitions.    A total of USD 9000 was disbursed to 11 students from 6 different universities in the United States.  The following is a detailed list of the students and their universities.   Osama R.
