<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests partial support for participation of students and young researchers&lt;br/&gt;in the 36th Annual International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves.&lt;br/&gt;The conference will be held in Houston TX on October 2-7, 2011. NSF support will provide&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for young researchers to showcase their recent results and interact with experts&lt;br/&gt;in the various disciplines which fall within the conference scope. The requested funds will&lt;br/&gt;specifically be used to support travel and registration costs for US researchers, and will&lt;br/&gt;be targeted towards under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;This conference has recently grown rapidly and is now the leading forum for researchers in&lt;br/&gt;all areas of long-wave electromagnetic science and technology. Topical areas span a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of disciplines, including aspects of physics, chemistry, biology and numerous engineering&lt;br/&gt;disciplines. The conference continues to benefit from the technical co-sponsorship of the&lt;br/&gt;IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society, which oversees the publication of the conference&lt;br/&gt;proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposal is fostering an environment of technical discussions among&lt;br/&gt;numerous different communities of theorists and practicing scientists and engineers. In addition&lt;br/&gt;the conference organizers are dedicated to encouraging participation by young US scientists&lt;br/&gt;and researchers, especially from under-represented groups. This will be accomplished through&lt;br/&gt;reduced conference registration fees for students as well as by providing targeted travel&lt;br/&gt;support enabled by this NSF proposal. By fostering the careers of younger researchers, this&lt;br/&gt;proposal will benefit the future growth of the field of long-wave science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal requested partial support for participation of students and young researchers in the 36th Annual International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves.  The conference was held in Houston TX on October 2-7, 2011.  NSF support provided opportunities for young researchers to showcase their recent results and interact with experts in the various disciplines which fall within the conference scope.  The requested funds were specifically used to support travel and registration costs for US researchers, and were targeted in part towards under-represented groups.  In total, 31 students and one post-doctoral researcher received funds to partially offset the costs of travel and lodging.  This conference has recently grown rapidly and is now the leading forum for researchers in all areas of long-wave electromagnetic science and technology.  Topical areas span a wide range of disciplines, including aspects of physics, chemistry, biology and numerous engineering disciplines.  The conference continues to benefit from the technical co-sponsorship of the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society, which oversees the publication of the conference proceedings.  The broader impact of the proposal is fostering an environment of technical discussions among numerous different communities of practicing scientists and engineers. In addition the conference organizers were dedicated to encouraging participation by young US scientists and researchers, especially from under-represented groups.  This was accomplished through reduced conference registration fees for students as well as by providing targeted travel support enabled by this NSF grant.
