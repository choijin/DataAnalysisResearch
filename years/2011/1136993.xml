<AbstractNarration>The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) is a catalyst and enabler for the computing research community. Its various activities strive to unite the community to contribute to shaping the future of the field; provide leadership for the community, facilitating revolutionary, high-impact research; encourage the alignment of computing research with pressing national priorities and national challenges (many of which cross disciplines); give voice to the community, communicating to a broad audience the myriad ways in which advances in computing will create a brighter future; and grow new leaders for the field as a whole. The CCC operates under a Cooperative Agreement between the National Science Foundation and the Computing Research Association (CRA), a membership organization of over 200 computing research entities in academia, industry, and government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the founding years of its existence, the activities of the CCC had a significant impact on the status, direction, and prospects of the computing research community, catalyzing new Federal initiatives in robotics and big data to name a few. Opportunities during this second phase of the CCC are every bit as great. The CCC is an investment that promises to pay off in important ways for the field and for the nation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The mission of Computing Research Association’s Computing Community Consortium (CCC) is to catalyze the computing research community and enable the pursuit of innovative, high-impact research.  CCC conducts activities that strengthen the research community, articulate, compelling research visions, and align those visions with pressing national and global challenges.  CCC communicates the importance of those visions to policymakers, government and industry stakeholders, the public, and the research community itself.     This award covered CCC’s transition from start-up to a steady state organization which has been instrumental in the health and future well-being of the computing research ecosystem.  During this award, several sister organizations have looked to CCC for partnership and guidance to enhance the broader research ecosystem.   CCC has expanded its role as a convener across disciplines within computing and across different scientific and engineering disciplines.  NSF’s return on its investment has been large.   Highlights:  Created A 20-Year Community Roadmap for AI Research in the US, a blueprint for the research which the US should be funding the maintain leadership in AI, based on 3 community workshops and input from over 600 community members.   Held 2 Symposiums in Washington, DC to engage the research community and policymakers on the Computing Research Areas that impact National Priorities and Societal Needs Held the AI for Social Good Symposium for over 400 people in Washington, DC to help catalyze the conversation around the importance of AI Sponsored and supported 37 Visioning Workshops to help frame computing research agendas Sponsored and supported 17 Blue Sky Idea Conference Tracks to encourage forward thinking in new areas. Supported and sponsored 3 Leadership in Science Policy Institute (LiSPI) to help CS researchers understand how they can work with policymakers to help the research ecosystem.    Supported and sponsored 4 special events for groups in the research community.   CCC initiated a look at Industry-Academia Collaborations in 2015,  by surveying the community, holding a roundtable discussion and writing a report on the ecosystem.  This was the beginning of an important conversation for the community that is still on-going. CCC led a Computing Visions 2025 effort, with the CISE AC that is now being followed up with a Computing Visions 2030 effort.   Produced 19 Workshop Reports. Produced 39 Community White Papers, including 2 special series: Intelligent Infrastructure and Toward a Science of Autonomy for Physical Systems.   Communicated with the computing research community through blog posts, Great Innovative Ideas articles, Computing Research News articles, and talks at myriad locations.   The vision of CCC remains to encourage and enable computing research that addresses national priorities and societal needs, while sustaining the health of the research ecosystem, both within computing and across all of science and engineering.  The CCC continues to grow as an authoritative catalyst and enabler of computing research.   In turn, the efforts of the CCC will continue to improve the quality of life and standard of living for people in the U.S. and worldwide through more advanced technologies from catalyzing the computing research community forward.
