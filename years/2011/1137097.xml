<AbstractNarration>With the stagnation of computer processor frequency due to the constraints of power and density, processor manufacturers are introducing additional parallelism within their designs to attain increased performance for highly parallel applications.   The Intel Many Integrated Core (Intel MIC) architecture offers potential advantages over the current generation of heterogeneous architectures.  To explore the effectiveness of the Intel MIC architecture on a broad range of computational science research, this award to the University of Tennessee Knoxville will (1) operate an experimental cluster equipped with Intel MIC co-processors  for a period of two years and (2) coordinate an associated research program in collaboration with other institutions aimed at exploring the potential impact of the Intel MIC architecture and related programming models on key scientific codes. Through a partnership with Intel, the experimental cluster will initially be equipped with pre-release hardware to allow leading scientists and engineers in a variety of disciplines to begin working with the Intel MIC architecture prior to its commercial debut. The pre-release hardware will be upgraded to commercially available Intel MIC co-processors upon their release. The associated research program will be comprised initially of software projects (from the fields of plasma physics, nanoelectronics, astrophysics, chemistry, biology, quantum chromodynamics, and computer science) directly supported by this project and subsequently expanded to a more diverse set of scientific applications (selected by a panel of experts) proposed by research teams across the country in response to an open call for participation. These software projects will optimize important scientific and engineering applications using techniques that are expected to benefit performance on both conventional and accelerator-based architectures.  Results will be made available publicly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project strategically promotes the use of emerging developments in accelerator hardware and parallel programming models within the nation's research community. The associated software projects are expected to advance the state of the art, positioning the nation's research community for future scientific and engineering advances. It also deepens the collaboration of the University of Tennessee Knoxville with industry. Finally, associated engagement activities that leverage existing University educational outreach programs ensure that the benefits of this research are broadly disseminated throughout the open science community and offer opportunities for traditionally underrepresented groups to participate in world-class computational research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explored the application of the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor to the acceleration of scientific and engineering applications.  This was accomplished through the deployment and operation of an experimental high-performance computing cluster equipped with Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors and the coordination of an associated research project involving research teams across the across the country.     The experimental cluster employed by the project was deployed and upgraded in several stages.  The initial machine provided 16 nodes equipped with 32 pre-production Intel Knights Ferry coprocessors, which were upgraded to production Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors (codenamed Knights Corner) shortly after their release.  The success of this initial stage of the project led to supplemental funding provided by the University of Tennessee that facilitated the deployment of a 48-node Cray CS300-AC cluster supercomputer equipped with 192 Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors, which debuted at the top of the November 2012 Green500 List, making it the most energy-efficient supercomputer in the world at that time.  This supercomputer, named Beacon, is still in operation by the University of Tennessee for use by the national research community today (June 30, 2015), and it is expected to operate as a core computing resource for the university and its collaborators for years to come.   Along with the 9 core research teams funded by the award, the project supported the research of over 50 additional research teams selected for participation via a peer-reviewed open call for participation or at the discretion of the principal investigator.  The selected teams received allocations of computational time, training, and support.  In aggregate, over 350 researchers and students utilized the experimental cluster during the project period, producing scientific advances across a broad range of academic disciplines.  In addition to the substantial scientific output of the research teams, the project contributed significantly to the development and dissemination of best practices related to the porting and optimization of scientific codes for emerging many-core computing architectures, paving the way for future machine deployments and code development at a varity of sites and across a variety of disciplines.   Aside from its scientific impacts, the project impacted the broader community through the development of human resources, the enhancement of infrastructure, and the transfer of technology to several vendors.  By providing a unique learning opportunity for students locally and abroad, the project contributed directly to the education of 11 graduate students, 5 undergraduate students, and 1 high school student, while indirectly impacting a far greater number through allocations to subprojects for research and educational use.  The project provided documentation, training, and assistance related to methods, techniques, and best practices that directly impacted the acquisition, deployment, and operation of similar computational resources at other sites.  Work associated with the project led directly to the establishment of several funded Intel Parallel Computing Centers at the University of Tennessee and collaborating sites and established new research partnerships that are in turn leading to new opportunities for funding and collaboration.  Finally, the project team has worked directly with technology providers, such as Intel, RogueWave and Allinea, to ensure the capability and stability of the Xeon Phi coprocessors and the associated software ecosystem and to enhance the next generation of related hardware and software, thereby improving the current and future computing environment for the entire scientific supercomputing community.
