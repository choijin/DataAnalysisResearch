<AbstractNarration>ECCS-1128632: Terahertz Field Control for Signal Processing and Communication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kevin Webb, Purdue University, and Keith Nelson, MIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: Terahertz (THz) spatial and spectral field control using optimized irregular structures that provide new functionalities by virtue of their large number of degrees of freedom will be studied, designed, fabricated and tested. To control light at THz rates, resonant THz elements will be coupled with optical cavities, and this will allow strong modulation of the emission from quantum dots located in the optical cavity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The work will pave the way for new THz and optical sources and detectors, for on-chip signal processing, and for new sensing methods. A measure of the degrees of freedom possible from devices formed in a certain volume, and a foundation for guiding the design process for optimized, irregular devices will be established. Hybrid photonic-plasmonic active and passive components will provide a new high-performance, small footprint, manufacturable technology, and the new work will seek THz data rates. More generally, this work will help build the foundations for electrical-optical, optical-optical, and optical-THz functionalities for chip-scale optical networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This award will support two Ph.D. students. At MIT, the project will dovetail with a pre-college outreach program run by the Nelson group. At Purdue, undergraduate students will be recruited to work on this project in the Webb group, and the work will impact the Purdue Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) program.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes: NSF 128632   Terahertz Field Control for Signal Processing and Communication Findings  Kevin Webb and Keith Nelson      The terahertz regime, which is between microwave and optical frequencies, has lagged in development because of a dearth of suitable sources and detectors. Recent progress creates opportunities for new ultrafast signal processing, including computation and communication, as well as spectroscopic imaging opportunities. This project investigated terahertz device concepts that will be important in such applications.    During this project, methods were developed for spatial and spectral field control using optimized irregular structures that are designed using optimization. These elements provide new functionalities by virtue of their enormous degrees of freedom, limited only by the fabrication and design method. This work will facilitate new classes of devices for sensing, communication, and computing. An angle-insensitive filter was shown to be possible with a material stack composed of thin metal-like and dielectric materials, circumventing a coupling efficiency limitation of conventional filters. Localized large field and necklace states with strongly scattering random media were described in a statistical sense for the first time. This has improved understanding of waves in randomly scattering media. A method to determine images using terahertz measurements was presented and demonstrated. Theory describing electromagnetic wave forces was presented, allowing the design of mechanical systems actuated with waves. A graphene stack was presented as a new black material for removing reflections.   A key terahertz experimental platform was developed that used short optical pulses to generate terahertz waves in lithium niobate and optical probing to directly measure the terahertz fields. This polaritonics platform allowed complete characterization of key terahertz components. High spatial resolution phase-contrast imaging and high signal-to-noise polarization-gated imaged methods were developed.
