<AbstractNarration>The electric grid in the United States has evolved over the past century from a series of small independent community-based systems to one of the largest and most complex cyber-physical systems today.  However, the established conditions that made the electric grid an engineering marvel are being challenged by major changes, the most important being a worldwide effort to mitigate climate change by reducing carbon emissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates key aspects of a computation and information foundation for future cyber-physical energy systems?the smart grids. The overall project objective is to support high penetrations of renewable energy sources, community based micro-grids, and the widespread use of electric cars and smart appliances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has three interconnected components that, collectively, address issues of computation architecture, information hierarchy, and experimental modeling and validation.  On computation architecture, the framework based on cloud computing is investigated for the scalable, consistent, and secure operations of smart grids. The research aims to quantify fundamental design tradeoffs among scalability, data consistency, security, and trustworthiness for emerging applications of smart grids. On information hierarchy, temporal and spatial characteristics of information hierarchy are investigated with the goal of gaining a foundational understanding on how information should be partitioned, collected, distributed, compressed, and aggregated. The research also develops an open and scalable experimental platform (SmartGridLab) for empirical investigations and testing of algorithms and concepts developed in this project. SmartGridLab integrates the hardware testbed with a software simulator so that software virtual nodes can interact with physical nodes in the testbed.   This research also includes a significant education component aimed at integrating frontier research with undergraduate and graduate curricula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Contingent trading for electricity markets  We proposed a coordinated trading process as a design of a wholesale electricity market with significant uncertainty due to renewable sources.  In this process two or more agents propose contingent buy and sell trades of electric energy.  The only requirement is that the trades are coordinated or balanced (i.e. sum of buy bids equals the sum of sell bids).  A coordinated trade is proposed to the ISO (Independent System Operator) whose task is to check the network constraints and either accept the trade if no constraint is violated or curtail it until no violation occurs.  Each proposed trade is accepted or curtailed as it arrives.  The ISO does not set prices, and there is no requirement that trades occur at uniform prices or concurrently.  Indeed, there is no explicit price setting mechanism.  We show that if traders exploit opportunities for gain, the trading process leads to an efficient allocation of energy and discovers LMPs.    As a growing fraction of renewable sources locates in the periphery of the electric grid, the control architecture of the grid will likely be transformed from a central authority at the core of the grid to a distributed intelligence located in its periphery.  Such a transformation will change the role of consumers from simply consuming electricity in their own interests to actively shaping their consumption patterns and their renewable sources for the benefit of collectives of consumers. We have extended the coordinated trading process described above to a system in which hundreds of thousands of consumers can generate their own electricty from solar panels and trade the excess electricity.  We envisage a P2P system in which consumers make supply and buy bids for short time intervals for small amounts of energy.  Thus unlike the wholesale electricity market which involves a centralized market for large generators and utilities that clears once a day, this P2P system clears micro-transactions of energy on a continuing basis.    We believe that the proposed P2P system will be attractive to community choice aggregators (CCA).  CCA enables local governments to aggregate electricity demand within their jurisdictions in order to procure alternative energy supplies while maintaining the existing electricity provider for transmission and distribution services.
