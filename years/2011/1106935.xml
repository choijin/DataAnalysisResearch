<AbstractNarration>Projective shapes of 3D configurations, not their Kendall type similarity shapes, are the most appropriate objects for general image analysis in machine vision and robotics. The present project will develop registration free nonparametric inference by constructing an appropriate equivariant embedding of the full projective shape manifold, and by providing two-sample and multi-sample inference procedures based on the extrinsic mean under the embedding. On the other hand, data analysis on size-and-shape reflection-similarity manifolds are important in virtual reconstructions of proteins and of various configurations of bone structures in humans. Another focus of the project is on certain special spaces which are not manifolds, but are spaces with manifold stratification, and which arise in many applications, e.g., in geometric representations of phylogenetic trees. Apart from the landmarks based shape analysis as described above, continuous shapes such as given by boundary contours in 2D will be investigated as elements of infinite dimemsional (Hilbert) manifolds. Finally, proposed nonparametric Bayesian procedures for density estimation, regression and classification on shape manifolds will be a significant point of departure from nonparametric inference based so far primarily on Fre'chet means and dispersions. Together these projects aim at providing comprehensive robust procedures for shapes which are of wide applicability in many fields of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital images today play a vital role in science and technology, in intelligence gathering and defense, and in many aspects of everyday life. The present proposal seeks to advance the analysis of digital camera images via the statistical study of shapes and other non-Euclidean objects. Nonparametric statistical methods developed by the PIs and others over the past twelve years have had a significant impact on statistical inference for 3D scene recognition from regular digital cameras, on medical diagnostics, and on many other forms of image analysis. The proposal aims not only to consolidate this theory. The objective is also to develop new methodologies for machine vision and robotics, for dynamic scene recognition, for medical diagnostics from CT scans for planning reconstructive surgery for the severely injured, and for the detection of elusive health impairments from DNA sequences via shape configurations of proteins.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main objective of this award as far as this PI is concerned was achieved with the publication in 2015 of the first textbook on Object Data Analysis, the most inclusive type of statistical analysis as far as the spaces where the data is represented are concerned. This book titled Nonparametric Statistics on Manifolds with Applications to Object Data Analysis was coauthored with Leif Elingson for Texas Tech, a former student of the PI, and was designed to give acess to Big Data Analysis of Complex Type to a larger audience.&nbsp; The book, a unitary view on Big Data of Complex type, has four parts: one of seven chapters: Electonic Shape and Imaging Data Examples, nonparametric multivariate Statistical methods, geometry and topology with an emphasis of examples of axial spaces, shape spaces, and spaces of diffusion tensors, consitency of Frechet moments, nonparametric distributions for Frechet sample means, inference for two sample means on manifolds and function estimation on manifolds. The second part develops the asymptotic methodology for object data analysis in more details on homogeneous Hadamard manifolds,&nbsp; Stiefel manifolds, projective spaces, Hilbert manifolds, spaces of congruences of finite configurations of labeled points, similarity shape spaces and Grassmannians. The third part offers conrete examples of applications of difusion tensor imaging, directional data analysis, similarity of planar contours, estimation of mean size and shapes of skulls, affine shape and linear shapes case studies, projective shape analysis of planar contours, 3D projective shape analysis from bilateral digital camera imaging outputs, two sample tests for mean projective shapes, mean glaucomatous shape change detection and density estimation on manifolds. Part four includes additional current topics in Object Data Analysis: persistence homology and further directions in Statistics on Manifolds.&nbsp; Most of these types of data analysis are in the large area of image analysis, including medical imaging, therefore being of large interest to the public at large, even if they come in the more technical language, being adapted to imaging outputs in more advanced electronic devices. An important component of the award was educational. Five graduate students at Florida State University successfully graduated with doctoral degrees, having their research supported by this award: Daniel Osborne (2012), Mingfei Qiu (2015), Kouadio Yao (2016), David Lester (2017) and Ruite Guo(2017). Due to the concerted efforts of the PI, his students and collaborators, all but one of the original projected problems were solved, and the unanswered problem proved to be intractable, due to certain counter examples. In addition, due to a continued award component additional new results of importance were added to the project outcomes. These include MANOVA on manifolds, with applications to 3D face analysis, two sample tests for 3D mean projective shapes of contours, detection of glaucomatous shape change from 3D reconstructed eye fundus images, central limit theorems of extrinsic antimeans and extrinsic energy statistics based methods for&nbsp; distributions on high dimensional object spaces,&nbsp; with applications to comparisons of distributions of means of shapes of contours of midsections in corpus callosum of normal vs ADHD diagnosed individuals.</p> <p>The outcomes helped advance a futuristic, nevertheless realistic view of Statistics where<strong> n</strong><span><strong></strong><span class="text-with-line-breaks"><span class="Linkify"><span>umbers  are moving to the back burner, and leave their place to  objects, that are represented for simplicity as points on complete  metric space.
