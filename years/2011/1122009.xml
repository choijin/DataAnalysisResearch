<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This FASEB conference will be held in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, on July 24-29, 2011. The 2011 Conference on Genetic Recombination and Chromosome Rearrangements will be the fourteenth in a series of highly successful bi-annual conferences devoted to these topics. Genetic recombination plays a key role in molding genome structure in all living organisms and is required to maintain genome integrity. The global objective of the conference is to bring together workers at the forefront of all aspects of genetic recombination to present new results and to promote discussion between researchers using different techniques and experimental systems. In the program for the 2011 conference, every effort is being made to balance organismal systems, homologous/specialized recombination, and mechanistic/biological studies. The organizers have recruited eight leaders in the field to chair the sessions; the session chairs, in consultation with the organizers, have invited outstanding speakers representing diverse approaches and experimental systems. This conference aims to join approximately 200 investigators studying many diverse aspects of genetic recombination, in a range of biological systems and with different experimental approaches. Presentations will introduce new and unpublished work on timely questions in the field and will include discussion from all participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;Every effort has been made to include female and junior investigators as invited speakers; in addition, several slots will be allocated to talks selected from abstracts with the expectation these will be given to junior investigators. Four of eight session chairs are women and about 30% of speakers on the preliminary program are women.</AbstractNarration>

The Steamboat Grand Resort site has been used since the 1995 meeting and has been chosen as the site for the 2011 conference by the participants of the 2007 meeting because it can accommodate up to 190 participants and is easily accessible for most participants. The 2011 FASEB Summer Conference on Genetic Recombination and Genome Rearrangements will continue the tradition of gathering workers who are at the forefront of all aspects of genetic recombination. The program for the 2011 conference is being made to balance organismal systems, homologous/specialized recombination, and mechanistic/biological studies. This inclusive approach distinguishes the FASEB meeting from the more specialized conferences such as the Gordon Conferences, which is devoted to one or two sub-fields, and from the broader conferences such as the Keystone Conferences on Replication, Repair and Recombination, which gives important aspects of recombination only token exposure. The FASEB conference is the only meeting with in depth treatment of genomic rearrangements. By emphasizing truly exceptional research, the FASEB conference provides unique opportunities for the exchange of information and technology that can be appreciated and exploited across the recombination field.&nbsp; The FASEB conference is a popular one; the meeting has been filled to capacity almost every year since its inception. The only other meeting that focuses exclusively on recombination is the bi-annual EMBO Workshop on Recombination, which alternates yearly with the FASEB meeting and was last held in May 2008. The EMBO workshop is a smaller meeting than the FASEB meeting (about 150 participants) and was most recently held at the Il Ciocco conference center near Pisa, Italy.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The FASEB conference is a popular one, both for those established and those new to the field. Of the first 44 people invited to the conference, only three have declined to participate. We continue the tradition of the FASEB conferences in inviting new speakers, especially young investigators, who have not previously participated in the conference. Approximately 1/5 of the invited speakers have not previously participated, and of the platform presentations to be invited from abstracts we anticipate inviting two or three more new investigators.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are at least two kinds of scientific gatherings that merit consideration.
