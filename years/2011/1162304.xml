<AbstractNarration>The 2012 Maurice Auslander International Conference will be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole Massachusetts, USA on April 25-30, 2012, and the 2013 conference is also planned for April. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maurice Auslander was an influential mathematician at Brandeis University, widely known for his creation, together with Idun Reiten, of Auslander-Reiten theory. In the twenty first century, Auslander's work has become even more popular with the many fields that are applying and using this theory; particularly important is the fact that the cluster theory of Zelevinsky and Fomin, which is connected to so many different fields, is also intimately related to the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. The proposed Maurice Auslander International Conference plans to bring together mathematicians from representation theory and related areas of combinatorics, invariant theory, non-commutative algebra, commutative algebra, homological algebra, etc. With support from the National Science Foundation, this successful yearly event will expand its participation, extend support to more graduate students and be extended to six days. There will be expository and research lectures about such topics as generalized cluster categories, including those related to surfaces, Poisson structures and their relation to cluster algebras, Brauer-Severi variety of Sklyanin algebras, universal deformation rings, quiver Grassmannians, Calabi-Yau algebras, Christoffel words and Markov numbers, Hopf algebra actions, twisted Plucker coordinates and combinatorial perfect matchings, higher Auslander algebras, MV polytopes and Nakajima quiver varieties. Many breakthrough have been presented at this conference, for example a proof of the well-known Strong No Loop Conjecture was presented for the first time in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Maurice Auslander International Conference is intended to be a center of activity for this area of algebra in the United States. The conference will be a combination workshop/conference/student presentation event. Each day of the conference will start with an expository lecture by known international experts in various fields of algebra. This will be followed by at least one student presentation explaining results related to their PhD theses. The rest of the lectures will be traditional conference talks. The goal of the expository talks and student talks is to make current research in algebra accessible to graduate students and postdocs and to give beginning researchers a platform to display their achievements. We also want to introduce international leaders in our field to the young talent that we have in the US. The intent is that our young researchers will become better known in the world and will make outside contacts. Also, there is a strategic national goal that will be furthered. The US is already the leading country in many areas of mathematical research. However, it is lagging in new branches of algebra which are being developed largely in other countries. The proposed conference will help to reverse this trend. We will make these current topics more accessible and more popular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2012 conference will be held April 25-30, 2012, and the 2013 conference is also planned for April.

In 2013, the work of Jeanne Scott on cluster structures on Grassmannians was mentioned several times and, on the last day of the conference, she gave a beautiful talk about Postnikov Diagrams which illustrate these structures. In 2012, Jeremy Russell, then a PhD student at Northeastern University, presented his work on "A functorial approach to linkage." This is a new approach to a classical construction in algebra. Ivo Herzog of Ohio State University was very impressed and invited Jeremy to come to visit him.
