<AbstractNarration>Urban areas emit the vast majority of anthropogenic CO2, but most efforts to study terrestrial and atmospheric carbon dynamics avoid areas influenced by urbanization. Urban areas are growing in spatial extent and the ecology of cities is becoming ever more germane to people?s lives and the development of carbon mitigation strategies. This research will improve understanding of how urbanization affects ecosystem characteristics and productivity across the Boston urban-to-rural gradient, and develop a framework for analysis of urban impacts on ecosystems, by (1) quantifying how ecosystem productivity changes across an urban-to-rural gradient and developing a clear empirical foundation for productivity estimation; (2) mapping historical and current patterns of land-cover change to determine trajectories of development and the carbon consequences of increasing urban lands; and (3) developing new methods to scale the results of this work from the plot and pixel level to the entire region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the pressing need for science to inform the development of policies that enhance core ecosystem services (e.g., air and water purification, carbon and nitrogen sequestration, food and energy production) while supporting a growing and increasingly urban human population. This work includes the development of a new science education curriculum, collaborations with the City of Boston, and will support undergraduate and graduate student research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Urbanization has radically transformed our planet and our ecosystems.  The objective of this CAREER award was to explore how urban development modifies the structure and productivity of ecosystems across urban to rural gradients.  With over two dozen publications resulting from this award, our results support the central hypothesis that urban trees are more productive on a per tree basis than their rural counterparts.  We found that urban ecosystems grow 2-3 times faster, respire CO2 2-3 times faster, and plant mortality rates are several times higher; overall, the cycling of carbon is accelerated in urban ecosystems.  Rural forests are not reliable analogs for estimating urban biogenic carbon fluxes. Through this award we also explored contributions of vegetation to urban heat islands, impacts of urban air quality on vegetation, urban soil characteristics and limitations, and we considered biological flows of carbon in the context of anthropogenic emissions.  Distinct urban growing conditions suggest that our understanding of forest ecology in rural areas is necessary, but not sufficient, to assess the role of vegetation in the carbon cycle. This work contributed to the development of both statistical and process-based model of biological carbon fluxes within cities.  Cities are currently at the epicenter of sustainability efforts, but our fundamental understanding of the science underlying nature-based solutions needs rigor and transparency to ensure truly sustainable pathways.
