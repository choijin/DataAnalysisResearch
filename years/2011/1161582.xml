<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes several research projects related to the local Langlands correspondence, and in particular to the modular representation theory of general linear groups over p-adic fields.  One goal of these projects is to address the question of extending the local Langlands correspondence to a correspondence that works on the level of families of Galois representations.  This builds on previous work of the PI and Matthew Emerton that has had applications to the Langlands program for global fields; in particular it plays a role in Emerton's proof of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture and is likely to be important for generalizations of this result.  A long term goal of the project is essentially a "local theory of congruences" for automorphic representations of general linear groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has its roots in the Langlands program, a series of far-reaching conjectures that connect topics in harmonic analysis and representation theory to long-standing problems in number theory.  The Langlands program is expect to shed light on questions in theoretical physics, and also has implications for the theory of elliptic curves. &lt;br/&gt;Advances in elliptic curves in particular could have considerable practical applications in cryptography and coding theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "The local Langlands correspondence in l-adic families" was concerned with the "geometry of algebra" --- the development of geometric intuitions and tools to organize and further our understanding of fundamental pheonmena in algebra and number theory. The guiding paradigm for the subject is the Langlands correspondence, a profound bridge between number theory and function theory through an identification of the hidden symmetries underlying both fields. The Langlands program has seen many triumphs in recent years, most notably the proof of Fermat's last theorem.  The primary intellectual focus of the project was understanding how the fundamental objects involved in the Langlands correspondence (both arithmetic and those involving special functions) can vary continuously, depending on external parameters, adding a new layer of structure to the program which should clarify its fundamental meaning. The intellectual merit was the results of David Helm on Langlands correspondence in families, in particular the detailed understanding of the integral Bernstein center, a new geometric object he introduced and which he and others have used for progress on assorted problems in number theory.   The broader impact of the grant consisted promarily in the support of Ph.D. students in the area, in particular Gil Moss, who earned his doctorate in Spring 2015 through important advances in the area thanks in part to this grant, and will be continuing these studies independently in the future.
