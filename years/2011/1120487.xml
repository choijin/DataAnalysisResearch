<AbstractNarration>Habitat conversion and accelerated climate change pose an unprecedented threat to montane regions, leading to increased concern for biodiversity in these areas. Given their narrow thermal niches, tropical montane amphibians and reptiles are particularly vulnerable to environmental change. Investigating the mechanisms responsible for diversification and species persistence in mountains is therefore imperative. This project will study 15 species of lizards and glassfrogs in the Brazilian Atlantic forest to test the hypothesis that topographic complexity and climatic stability are responsible for diversification and population persistence in montane regions. The project combines inventories in 13 poorly-studied sites, climate-based models of species distributions, molecular studies afforded by DNA sequencing, and physiological assays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the processes that underlie endemism in tropical mountains will advance studies of biodiversity patterns and contribute to biodiversity prediction worldwide. Field and laboratory data will enable reassessments of species boundaries, identifying new species and morphologically cryptic lineages. Physiological data will directly inform conservation of taxa under risk of climate-related extinction. This project will provide educational and research opportunities for three undergraduates per year, one graduate student, and one postdoctoral associate in a minority-serving urban campus, significantly increasing exposure of underrepresented and underprivileged students to trans-disciplinary, collaborative, field-based work.</AbstractNarration>

We established two new large-scale sequencing&nbsp;platforms to document the geographic distribution of genome-level variability in&nbsp;5 genera of lizards (Fig. 2). We deployed sensors of temperature and precipitation throughout the mountains to develop precise, habitat-scale descriptors of the local environments experienced by the fauna. These measurements are compared to retrievals from remote-sensing satellites and will guide the creation of a platform to provide accurate descriptors of micro-climatic conditions throughout the American tropics. We also converted readily available data from NASA&rsquo;s satellite missions into descriptions of local temperature ranges, which we used to model de distribution of local species (Fig.3; descriptors are publically available for download). We developed models of the distribution of the Atlantic Forest in the past, using simulations of climate going back 120,000 years. We then identified areas of the forest that have been stable climatically, and those that have been changing rapidly (Fig. 4; models and simulations publicly available). Finally, we developed physiological essays with&nbsp;4 lizard genera to test how their distributions correlate with environmental tolerances.</span></p> <p><span>The project resulted so far in 19 peer-reviewed publications, with over 300 citations. Several new species&nbsp;of frogs have been uncovered through our field; eight have been described (Fig. 5). Our sequencing analysis uncovered and described a high degree of genetic endemism throughout the montane forests (that is, many within-species unique genealogical lineages are restricted to small areas). We also found high levels of climate stability over time in the mountains. Yet, differently from what is observed in the lowland forests, we discovered that the endemism of genetic lineages, in the montane regions,&nbsp;is not&nbsp;predicted well by forest stability. Instead, contemporary climatic conditions are their main predictors. Advancing on the characterization of environments, we found that our remote sensing-based descriptors of local temperature improve distribution models of several Atlantic forest species. The results also demonstrate that remote-sensing products perform better than weather-station based estimates at predicting temperature throughout the various forest microclimates sampled through sensors &ndash; and better correlate with physiological responses by the forest animals.</span></p> <p><span>The project positively impacted the academic careers of 17 US-based students and 7 students in Brazil. At CUNY, it provided support, research training opportunities and mentoring to 4 Biology Ph.D students (2 women), 2 postdocs, 5 female MSc.&nbsp;Students (4 under-represented minorities, all of which joined the project as undergraduates) and 4 additional undergraduates. All students presented their results in local, regional or international meetings, resulting in ca. 70 conference presentations. Six students are already co-authors on publications that emerged from this project. The grant also provided direct research opportunities&nbsp;and mentoring to 2 postdocs and 5 graduate students&nbsp;from Brazilian institutions. Six of them spent time in the US while working on collaborative analyses and manuscripts with CUNY students. The PI also co-advised 2 M.Sc. students in the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences department at CUNY.</span></p> <p><span>The project also had a comprehensive outreach component.
