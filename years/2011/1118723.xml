<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Roger Revelle, a 273? general purpose Global vessel; the R/V Melville, a 279?general purpose Global vessel; the R/V New Horizon, a 170?, general purpose, Intermediate vessel and the R/V Sproul, a 125? general purpose Regional vessel. All four vessels are operated by Scripps Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The request includes five items listed by priority:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1) Shipboard Network Upgrades&lt;br/&gt; 2) MicroK-100 Termperature Bridge&lt;br/&gt;3) TrackLink 5000 USBL&lt;br/&gt;4) Lowered ADCP (2 systems)&lt;br/&gt;5) Pumps for AA-III AutoAnalyser (3)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
