<AbstractNarration>The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in developing techniques to understand formation of instabilities for abstract and concrete nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems. This includes the classical 3 body problem from celestial mechanics, which in particular describes the 3 body problem modeling the Sun-Jupiter-Asteroid system. So far mathematical description of instabilities for these and many other nearly integrable systems is limited. On the contrary stability for large measure of initial conditions is described by the famous KAM theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the project is analysis of the stability of motion of complex mechanical systems over long periods of time, focusing on the motion of planets. The behavior of such complex systems can be seen either as regular, as in the motion of planets, or chaotic, as in the motion of a hurricane. We shall analyze the interplay between regular and chaotic behavior to determine the length of stability of various systems, including the complicated three-body problem in classical mechanics, which involves determining the motion of three celestial bodies moving under no influence other than that of their mutual gravitation. Knowledge of instabilities of this system is fairly limited. The object is to develop techniques to investigate the stability time of these systems. The project will also involve graduate student training. Students will become expert celestial mechanics and will have first-hand experience in working on classical problems using relatively new mathematical tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are many examples of nearly integrable systems describing motions of various evolution systems such as the Solar system, Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chains, accelerators, geodesic flows on tori close to the flat tori or on surfaces close to surfaces of revolution, etc. Existence of instabilities in this setting is an old and famous problem of Arnold. We managed to solve this problem in several important settings: for convex nearly integrable systems in low dimension. We also managed to give a solution of weak Quasiergodic Hypothesis in low dimension for a class of nearly integrable systems by constructing an orbit dense in a set of almost maximal measure on the energy surface.  In somewhat parallel direction for the three body problem in the regime of so-called Kirkwood gaps we construct solutions exhibiting considerable instabilities in the form of eccentricities changing by a magnitude of order of one.  In another direcion we proved finiteness of the number of central configurations for the four and five body problem, which is one of Smale's problems for the next century.  At the same time we exhibit difficulties in solving this problem for six bodies or more.   We also studied billiards in convex domains, where the massless particle moves with constant velocity and reflects with the law that angle of incidence equals to the angle of reflection. We prove that near the circle the only domain with integrable dynamics is an ellipse. This is a solution to a weak form of Birkhoff conjecture.
