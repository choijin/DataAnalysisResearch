<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Georgia that will provide research training for 9 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. The program focuses on the population biology of infectious diseases - the sciences that aim collectively to understand the mechanisms by which existing and emerging pathogens spread, evolve, and respond to environmental pressures. It is now widely perceived that meeting the future challenges of infectious diseases will require an increasing emphasis on inter-disciplinary training and collaboration and the quantitative synthesis of ideas and data through modeling. A central goal of our program is to provide students with research experiences and educational opportunities at the intersections of the quantitative sciences (applied mathematics, statistics, computer science) and empirical disciplines of infectious disease biology. Students will be paired with faculty research mentors in 12 departments from across the UGA campus, and will conduct projects focused on the ecological, evolutionary or immunological interactions of hosts and pathogens.  Students are selected on the basis of academic preparedness, previous experiences, future goals, and supporting letters of reference and to ensure a balance between modeling and experimental projects within each cohort of students. Students will be recruited through a combination of print, digital, and direct means including a collaboration with the Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority participation (http://www.pslsamp.uga.edu/) and campus visits to a network of supporting institutions.  Undergraduate students from any institution and major subject of study are invited to apply. Applications from students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and/or majoring in biology, computer science, ecology, mathematics, and statistics are especially encouraged. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://reu.ecology.uga.edu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. John Drake at jdrake@uga.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Infectious diseases present one of the greatest public health challenges of modern times, and advancing the understanding of infectious diseases will require training a new generation of researchers across a diversity of disciplines including genetics, ecology, veterinary medicine, mathematics and computer science. Facing the dual challenges of raising the quantitative and computational literacy of the next generation of biologists, along with increasing the understanding of biology among students of mathematics and computer science, we developed the REU Site: Population Biology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Georgia.  From 2013-2016, this award provided funding for 39 student research experiences.  Participating students represented a wide variety of majors, both biology- and life science- related, and computer science and mathematics-related,  including  Biology, Mathematics, Wildlife and Fisheries, Chemistry, Environmental Health Sciences, Microbiology, and Sociology, among others.  Each student worked in the lab of a participating faculty member to design, perform, and present a research project.  Projects represented a mix of lab-based empirical studies and theoretical modeling.  Results of all projects were presented at a poster symposium at the end of each summer. In addition, projects from our program have so-far resulted in 11 peer-reviewed publications and 41 presentations.   All students were introduced to the use of programming for biology in a series of four half-day computational workshops.  In addition, students participated in activities related to research ethics, applying to graduate school, non-academic career choices, and professional development and recreational field trips.   The intellectual merit of this program lies in the diversity of research topics from which students were able to choose, the activities that introduce students to both empirical and quantitative techniques, and our ability to provide training in molecular, ecological, and computational approaches to complex issues in host-pathogen dynamics.  As a training program, the primary broader impact of this program is a well-equipped, quantitatively informed scientific workforce. The students trained by this program will better understand the advantages of collaborative research and will be better prepared for careers in infectious disease biology.  At least 29 of our student participants have attended, are attending, or have applied to graduate or professional school.  Three are currently employed in science and math education, and four are employed in the biomedical field.  In addition, our program has endeavored to enlarge participation in research by under-represented demographic groups. Through established collaborations with HBCUs and other organizations, we recruited a significant portion of participants from groups underrepresented in the sciences, including women, minorities, and students from colleges with few research opportunities.

Lastly, this program provided administrative support to a coalition of REU sites at UGA, improving the campus-wide portfolio of undergraduate experiential learning initiatives.
