<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary of Award and Outcomes  The PostDoctoral Research Fellowship grant DMS-1103765 was very successful in both funding successful research in the original proposed topic area and in giving the PI access to the perfect environment at NYU to continue his training and make successful advances in several other fields. Due to these successes, the PI now holds a tenure-track Assistant Professorship at the University of Maryland, College Park, a top-10 US research department in the PI's field of expertise.  The proposed topic of the grant was the study of a certain class of mathematical models which posses "critical mass", that is, where the behavior predicted by the model changes dramatically from one type to another if a certain quantity is above a special threshold. The class of models studied by the PI over the course of the grant mostly arise in mathematical biology for the collective motion of micro-organisms. The existing mathematical theory focused mainly on a few important representative models, however, these special models do not share the same behavior as some more accurate physical models. The PI worked to expand our mathematical understanding of the wider class of models, often by rigorously proving certain limit behaviors of the more complicated models reduced back to simpler models. This required the development and refinement of numerous mathematical tools. The research papers published or in review which are related to this topic and partially supported by this grant are  J.
