<AbstractNarration>The Ithaca College (IC) Robert Noyce Scholarship Program is preparing 18 candidates to teach in high-need school districts primarily in central New York, New York City, and Washington, D.C. and supporting these scholars through their first four years of teaching. Scholars engage in the ongoing integration of research and education that are hallmarks of the mathematics and physics programs at Ithaca College, while also being mentored as teachers and scholars. Paid summer internships at the Ithaca Sciencenter and at the Newfield Recreation Summer Camps provide scholars the opportunity to engage in educational enrichment with K-12 students. During the academic year, scholars participate in on-campus tutoring, teaching assistant opportunities, field experiences at the Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem and in Washington, DC schools, and national mathematics or physics teaching conferences. Scholars complete the Ithaca College M.A.T. program and continue to be mentored during their first four years of teaching in a high-need school district by participating in summer workshops, working with project staff during periodic site visits, attending professional conferences, and participating in an online social network created in support of this project. Early engagement through "linking" courses make the connection between college-level STEM knowledge and secondary teaching explicit, thereby strengthening the scholars' content and pedagogical knowledge while providing first steps into the world of teaching. Summer internships provide further opportunities for Noyce scholars to engage in educational activities with students. Participation in early field experiences, engagement in education research, and mentoring by the project staff provide scholars with a strong foundation for developing their pedagogical and discipline-specific knowledge. In the senior year, scholars continue their training by tutoring high school students in the Advancement Via Individual Determination program and teaching their peers through on-campus teaching assistantships. Scholars also participate in regional and national education conferences and site visits to high-need schools, further engaging them in authentic teaching-related experiences. Mentoring and professional engagement continue throughout the 13 month M.A.T. program. The various cohorts of scholars interact in a summer workshop on the Ithaca College campus, with pre-service scholars learning from in-service scholars.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1">The Ithaca College Robert Noyce Scholarship Program was established through the Scholarship &amp; Stipends Track as an effort to address the critical need for talented Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics teachers in high-need school districts. The objectives were to prepare eighteen mathematics and physics teaching candidates to teach in high-need school districts primarily in New York State, and support these scholars through their first few years of teaching. Scholars completed the Ithaca College Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program, and were mentored during their first few years of teaching in a high-need school district by participating in summer workshops, working with project staff during periodic site visits, attending professional conferences, and participating in an online social network created in support of this project. The project exceeded the goal of recruiting eighteen scholars by recruiting 38 scholars; 34 of whom have or are on track to complete their teaching requirement. In the six years prior to the grant activities Ithaca College only graduate 14 science teachers compared to 39 during the grant activity (note that not all science teaching graduates were Noyce scholars). Through our grant activities we expanded recruitment from just physics and mathematics to include agricultural science, biology, chemistry, childhood education, and earth science as the infrastructure was changed to support inclusion of these programs. The agricultural science and earth science certification programs and three new pedagogical courses were created to better support our efforts. We also formed articulation agreements with Cornell University, Rochester Institute of Technology, and SUNY Cobleskill, who don&rsquo;t have teacher certification options, to simplify their graduates&rsquo; acceptance into our MAT teacher certification program. In addition to our student-centered, inquiry approach of our MAT program we added additional focus on professional development by creating a summer Noyce workshop, attending Noyce regional and national meetings, and attending the Science Teachers Association and Mathematics Teachers Association of New York State annual conferences. Of the 38 scholars only two did not enter the K-12 teaching profession (one became a college instructor), two are teaching, but not in high-needs school districts, and only two have left the teaching profession after completing their teaching requirement. We have given six conference presentations and have one published article describing our project successes. On-going evaluation is looking at the positive impacts our scholars are having on their students&rsquo; academic success. We are also looking at what factors led to our highly successful recruitment and retention of our scholars in the teaching profession.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/18/2018<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;Rogers</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
