<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by Professor Michael Maroney at the University of Massachusetts to carry out fundamental studies of the mechanism of superoxide disproportionation catalyzed by nickel-dependent superoxide dismutase, an enzyme found in bacteria.  Nickel superoxide dismutases (NiSODs) represent a novel approach to the elimination of superoxide in biological systems, and thus contribute to the biodiversity of mechanisms for oxygen detoxification.  Other nickel metalloenzymes play critical roles in microbial redox catalysis, including hydrogen utilization (hydrogenases), methane production (methylcoenzyme M reductase), and CO/CO2 chemistry (carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and acetylcoenzyme A synthase), and are thus important catalysts in energy science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of NiSOD will contribute to our understanding of redox catalysis by biological nickel sites via examination the only redox nickel enzyme characterized to date that contains no other cofactors, and thus offers a clear spectroscopic view of the chemistry involved.  These studies, which use a multidisciplinary approach involving molecular biological and spectroscopic techniques, will contribute to our knowledge of the design of redox centers for catalysis that will contribute to synthetic systems for hydrogen production/utilization and CO2 reduction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Superoxide is a radical with chemistry that gives rise to the formation of hydroxyl radical (OH&bull;, a molecule that reacts rapidly with biological molecules, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, causing their degradation.  Some superoxide is produced naturally, such as inadvertently in mitochondria during respiration, and some is produced in other ways, e.g., by air pollution, smoking, etc., leading ultimately to aging and a number of diseases. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are enzymes that serve nearly all organisms as a first line of defense from oxidative stress by catalyzing the disproportionation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen (Equation), thus preventing the buildup of superoxide and  2 O2-  + 2H+   &rarr;   H2O2  +  O2   the formation of hydroxyl radical.  All SODs contain a redox-active metal, and there are several types of SODs based on their metal content. During catalysis, the redox metal center oscillates between two redox states separated by one-electron to catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide (the so-called æping-pongÆ mechanism). The optimum redox potential for catalyzing this reaction is about 300 mV, and so it is no surprise that Nature employs the Cu(II/I), Fe(III/II) and Mn(III/II) redox couples to catalyze this reaction, since each of these metals will catalyze the reaction in aqueous solution without the protein.  With respect to the desired redox catalysis, the role of the protein in these cases thus becomes optimizing the potential of the metal center midway between the oxidation and reduction of superoxide at ~300 mV.  The much more recently discovered nickel-dependent SOD (NiSOD) is unusual in that it employs a metal that has no redox chemistry in aqueous media, and therefore must depend on the protein to create a new redox center.  This center employs a novel biological nickel complex that is bound to the protein by four ligands in the Ni(II) oxidation state, the N-terminal amine, a backbone amide, and two thiolate S-donors from cysteine residue (see figure), and adds an apical imidazole ligand from His1 in the Ni(III) oxidation state.  The use of S-donor ligands is unprecedented in SODs, and unexpected because of their reactivity with peroxide, oxygen and superoxide. However, the use of multiple thiolates is an emerging trend in the biochemistry of nickel that produces a redox active center that is accessible at biologically relevant potentials.  Thus, the overarching questions addressed by the project are: 1) How does Nature promote the redox chemistry of nickel?  And, 2) how are the thiolates protected from oxidation by the reactants and products?  These questions were addressed using an approach that used structure-function correlation and employed a number of biochemical and biophysical techniques.  Intellectual Merit: The study of NiSOD has contributed to our understanding of redox catalysis by biological nickel sites via examination of the only redox active nickel enzyme characterized to date that contains no other cofactors, and thus offers a clear view of the chemistry involved. This was accomplished by systematically altering the nickel ligands and assessing the affect of the alteration on the structure and function of the enzyme. The main achievement from this grant was the alteration of the protein backbone amidate ligand to a secondary amine, an alteration that has not previously been achieved.  This required the development of new and rather elaborate synthetic methodology that is broadly applicable to other metalloenzymes that feature the unusual coordination of backbone amides. The effect was more subtle than we imagined.  There is an almost undetectable alteration in the structure of the enzyme, and a subtle change in the electronic structure of the nickel center.  Nonetheless, this alteration yields a variant with only 1% of the catalytic activity of the wild-type enzyme. In addition, we showed that the apical His1 imidazole ligand is not required ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
