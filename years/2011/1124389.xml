<AbstractNarration>The metabolic activity of microorganisms dominates the biogeochemical evolution of the Earth over geologic time.  One of the fundamental questions facing scientists seeking to understand global biogeochemistry is: What is the relationship between microbial community composition (who¡¦s there?), metabolic activity (what are they doing?), and ambient environmental conditions (e.g., pH, sulfate levels) (how are they impacted?). Sulfur cycling, particularly the coupling between sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation, is one of the dominant geochemical pathways driving carbon mineralization within many diverse microbial ecosystems today. Isotopic and mineralogical evidence recovered from ancient rocks suggest biological sulfate reduction played an important role on early Earth as well.  In attempt to better understand this globally important process and the corresponding biosignatures of active sulfur cycling microorganisms, we are proposing a multi-disciplinary, high-resolution geochemical and molecular biological investigation of closely coupled microbial sulfur cycling in three representative microbial ecosystems. These include a 3-4 member synergistic anoxygenic phototrophic consortium, moderately diverse chemosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing mats, and highly complex benthic oxygenic photosynthetic microbial mats. These systems differ in terms of biological complexity and in the major sulfur cycling pathways, that collectively will provide fundamental information regarding light-dependent and -independent sulfur metabolisms.  Our work combines analyses at high spatial (?Ým-scale) resolution of sulfur and carbon isotopic data using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and FISH-nanoSIMS, microvoltammetic sulfur species measurements, and CARD-FISH molecular imaging to investigate the linkage among microbial spatial organization, metabolic activity, and establishment of geochemical gradients by coupled sulfur cycling communities. Together, the data from this combined laboratory and field study will develop a new toolset that can be used to study tightly coupled sulfur cycling on an unprecedented scale within microbially dominated sedimentary environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will inform scientists about the fundamental chemistry and biology governing sulfur in the environment, past and present.  This is important because sulfur plays a critical role in processes controlling not only how we view the evolution of life on this planet, but also about ore deposits as sources of metal resources, oil and gas formation and their economic recovery, soil nutrient availability affecting crop yields and the quality of water resources, and the transport of many contaminants in ground and surface waters.  Additionally this project will help train the next generation of scientists with the scientific and technical knowledge to work in high tech and scientific industry, research, and education fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Today, the metabolic activity of single-celled microorganisms, despite their small size, plays a major role in regulating global biogeochemical cycling, impacting nutrient availability, ocean and atmospheric chemistry, and climate.  Early in EarthÆs history, the role of microbial ecosystems is likely to have been of even more importance.  Despite many decades of investigation, there are still many unanswered questions regarding microbial community organization and metabolism in a range of microbially dominated environments. Sulfur cycling, particularly the coupling between two important metabolisms (sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation), is one of the dominant geochemical pathways within many diverse microbial ecosystems, the oxidative side of which is catalyzed through a number of distinct pathways, including photosynthetic and chemosynthetic microbes, as well as abiotic mechanisms.   In this study, we used a multi-disciplinary, micro-scale approach, coupling geochemical and molecular biological investigation of closely coupled sulfur cycling in three distinctive, globally relevant microbial systems, which differ both in terms of their biological complexity and in the major sulfur cycling pathways, in an effort to resolve the mechanisms and possible biosignatures variations associated with biological sulfate-reduction coupled to various oxidative processes (i.e., anoxygenic and oxygenic biological oxidation and abiotic sulfide oxidation). The resulting research highlighted the value of the approach pursued here &ndash; measuring geochemical signatures at the micron spatial scale, which is most relevant to investigating the chemical conditions that drive (and in turn are impacted by) the metabolic activity of individual microbes.  The goals of this multi-disciplinary project centered on improving our understanding of microbial mat ecosystems and their associated metabolic activity through microscale geochemical and molecular investigations. We specifically investigated the spatial structure of microbial community organization and the role of environmental conditions and ambient chemistry in regulating both the types metabolic activity present in these environments and the specific rates of metabolic activity. In a series of papers focusing on carbon and sulfur cycling in these systems, we were able to gain significant insights into the spatial organization of different metabolisms in microbial ecosystems, including both carbon fixation (Houghton et al. 2014) and sulfur cycling (Wilbanks et al. 2014) pathways.   One key outcome with regards to microbial sulfur cycling is the persistent existence of particular stable isotopic signatures, based on metabolism-specific preferences for different kinds of sulfur (e.g., 32S or 34S, sulfur atoms which contain the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus).  These isotope æbiosignaturesÆ allow us to infer the spatial distribution and importance of different sulfur cycling metabolisms.  In microbial systems, we found a minimum in the isotopic differences between two sulfur species (sulfate and hydrogen sulfide) at the interface between oxic environments and anoxic (lacking oxygen) environments (Wilbanks et al. 2014). This suggests minimal activity of a particular metabolism known as sulfur disproportionation, which has been previously invoked as a key tracer of the increase in oxygen in the ocean-atmosphere system over Earth history (based on sulfur isotope measurements).  Instead, we infer that disproportionation was not a key metabolism driving the large-scale isotopic patterns in sulfur cycling associated with increasing oxygen levels.  Instead, these isotope signatures most likely reflect changes in organic matter availability (and carbon cycling) associated with increasingly oxic environments &ndash; interpretations supported by recent laboratory experiments of sulfate-reducing bacteria.
