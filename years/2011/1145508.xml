<AbstractNarration>Parasite life cycle complexity, which encompasses both host species and number of hosts in the life cycle, is one of the most fundamental and intriguing components of parasite ecology and evolution.  However, because there remains a significant amount of undescribed parasite biodiversity, little is known about the evolutionary patterns or consequences of changes in life cycle complexity.  This study aims to use morphological and molecular data to discover new species in the trematode (fluke) genus Alloglossidium.  What makes this genus fascinating is that among known species there is variation in the number of hosts needed to complete the life cycle (2 or 3) and variation in the use of final host species (crayfishes, catfishes, leeches).  Thus, this project will also use the genus Alloglossidium as an exemplary model to test evolutionary hypotheses about the origins of different life cycles and test for relationships between life cycle changes and morphological changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is scientifically important because it will contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of life cycle complexity in parasites of animals.  Such knowledge is necessary to provide key insights into infectious disease transmission and the potential for parasites to infect new host species.  Broader impacts include research and educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in important areas such as parasitology, taxonomy, and molecular phylogenetics.  Undergraduates will be recruited from the Texas A&amp;M Regents Scholars (low income, first generation students) program and Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. To facilitate outreach to a broader audience such as K-12 educators, a web-based field guide will provide free educational resources and natural history facts on the parasites and host organisms in this study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Parasite life cycle complexity includes both host species and number of hosts needed to complete all developmental stages of a parasite.  Because many unrelated parasite species have independently evolved a complex life cycle, complex life cycles are regarded as a major adaptive peak for parasitism.  As such, life cycle complexity is one of the most fundamental components for understanding the ecology and evolution of parasites including those that infect humans.  However, because there remains a significant amount of undescribed parasite biodiversity, little is known about the evolutionary patterns or consequences of changes in life cycle complexity.  Our study had two research goals.  The first was to discover and describe the biodiversity in the digenean trematode genus Alloglossidium. What makes this genus fascinating is that among known species there is variation in the number of hosts needed to complete the life cycle (2 or 3) and variation in the use of final host species (crayfishes, catfishes, leeches).  The second goal was to elucidate the relationships among these species in order determine how many times changes in life cycles occurred.  Overall, we accomplished our goals in terms of the intellectual merit contributions to the scientific community as well as contributing to society by having the broader impacts of training students in a STEM field.  Including main project goals as well as related side projects, there were a total of 11 publications, with 3 more to come, that resulted from our studies.  Particular findings included the discovery of 5 new species in the genus as well as the elucidation of new natural history data for species in the genus.  One significant study showed how a life cycle change that resulted in forced self-mating of a hermaphroditic parasite resulted in subsequent evolutionary changes in the reproductive organs of the parasite (see associated figure).  In another study, construction of the relationships among the species in the genus reveled that there were at least three independent evolutionary events where the parasites truncated their life cycle from a 3-host to a 2-host life cycle.  Hence, parasites can be resilient to changes in their life cycle even when losing a host that is typically required for the parasite to complete its normal development.  Our studies contribute to our baseline knowledge of biodiversity and to understanding the patterns and consequences to changes in parasite life cycle complexity.  The latter knowledge is especially important as it provides key insights into infectious disease transmission and the potential for parasites to infect new host species.      Broader impact results included research and educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in important areas such as parasitology, taxonomy, and molecular phylogenetics.  Students were involved in all stages of the project including extensive field work to collect samples, collection of genetic data to infer relationships among species, and dissemination of results (publications and presentations at scientific meetings).  Students also participated in outreach events at K-12 schools to educate others on the fascinating biology of parasites.  One of the female graduate students that had a primary role in the project has since obtained a tenure-track Assistant Professor position.  Hence, this project directly contributed to the addition of a female to the STEM workforce.  Moreover, this project enabled the direct involvement of 8 undergraduate students including a military veteran and 2 minority students.  Two of these undergraduates have gone on to Masters programs in the biological sciences while the others have entered the general workforce (including health-related fields) with a well-rounded scientific background and critical thinking skills.
