<AbstractNarration>The Zaparo Documentation Project (ZRDP) will bring together remaining speakers of Zaparo, a linguistic isolate spoken in the Ecuador. There are three last speakers of this under-documented language who are in their nineties and in frail health. The outcomes of this project are pivotal to understanding the typological features which characterize the Zaparo language family. The project records conversational interactions and oral narratives from which a corpus will be constructed with interlinearalized transcriptions. The project will be valuable to researchers and to community members as the final products include the central corpus (in video and audio formats), a Zaparo-Spanish-Quichua Dictionary and a Zaparo primer.</AbstractNarration>

Through this NSF grant, intensive fieldwork and data analysis were conducted in Ecuador with five of the remaining speakers of Sapara (Zaparo, ISO code: ZRO) by the project team, in two phases: between December 25, 2010 and January 21, 2011; and between May 23, 2011 and July 25, 2011.

The ZRDP has made a contribution in various domains.  * Documentary Linguistics: The ZRDP has increased knowledge of both the Sapara (Zaparo) language and the Zaparoan family more generally.   * Historical Linguistics: Our documentation project has increased knowledge regarding the family-internal relations among the four languages of the Zaparoan family for which there exist data: Andoa, Arabela, Iquito, and Sapara.  * Other disciplines: The ZRDP is a cross-disciplinary project by design; it was designed to address a set of interests shared by the ethnoarcheaologist and linguists who are its core participants -- interests in the intersection of linguistic form, language use, cultural forms, social networks, and historical processes. Because of our attention to this set of interests as they are manifest in language, we anticipate that the outcomes of the ZRDP will benefit anthropologists, cultural geographers, historians, and any other specialists in related fields who are interested in the language, culture and/or history of the Sapara people.  * Resources for Research and Education: The data set produced by the ZRDP is being archived and disseminated, in both paper and electronic forms, as appropriate, so that other researchers and other interested parties, both in the US and elsewhere, will be able to use our results to further their own research and educational projects outside the ZR...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
