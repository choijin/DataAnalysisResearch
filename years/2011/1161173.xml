<AbstractNarration>This mathematics research project deals with the restriction of infinite dimensional unitary representations of a semisimple Lie group G to a semisimple subgroup H and applications to automorphic forms. The project  also concerns the restriction of the underlying Harish Chandra-modules and their globalizations. The restrictions of unitary representations are not yet well understood and in particular understanding the restriction of the HarishChandra-modules is still in its infancy. So examples play a major role. Speh and her collaborators will also study the restriction of the HarishChandra-modules of the rank one orthogonal groups and to work out the restriction of complementary series representations, which are of particular analytic interest. These restriction problems have applications to automorphic forms and the cohomology of arithmetic groups, which Speh will also investigate; in particular she is interested in generalized modular symbols and period integrals defined by symmetric subgroups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics research project in the area of group representation theory deals in a fundamental way with the understanding of the symmetries of a space, such as the symmetries of an atom or the rotations of a sphere. Symmetries have important applications to several disciplines such as robotics and civil engineering.  In robotics, the symmetries of the ``configuration space" are important and are limiting factors in the controllability of the arms of a robot. The stability of the impressive domes over some large buildings, such as sport stadiums, is due in part to the domes' symmetries. As part of this project, Speh will organize an interdisciplinary conference that will bring together senior and junior researchers from several disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The philosophy of analysis and synthesis asks for theunderstanding of the smallest objects and how things are built upfrom these objects.  Considerations of symmetries are important mathematics, in physics and also in some parts of computer science and electrical engineering as weel as in robotics. In this research we considered a ''group" of symmetries, for example the group consisting of all the symmetries of a ball.   We can consider a group G of  symmetries also as the symmetries  of a different more abstract objects. For example we may consider this group  as the "symmetries" of an elementary particle or a physical system. In mathematical language we say that we have a representation of the group G.  Of particular interest in physics are the representations of the "Lorentz group" which related to special relativity.  The restriction of a representation of group G to a smaller group H   is not yet well understood and many related problems are still unsolved. The PI analyzed  the restriction of representations of the Lorentz group  to  a smaller Lorentz group. For certain interesting representations she obtained very precise laws describing this restriction. This allows a much better understanding of the representation of the Lorentz group and how they are built up out of representations of the smaller groups.  These results are of interest in physics as well as in mathematics, in particular to number theory.   The PI expects that this will greatly stimulate the research in this area, The articles supported by this NSF grant already received numerous citations.
