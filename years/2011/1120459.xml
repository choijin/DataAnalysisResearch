<AbstractNarration>The objective is to broaden participation in the Geosciences by increasing the number of African-American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic or Latino, females, and first generation college students.  Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Sciences Program exposes the students to the atmospheric and related sciences.  The program will give underrepresented students experience in atmospheric research during a ten-week summer research internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research or at laboratories of other SOARS sponsors. There is a strong, formal mentoring program and a vibrant learning community support for all protégés.  A technical writing workshop is also part of the summer program to help students to write scientific proposals</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>SOARS&reg; (Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science) is a mentoring and research internship program headquartered at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, with the goal to increase the number of African-American or Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Hispanic or Latino, female, veterans, first generation college students, and students with disabilities who enroll and succeed in graduate school in the atmospheric and related sciences. SOARS also encourages students who have experienced, and worked to overcome, educational or economic disadvantage and/or have personal or family circumstances that may complicate their continued progress in research careers. SOARS welcomes lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students. SOARS&rsquo; mission contributes to national goals of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally engaged workforce of scientists and engineers.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> SOARS seeks to foster the next generation of leaders in the atmospheric and related sciences by helping students develop investigative expertise complemented by leadership and communication skills. SOARS combines multiple summer research experiences with intensive, multidimensional mentoring and a robust learning community to help undergraduate students complete college and make successful transitions into graduate school.</p> <p>SOARS has been widely recognized through formal and informal assessments as a highly successful program. At the heart of SOARS is an eleven-week summer program in which prot&eacute;g&eacute;s conduct genuine research at NCAR or at laboratories of other SOARS sponsors. SOARS offers opportunities for up to four summers of research, funding for undergraduate and graduate school, and funding for conference travel for prot&eacute;g&eacute;s to present their research. Over the 21 years of SOARS existence, SOARS participants, called prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, have presented more than 400 scientific posters and talks at national and international conferences, and written 29 peer-reviewed papers about their research.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> During the 6 years of grant 1120459, SOARS supported underrepresented students in conducting 119 undergraduate and graduate student summer projects, including 75 funded fully or partially by this award. These students were supported in performing research in the atmospheric and related sciences, prepared for successful graduate careers, and encouraged to integrate their graduate research with projects at NCAR and other national laboratories. Over 90% of the students funded by this award transferred into a graduate program on completion of their undergraduate degree. The award also allowed SOARS to provide ongoing support to the 199 prot&eacute;g&eacute;s who have participated in the program since it began in 1996. Significant numbers of the minority students graduating with degrees in the atmospheric sciences have come through the SOARS program, and are now committed to leadership and mentoring as they move into careers. After graduation, SOARS alumni are succeeding in careers in STEM that span academia, government, industry and the non-profit sectors, contributing to our mission to build a diverse and competitive STEM workforce.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/22/2017<br>      Modified by: Rebecca&nbsp;Batchelor</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1120459/1120459_10117830_1513974389036_Alumni--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1120459/1120459_10117830_1513974389036_Alumni--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Alumni"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1120459/1120459_10117830_1513974389036_Alumni--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Alumni"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SOARS protégés and alumni during the SOARS 20th Anniversary Symposium, summer 2016.
