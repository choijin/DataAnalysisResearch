<AbstractNarration>For the past decade, the University of Texas--Pan American has sponsored the Hispanic Engineering, Science and Technology (HESTEC) Week to promote STEM careers to students in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, a predominantly Hispanic area of the United States and to reach out to the community at large.  With National Science Foundation support, HESTEC will partner with two NSF-funded Science and Technology Centers to provide professional development for teachers (Educator Day), hands-on science activities for middle school students (Middle School Challenge), and science shows and experiment stations for the entire community (Community Day).  NSF support will permit students and staff from the Colorado State University Center for Multiscale Modeling of Atmospheric Processes (CMMAP) to bring its Little Shop of Physics to HESTEC, where the hand-on science activities will reach some 30-70 educators, up to 4000 middle school students, and thousands of community visitors. UT-PA undergraduates will work directly with CMMAP staff to operate the demonstrations and to engage the HESTEC participants. In addition, representatives from the Center for Coastal Margin Observation and Prediction (CMOP) at Oregon State University will provide a professional development workshop for middle and high school teachers as part of the HESTEC Educators Day.  The Little Shop of Physics was awarded the Robert A. Millikan Medal by the American Associate of Physics Teachers in 2001.  The program has reached 250,000 students in schools throughout the Colorado region and will now have a prominent place at HESTEC.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ HESTEC, a week long event, addresses an important issue in preparing tomorrowÆs STEM workforce regionally and nationally. The weekÆs activities have a profound effect on the level of knowledge, interest, and participation in STEM education and careers in the Rio South Texas region, a region of the country plagued by high unemployment and low educational attainment by its residents.  The University of Texas-Pan American, the congressman, and South Texas school districts have launched this program in an effort to help reduce the high school drop-out rate and help the communities better prepare the future workforce.     As documented in the HESTEC 2010 Impact Report, HESTEC has played an important role in raising studentsÆ awareness and interest in engineering, science, technology and math. Feedback also shows that students, parents and educators valued the resources that were available during the week and that they profited by the many networking opportunities. Perhaps most important is the encouragement and inspiration that students, parents and administrators take away from HESTEC. Presenters are role models who tell the stories of their career successes in spite of obstacles in their lives, and demonstrate that others can achieve at he similar accomplishments.     HESTEC provides an excellent model of best practices and lessons learned concerning broadening participation among minority populations, encouraging and motivating students to pursue higher learning and successful careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).

The CMAPP Little Shop of Physics exhibit was relocated to a larger venue for HESTEC Community Day on Saturday, October 1, 2011, a free, family educational event that attracts thousands of people from throughout the region, with the purpose of promoting STEM to the community at-large.
