<AbstractNarration>Production of primary marine aerosol at the ocean surface is a major process in the earth?s climate system, with important implications for the physicochemical evolution of the troposphere and feedbacks on upper ocean biogeochemistry. Newly formed marine aerosol are number-dominated by sub-Ã¬m diameter, hygroscopic, organic-rich particles that scatter solar radiation and serve as condensation nuclei. Photolysis of the associated marine-derived organic matter (OM) produces reactive oxygen species and other oxidized species. The nature, magnitude, and consequences of the production and evolution of marine aerosol are highly uncertain, precluding development of a reliable predictive capability for associated influences on tropospheric chemistry, upper ocean biogeochemistry, and climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address some of these uncertainties, an interdisciplinary research team from the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, the University of Virginia, and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography will participate on a multidisciplinary research cruise from the US to Bermuda in the summer of 2012 to study fluxes of marine aerosols as a function of seawater characteristics.  In particular they will characterize size- and composition-resolved marine aerosols by comparison of measurements made with their own custom-designed UVA aerosol generator with parallel measurements with the NOAA SeaSweep aerosol generator and eddy covariance techniques.  Comparative studies will be carried out at two or three optically distinct stations with seawater characteristics that are compositionally distinct.  These results will also be compared with similar data already in-hand to yield a more thorough synthesis and to serve as the basis for developing numerical models of the aerosol transport system.  An important outcome of this project will be a thorough characterization of the aerosol material generated by the UVA instrument for future aerosol work at sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Results of the proposed research are expected to advance further study of the influences of the surface ocean on the size-resolved organic and inorganic composition and flux of nascent and ambient marine aerosol, and the related influences of these aerosol in the multiphase chemical and physical evolution of the marine boundary layer, surface ocean biogeochemistry, and Earth's radiation balance.  The project will also provide for the training and support of one or more graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Primary marine aerosol (PMA) is injected into the atmosphere when bubbles produced by wind waves burst at the ocean surface.  Bulk PMA is highly enriched (typically by factors of 102 to 103) in organic matter (OM) relative to near-surface seawater.  This production pathway is the single largest source of aerosol mass and a major source of aerosol number and particulate OM in the atmosphere thereby significantly impacting the physical and chemical evolution of the atmosphere, climate, and associated feedbacks on the surface ocean.  However, many aspects of PMA production and cycling are highly uncertain, which constrains our understanding of and ability to reliably simulate major processes in the Earth system.  During a research cruise of the NOAA R/V Ronald H. Brown, we investigated the chemical and physical properties of PMA produced within a high-capacity marine aerosol generator via aeration of biologically productive and biologically impoverished (oligotrophic) waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean.  Results yielded several imporant findings.   First, the enrichments of OM associated with freshly produced PMA were the same in biologically productive (high chlorophyll-a) and oligotrophic (low chlorophyll-a) waters.  This finding challenges the widely held view that PMA OM originates from recent biological activity in sunlit surface waters, an assumption that has been promulgated in the literature based on weak correlations between chlorophyll-a concentrations in surface seawater and corresponding particulate OM concentrations in ambient air sampled downwind of marine algal blooms.   Second, number production fluxes of PMA from biologically productive waters varied systematically over 24-hour cycles, with high production fluxes during the day and lower fluxes at night.  No such variability was observed in PMA production from oligotrophic waters.  This surprising and unexpected finding suggests that OM produced by a sunlight-mediated biological or chemical process drives enhanced PMA production from biologically productive waters.  Lower production fluxes at night suggest that the reservoir of OM produced during daytime was depleted following sunset.  Third, the OM that modulated PMA production in biologically productive waters during the daytime could be rapidly (minutes) removed via bubble scavenging, which revealed the influence of a large background reservoir of surface-active OM that sustained PMA number production fluxes that were indistinguishable from those in oligotrophic waters.  Based on this finding, we hypothesize that the background OM consists of what is known as refractory dissolved organic carbon (RDOC).  This RDOC comprises more than 95% of oceanic carbon and is one of the largest reservoirs of organic carbon in the biosphere.  RDOC is uniformly distributed with depth throughout the oceans and has an average lifetime of about 16,000 years.   To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment to determine if RDOC includes surface-active OM that could be emitted to the atmosphere  in association with PMA via bubble bursting.  North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), in which RDOC accounts for virtually all OM, was sampled from a depth of 2505 m.  Bubble surface tension measured in NADW was within the range of that in near-surface waters and demonstrated unequivocally that RDOC includes surface-active OM.  In addition, PMA number production fluxes from aeration of NADW and the associated OM enrichments were similar to those from oligotrophic waters and from biologically productive waters at night.  These results support the hypothesis that PMA generation by bursting bubbles at the sea surface is an important mechanism by which RDOC is injected into the atmosphere.  Under the highly oxidizing conditions in the atmosphere, RDOC is expected to undergo extensive degradation over the lifetime of the aerosol yielding volatile inorganic and short-lived organic products.  Therefore, this process is a potentially import...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
