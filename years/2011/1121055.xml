<AbstractNarration>Fruits play a central role in agriculture since they are the harvested product for many crop species. A detailed understanding of the major genes that control fruit development is likely to lead to important agricultural applications that will dramatically increase crop yield, such as increasing the number of seeds per fruit, enlarging the fruit, allowing fruit growth in the absence of fertilization, and controlling seed loss and dispersal. Arabidopsis has become the model organism of choice for plant biologists worldwide, and our previous studies identified the major genes that control fruit development in Arabidopsis. Recently, a new type of gene, microRNAs have been shown to have a major impact on the regulation of gene activity in plants and animals. These microRNA genes have not previously been studied in terms of their roles during fruit development. Our proposal aims to uncover the critical roles that these microRNA genes play in the control of fruit development. The project will provide advanced training for a postdoctoral scholar and undergraduate researchers will also be directly involved. The project will participate in an ongoing program with the vision of increasing the number of under represented groups at every level of the scientific enterprise. Throughout the project, fellowships will allow students from diverse San Diego and Los Angeles high schools to participate in intensive and extended programs aimed at recruiting them to science careers and aiding in retention. Thus, the project will impact human resource development, understanding of central problems in plant science and will also be applicable to a wide range of agricultural applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As science strives to find ways to meet the challenge of feeding an ever-increasing global population, basic research in plant biology, such as the NSF-sponsored research we have been conducting, can provide the necessary tools to increase agricultural outputs.  Fruits play a central role in agriculture since they are the harvested product for many plant species and they give rise to the generation of seeds.  While fruit size, shape, and method of seed dispersal vary markedly in different species, their molecular determinants in all flowering plants are likely share common features. Like many researchers around the world, we have taken advantage of the small flowering plant called Arabidopsis because it provides a model system for exploring the genes that control fruit development.  By providing a detailed understanding of the gene regulatory interactions that control fruit development in Arabidopsis we will be better able to make specific improvements in plants of agricultural importance.  Our research has addressed two fundamental questions, namely, how is the size of the fruit determined and what are the underlying mechanisms that control the activity of genes that regulate fruit development?     For many years, our lab has exploited the model system of Arabidopsis to identify the major regulatory genes that control fruit development.  Many of these genes encode proteins that function as transcription factors, meaning that these transcription factors turn other genes on and off to regulate fruit formation.  Our NSF-funded studies allowed us to construct a general model for the transcription factor interactions that underlie fruit formation.  In our most recent NSF-funded studies, we have taken this field one major step further forward.  Layered onto the network of transcription factor interactions, we have now added the role of so-called microRNAs.  These more recently discovered small RNAs play a major role in controlling the activity of genes in plants and animals.  Our studies showed that one specific microRNA gene called MIR172C is responsible for controlling the activity of a transcription factor called APETEALA2.  This regulatory interaction is essential for controlling the growth of the fruit and it is likely that a similar interaction is involved in the control of fruit growth in diverse plant species.  Our studies went on to identify the factors that are responsible for turning on the expression of the MIR172C gene.  Interestingly, although microRNAs have been shown in recent years to regulate the activity of target genes in plants as well as animals, relatively little is known about how these microRNA genes themselves can switched on and off.  Our studies therefore provided a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms of microRNA gene regulation.     Our NSF-sponsored research has allowed us to create genetic and genomic resources that we have disseminated to leading researchers around the world, thus facilitating the international effort to improve agricultural outputs.  In addition to the major research accomplishments, our NSF-funded research has also provided excellent training opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows, and the resources created by this research have been incorporated into laboratory courses and outreach efforts, allowing for example, the participation by high school students in state-of-the-art research.
