<AbstractNarration>The Student Mentoring to Achieve Retention: Triads in Science program (SMARTS) at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) has as its primary goals to encourage more underrepresented and financially disadvantaged students to persist as science majors, complete their degrees in a timely manner, enhance their interest in pursuing advanced degrees, and provide them with the tools necessary to become skilled scientists and educators, so that they are able to compete effectively in the global academic and technical workforce. To realize these goals, the program uses an innovative approach that involves the formation of mentoring teams consisting of one faculty member, one graduate student and one undergraduate student (junior or senior level), who form a mentoring triad. The program has three main objectives: 1) achieve full retention of talented but financially disadvantaged undergraduate students (juniors and seniors) majoring in the sciences, while significantly reducing their time to graduation; 2) increase the number of undergraduates, particularly members of underrepresented minorities, who elect and are well-prepared to pursue advanced degrees in the sciences; and 3) recruit more graduate students to become educators and research mentors in the sciences.  Through the triad approach, undergraduates learn to work effectively in teams and learn from practitioners what to expect in future years. Graduate students hone their team-building and mentoring skills, which is valuable as they pursue educational, leadership and managerial roles in STEM fields. The program also enriches the professional training of graduate students through several of the program workshops.</AbstractNarration>

Expected outcome: 80% of all undergraduates served by the SMARTS program will 1a) remain in the sciences and 1b) graduate in 5 years or less.  Achieved outcome:  21 undergraduate students participated in the program. Four left the program for different reasons: Accepted into a program with better benefits (1); Did not qualify for financial aid any more (1); Changed to a non-STEM major (1); Changed to a STEM related major that did not fall into the proposed ones (1) 20 out of the 21 (95%) undergraduate fellows remained in the sciences  19 graduated with Bachelor?s degree: 18 with STEM degrees and one with a STEM related degree (nursing).  One student left the sciences and one student is still enrolled as an undergraduate in a STEM program. All 19 who graduated did it in 5 years or less.     Objective 2:   Increase the number of undergraduate students, particularly members of underrepresented minorities, who elect and are well prepared to pursue advanced degrees in the sciences. Expected outcome: 50% of all undergraduates served by the SMARTS program will elect to pursue advanced degrees in the sciences.  Achieved outcome:    Of the 19 fellows who graduated,  13 are pursuing advanced degrees: 12        in STEM (63%) and 1 an MBA;   3 are pursuing additional research        experience (post-back programs): 2 to gain entry into graduate programs,        and 1 to gain entry into  medical        school;  2 have unknown whereabouts and  1 is working as a nurse (see bullet        below)   Of the 4 who left the program,   the 2 that remained in STEM are        pursuing graduate degrees in STEM; the 1 that switched to nursing is        working as a nurse; the 1 that switched to a non-STEM        major is still enrolled.      Objective 3:  Recruit more graduate students interested in and train them to become educators and research mentors in the sciences. Expected outcome: 50% of all graduate students served by the SMARTS program will elect to become educators and research mentors in the sciences.  Achieved outcome:  All 17 (100%) graduate fellows were retained in their respective science majors Of the 17 graduate fellows,    11 (65%) completed degrees (7 Master?s and 4 Doctoral); 2 of the Master?s degree recipients continued on to pursue doctoral degrees (still enrolled);  4 are still enrolled (1 in the Master?s program and 3 in doctoral programs).  Only 1 doctoral student left the university before graduating due to spouse re-location.        All participants who were doctoral recipients are       currently in post-doctoral positions            Last Modified: 11/10/2016       Submitted by: Lourdes E Echegoyen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
