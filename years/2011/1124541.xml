<AbstractNarration>This research investigates the relationship between institutions (e.g., formal laws and community norms) and compliance in the context of organic farming in the United States. The project focuses on how policy designs and individual and socially derived motivations such as attitudes, social norms and habits, and individual capacity influence decision making regarding compliance. The case study is organic farming, the fastest growing food industry over the past decade in the United States. The organic farming industry faces growing pains as it seeks to provide and maintain a standardized certification process that instills consumer confidence and protects the integrity of its processes for the benefit of human health.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The study applies the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework, and the Institutional Grammar Tool to analyze organic farming policies, including organic crop and livestock/dairy farm certifications, comparatively across six states. The investigators use data gathered from interviews and questionnaires given to organic farmers and regulators to compare policy designs with actual behaviors as well as to principles of organic farming as identified by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements. The investigators compare compliance in organic farms in six states to fish farms in three states previously studied by the investigators. This study will contribute to understanding how to strengthen the alignment between policy designs and actual behaviors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined organic food regulation under the United States Department of AgricultureÆs (USDA) National Organic Program (NOP).  The projectÆs central findings are reported here according to the projectÆs 4 studies:  Analysis of organic food legislation and regulation.     Results from an in-depth analysis of the United State Department of AgricultureÆs (USDA) National Organic Program (NOP) regulation.  These results describe the NOP regulation policy design as a quasi-voluntary third-party policy design: it is æquasi voluntaryÆ as operations are only subject to NOP regulations if they choose to market their products as æorganic,Æ and it is æthird-partyÆ as administration of NOP regulations is delegated to independent (third-party) certification organizations.  The results suggest: (a) the NOP regulation details specific actions to be carried out in the production and regulation of organic foods, while placing little emphasis on desired outcomes; (b) the NOP regulation emphasizes conflict resolution mechanisms over enforcing sanctions; and, (c) there may be barriers to adaptive policy change over time in the NOP. Results from a comparative analysis of the 1990 Organic Foods Production Act and the USDAÆs NOP regulation suggest that both policies are structured by relatively robust policy designs, and that relatively minor policy divergence (changes in policy design) seem to have resulted in the rule-making process that translated the Act into USDA regulations.  The identified divergences include: (a) although the Act calls for periodic residue testing (e.g.: for banned pesticides) the NOP regulation does not, (b) the NOP has failed to implement a peer-review panel to advise NOP operations, called for by both the Act and the NOP regulation.    Organic certifier study  NOP strengths/weaknesses:  (a) All survey respondents agree the NOP is necessary to maintain consistency in organic food production (strength); (b)  According to results, some feel the NOP does not address the concerns of organic producers (weakness);  (c) 92% believe their organizationÆs goals either "Completely align" or "Mostly align" with the goals of the NOP (strength);  (d) A small percentage of respondents (16%) helped develop the initial design of the NOP; today, a larger percentage of respondents (68%) regularly communicates with the NOP to discuss the regulation. Certifier challenges in administering the NOP regulations:  (a) Most organizations manage a website to disseminate information and provide resources to certified operations about the NOP regulation; (b) Paying accreditation fees and preparing for the USDA audit are the most difficult accreditation tasks for certification organizations; (c) Most certification organizations perceive inflexibility in interpreting mandated accreditation tasks;  (d) The biggest implementation challenge for certifiers is waiting for clarification on questions posed to the NOP.   Organic inspector study  Inspector backgrounds: Of the inspectors surveyed, 63% are contract organic inspectors for one or more certifier(s) and 61% have worked for no more than two certifiers in the past year.  Of these certifiers, 72% are non-governmental. Certifier oversight of inspectors:  The majority of inspectors agree that their certifier "closely" tracks their inspection activities.  Close to 65% claim that certifiers do not frequently accompany them on inspections.  77% of inspectors agree that their certifier enforces ethical standards on inspection practices. The resources upon which inspectors rely:  The majority of inspectors always consult the federal regulations and information provided by the certifier.  A strong majority (80%) always rely on personal expertise and more than 40% of inspectors usually rely on informal guidelines such as "rules of thumb" during an inspection. How inspectors perceive their role:  A majority (66%), of inspectors consider themselves regulatory monitors for the NOP, and employees and repres...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
