<AbstractNarration>The project advances the state-of-the-art of autonomous Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, and maximizes the ability to explore under extreme conditions with minimal time using real-time 3D methods in nuclear power plants.  The integrated system consists of a hardware system with three LIDAR's, a CPU, a GPU, a battery and a wireless unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state-of-the-art in nuclear power plant disaster mitigation is a direct consequence, as well as the development of more advanced and robust SLAM techniques that are applicable in all domains.</AbstractNarration>
