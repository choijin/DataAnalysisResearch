<AbstractNarration>Computer networks, in particular the Internet, represent critical infrastructure for business, government, military, and personal communication. Several recent trends in technology and network use have pushed the capabilities required of the Internet beyond what can be provided by the currently deployed infrastructure. This project develops a new architectural design for the Internet of the near future that represents a transformative shift to enable sustained innovation in the core of the network, using economic principles. The core idea of this new network architecture is to support choice as the central aspect of the architecture. A network built on these principles will be able to adapt to emerging solutions for current and future challenges. The network architecture designed and prototyped in this work aims to (1) encourage alternatives to allow users to choose from a range of services, (2) let users vote with their wallet to reward superior and innovative services, (3) provide the mechanisms to stay informed on available alternatives and their performances. Solutions are approached from different directions, reflecting the team's multidisciplinary expertise in computer networking, network systems, management science, and network economics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project contributes to enhancing the functionality and usability of the next-generation Internet, which is expected to become an important piece of infrastructure. The project also integrates research and education of graduate and undergraduate students at the participating organizations, where current efforts to integrate underrepresented minorities are continued. Results from this work are disseminated in the form of an open-source prototype and publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ChoiceNet project has been exploring ways in which economics can be integrated into the design of future internet architectures.  Historically, functionality has been added to the Internet by deploying new services at the edges of the network.  This has been a highly successful approach.  However, the heart of the network - the network layer that provides connectivity between end systems &ndash; has changed little over the years, limiting our ability to offer new services inside the network.  In other words, the current Internet architecture does not lend itself to improvements at the network layer.  One of the reasons is the lack of economic incentives for internet service providers to invent and deploy new services inside the network.   To address this problem, the ChoiceNet project has been exploring ways for innovative providers to be compensated for deploying enhanced functionality inside the network.  To support this type of innovation, we designed and integrated an economy plane into the network architecture, which enables customers to compensate any internet service provider for offering new services - as opposed to the current Internet where customers pay their local internet service provider. We also developed a marketplace where providers can advertise their new services and customers can discover services that meet their needs.  When customers communicate with service providers, customers include some form of consideration or payment to compensate providers for performing the service.  We showed that various types of consideration are possible depending on the customer-provider relationship. Consideration can take the form of a direct payment, bank transfer. In other cases the consideration may contain proof of group membership, where being a member of the group is sufficient "payment" for the provider to perform the service.  In cases where the service is offered for free, the consideration may be empty or be a value representing no payment.   In the project we defined multiple architectural elements and interactions between them, which then served as a foundation for developing the programming interfaces between them. At RENCI we concentrated on the authorization mechanisms needed to support ChoiceNet architecture.  To demonstrate the utility of ChoiceNet, we designed and implemented (together with our ChoiceNet colleagues at UMass Amherst, University of Kentucky and NC State University) prototypes demonstrating various aspects of ChoiceNet. Our prototypes demonstrated the basic features of ChoiceNet through example services. At RENCI we concentrated on the development of path computation algorithms operating in a Software-Defined Networking multi-provider environment. We developed a rigorous mathematical problem formulation and developed prototypes of several efficient solutions.    Because the ChoiceNet architecture supports choice, competition, and compensation, it has the potential to facilitate the development of novel network applications and services that are not possible in the current Internet.  Application developers from all disciplines have the potential to benefit from the new innovative services deployed at the network layer.  While it is difficult to predict the types of new applications and services that will be developed, it is clear that ChoiceNet services have the potential to benefit applications in all areas of society.  Results from our work have been disseminated in the form publications in high-quality, peer-reviewed conferences and journals.
