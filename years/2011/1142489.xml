<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to incorporate antimicrobial properties into the materials of a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane module, providing constant protection from bacterial attachment.  Bacterial growth on the surface of RO membranes is a significant problem for the membrane industry, due to both increased energy consumption due to back pressure and cleaning costs.  Also, current methods used to remove bacterial growth from membranes lead to additional problems, such as chemical oxidation and damage to the membrane material while minimally impacting bio-film formation.  We propose to design and manufacture an organo-selenium bio-composite spacer, which will constantly inhibit bacterial attachment to the RO membrane.  This is possible because organo-selenium continuously produces superoxide radicals, which targets bacterial cells with no negative effect upon the surrounding water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are that the chemical and labor costs for the maintenance of the membranes with organo-selenium will be reduced since the need to take a membrane module offline for cleaning will be reduced or eliminated. In addition, this will also reduce energy requirements to pump the water through the membrane.  This is important for the food, water and wastewater reclamation (ie desalinization), health care, and the electronic industries, as many of these sectors employ membrane separation techniques during commercial operation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The collaborative partnership between Selenium, Ltd ,  Texas Tech University, and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, proposed and executed a plan to evaluate the effects of organo-selenium additives upon reverse osmosis (RO) membrane spacers to prevent biofouling and determine the effects on micropollutants.  This work included preparing the additive, incorporating the additive, preparing spacers, then testing the efficacy of the antimicrobial additive, and finally determining the effects upon micropollutants.  Simultaneously, market leaders were contacted to determine interest and gain insight into product specifications of a successful new antimicrobial feed spacer.Our final report documents the successful application of a novel antimicrobial technology using an organo-selenium compound for RO spacers that does not leach, is catalytic , safe, inexpensive  and scalable.  Our results demonstrate the organo-selenium compounds can be incorporated at the point of manufacture of resin or thermal processing.  A potential Phase II project would elevate the product to a master batch material based on market feedback.             Our team verified there is strong market interest and the market is willing to fund development projects in this space- indicating a real problem significant to the industry Our business team performed market diligence and the interest supports a Phase II project.  In summary, the market is very excited about the possibility, wants to see long term effects in situ.  Proof of concept from phase I works, but better integration through master batching in Phase II will improve consistency of materials, and integrate directly with preferred manufacturing processes.
