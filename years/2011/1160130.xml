<AbstractNarration>PI: Fischer, Kenneth J.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1160130&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary: Biomechanical Rehabilitation Engineering Advancement in Kansas &lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the Biomechanical Rehabilitation Engineering Advancement in Kansas (BREAK) program is to give Kansans with disabilities a BREAK and offer custom devices to improve their quality of life. Additional objectives are to educate students about the needs of those with disabilities, and offer them a real world, service learning, design experience to address those needs. Projects will focus on rehabilitation technology, assistive devices and recreational opportunities within with the engineering Capstone Design experience. Each year we expect to facilitate 3-5 rehabilitation engineering design projects as part of the BREAK program &lt;br/&gt;The BREAK program will be a multidisciplinary collaboration between engineering capstone programs in three departments at KU and a consortium of community organizations that will help identify and propose projects. The program will provide custom equipment to benefit organization rehabilitation programs (and their many clients) or to meet the needs of individuals. While projects will often address the needs of individuals, the design process will include universal design, whenever possible, so that developments are more likely to be commercialized. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit Summary: BREAK program will contribute towards discovery and innovation in rehabilitation and assistive devices of a broad nature, and will lead to advancement in fundamental engineering knowledge in some cases. The program will also serve as a model for multidisciplinary engineering education while inspiring and training students in the engineering of designs for assistive and rehabilitation technology. Each student project addressed a unique need for technology, and seeks to meet that need (which is not satisfied by existing commercial products). In the process of conducting the research, design, fabrication and testing work, students develop a variety of skills, including technical, project management, and communication skills. They will gain experience interfacing with clinical personnel and their client throughout the semester. Invention disclosure will be required of all projects funded through the program. All students will be required to attend symposia on commercialization, including topic such as licensing vs. entrepreneurship, business planning, and marketing. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Summary: The BREAK program will provide visibility KU engineering students of the needs of people living with disabilities. Even those students who do not choose to participate in the BREAK program will be exposed to the concepts and needs of those with disabilities. Students should receive great satisfaction at having immediately met a need in someone's life, as well as creating technology which may be commercialized. We expect the BREAK program will encourage students to consider employment in rehabilitation engineering. &lt;br/&gt;Promotion of the BREAK program to prospective high school students may help increase participation in STEM disciplines. Recruiters can promote the BREAK program webpage, especially for women (who historically gravitated to bioengineering applications) and minorities. &lt;br/&gt;We are certain the BREAK program will increase the quality of capstone design experiences. The project also will help students build their multidisciplinary teamwork skills, as they work among engineering students from different engineering disciplines. Some students will also have the opportunity and learning experience of presenting their design at a national conference. &lt;br/&gt;Not the least of the broader impacts is that individuals in Kansas will be served by providing needed technology to improve their quality of life! Further, we expect many of these innovations will be marketable and commercializable, thus benefiting thousands more individuals and providing an enduring benefit to society. If possible, commercialization may include new start-up businesses in Kansas, thus stimulating the Kansas economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through the NSF-funded Biomechanical Rehabilitation Engineering Advancement in Kansas program, 65 students have been exposed to people with disabilities and their abilities.  These have been mentored in the design of assistive and rehabilitation devices.  These students have produced multiple successful devices and systems to aid individuals with their personal independence, to provide recreational opportunities for people with disabilities and to provide and/or improve opportunities for employment of people with disabilities.  The impact on students is very obvious, especially for those who were able to provide an excellent product that changes the lives of people with disabilities.  All the students appeared to become emotionally invested in trying to help these people with disabilities.  Examples of particularly successful personal and recreational projects include the accessible children?s train car for the Spirit of Wamego children?s train (which has free admission to all comers).  Wamego is a charming Kansas town with a number of tourist attractions and several annual festivals that draw many people to the community.  Now people who have difficulty boarding a standard children?s train car can still enjoy the Spirit of Wamego train in the wheelchair accessible train car (Photo 1).  In addition, a young lady with quadrilateral congenital amputations (no arms below the elbow or legs below the knee) was provided with a custom designed piano pedal pusher, to allow her to use the pedal while playing the piano (Photo 2).  This device has made her piano music much more smooth and flowing. The ability to use the piano pedal has inspired her to play the piano even more and she enjoys it even more than before.  Examples of particularly successful projects to enable/enhance employment opportunities include the bagging buddy fixture to allow people with only use of one hand to complete fulfillment/bagging tasks (Photo 3).  This relatively simple frame device with magnetic clips allows employees at Cottonwood Industries of Lawrence, KS (a protected shop for people with disabilities) to bag large items, like military loading straps, in large bags though the central opening and smaller items by clipping smaller bags to the sides of the fixture.  Several people were immediately able to perform tasks they could not do before or could perform those tasks with much better speed and efficiency.  Similarly, the bins/hoppers and new workstations designed for Multi-Community Diversified Services (MDCS) in McPherson, KS (another protected shop for people with disabilities) improved the ease, speed, and efficiency of disabled workers in their packaging/fulfillment tasks (Photo 4).  These workstations and their new arrangement also make it easier for other staff to provide parts supply to each workstation.
