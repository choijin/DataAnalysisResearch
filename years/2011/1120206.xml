<AbstractNarration>One of the wonders of nature is how a single cell can develop into a multicellular animal with the form and function characteristic of the species.  Animal development is remarkably reproducible even when environmental conditions fluctuate, suggesting that fitness depends on mechanisms that buffer development from variation.  The Baugh Lab at Duke University seeks to understand the physiological mechanisms that result in such developmental homeostasis.  The lab investigates how nutrient availability governs post-embryonic development in the roundworm C. elegans.   Worm larvae respond to starvation by arresting development and increasing resistance to environmental stress (eg, heat, freezing, oxidation, pathogens, high salt, UV radiation, low oxygen, etc).  Arrested larvae can survive starvation several weeks, which is longer than the normal lifespan of fed worms, but they respond rapidly to feeding and resume development.  Insulin-like signaling controls this remarkable physiological transformation between arrest and development.  However, the genome encodes 40 insulin-like signals, raising questions about their specificity and functional dynamics, while the function of individual signals remains largely uncharacterized.  A genetic approach will be used to identify the insulin-like signals and signaling centers that promote development in response to feeding.  A molecular approach will be used to investigate the regulation of all 40 insulin-like genes and to determine the influence of feedback on signaling dynamics.  Graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, will be trained to perform the experiments and taught to write about and present the findings.  With completion of this work, specific details critical to understanding how developmental homeostasis is maintained in this well-characterized model system will be learned, impacting research on organismal biology and insulin-like signaling in a variety of other systems.</AbstractNarration>

Appropriate developmental responses to nutrient availability are critical to adaptation to environmental change in the wild. For example, the roundworm C. elegans arrests growth and development in response to starvation, permitting survival, and development resumes after feeding. This worm is a valuable model system, and regulatory mechanisms discovered and characterized in this system are well conserved with other animals, providing important insights into how development is controlled. It is remarkable that development of a multicellular animal like the worm can be stopped and started without disrupting coordination of development, but how this is controlled was mysterious. That is, it is unclear how cellular behaviors that comprise development, such as cell division, migration and fusion, are coordinately arrested and resumed throughout the animal in response to nutrient availability, which varies between tissues. We know that insulin signaling is critical for such systemic control of development, but there are forty genes encoding insulin signals in the genome. It was unclear which of these signals is responsible and how their action leads to systemic control of development. The goals of this project were to identify the insulin signals that regulate development and the signaling centers from which they are expressed. This is significant, as these signals and signaling centers are at the top of the regulatory network governing development in response to nutrient availability. We found that three of the forty insulin signals, ins-4, ins-6 and daf-28, are most important. These signals are expressed in response to feeding, and they promote development. In addition, they are expressed in sensory neurons in response to external nutrient status as well as the intestine in response to internal nutrient status. That is, these insulin signals define two important signaling centers that integrate internal and external cues to control development of the entire animal. Despite being hormones that can act throughout the body, we were surprised to discover that these insulin signals do not directly control development in every tissue. In contrast, we found that intestinal, neuronal and epidermal cells respond to lack of these insulin signals during starvation by inhibiting two other signaling pathways. These other pathways are referred to as TGF-beta and steroid hormone signaling pathways, and they each promote development. Thus, in the absence of insulin signaling, development is arrested by inhibition of growth-promoting pathways. These insights reveal a relatively complex signaling network involving three signaling pathways and multiple tissues that governs development in response to nutrient availability.
