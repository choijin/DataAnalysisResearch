<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to North Carolina State University (NCSU) that will provide research training for 8 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2014. Students will be engaged in cutting edge research in integrative molecular plant systems (IMPS) with foci on sustainable foods, fuels, and model systems. NCSU has a strong core of plant biologists who are working in multiple areas of integrative plant biology, as well as faculty collaborators from multiple departments and disciplines that serve as research mentors in the program. The goal of the program is to inspire and empower undergraduate researchers to pursue productive scientific careers. Students in the program will participate in a 3-day "Biotechnology Bootcamp" during the first week of the program, where they will learn critical molecular biology laboratory skills, and then will pursue independent research projects for the remainder of the summer under the guidance of a faculty mentor. Students will have multiple public-speaking opportunities to present their research, including a poster presentation at the campus-wide undergraduate research symposium at the end of the program. Students will also participate in career-development activities, including research seminars and various workshops, such as the responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process.  The student recruitment strategy has an online component through the program website and the NSF website, as well as direct email to colleagues and programs at other institutions and site visits to local HBCUs. Students are selected based on academic record, research interest, letters of recommendation, and potential for outstanding research in molecular plant biology. Students from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://biotech.ncsu.edu/reu or by contacting the PI, Dr. Sue Carson (sue_carson@ncsu.edu or 919-513-0330).</AbstractNarration>

Plant Biology is an exciting field of research that is often overlooked by undergraduates, and by minority students in particular. However, we have found that the areas of renewable energy and food security have captured the passions of many undergraduates from a wide variety of disciplines. Characterizing transgenic plants provides a venue for training undergraduates in molecular, genomic, biochemical and cell biology. This program also aims to provide opportunities for developing oral and written communication skills, which is a critical aspect of sharing knowledge.  Targeted student participants included rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors in various majors including biology, engineering, microbiology, and plant biology who have demonstrated an interest in using molecular and modeling tools to solve problems and to understand basic biology. Particular consideration was given to members of underrepresented groups and students who have limited opportunity to pursue research in our focus-area at their home institutions.  The intellectual merit of this program centers on research studies asking basic and applied questions in integrative molecular plant systems. NCSU has a strong core of plant biologists who are working in the areas of sustainable foods, fuels, and developing model systems for studying fundamental biological mechanisms. Examples of student research projects are summarized below.  Algae biofuels: using extremophile enzymes to increase lipid production and provide nutrient recycle capabilities in marine microalgae.

Participant Demographics  47% of our program participants self-identified as members of underrepresented groups in the biological sciences (Hispanic, African American, or Native American). In addition, we favored selection of students who were less likely to be engaged in a research-intensive laboratory with full-time graduate student peers at their home institutions. 72% of particip...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
