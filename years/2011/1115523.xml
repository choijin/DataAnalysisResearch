<AbstractNarration>The restoration of degraded images is a fundamental and challenging problem in image processing. This problem is ill-posed. The total-variation regularization and its variants are commonly used to convert to a well-posed problem. The resulting regularized model usually has a non-differentiable objective functional, which together with the large dimension of the underlying image makes the minimization theoretically and numerically difficult. Typical numerical treatments for this minimization are indirect in the sense that the methods are developed for a smoothed or dual model of the original model. With this project, the principal investigators use tools from convex analysis to find the solution of the image restoration models directly under a unified framework. The PIs address more general mathematical challenges and computational difficulties associated with the obtained fixed-point formulation.  This project provides a fixed-point characterization for the solutions of models with  least squares and max norm fidelity terms combined with the total variation regularization term. The study considers images corrupted by Gaussian noise, impulsive Gaussian noise and Poisson noise, which are all of relevance for different applications. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Restoring images from available data is required in a variety of applications including computer tomography; natural resources and pollution control via satellite imaging in environmental sciences; and fingerprint and face recognition in security identification. Advanced mathematical models and efficient computational algorithms for solving this problem are essential. The developed numerical schemes  support improved automatic image restoration for these applications. Furthermore, interdisciplinary approaches resulting from the projects enrich upper level undergraduate and graduate curriculum development and teaching activities.</AbstractNarration>

These problems arise from applications of practical importance such as incomplete data recovery with a sparse representation and compressive sensing. Research results obtained from this project consist of two types.     Results in Theoretical Development:  Fixed-point Characterization of Solutions for Non-smooth Optimization Problems: A variety of optimization problems in image/signal processing are non-smooth in nature.

Results in Mathematical Modeling and Applications:  Mathematical Modeling:Solving an application problem in image/signal processing requires to identify intrinsic features embedded in the problem and then to build a model with mechanistic interpretations. Edges and textures in different orientations are important features in images. The PIs designed a discrete cosine transform based tight framelet system that can simultaneously capture the edges and textures of an image.

Applications in Medical Images: The PIs have developed a preconditioned alternating projection algorithm (PAPA) with total variation (TV) regularizer for solving the penalized maximum likelihood optimization model for SPECT reconstruction.This algorithm belongs to a novel class of the fixed-point proximity methods. For high-noise simulated SPECT data PAPA-TV significantly outperforms the clinical EM-GPF and the conventional OSL-TV in terms of "hot" lesion detectability, noise suppression, MSE and computational efficiency. The proposed PAPA-TV might permit clinically useful reconstructions of low-dose SPECT data thus offering a promising approach to the important need of reducing radiation dose to patients ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
