<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Merlin Bruening at Michigan State University and his group will develop enzyme-containing porous membranes that catalyze digestion of proteins to enable their analysis.  They will investigate how variation of the flow rate through the membranes affects the lengths of the peptides that result from digestion.  Formation of large peptides is important for finding specific protein modifications including phosphorylation that are relevant to diseases such as cancer.  Control over membrane digestion can also help elucidate protein structure and examine how structure changes in response to certain drugs or other proteins.  The proposed research, if successful, will extend the utility of the membrane digestion approach and provide better tools for post-translational modified protein analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will involve students at high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, including those from underrepresented groups.  A high school teacher workshop on protein analysis by mass spectrometry will further expand the impact of these studies. An international student exchange program is also in development to further expose students to different scientfic training and cultural environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Modification of proteins with phosphate and other groups is vital to cell regulation, and errors in such modifications are associated with cancer and other diseases.  However, detection of new functional groups on proteins is difficult because these groups may appear on only a small percentage of the copies of a specific protein, which itself is only a fraction of the total protein in a cell.  Thus, detection of protein modifications usually requires isolation of a given protein from the rest of the material in a cell. This research created filters that selectively bind to proteins with tags or certain functional groups.  Remarkably, these devices enable purification of specific proteins in minutes.  The method for creating selective filters uses simple adsorption of functional polymers, which should be relatively inexpensive.   Even after isolation, interrogation of protein composition typically includes enzymatic digestion of the protein into small pieces (peptides).  Thus, this project developed enzyme-containing filters that cut proteins in a controlled manner.  Faster flow through the filters leads to larger peptides that are often useful for exhaustively locating modifications using mass spectrometry.  Moreover, other specially designed filters selectively capture phosphorylated species to help specifically identify peptides with phosphate groups.  Controlled protein digestion occurs in seconds using the new filters, which should facilitate rapid analyses of modifications associated with disease states.  The analytical methods may also prove useful in quality assurance in the manufacturing of therapeutic antibodies.  Filter-enabled analyses should help to assure that each batch of antibody has the same modifications.   Broader impacts of this work may include widely available filters that enhance protein analyses.  Licensing of our previous membrane technology led to commercial devices for protein purification, and similar success could occur with enzyme-containing filters.  Additionally, the project contributed to training of many young scientists.  This research included 7 graduate students, two undergraduate students and three high school students.  Additionally, by incorporating small portions of research studies as senior projects in the analytical chemistry laboratory course, additional undergraduate students benefitted from this work.  Recent PhD graduates obtained positions at the DOW Chemical Company (Midland, MI), QPS Holdings LLC (Newark, DE), and MPI Research (Kalamazoo, MI).
