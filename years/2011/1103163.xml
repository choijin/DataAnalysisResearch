<AbstractNarration>This award enables the research team to continue their work on the ICECAP (ICE age Chemistry and Proxies) modeling project whose aim is to explore the utility of delta O-17 isotopes in ice core sulfate as a proxy for past oxidant levels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, the research will investigate the evolution of the atmosphere's oxidation capacity during the Last Glacial Maximum and pre-industrial Holocene through to the present-day.  Specifically, the researchers aim to evaluate the relative roles of emissions and atmospheric dynamics in the variability of oxidants on glacial-interglacial timescales as well as any regional variation in sulfate and nitrate isotopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support two graduate students and a high school science teacher.  Successful completion of the work would improve the understanding of feedbacks between climate and the sources and sinks of methane, which would help improve our understanding of climate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT  The oxidation capacity of the atmosphere determines the atmospheric lifetime of most reduced trace gases in the atmosphere that serve as pollutants and greenhouse gases.  The oxidation capacity is defined by the global abundance of oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical (OH) and tropospheric ozone.  Although much as been learned about the past variability in the atmospheric abundance of greenhouse gases such as methane, the cause of the observed variability is still unknown, compromising our ability to predict future abundances.  Since these oxidants are not preserved in geological archives such as ice cores, models are the best tool we have to examine the key variables influencing the atmospheric abundance of these oxidants, and to evaluate suggested ice-core proxies for the oxidants.     This research project developed a three-dimensional global chemistry-climate model constructed to efficiently evaluate the sensitivities of oxidant abundance over glacial-interglacial climate changes.  We found that OH concentrations are most sensitive to three variables: water vapor concentrations, stratospheric ozone abundance, and lightning emissions.  We evaluated the sensitivity of two potential ice-core proxies for oxidant abundances, and found that the oxygen isotopes of nitrate are highly sensitive to the relative abundance of OH and ozone.  We used the model to interpret ice-core observations of nitrate oxygen isotopes over major climate transitions.  The results suggested that the variability of tropospheric ozone over major climate transitions is governed by processes in the stratosphere that determine the stratospheric circulation and influence stratospheric ozone abundances. These stratospheric processes are typically considered to be constant over major climate transitions.  Our work suggests that stratospheric variability must be considered when evaluating the cause of the observed variability in pollutants and greenhouse gases measured in ice cores.     BROADER IMPACTS  This research has transformed our understanding of the drivers for potential changes in the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere over major climate change and informed the interpretation of ice-core records of pollutants and greenhouse gases.  This will ultimately improve our ability to predict the future atmospheric abundance of pollutants and greenhouse gases.  This project provided training for five graduate students, one postdoctoral scientist, and one undergraduate student.
