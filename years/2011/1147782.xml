<AbstractNarration>The investigator studies moduli spaces of finite, flat covers and line bundles of those covers.  Important basic examples include orders in number fields (finite flat covers of the integers) and finite covers of the complex projective line.  The methods involve working over an arbitrary base scheme, so for example one gets results about both the number theoretic and geometric examples above.  The project is to find moduli spaces that have explicit descriptions and reasonable geometry so that they can be worked with concretely.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the work of Gauss in 1801, polynomials have been use to study number systems that are bigger than the usual counting numbers 1,2,3..,  For example, a larger number system might also include the square root of 2, which cannot be found among 1,2,3...  When we include the square root of 2, it is a quadratic extension of the usual numbers, and if we had included the cube root of 2 it would have been a cubic extension of the usual numbers.  This work tries to understand what the possible low degree extensions of the usual numbers are by working explicitly with polynomials that are related to the extensions.  This then allows one to make computations regarding the larger number systems by reducing them to easier computations about polynomials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported research in number theory and algebraic geometry.  One of the most important topics of the research is investigating different systems of numbers, which are similar to the usual integers, but slightly bigger or more complicated.  When we use these bigger systems of numbers, there are interesting effects on the usual features of the integers, such as prime numbers.  For example, when our number system includes the square root of 2, the nubmer 2 is no longer prime because it factors as the square root of two times the square root of two.  This project studied what happens to things like primes and factorization in large or random random systems.  The results of this research include at least 17 research papers published or to be published in peer-reviewed mathematics journals.  This projected directly supported the research of one assistant professor, 2 graduate students, and 18 undergraduate students, and involved collaborations with many others.  The PIs research program also includes a large component of outreach to explain mathematical ideas, and in particular, the creative side of mathematics, to a wide audience, as well as efforts to promote the visibility of women in mathematics as a way to encourage more participation from women in STEM fields.
