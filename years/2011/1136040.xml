<AbstractNarration>Holonic Multi-Agent Control of Intelligent Power Distribution Systems &lt;br/&gt;This project will demonstrate a Holonic Multiagent System Architecture capable of adaptively controlling future electrical power distribution systems (PDS), which are expected to include a large number of renewable power generators, energy storage devices, and advanced metering and control devices. The project will produce a general, extensible, and secure cyber architecture based on holonic multiagent principles to support adaptive PDS. It will produce new analytical insights to quantify the impact of information delay, quality and flow on the design and analysis of the PDS architecture. Finally, it will develop a novel approach to automating PDS with high penetration of distributed renewable resources for higher efficiency, reliability, security, and resiliency.&lt;br/&gt;The complex nature of future PDS will require them to adapt reactively and proactively to normal and anomalous modes of operation. The architecture produced by this project will be capable of optimizing performance and maintaining the system within operating limits during normal and minor events, such as cloud cover that reduces solar panels output. The architecture will also allow the operation of a distribution system as an island in emergencies, such as hurricanes/earthquakes, grid failures, or terrorist acts.  &lt;br/&gt;The project will inspire future engineers via a simulation that will allow students to inject faults, failures, and weather events to see how an intelligent PDS will respond.  These activities will combine cyber- and physical expertise, thus creating a workforce prepared for tomorrow?s cyber-physical system challenges. Existing university programs will be used to involve under-represented minorities and U.S. veterans in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With declining prices and advances in technology, more consumers are opting to install rooftop sloar photovoltaic (PV) generation in their homes.  The sloar PV generation creates dynamics for which the legacy power distribution systems are not designed.  These dynamics become more severe with higher penetration of rooftop solar PV.  For example, movement of intermittent clouds causes fluctuations in power output as well voltage, which is detrimental to the system and to consumers' equipment.  Further, control of large number of devices to mainitain system operating conditions within limits is difficult because the solutions become computationally very complex and time consuming.    The primary goal of this project was to create a multi-agent architecture to control future electrical power distribution systems with high penetration of distributed renewable generation, energy storage devices, and advanced metering and control devices.  The complex nature of future power distribution systems will require them to operate as cyberphysical systems that adapt reactively and proactively under normal as well as extreme modes in time scales of one cycle to several minutes. The proposed architecture optimizes performance and maintains the system within operating limits during normal and minor events, such as intermittent clouds that suddenly drop the output from rooftop solar panels.  The control aspects focused on local as well as coordinated distributed control.  The local control is based on deploying smart inverters to inject reactive power in response to fluctuations in active power from solar PV to mitigate voltage fluctuations.  The coordinated distributed control uses distributed optimization based on hierarchical structure of the power distribution system to inject reactive power at the home level to minimize system losses.  Aditionally, the research investigated compressed sensing while exploiting spatial and temporal correlation in solar PV generation and load for situational awareness of the sytem with limited data.   The architecture and techniques investigated for the project provide a pathway for higher intergration of rooftop solar generation in power distribution systems, which in turn will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.  A test system built for the project is available through the project web site to the research community for additional research. The techniques implemented in the project are attractive to distribution system management (DMS) vendors, solar integraters, and inverter manufacturers for commercilalization.   The project trained five PhD students.  The research team and the students published several journal and conference papers based on the research.
