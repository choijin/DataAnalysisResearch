<AbstractNarration>Significant resources are devoted to R&amp;D on robotics across industry and government agencies. This project aims to (1) understand how the efforts can be coordinated to optimize the impact of such efforts, (2) build educational resources where best practice is used across all institutions in the US to ensure access to the best human capital, and t(3) study best practice for transition of results for exploitation. Finally, resources are provided to disseminate information about the impact of robotics to a broad community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A national robotics initiative is launched for the creation of basic technologies that grow the economy, secure healthcare for future generations and provide support to first responders. It is essential from a societal perspective that the use of such resources is optimized to maximize the impact in terms of economic growth, job creation and provide services to the citizen. The organization of a Robotics-VO provides the required infrastructure support and coordination to ensure effective use of resources.</AbstractNarration>
