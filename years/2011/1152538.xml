<AbstractNarration>This project will create a research coordination network to develop lasting collaborations among scholars from a variety of disciplines (e.g., economics, management, and sociology) who study the creation and transfer of knowledge and the implications of these processes for individual and organizational outcomes.  While a significant amount of research has been done in the area, the broad field of inquiry is fragmented into multiple distinct groups, with some researchers adopting an "organization-focus" and considering knowledge creation and transfer within and across organizations, while others have adopted an "individual-focus" emphasizing the life scientists and a third group has adopted a "group-focus" investigating knowledge transfer among interacting teams. Through the formation of network clusters focused around four common themes and a series of workshops and conferences, this research coordination network will help bridge the boundary or disconnect between these multiple "invisible colleges" and make researchers more aware of theoretical arguments and research findings developing outside of their school.  The research coordination network would encourage boundary-spanning interactions that are likely to result in novel research projects and initiatives that will enable development of a more complete view of the interplay between institutional factors such as intellectual property rights and individual factors such as motivations and incentives that affect the creation of scientific knowledge, its diffusion and potential commercialization and use.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the creation and transfer of knowledge is of great importance both to the scientific community and to nurturing a national innovation ecosystem that will enhance national competitiveness and security. Scholarly research is currently fragmented so could benefit greatly from integration and an integrated view can guide both national policy and organizational practice and the ability to create and transfer knowledge is a distinct source of competitive advantage.  Indeed, as the half-life of products and even entire product categories has decreased, the ability to create and transfer knowledge has become even more important because both factors shape a firm's ability to improve existing products and work routines and to develop new products and work routines. Research coordinated by the network would improve our ability to manage the production and distribution of knowledge within and between organizations.  Scientists and women in particular, must overcome a significant number of barriers as they attempt to commercialize their ideas.  Research that combines organizational and individual factors could shed light on how best to overcome those barriers in particular and to knowledge creation and transfer in general. New projects encouraged by the network could prove particularly valuable for life scientists and the large number of people who benefit from their ideas and innovations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research collaboration network had a simple goal of objective.  We sought to create a bridge between two group scholars with an interest in the performance implications of knowledge transfer for individuals, teams, organizations and much larger collectives.   Scholars with an interest in these questions cut across a variety of disciplines.  Our research coordination network focused on bringing these diverse individuals together.  We have organized a number of conferences that have provided scholars from different disciplines an opportunity to meet, share what we know, and start new collaborations.   In our first conference, we invited a small and diverse group of individuals.  We identified potential topics for subsequent conferences.  We discovered that a major constraint facing most people was simply time.  Our conferences would need to fit into the conferences that individuals were already attending.  We adopted two approaches.  First, we partnered with the Organization Science Winter Conference (OSWC).  We used the OSWC as a platform to reach a large number of people.  Second, we used the Mack Institute at the Wharton School of Business to organize and deliver additional conferences.  We were able to get hundreds of individuals to attend our conferences.  During our initial conferences, we focused on topics we had identified during our first conference.  Participants played a role by presenting research in the topic areas we identified.  In subsequent conferences, we allowed some individuals to play a more active role in planning and delivering a conference.  We focused in particular on more junior members of our field and worked with them to deliver conferences on topics which they believed community members would find rewarding.  We also changed the presentation format.  Instead of giving presenters a fixed time to present, we gave them five to ten minutes to quickly summarize their key ideas and then opened the floor for discussion.  By all accounts, the new format worked extremely well.  Our junior colleagues usually identified more interesting topics and invited new individuals to the network to present.  The discussion format generated more interesting and insightful conversations.  We can use a number of metrics to measure the success of our efforts.  Several hundred individuals attended our conferences.  Those individuals spanned multiple disciplines, including economics, management psychology, social psychology, and sociology.  Seminar participants were diverse with respect to age, ethnicity, gender and race.  Informal feedback indicated our activities were well received.  The feedback we received was not systematic and in hindsight, we regret not collecting systematic feedback after each conference.  Over the last few weeks, we asked seminar participants to respond to a very brief survey.  The response rate was very low.  We haven?t organized a conference in over a year and we asked individuals to respond during spring break.  However, the responses we did receive were informative.  We asked individuals to evaluate the overall quality of the conferences they attended.  Fifty-nine percent of the individuals that responded thought our conferences were excellent and another 27% percent thought they were very good.  Only one respondent thought the conferences were of poor quality.  We asked individuals to indicate how attending the conferences affected their research.  Individuals were asked to respond to three related but distinct questions.  Ninety-one percent indicated that attending made them "more aware of theoretical arguments and frameworks developing in different fields."  Fifty-nine percent reported that they were "exposed to theoretical arguments and frameworks which I now use in my research."   And fifty-five percent reported that they attending our conferences "provided me with an opportunity to find new collaborators."  The responses indicate that we have been successful in facilitating the transfer of existing knowledge and creating a platform for the creation of new knowledge in this important research area.  We also asked responded "How would you describe the time you spent at our events?"  The responses were very informative and suggest we were successful in creating an ongoing community ("Excellent events. The highest quality and most useful conferences I've participated in.", "These gatherings have done more to further my work than any other conferences of their kind.", "Among the best and most valuable conference experiences in my academic career. Extremely helpful and stimulating.").  The responses we received in response to this question indicate how committed individuals are to this important topic and the social sciences in general and second, they indicate how successful our conferences were and why individuals found them so appealing. While we did not hold as many events as we would have liked, we view our research collaboration network as a success.  The network is relatively large, diverse, active, and characterized by ongoing relationships and interactions.  And we can say from our own personal experiences, that we have been changed by the experience.  We would like to thank the National Science Foundation for providing us with this opportunity.            Last Modified: 04/05/2017       Submitted by: Ray E Reagans]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
