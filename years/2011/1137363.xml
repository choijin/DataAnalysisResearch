<AbstractNarration>Although scientists have learned much in the past 20 years about how individual ecosystems are likely to respond to climate change, extending this knowledge to regional and continental scales has been a far greater challenge. At these larger spatial scales, both the environment and the attributes of ecosystems vary dramatically. For example, in the central US, there are strong temperature and rainfall gradients from Texas to North Dakota and the dry plains of Colorado to eastern Kansas, and the types of grasslands differ as well (from short grasslands in the west to tall grasslands in the east). In order to better forecast how entire regions will respond to expected climatic changes, there is a pressing need to understand why ecosystems differ in their sensitivity to changes in climate.  This project includes research designed to answer a question of fundamental importance for advancing knowledge of biological processes at large scales:  How important are the attributes of ecosystems per se vs. the environmental context in which climate is changing in determining ecological responses to climate change at regional scales?  To answer this question, a geographically distributed field experiment will be conducted at six sites in NM, CO, WY and KS and the results from this experiment will be used to strengthen an existing process-based terrestrial ecosystem model. With this model, the relative importance of ecosystem attributes versus the environment for determining responses to climate change will be evaluated and then scaling rules for extending site-based knowledge to regional scales will be developed.  The experiment imposed will be a severe multi-year drought in grasslands arrayed along a rainfall gradient (from desert grassland to mesic tallgrass prairie).  Key responses measured will include many related to carbon cycling and budgets and plant biodiversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has a number of broader impacts including enhancing existing terrestrial ecosystem modeling approaches, and conducting a field experiment that will provide a platform for others in the scientific community to conduct additional research activities.  A project website will make products (datasets, key results, papers, models) available to the scientific community and general public. Research will occur on federal lands and at a number of other research stations where outreach programs are in place, allowing results to be shared with a wide range of stakeholders.  The project is also designed to provide training opportunities for numerous graduate and undergraduate students. Because this study is unique in its spatial extent and combination of field and modeling approaches, the collaborative training opportunities available to students differs substantially from traditional degree programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The probability of decade-long, severe drought by the end of this Century is &gt;80% in the Central Great Plains and nearly 100% in the Desert Southwest. The impacts of such droughts will have significant consequences for ecosystem structure and function, and the provision of ecosystems services, such as forage and carbon sequestration. The overarching goal of the Extreme Drought in Grasslands Experiment (EDGE) was to determine the differential sensitivity of grassland ecosystems to chronic drought. Most comparative analyses of drought use natural droughts that differ in strength and duration. In EDGE, we used a similar level of rainfall reduction and duration or drought in six North American grasslands ranging from desert grassland to tallgrass prairie. We hypothesized that mesic grasslands would be more responsive to drought than dry grasslands because species in arid systems should be adapted to frequent water limitation. In contrast, observational data based only on interannual variation in precipitation (rather than severe drought) suggested that dryland systems are most responsive to changes in amount of precipitation. Our project provided experimental support for the latter hypothesis &ndash; the most arid site was the most responsive to experimental drought. Both aboveground plant growth and soil respiration &ndash; two key components of the global carbon cycle - declined precipitously in response to drought. We also found that soil microbial communities responded to drought, but in this case, the microbial communities in mesic systems were more sensitive to drought than dryland soil communities. At the two dryland sites in New Mexico, however, we also found differential sensitivity to drought. The Chihuahuan Desert site dominated by black grama grass was far more sensitive to drought than the Great Plains grassland dominated by blue grama. This was also true for biological soil crusts. Soil seed bank composition also changed in response to drought. Drought reduced the diversity and density of seeds in the soil seed bank in the black grama dominated grassland. Finally, the dominant grass, black grama, suffered a decrease in genetic diversity among individuals that survived multiple years of drought. Together these results indicate that dryland systems, in general, are particularly susceptible to chronic drought and that ecosystem recovery following extended severe drought will be limited by contributions from the soil seed bank and genetic diversity of the dominant grasses.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Scott&nbsp;L&nbsp;Collins</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
