<AbstractNarration>An international team of researchers from the University of Texas at Arlington, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Broward College, and 15 other institutions in 11 countries, will fill in a massive gap in global biodiversity awareness through a large scale inventory of reptiles (snakes, lizards, crocodiles and turtles) and amphibians (frogs and caecilians) from the Javan and Sumatran montane forests of Indonesia. As of today, the biodiversity of these tropical montane highlands is very poorly known. Previous work hints that these areas may be some of the most species rich on earth, and may contain vast numbers of endemic species with restricted ranges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These species represent the largest number of vertebrate animals yet to be discovered and described by scientists.The survey will likely discover hundreds of new species from this poorly known area of the world and will result in educational and research partnerships between Indonesia and the USA. As a benefit to the scientific community, the project will produce modern specimen repositories and web-based resources for identification and conservation management, and for genetic and biodiversity work.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual merit:</span></strong> An international team of faculty, students, and research staff from the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Broward College, and Universitas Brawijaya (UB), working with students and personnel from Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB), Universitas Syiah Kuala (Unsyiah), Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM), Universitas Andalas (Unand), and Universit&auml;t Hamburg (UH), have successfully filled in a massive gap in global biodiversity awareness. Over four years these institutions have completed one of the most thorough and well-planned large scale taxonomic inventory of a highland tropical herpetofauna (reptiles and amphibians). Until this collaborative project the Javan and Sumatran tropical montane herpetofaunas were among the least explored and potentially most species rich on earth. This megadiverse and yet poorly sampled region has now been systematically explored for herpetofauna, finding more than 250 species new to science. Only a handful of researchers had until recently worked in this vast area.</p> <p>The survey&rsquo;s more than 250 new species discovered are resulting in many taxonomic descriptions and monographic revisions of large groups of herpetofauna. Integrative methodologies are being used in species delimitation, and include evolutionary analyses of morphology and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. The focal groups are offering unique opportunities to examine gene flow dynamics at several levels of dispersal capability, between islands and between mountains. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts:</span></strong> The tropical uplands of Java and Sumatra are inhabited by an incredible diversity of reptiles and amphibians, many endangered by extensive habitat fragmentation, forest destruction (e.g., fires, agriculture, and urbanization), and by introduced diseases (e.g., chytrid fungi). Identification of areas of endemism and new species from montane habitats is facilitating conservation. This project is establishing baseline data for comparative studies with other tropical mountain systems, including habitat fragmentation, coevolution, vicariance, and effects of climate change. Additionally, over 10,000 museum specimens, with respective DNA samples and photographs have been collected for scientific study, for immediate taxonomic work and for dissemination to the international scientific community. The over 10,000 DNA sequences generated for taxonomic work are being deposited through open access repositories, providing users with collection locality data, in vivo photographs and tools for tree generation and visualization.</p> <p>The project has provided direct <em>field training</em> and involvement to multiple researchers (Indonesian 4; US 4) and undergraduate (Indonesian 27; US 1) and graduate (Indonesian 2; US 6) students; and <em>laboratory training</em> to Indonesian (researchers 3, undergraduate students 2) and US participants (undergraduate students 4, graduate students 6). The participation of Indonesian scientists (10) and students (29) and those from the US (4 scientists, 7 students), in field, lab, and/or manuscript work has forged an unparalleled partnership among all, and an unprecedented development of human infrastructure.</p> <p>Many talks at the researchers&rsquo; home institutions (e.g., UTA, BC, LIPI, UB), conferences, scientific meetings, and during workshops have served as outreach activities.&nbsp; Also, an outreach exhibit was organized at the UTA Science and Engineering library (student exposure &gt;30,000), and at the Institut Pertanian Bogor and at LIPI-Cibinong, Indonesia, we organized a workshop entitled &ldquo;Research, collection and lab techniques in Herpetology&rdquo;. The workshop integrated students and researchers interested in Herpetology from schools and research institutions in Java and Sumatra. There were 39 participants from 10 different institutions, of which 32 delivered talks.</p> <p>Electronic media outlets are created to make all information generated publically accessible. These herpetofaunal electronic resources include a type specimen iconography with interactive digital images for most types from Sumatra and Java and from the Sunda Shelf in general.&nbsp; Relevant type specimens were examined, from four museums in the USA, three in SE Asia, and thirteen in Europe. With this compilation of photographs and recent examination of types major advances are made in the taxonomy and description of the herpetofauna of Sumatra and Java. Each taxon will have an online account, complete with photographs of diagnosable morphological characters and a file of localities (KMZ). Along with interactive keys and a checklist for the region, other available data types (e.g., anuran breeding calls, anuran larval descriptions, etc.) will be included. These databases will facilitate taxonomy and conservation in Indonesia and adjacent Asian countries.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Projections reveal that the herpetofauna of Sumatra is still underexplored and similar follow-up projects, can easily reveal an additional 500 undescribed new species.&nbsp; Although this project focused on highlands, it has revealed the urgency to fund lowland tropical rainforest inventories.&nbsp; Lowland forests of Sumatra and Java (below 200 m, excluding swamps and mangroves) have been decimated to less than 1% of their original cover, leading to vast numbers of unique herpetofauna already extinct or within the next ten years (ca. 90%).&nbsp; Inventories are necessary for the last remaining lowland forests (small patches between agricultural and urban developments and a few protected areas), to save exemplars, images, and genetic samples representing this incredible faunal diversity, for future generations and as our historical record.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/05/2016<br>      Modified by: Eric&nbsp;N&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1146324/1146324_10152381_1480976745299_P6090162--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1146324/1146324_10152381_1480976745299_P6090162--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sumatra Parachuting Frog"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1146324/1146324_10152381_1480976745299_P6090162--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sumatra Parachuting Frog"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Adult Sumatra Parachuting Frog displaying lateral flash coloration.

Projections reveal that the herpetofauna of Sumatra is still underexplored and similar follow-up projects, can easily reveal an additional 500 undescribed new species.  Although this project focused on highlands, it has revealed the urgency to fund lowland tropical rainforest inventories.  Lowland forests of Sumatra and Java (below 200 m, excluding swamps and mangroves) have been decimated to less than 1% of their original cover, leading to vast numbers of unique herpetofauna already extinct or within the next ten years (ca. 90%).  Inventories are necessary for the last remaining lowland forests (small patches between agricultural and urban developments and a few protected areas), to save exemplars, images, and genetic samples representing this incredible faunal diversity, for future generations and as our historical record.
