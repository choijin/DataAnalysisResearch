<AbstractNarration>Teacher education faculty from four diverse institutions (Utah State, West Virginia University, Mills College, and St. Petersburg College) are collaborating with the Math Forum to study the development of Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT) in elementary Preservice Teachers (PTs) who participate in online mathematics mentoring experiences.  The study is investigating the retention and application of this knowledge during the PTs' student teaching experiences in the field.  Faculty, along with their PTs, are learning  to use the Virtual Fieldwork Sequence (VFS), a structured set of online modules that supports PTs to work with grade level mathematics, identify student strengths, and provide feedback to "live" students on-line. A key element of the professional development model and a large part of its uniqueness is that the faculty are reflecting on and analyzing the data and describing the findings from their pilot study, including the impact of the VFS on student MKT.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is expected to yield significant findings concerning the learning of preservice teachers by investigating how MKT might be further developed. The project adopts an on-the-job approach to the professional development of the involved faculty, a strategy that prior research has shown to be significant in promoting change in teaching practices. One of the outcomes is an on-line professional development module that is collaborative, situated, and focused on developing preservice teachers' MKT.  The students involved are non-traditional, underrepresented minority, first-generation college students. The project has an impact on both the teaching approaches of faculty of undergraduate STEM students and the students' MKT both of which are currently recognized as areas of STEM education needing improvement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative project included: researchers and developers of the Math Forum @ Drexel's online mathematics materials; university mathematics educators at various universities across the country; and participating preservice teachers enrolled in mathematics methods courses.   There were two major goals for this project: (1) developing a template for an online training program to support university instructors of preservice teachers to use online  Math ForumÆs Virtual Fieldwork Sequence (VFS) in their teaching, and (2) the replication and extension of prior study of preservice teachersÆ motivation for and learning from the VFS mathematics modules.   Some outcomes related to the first goal included: improving and further developing the online modules themselves based on feedback from the university instructors using them; some of the university instructors engaging in their own research projects related to the modules and presenting them at national conferences; and developing a program for orienting future university instructors to use the modules in their courses.   The outcomes related to the second goal included following preservice teachers for a longer period of time after their introduction to the online modules and into their student teaching experiences. This goal provided many challenges in getting consistent data from the preservice teachers once they left the mathematics methods courses; the researchers from the Math Forum have extended the time of the research project in order to access and analyze this longer-term data from the preservice teachers regarding their motivation, learning, and student teaching related to mathematics. The Outcomes Report from this extended time for study will be available later in 2015.   The university instructors continue to use and refine the VFS mathematics modules in their courses, and are continuing to engage in research and scholarly activities related to the complicated issue of preparing preservice teachers in the area of mathematics.
