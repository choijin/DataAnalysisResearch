<AbstractNarration>This is workshop travel support for 14 junior scientists (mostly graduate students, with a few postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;researchers) from the USA to travel to Sanya, Hainan China for the Symposium in geophysical&lt;br/&gt;imaging. The NSF of China has some co-funding to support the local accommodations for the&lt;br/&gt;invited speakers, and for the registrations and other conference expenses. IASPEI (International&lt;br/&gt;Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth?s Interior), SEG (Society of Exploration&lt;br/&gt;Geophysicists) and EAGE (European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers) have endorsed&lt;br/&gt;and listed the Symposium as their formal symposium or workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geophysical imaging is the key for subsurface structural delineation, target detection and&lt;br/&gt;property inversion. It has a wide range of applications to subsurface resources exploration, crust&lt;br/&gt;and mantle structures, earthquake rapture process and fault structure, and shallow target&lt;br/&gt;detection. Due to the increasingly high complexity of the geological environments for oil/gas&lt;br/&gt;exploration and other imaging targets, such as for monitoring CO2 sequestration and pollution&lt;br/&gt;control, and the explosively increased data amount collected by the new acquisition system, highresolution,&lt;br/&gt;high-fidelity and high-efficiency imaging methods are highly in demanding. For highresolution,&lt;br/&gt;high-fidelity imaging, we need much more phase-space information, such as the main&lt;br/&gt;direction of the local energy flux, instant frequency of the wavefield, rather than a straightforward&lt;br/&gt;space-domain solution. In other words, we need accurate and efficient propagators with phasespace&lt;br/&gt;localizations. Such phase-space information is crucial in modern true-amplitude, truereflection&lt;br/&gt;imaging and parameter inversion. With phase-space localized wave propagators, local&lt;br/&gt;AVA (amplitude variation with angle), local inversion for reservoir parameters can be performed&lt;br/&gt;and the close link between imaging and inversion can be established. Recently emerged seismic&lt;br/&gt;imaging methods using fast beam, fast wavepacket and other localized waves, such as beamlet,&lt;br/&gt;curvelet, have brought up broad interests in the study of imaging using localized waves. The&lt;br/&gt;relevant researches have been spread to many branches of physics, acoustics, seismology,&lt;br/&gt;engineering and mathematics.The symposium is different from other&lt;br/&gt;geophysical conferences and workshops in its broad scope and interdisciplinary interactions. The&lt;br/&gt;intensive invited speeches serves as introductory lectures by the experts of different fields.</AbstractNarration>

We believe that the  symposium will promote the research in this area and bring significant  impact to the future development in geophysical imaging/inversion using  localized waves.         During the conference, we combined a wide spectrum of applied mathematical techniques and a wide spectrum of scientific application disciplines, led by geophysics, purposely promote industrial-academic, and cross-disciplinary collaborations. We also emphasize the participation of young scientists at all levels including some graduate students and postdocs. We believe that this broad interaction between geophysics, applied mathematics, physics, and other related disciplines will promote further interactions and correlations between different disciplines on the development of phase-space localized wave propagation, scattering , local AVA (amplitude variation with angle), local inversion. It has the potential to revolutionize the traditional way of geophysical imaging/inversion. The scientific impact is not limited to Geophysics, but to a wide spectrum of disciplines.
