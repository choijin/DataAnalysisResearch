<AbstractNarration>The discovery of RNA interference mediated gene silencing by double-stranded RNA is one of the most exciting recent developments in the biological and biomedical sciences. RNAi utilizes a pathway whereby a double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) targets and destroys complementary mRNA in eukaryotic cells to regulate gene expression. Since its discovery just over a decade ago scientists have investigated the potential use of siRNA-based treatment of many diseases such as cancer, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, and hypercholesterolemia. In principle, siRNA has much broader therapeutic applications than other types of drugs because siRNA can be synthetically designed to silence any gene via the RNAi machinery. Therefore, the primary challenge for therapeutic applications is efficient and non-toxic delivery of siRNA to cells within tissues of interest. The research goal of this CDI project is to design efficient delivery systems for siRNA via supercomputer simulations. Multimillion-atom simulations are performed to study: (1) the effect of siRNAs on the molecular structure of lipid membranes and how structural changes affect the membrane permeability; (2) molecular mechanisms by which siRNA molecules attached to gold nanoparticles cross the membrane and go into a cell; and (3) delivery of siRNAs encapsulated in liposomes by ultrasound. Computational technologies will be used to enable automated design of efficient siRNA delivery systems. This project is promoting scholastic and professional excellence among students. A dual-degree program has been established which gives students the opportunity to obtain a Ph.D. in the physical sciences or an engineering discipline and an M.S. in computer science with specialization in high performance computing and simulations. This research team will also organize computational science workshops for undergraduate students and faculty mentors from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions.</AbstractNarration>

To this end, the project has resulted in significant research outcomes, software artifacts, and biological insights and datasets.  <strong>Motivation</strong>: Understanding the precise regulatory role of ncRNAs (siRNAs, miRNAs, and others) is of great interest, since they have been shown to play important roles in development, diseases, and other biological processes. Early work on prediction of targets of ncRNAs focused on static sequence-driven miRNA-mRNA complementarity. More recent research also utilizes expression-level data to study context-dependent regulation effects in a more dynamic, physiologically-relevant setting.  <strong>Innovation</strong>:  The project resulted in a suite of innovative machine learning techniques, informed by biological insights, that redefined the state of the art in inference and characterization of ncRNA interactions. Specifically, the project resulted in the following outcomes:  - We have developed a suite of SVM-based classifiers, called Avishkar, to differentiate miRNA targets and non-targets, designed as a bipartite classification problem. We focus on non-canonical gene targets and come up with a new metric to measure the enrichment of ``seed" regions (described later), and to maximize the classifier signal by using non-parametric curves to relax the difficult-to-handle discrete features, such as sequence-based and biophysical, thermodynamic features.  - We have developed a general-purpose distributed implementation of non-linear Avishkar and open sourced it (https://bitbucket.org/cellsandmachines/kernelsvmspark) for use by the community.  - We have designed a context-specific version of Avishkar that can predict expression in 13 different types of cancers and open sourced the visualization of these interactions (http://cygnus.ecn.purdue.edu).  - We have developed a deep learning framework called Tiresias, which can identify the presence and strength of miRNA-gene interactions using a two-step process, by combining sequence and expression data.   <strong>Detailed Methods and Results</strong>  We have developed a powerful new suite of classifiers, based on support vector machines (SVMs) and deep networks. The goal of this effort was two-fold -- identification of relevant features for classification, and suitable classification engines. With respect to feature selection, we maximized the signal from both sequence-based and thermodynamic features by interpolating noisy data using splines, to develop a non-parametric characterization of thermodynamic and accessibility curves. </pre> <pre>We also engineered a new feature that we call seed-enrichment score feature. This was done to incorporate various non-canonical seed matches in a unified and systematic manner.&nbsp;</pre> <pre><strong>Non-linear SVMs</strong>. Next, we created a non-linear (radial basis function kernel) SVM to counter the bias in linear SVMs, called Avishkar. Since training non-linear SVMs is computationally expensive, we provide a general-purpose and efficient implementation of a popular algorithm for parallel training of SVMs - Cascade SVM, on top of Apache Spark. We open sourced our implementation, which will be invaluable to a number of scientific communities.  <strong>Context-specific regulation</strong>. Recent research also utilizes expression-level data, e.g., from The Cancer Genome Atlas, to study context-dependent regulation effects in a more dynamic, physiologically-relevant setting. To address this, we consider the expression data of miRNAs and mRNAs from TCGA for thirteen different cancer types and use a sparse regression method (Elastic Net) to estimate which miRNAs upregulate or downregulate which mRNAs. We show that the pairings are, to a large extent, specific to the cancer type. Further, we show that for the most highly-expressed miRNAs, results of Avishkar based on CLIP-seq data has strong agreement with results from TCGA expression data. Finally, we have also developed an open-source implementation of Avishkar to visualize the results in an Avishkar Expression Engine called V-Avishkar  (http://cygnus.ecn.purdue.edu/).  <strong>ANN-based model.</strong> Finally, we have developed Tiresias, a novel artificial neural network (ANN) based method to predict such targets in a context-dependent manner by combining sequence and expression data. Tiresias decouples the problem in a manner that makes learning easier - the first stage estimates miRNA targets and the second stage estimates the regulation weight based on the previous stage outputs. Tiresias has a single hyper-parameter to control the sparsity of miRNA-mRNA interactions, which we optimize using Bayesian optimization. Tiresias is designed to study various regulation models, ranging from a simple linear model to a complex non-linear model. Experiment results show that Tiresias significantly outperforms existing computational methods in both precision and recall (true positive rate).  </pre><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/18/2017<br>      Modified by: Ananth&nbsp;Grama</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
