<AbstractNarration>The proposed work will advance the field of decision making under uncertainty in several directions. (1) It will provide the first application of a variety of new research algorithms for utility and probability elicitation. (2) Chat rooms will identify common decisions faced by a broad range of individuals, and will provide direction for targeted research. (3) The information gathering phase of the platform will provide a unique forum for collecting information from different sources, and will be used for research on aggregating expert opinion and research on verifying the quality of real-life experts. (4) The collection of statistics, such as records of success rates in courts and medical surgery, will provide basis for research on aggregating expert opinion with data, and a database of conditional probabilities to be used by researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will enable widespread use of decision analysis and will incorporate it into daily lives of individuals. Anyone who is interested in making a decision (personal, financial, medical and bidding) will have the ability to log on to the web system and receive up to date methods for preference and belief elicitation, and interact with other decision makers facing similar decisions. The decision platform will also provide a unifying framework for experienced decision modelers to upload their templates for dissemination. Bayesian Networks will be created from users and various historic records and will be of use in a wide range of future decisions. Users will also have access to more representative models of multi-attribute utility functions for improved medical and environmental decisions. People who have faced a traumatic decision and would like to share their experience to help others will have a suitable forum.</AbstractNarration>

P.S: Work on this I-Corps project was a great experience and can be categorized into three phases.  First, preliminary work was conducted prior to attending the entrepreneurship course at Stanford University.  Second, the work conducted during the entrepreneurship course focusing on an online bidding support tool, BiddingPal.  Third, work conducted after completing the entrepreneurship course, which resulted in Ahoona.   The Stanford course presented an important tool for tracking the status of business model hypotheses, the canvas, a visual representation of beliefs about important aspects of the business model.  This tool was used extensively throughout the work on BiddingPal. We will discuss some of the learnings workin on BiddingPal below.  Some of the initial hypotheses tested concerned the general publicÃ†s willingness to use decision support for auctions, willingness to pay for support for online auctions, and willingness to pay for support for real estate auctions.  These hypotheses were central to the value proposition.  The results of these surveys showed that individuals would only be willing to use decision support for online auctions if the support were provided free of charge. The interest in auction support increased with the value of the item in the auction.             Last Modified: 05/14/2013       Submitted by: Ali E Abbas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
