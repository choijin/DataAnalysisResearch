<AbstractNarration>This research project will study the use of a special gap damper that is designed to limit the excessive deformation without causing impact and the associated high frequency motions and accelerations.  In the design of a seismic base isolation system for a building, an isolator must be allowed to deform a significant amount.  At the same time, this deformation must be controlled to avoid structural damage due to its reaching the displacement limit in a rare but possible strong ground motion.  The project involves advanced analytical and numerical simulation studies to determine the optimal gap damper characteristics for desired performance such as the size of gap element, the ratio of pre- and post-gap isolation system stiffness, and the energy dissipation demand to reduce displacements without inducing large accelerations in the building. Experimental studies on a standalone damper will be conducted in the Structural Research Laboratory at Auburn University to characterize the energy dissipation properties of the damper. Shaking table studies at the Large Scale Structures Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno will validate the effectiveness of the proposed gap damper scheme. This study will provide an experimentally and analytically validated framework leading to reliable performance-based isolator design of buildings under different seismic scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is expected to lead to better designs of base isolation systems that are often used in critical or essential facilities such as hospitals, emergency operation centers, fire stations, and other important buildings. The research results will be broadly disseminated for practical implementation to practitioners through publication in technical journals, presentations in professional conferences and the website created for the project. The experimental data will be archived on the George E. Brown Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation data repository for easy accessibility by other researchers in the earthquake engineering community. The project will provide advanced training to graduate and undergraduate students through their involvement in project research activities. To enhance the awareness and importance of earthquake engineering, a ?Reconnaissance Education Program" will be established with participation of several upper level undergraduate students with representation from underrepresented groups in an earthquake reconnaissance mission after the next major earthquake. This participation is expected to provide a life-changing experience for the students and to motivate them for long-term commitment to earthquake engineering.</AbstractNarration>
