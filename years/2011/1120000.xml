<AbstractNarration>The proposed project is to refine and disseminate a cyber-enabled learning system on microcontroller technologies that the PIs developed in a Type 1 CCLI project and make it adaptable by other institutions.  Assessment of the Type 1 project indicates that the microcontroller curriculum and training system were both effective and efficient in delivering the learning experience required for microelectronics education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Type 2 project is substantially increasing the functionalities of the PIC training system, further testing its capabilities in distance learning, making it more adaptable to other institutions, and expanding its use by other instructors in three regions of the US. The project team will design additional trainer hardware/software, develop distance learning management tools, and add 6 course modules that fit into electrical and computer engineering and engineering technology curricula.  One hundred and twenty faculty members from 2-year and 4-year institutions and high schools across the country will be trained to use the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed PIC training system has potential for large scale adoption not only because of its effectiveness and efficiency, but also the possibility of commercialization. The low relative cost for this system makes it attractive to a broad spectrum of electronics teachers from high school to community college to university level. The effort of this project will contribute to the education of the next generation of microcontroller designers and technicians and help to maintain US leadership in the area of microcontroller technologies.</AbstractNarration>
