<AbstractNarration>The shelf break front is one of the most salient features of the regional oceanography of the Middle Atlantic Bight, both in terms of its physics and biology.  Processes associated with the shelf break front are inherently nonlinear and exhibit variations over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales.  The shelf-break frontal jet, subject to local instabilities, meanders along the shelf break and interacts with winds, continental shelf eddies and slope sea warm-core rings.  The shelf-break region also has significant along- and cross-shelf fluxes of heat, salt and nutrients that are subject to modification by frontal meandering, winds and impinging warm-core rings.  Despite many years of study in the region, many scientific questions related to meandering of the shelf break front, bottom boundary layer dynamics, and cross-shelf exchange remain unanswered.  The primary objectives of the proposed research are to understand characteristics of the shelf-break frontal meandering south of New England, its underlying dynamics, and effects of frontal meandering and other forcing mechanisms on cross-frontal exchanges.  The proposed research will consist of analysis of historical and forthcoming Pioneer Array observations and idealized numerical simulations to:  reveal the formation and evolution of large amplitude shelf-break frontal meandering south of New England; diagnose characteristics of the frontal meandering; investigate the effects of frontal meandering, winds and warm-core rings on flows in the shelf-break bottom boundary layer; investigate the effects of frontal meandering, winds and warm-core rings on cross-frontal exchange; and examine the along-shelf and vertical variations of the cross-frontal exchange. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  Numerical simulations will be used in conjunction with analysis of historical and forthcoming observations to address fundamental scientific questions concerning dynamics of frontal meandering at the New England shelf break and effects of frontal meandering and other forces on cross-frontal exchange.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Better understanding of meanders of the shelf break front and cross-frontal exchange will provide the physical background for studies of biological productivity and contaminant dispersal at the shelf break.  This project has implications for commercial fisheries and marine conservation.  Results of this project will be communicated to general public and K- 12 students, and also used for future outreach effort providing informal education materials including video and multi-media presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project was aimed at exploring the dynamics of the shelfbreak front south of New England.  This feature, which includes a strong jet with currents as strong as 2 knots at times, is important in local commercial fisheries and the overall biological productivity of the continental shelf and slope.  The primary scientific publication from our work focused on developing a relationship between the structure of the shelfbreak front and its associated jet and the wavelength of large amplitude waves which are commonly observed along the front (Figure 1).  We developed a simple formula for the largest waves as well as a time scale over which these waves grow to a large amplitude.  The wavelength depends on the density difference between water masses of the continental shelf and slope as well as the bottom slope, the cross-shelf span of the front, and the tilt of the density field within the front.  The model predictions are consistent with the scales of the observed frontal waves and the formula can be used to determine, under different density differences, jet speeds, and tilt of the density field, how large the wavelength of these frontal waves would be and how quickly they would form.  This work has been presented in Rhode Island to commercial fishermen and we have been interacting with them and sharing information about conditions at the shelfbreak for several years.  A key question we examined in another study was whether the frontal upwelling at the shelfbreak front led to enhanced biomass.  Satellite measurements of chlorophyll have not consistently shown seasonally averaged maxima at the shelfbreak, and yet one would expect higher values because of the persistent upwelling within the front.  We found, using a sophisticated numerical modeling incorporating nutrients, phytoplankton, and zooplankton, that zooplankton grazing kept phytoplankton (and by extension chlorophyll) values down, and that high values of mortality for phytoplankton was necessary to keep the system in balance.  This has significant implications for transfer of energy between trophic levels and helps to explain why the shelfbreak is such a biologically productive area and significant for commercial fisheries.  With the recent construction of the Ocean Observatories Initiative Pioneer Array, we have had tremendous opportunities to learn more about the scales of variability near the shelfbreak front and the variety of processes that contribute to exchange of waters between the deep ocean and continental shelf.  We examined the length scales of variability using a four month glider deployment.  The scales of variability were consistent with a prior study, 40 km, and also with the results of our non-linear model mentioned above.  We also examined, using engineering test data from the Pioneer Array, the effects of a large northward diversion of the Gulf Stream that led to very high salinities on the continental shelf (within the top 0.5 per cent of historical salinity values).  We also used the early Pioneer Array data before commissioning to study a new type of feature, which we called the PinocchioÆs Nose Intrusion.  This feature, which carries Gulf Stream water along the outer edge of the continental shelf for hundreds of kilometers, also carries a significant amount of salt and heat onto the continental shelf.  To summarize, our project advanced both theoretical and observational understanding of a significant ocean feature with important ecosystem and economic implications for commercial fisheries.  We used early data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative and learned how to use this data to study important ocean variability.  At every stage of the process, we shared our results with the general public, including press releases for the papers on the Gulf Stream diversion and the PinocchioÆs Nose Intrusion.  We have also been in close contact with the Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation in Rhode Island, sharing preliminary results and presenting comp...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
