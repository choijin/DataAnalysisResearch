<AbstractNarration>The widespread adoption of multicore processors requires multithreaded&lt;br/&gt;software to exploit these hardware resources.  Unfortunately, the&lt;br/&gt;construction and validation of reliable concurrent software currently&lt;br/&gt;requires extraordinary effort, due to unanticipated interactions&lt;br/&gt;between concurrent threads.  Thus, developing better programming&lt;br/&gt;techniques and tools for concurrent programming is essential.  This&lt;br/&gt;research develops a cooperative programming methodology for&lt;br/&gt;multithreaded software, based on the philosophy that all thread&lt;br/&gt;interference must be explicitly documented via source-level "yield"&lt;br/&gt;annotations by the programmer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate both static and dynamic checking&lt;br/&gt;techniques to verify the correctness of yield annotations.  Once&lt;br/&gt;verified, these annotations guarantee that code executed between&lt;br/&gt;successive yields is serializable and thus amenable to sequential&lt;br/&gt;reasoning.  Moreover, yield-free code is deterministic.  Despite&lt;br/&gt;provided these strong safety guarantees, this methodology does not&lt;br/&gt;impact program performance.  The cooperative methodology provides a&lt;br/&gt;robust foundation for multithreaded software and can potentially&lt;br/&gt;transform the principles and practices of multithreaded software&lt;br/&gt;engineering.  This work on cooperability will also provide research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and it will&lt;br/&gt;support endeavors to provide access to science education for all&lt;br/&gt;students.</AbstractNarration>
