<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports the renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Washington. Hooked on Photonics (HoP) is a 10-week REU program where undergraduates participate in research involving the development of photonic materials and devices with applications ranging from telecommunications to light-emitting devices to alternative energy.  A unique aspect of HoP is that participants are located on the three campuses:  University of Washington, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of Arizona.  The advantages of a multi-campus REU program include leveraged recruiting and educational efforts, substantial program evaluation, and increased diversity of research activities.  The HoP program includes research, content lectures, ethics training, career seminars, and scientific-presentation skill workshops.  In addition to advancing photonics research, the goals of HoP are to (1) provide academically appropriate research experiences for lower-level undergraduate students who traditionally have had limited access to research (community college students and students from primarily undergraduate institutions), and (2) increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities who successfully complete Bachelor's and advanced degrees in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
