<AbstractNarration>The PIs propose several investigations in computational arithmetic geometry.  These include the further development of generic group algorithms and numerical  computation of p-adic cohomology, the further investigation of the distribution  of Frobenius eigenvalues of curves of low genus, and the efficient computation  and tabulation of modular polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational arithmetic geometry in general, and the proposed research in  particular, bears relevance to several aspects of applied computer science,  including the reliable transmission and storage of digital data and the  security of electronic communication.  In addition to research, the proposed  activities also include undergraduate participation in algorithm and software  development, integrating research and training activities while producing tools of high value to the research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of arithmetic geometry is to better understand Diophantine equations; these are polynomial equations in two or more variables with integer coefficients. Such equations play a crucial role in number theory (Fermat's Last Theorem, for example), and they have many practical applications, including the reliable transmission of data over noisy channels and data security. An important example of the latter involves elliptic curves, equations of the form y2 = x3 + Ax + B.  Elliptic curves play a crucial role in what has become the most widely used cryptographic protocol for establishing a secure internet connection and are now used by 9 of the 10 internet destinations in the United States.  One of the primary goals of this project was to create computational tools that allow number theorists to investigate statistical properties of certain Diophantine equations. For example, the Sato-Tate conjecture is concerned with the distribution of the number of solutions to elliptic curve equations when one replaces equality with the weaker notion of congruence modulo a prime number p; rather than requiring the two sides of the equation to be exactly equal, we allow them to differ by a multiple of p. One can then count the number of pairs (x,y) for which such a congruence modulo p holds and ask how this number varies with p.  Remarkably, regardless of the integers A and B that we choose, there are just two possible shapes that this distribution can have when the equation is nonsingular. This fact was conjectured nearly 50 years ago and only recently proved, thanks to the work of Richard Taylor and others, utilizing some of the same techniques that were used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem.  There is a natural generalization of the Sato-Tate conjecture to more general equations that remains unproved, but as a result of this project we now have computational tools that allow us to compute these distributions to a level of precision that is many orders of magnitude greater than was possible just five years ago. These tools played a key role in the classification of Sato-Tate distributions for genus two curves obtained by the PI in collaboration with other researchers, which precisely characterizes the 34 distributions that can arise for equations of the form y2 = f(x) when f is an integer polynomial of degree 5 or 6, assuming the generalized Sato-Tate conjecture. Examples of these distributions are shown in the attached figures.  There are many other applications for the computational tools created by this project. These include theoretical investigations of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and explicit aspects of the Langlands program (two major open problems in mathematics), as well as important practical applications, such as elliptic and hyperelliptic curve cryptography.
