<AbstractNarration>The Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) Workshops, held in alternating years since 2005, bring together the world's experts in a forum recognized internationally for its singular contributions to the fundamental understanding of the most basic building blocks of matter, the neutron and proton constituents of the atomic nucleus. This year's PWA Workshop will be held at the Foggy Bottom Campus of The George Washington University under the auspices of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences' Center for Nuclear Studies (CNS), which has been chartered since November of 1990 and is universally recognized as an academic leader in the field of the physics of the atomic nucleus. Currently, activity is very high in fundamental and precision nucleon physics. Many recent developments in the field have signaled a reinvigorated interest in and support for the PWA program at the national level, which has been led by the Data Analysis Center (DAC) housed in the CNS since 1998. These developments include the construction of Jefferson Laboratory's 12-GeV Upgrade, which represents substantial commitment at the federal level for equipment and infrastructure supporting the precision nucleon physics program. The nucleon physics program at Jefferson Laboratory is part of an international effort in precision experimental nuclear physics including efforts in Europe and Japan. A wealth of precision data is forthcoming from laboratories both in the United States and international institutions. These new experimental physics efforts have ushered in a renaissance in theoretical and analytical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of broader impact, this year's PWA Workshop will bring specialists and experts together who are presently involved in the analysis of existing and forthcoming experiments on nucleon and hadron physics. Workshop attendees will include students, postdoctoral researchers, and both younger and more experienced faculty and researchers. We will focus on time-sensitive and critical issues addressed to the success of precision nucleon physics experimental programs. Substantial support from Jefferson Laboratory indicates the recognition of the importance of PWA and the work of the DAC and CNS to the success of the program. Beside techniques to be exchanged an important issue is the planning of future experiments to ensure the success of the program.</AbstractNarration>
