<AbstractNarration>The High Performance Design, Build and Operations (HP-DBO) project is to supply regional building related industries with workers who are skilled in sustainable development particularly for the conditions in the Pacific Northwest.  The project builds on previous activities to provide professional development to faculty and teachers in fields such as architectural drafting and design, building construction technology, building maintenance technology, energy management and landscape technology in the Pacific Northwest on sustainable development.  Regional businesses in these fields have already identified the need for workers educated in sustainable technologies, which minimizes impact on ecosystems and maximizes resource efficiency.  The Summer Sustainability Institutes introduce 60 instructors annually to broad concepts, theories and issues central to sustainable design, building and operations so that they can incorporate them into their courses.  Activities to help instructors address the needs of underrepresented minorities will be provided.  Fourteen instructors participate in funded externships with regional industry.  Sustainability-related educational materials and videos are developed and disseminated through a website.  Scholarships are provided to increase the diversity of students in the program.  An evaluation measures the extent to which the activities lead to the goal.</AbstractNarration>

The impact of the grant(s) created significant outcomes and changes for related Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs throughout the Pacific Northwest. Critical to the success of the grant activities was the timing of the project relative to the introduction of new federal, state and local high performance design, build and operations requirements.   The projectÆs broader impacts were extensive for departments, instructors and students.  The OCATE project was designed to focus on training for high school and college educators.  OCATE provided professional industry externships as well as summer training programs. Within PCC, OCATE supported externship opportunities for the Landscape Technology Department.  For Landscape Tech, the externships resulted in a redesigned program focusing on water-use reduction, xeriscaping, and native plant use.  Most importantly and unexpectedly, the externship experiences of working in industry for ten (10) weeks revitalized relationships with industry resulting in a bigger presence of industry in the departmentÆs decision making.  Landscaping tech was the last of five (Architectural Design, Building Construction Technology, Interior Design, and Facilities Maintenance) PCC CTE Departments to be impacted by the NSF ATE grant, all of which are related to residential and small commercial building design, building and operations.  .  The OCATE project provided externships for Bates Technical CollegeÆs Maintenance Engineering Department and shorter, summertime externships for IdahoÆs Construction Technology instructors.  College instructors from North Idaho College and College of Southern Idaho participated as well as most high school Construction Tech teachers across Idaho.  Overall, the OCATE externship program provided externships to 30 instructors, changing, updating, and revitalizing 24 different college and high school programs.   OCATE also impacted design, build and operations teachers throughout the Pacific Northwest through our Summer Sustainability Institute (SSI).  There were two SSI opportunities. The first opportunity was a weeklong training event held in Portland OR. Teachers from across the region committed to changing two courses when enrolled.  The SSI involved 32 participants over two years, resulting in the revision of 64 college courses. The second SSI opportunity was held each summer as a three (3) day event connected to the annual Idaho Professional Technical Education Summer Conference.  We successfully attracted 24 of the stateÆs 27 Construction Tech educators from deep in the mountains or way out on their farms.  OCATE also produced a number of training support items for teachers to incorporate into their training. One of the most used products was a series of 12 demonstration videos linked on the projectÆs website: www.locate-stte.org.  The videos had thousands of views and were created due to demand rather than just another "resource" on the shelf.  The website also houses examples of curriculum changes from college-level instructors in the design, build and operations fields.  We also edited the construction technology math book and increased the distribution of the math book to most of the Idaho high school construction tech programs.  The math book was originally written from an unrelated NSF grant in the early 2000Æs and is now being used by 15 high school construction tech programs in Oregon and Idaho and in the Building Construction Tech program at PCC.  Intellectual merit outcomes of the project impact: 1) PCC; 2) much of the Pacific Northwest-based design, build and operations ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
