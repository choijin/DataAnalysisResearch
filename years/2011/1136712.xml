<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium aims to bring together researchers working on quantifying nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;carrier transport processes in excitonic solar cell devices. Excitonic solar cells, including allorganic, hybrid organic-inorganic and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), offer strong&lt;br/&gt;potential for inexpensive and large-area solar energy conversion.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium strongly encourages the participation of underrepresented groups,&lt;br/&gt;including Hispanics, Native Americans, and women, through appropriate travel and&lt;br/&gt;registration support. Specific efforts to encourage their participation include: distribution&lt;br/&gt;of information encouraging women/ethic minorities, researchers from undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;educational institutions along with abstract acceptance.</AbstractNarration>
