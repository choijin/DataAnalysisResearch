<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to understand how changes in water table, vegetation, and microbes affect carbon storage in peatlands.  Peatlands are wetlands that accumulate carbon because high water tables inhibit decomposition. More extreme summer drought in recent decades has caused large mid-summer declines in peatland water tables.  Lower peatland water tables could cause carbon dioxide release to the atmosphere by accelerating peat decomposition and, in addition, cause changes in peatland plant community composition and microbial assemblages. In this study, a peatland mesocosm facility, where both water table and plant communities can be experimentally controlled, will be used to assess how water table and vegetation combine to affect microbial communities and carbon cycling in peatlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peatlands represent 3-5% of the land surface, but harbor 12-30% of global soil organic carbon. This large amount of carbon is vulnerable to release back to the atmosphere if environmental conditions change.  Insights from the proposed work will provide options for natural resource management and inform ecosystem models describing the plant communities, microbial dynamics, and carbon storage or release within northern peatlands in the face of climate change.  In addition, a new Wetland Ecology Teachers Institute will be initiated in collaboration with the Michigan Tech Center for Science and Environmental Outreach to expose teachers from all over the nation to cutting edge research in peatlands and other wetlands.</AbstractNarration>

We altered the plant communities to be dominated by either sedges or heath shrubs related to blueberries and cranberries. These two groups have many different traits that were hypothesized to alter carbon cycling and greenhouse gases.  Primary Findings:  Our experiment allowed us to measure all aspects of the carbon cycle during simulated plant species shifts and drought conditions.  Previous studies have shown that sedge communities typically do better in seasonally wet or flooded areas whereas shrubs  perform better when conditions are drier, allowing for more oxygen in the root zone. In summary, we found greater decomposition, peat subsidence, and carbon loss to the atmosphere in drought conditions, which is consistent with other studies.  In addition, we also found the plant species that were there affected the amount and type of greenhouse gases produced.   An important finding of this study is that changing plant communities can be as important as drought in changing peat carbon cycling.  Sedges deliver oxygen deep in the peat soil from air-filled tubes in their root systems which increased decomposition, peat subsidence, and increased the mobility of mercury (per unit carbon).  The shrub communities also affected peat decomposition through their relatively shallow root system and unique suite of root-associated symbiotic fungi. While we found drought greatly increased the decomposition of some plant materials (cellulose), the presence of shrubs reduced decomposition of some more complex plant tissues (whole Sphagnum moss litter). Sphagnum moss litter makes up the bulk of the carbon stored in peatlands, so any changes in its decomposition could have large impacts. Taken together, these findings suggest that increases in shrub communities in drier climates with a lower water table might reduce some of the carbon losses through decomposition associated with drier peat.   However, the total impact on greenhouse gases has to be considered in the context of other carbon losses, such as the production of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Drought treatment and plant community type also affected the release of methane.  In wetter conditions, methane fluxes were higher overall, but lower in sedge-only plots compared to unmanipulated and shrub-only plots.  Overall, these data suggest the oxygen introduced by sedge root systems promotes carbon dioxide production, and may inhibit methane production.  This significant interaction between vegetation and drying of peatlands in affecting methane fluxes highlight the importance of including plant community dynamics in models of methane production.   Methane is produced in the absence of oxygen (deeper in the peat), and consumed as food by microbes in its presence (near the surface). We found less methane consumption when heath shrubs were present and more methane consumption in sedge root systems, particularly in the top 40 cm of peat.  When we used DNA-based methods to examine the microbes that produce and consume methane, we f...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
