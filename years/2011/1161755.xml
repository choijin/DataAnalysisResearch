<AbstractNarration>This research project investigates what can be done before an event to improve inter-agency communication and coordination during a disaster.  Due to a number of social, economic, developmental, physical and environmental factors, natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires are anticipated to increase.  Consequently, we need to have a better understanding of how communities can respond to and better prepare for disasters.   This project is unique in two ways.  First, it will examine whether factors like attachment to community, inter-organizational relationships, and network leadership are associated with better community preparedness.  Second, the research will measure these factors in communities ahead of a disaster to see if they lead to better communication and coordination when an actual disaster happens.  Wildfires, because they are one of the most commonly occurring natural disasters in the United States, are the focal events of this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from the research will help improve disaster management by providing information that can inform how the many agencies, organizations, and groups involved in disaster preparedness and response can better organize themselves to create more disaster resilient communities.  These lessons for better disaster management will be communicated directly to partner agencies and organizations, such as the U.S Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management, National Incident Management Organization and various state and local wildfire response organizations.  The investigators will also share this work more broadly with the interested public, as well as professional and academic audiences.  Conducting the research will provide opportunities for student training, as well as expand research partnerships with leaders in key agencies interested in disaster scholarship.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To date, this study has made several significant contributions in the realms of methodology, theory, and practice.   Methodologically, we developed  advanced procedures for how to empirically bound and measure performance within disaster response networks.  Historically, applications of social network methodologies have relied heavily on convenience samples of archival information such as daily briefing or news reports.  This study developed and executed a standardized protocol of network identification and bounding that created comparable network datasets across over 100 at risk communities pre-disaster and subset of 21 communities that actually experienced a large scale wildfire.  Doing so required that we grapple with theoretical and methodological challenges associated with defining the boundaries of latent disaster networks.  In Faas, Velez, Nowell, and Steelman (under review), we provide a detailed account of our methodological approach for how such networks could be conceptualized and operationalized to allow for longitudinal comparability pre- and post disaster across multiple disaster sites to inform future research. In Nowell, Velez, Hano, Sudweeks, Albrecht and Steelman (under review), we investigate the methodological and theoretical tradeoffs associated with this process of network boundary determination and offer a decision rubric for informing future research on what methods may be most appropriate under what situations.    In Nowell, Steelman, Velez, and Godette (in press), we investigate the issue of pluralism in evaluations of network performance across responders.  Using hierarchical linear modeling techniques, we find evidence of significant pluralism within our disaster response networks.   This finding is significant - particularly in the study of disaster response networks - as it provides a theoretical challenge to whole network based performance measures that fail to consider whose perspective on performance is being privileged in the use of such measures.      Substantively, findings from this project have provided insight into idealized structures of network governance during complex wildfire events.  In Nowell, Steelman, Velez, and Yang (under review), we present findings that support an idealized structure of network governance that resembles a moderate core periphery structure with a strong emphasis on redundant bilateral ties between functional groupings and extensive use of trusted brokers. We believe this structure holds great promise for re-envisioning the incident command system as articulated through national policy (i.e., NIMS) away from a command- centric view to one in which incident command structures are more accurately and productively viewed and managed as part of a broader structure of network governance. We develop these ideas further in a policy piece manuscript entitled 'Beyond ICS: How should we govern complex disasters in the United States?' that is currently under review with the journal Disasters.     Findings from this project to date have also offered new insight into patterns of intra and intergovernmental conflict and collaboraton during large scale wildfire events.  Findings   indicate that perceptions of a mission alignment, or lack thereof, represent a critical component of social-organizational resilience to disasters(Fleming, McCartha, and Steelman, 2015).   Findings further indicate that federal actors {i.e., USFS] perceived greater ability to manage conflicts based on competing missions with other federal actors relative to actors across different levels of government (local and state).   Cumulatively, in addition to advancing theories of federalism, these findings empirically illuminate areas where greater mission incongruence and potential conflict is most likely on large scale wildfire events involving multi-jurisdictions across local, state and federal land agencies.       Last, findings from this project to date have led to additional insights into the actors that other responders trust to play bridging roles within the network during a large scale wildfire event as well as those actors who end up playing these roles.  In press with Disasters (Faas, Velez, Fitzgerald, Nowell, and Steelman, forthcoming),  findings reveal patterns based on principles of homophily in who actors trust and prefer as liaisons/bridgers in the network.  Further, findings revealed that the preferred bridgers were frequently not mobilized into these roles suggesting a disconnect between those actors who may have the greater social capital to act in liaison roles within the network and those actors generally assigned to or assuming those roles.    With regards to impact to practice, this project was developed within the tradition of action research and included pre-fire readiness reports disseminated to over 1500 incident responders in OR, ID, WA, and MT as well as  individualized technical reports on network performance developed for 21 different large wildfire incidents.  The specific impact of this outreach and engagement is difficult to quantify beyond its reach.  Anecdotally, we've observed a significant shift in conversations of the incident commanders. The notion of a disaster response network has increasingly entered the vernacular of the Type 1 incident commanders.  We are also  hearing an increased focus on how to build network capacity within the context of national policy discussions around the Cohesive Strategy - a policy framework currently being promoted by the USFS Fire and Aviation Management as well as other land agencies.
