<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14 July 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1119881&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Miami&lt;br/&gt;PI:   R. Kniffin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests two Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V WALTON SMITH which is operated by the University of Miami; namely conversion of one trawl winch and drum to 3/8" wire rope and a new Oily Water Separator.  These items will either improve safety, enhance the science support capability, and/or allow the vessel to meet current regulatory requirements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The R/V WALTON SMITH  supports federally funded scientific research in the southern Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, and educational cruises.  The WALTON SMITH  is scheduled to complete approximately 50 NSF sponsored days in 2011.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This SSSE award allowed University of Miami's Research Vessel F.G. Walton Smith to purchase an Oily Water Seperator and Lebus shell.  The Recovered Energy - MEPC 107(49) Certified OWS-Boss 2.2T/107 2.2 gpm oily water seperator (OWS) system was installed aboard the ship in the starboard side engine room. This OWS was the smallest OWS that could be purchased but it is the largest that will fit in the ship. Modifications were made to the engine room area where the unit was installed as well as some fabrication of the hardware and materials used for mounting and installing the system.  There were some issues with the manufacturer/installer about the purchase order.  In the end the ship's crew provided the man power to install the new OWS according to specs.   A new Hawboldt 3/8" Conversion including Lebus shell, level wind sprocket, chain, sheave, and overboarding sheave were purchased from Hawboldt Industries and installed on port side winch, one of two Hawboldt winches aboard.  The new Lebus shell allowed the ship to convert one of their oceanographic winch drums from &frac12;" 3X19 wire rope to 3/8" 3X19" wire rope. Under this configuration the ship now has the capacity to deploy up to 4,300 meters of wire to perform multi-cores and similar operations as well as allowing for larger trawl nets.
