<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1154940           PI:  Wolf, Sandra             ORG:  Materials Research Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Support for Fall 2011 MRS Symposium Biomaterials for Tissue Regeneration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  Tissue engineering is an emerging field, which has major potential to improve human health by repairing and maintaining existing organs or regenerating  new ones.  This potential can be realized through a combination of a scaffold matrix, progenitor cells, and/or bioactive agents to form a tissue engineering construct to promote organ repair.  Biomaterials play a crucial role in tissue regeneration.  Although technical advances have been made, success to date has been limited due to current lack of understanding of the regenerative process in native tissues, the complexity of the 3D environment, and our ability to identify and recapitulate the appropriate cues that promote functional cellular and tissue growth.  Understanding and utilization of tissue engineering scaffolds, scaffold-biomaterials interactions, and in vivo scaffold performance are central to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and are closely related to the scientific interests in the Biomaterials Program (DMR) at the National Science Foundation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  The aim of this symposium is to collect and present a broad range of areas in biomaterials developments for regenerative medicine and to stimulate innovative research ideas among scientists and researchers from different disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
