<AbstractNarration>Cloud computing offers IT organizations the ability to create&lt;br/&gt;geo-distributed, and highly scalable applications while providing&lt;br/&gt;attractive cost-saving advantages. Yet, architecting, configuring, and&lt;br/&gt;adapting cloud applications (latency-sensitive web applications and&lt;br/&gt;bulk data processing applications) to meet their stringent performance&lt;br/&gt;requirements is a challenge given the rich set of configuration&lt;br/&gt;options, shared multi-tenant nature of cloud platforms, and dynamics&lt;br/&gt;resulting from activities such as planned maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing novel methodologies, algorithms, and&lt;br/&gt;systems that can enable application architects to (1) judiciously&lt;br/&gt;architect applications across multiple cloud data-centers while&lt;br/&gt;considering application performance requirements, cost saving&lt;br/&gt;objectives, and cloud pricing schemes guided by performance and cost&lt;br/&gt;models of cloud components; (2) automatically learn effective&lt;br/&gt;application configurations and configuration-to-performance prediction&lt;br/&gt;models through statistical machine learning techniques; and (3) create&lt;br/&gt;applications that can adapt to ongoing dynamics in cloud environments&lt;br/&gt;through transaction reassignment over shorter time-scales, and&lt;br/&gt;application migration over longer time-scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this research is multi-fold: (1) Enable IT organizations&lt;br/&gt;to significantly reduce costs by optimally moving their operations to&lt;br/&gt;the cloud; (2) create benchmarks based on operationally deployed&lt;br/&gt;applications and collecting workload traces which will be made&lt;br/&gt;available to the research community; (3) make developed algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;systems widely available as open source software; (4) inform the&lt;br/&gt;design of a nation-wide health-care cloud in Thailand; (4) introduce&lt;br/&gt;cloud computing related topics in the undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;curriculum; and (6) train multiple Ph.D., M.S., and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students, with explicit effort to recruit and train students from&lt;br/&gt;under-represented minority groups.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The outcomes of this project have drastically improved the flexibility of the cloud infrastructure and the performance of applications in the cloud. We have developed a live virtual machine migration progress management system called Pacer that enables migration time prediction, application interference minimization, and migration deadline selection and enforcement. We have developed a multi-tier application migration system called COMMA, and develop a new communication-cost-driven coordinated approach for virtual machine migration to minimize disruption to multi-tier applications during migration. We have developed new methodologies for application-specific configuration selection in the cloud through a detailed study of Amazon EC2's performance variations and policies (e.g. rate limitation, virtualization, CPU scheduling, resource allocation, etc.). Based on this understanding of the impact of provider policy, we have developed algorithms for selecting cloud configurations that can best meet the cost and performance requirements of applications. We have further extended this work by collaborating with Burstorm, a CAD application vendor for cloud architects, and benchmarked the performance of seven cloud service suppliers (including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Rackspace, HP, Linode, and Softlayer) across three continents with a total of 96 different instance types. Using these results, cloud application developers can optimally choose the cloud service for their price-performance requirements. We have developed topological flexibility through reconfigurable network hardware called OmniSwitch as a method for adapting multi-tenant cloud network to tenant workload by provisioning bandwidth for cloud tenants and reducing transmission hop count at low computation cost. We have developed a new cloud file system called Pfimbi that supports flow-controlled asynchronous data replication to accelerate jobs, exploit under-utilized storage I/O bandwidth, and support hierarchical storage I/O bandwidth allocation policies.
