<AbstractNarration>For vascular plants the phloem network is responsible for the transport of nutrients and signaling components, including small molecules, macromolecules and nucleic acids.  The movement of these components is essential to plant metabolism, development and pathogen defense.  Plant viruses hijack the phloem network to promote their own systemic movement and because of this represent a unique system in which to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control the trafficking of mobile components within the phloem.  The goals of this project focus on understanding how viruses reprogram phloem specific tissues to mediate their own movement.  Using a Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) - Arabidopsis model system, efforts in this study will exploit TMV?s ability to reprogram cellular transcription through an interaction with phloem specific IAA transcription factors.  IAA factors are components of the plant's auxin response system and play an essential role in many aspects of plant development, metabolism and defense.  Specific efforts in this project will focus on examining the localization of virus interacting IAA proteins; investigating how IAA proteins affect the virus's ability to move within specific phloem cell types; and identifying the transcriptional targets of virus interacting IAA proteins and their potential role in virus mediated phloem transport.  Combined results from this study will significantly advance our understanding of virus movement via the phloem and shed new light on the mechanisms that plants use to transport molecules to distal tissues.  The broader goals of this project involve the educational integration of virology and plant biology disciplines for the training of post-doctoral, graduate, undergraduate and high school students with an emphasis placed on encouraging undergraduate and high school level students to consider advanced training in these important areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For vascular plants the phloem network is responsible for the transport of nutrients and signaling components, including small molecules, macromolecules and nucleic acids.  The movement of these components has a vital role in mediating plant metabolism, development and defense.  However, the molecular mechanisms that control the trafficking of these mobile components within the phloem network remain largely unknown.  The phloem network also provides an essential avenue for the systemic transport of viruses.   Current evidence indicates that viruses modify existing plant transport mechanisms to move long distances between tissues of different age and function. The goals of this project focus on understanding how viruses reprogram phloem specific tissues to mediate their own movement.  Using a Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) &ndash; Arabidopsis model system, the ability of TMV to reprogram cellular transcription through an interaction with phloem specific IAA transcription factors was investigated.  IAA factors are components of the plantÆs auxin hormone response system and play an essential role in many aspects of plant development, metabolism and defense.  Results from this study clearly demonstrated that virus infection disrupts the normal nuclear localization pattern of interacting IAA factors inside phloem companion cells.  Furthermore, virus mediated disruption of IAA localization correlates with the ability of this virus to move into vascular tissues and spread systemically throughout the plant.  Analysis of the transcriptional changes driven by interacting IAA factors identified plant genes involved in defense responses, virus cell to cell movement and the regulation of intercellular plasmodesmata connections.  Viruses use plasmodesmata to move from one cell to the next and the ability to control the regulation of these intercellular connections represents a significant advantage, allowing viruses that interact with IAA factors to out compete viruses that do not encode this interaction.  Additional studies analyzing ribosome-associated transcripts within the vascular phloem of healthy and virus-infected plants identify similar transcriptional changes affecting plasmodesmata regulation and host defense processes occurring in the plants vascular tissues upon infection.  Combined, these studies demonstrate a mechanism whereby viruses such as TMV selectively reprogram the vascular tissues of their hosts to promote their own infection and disease.  Since viruses usurp existing host processes this study also sheds new light on the mechanisms that plants use to transport molecules to distal tissues.  A function that is critical for plant growth and maintenance.  The impact of this research is expected to extend beyond the Arabidopsis system as similar IAA protein - virus interactions have been identified in tomato and other agriculturally important crops.  In addition, most plant viruses depend upon phloem-mediated movement to spread systemically and cause disease, thus, information gained from this study should result in new strategies for the control of this important group of pathogens.   The broader goals of this project involve the educational integration of virology and plant biology disciplines for the training of post-doctoral, graduate, undergraduate and high school students.  Specific to this project three high school student, four undergraduate students, one graduate student and one postdoctoral student received training and mentoring in theses fields.
