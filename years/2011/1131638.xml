<AbstractNarration>In the 1960s, plate tectonics, a model of the Earth based on the notion that the surface of our planet is paved with a mosaic of rigid plates that move large distances of geologic time, revolutionized the geological sciences and explained the distribution of dangerous earthquakes and hazardous volcanoes. The societal relevance of plate tectonics is hard to overestimate. Yet even then, there were hints that there are regions affected by diffuse deformation, where the rigid plate model does not entirely apply. Just how and why diffuse deformation occurs is not well understood, and a thorough analysis is long overdue. The project will address that problem, in a systematic way, for the first time by quantifying the rheology and dynamics of diffuse plate boundaries using thin viscous sheet models. The chief broader impact of this work lies in its implications for our understanding the working of our planet at the most fundamental level. The work also has more specific implications for improving hazards due to earthquakes and volcanoes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plate tectonics has transformed the way that humans perceive their planet.  Considerable evidence supports the theory of plate tectonics, and it is widely accepted by scientists.  Nonetheless, some regions of the Earth do not conform to the original tenets of plate tectonics&mdash;that tectonic plates are rigid and that the boundaries between them are narrow.  An interesting example is the Earth beneath the Indian Ocean between the Java-Sumatra trench and the Central Indian and Southeast Indian Ridges.  There the oceanic lithosphere (the strong outer layer of the solid Earth that comprises the tectonic plates) deforms in a broad zone that is &gt; 1000 km across as viewed on a map, which is much wider than typical plate boundaries, which are a few km wide.  This region has been the site of some of the largest and deadliest earthquakes of this century.  These earthquakes are destructive not only because of the damage done directly by the earthquakes, but also by the tsunamis that are triggered by the earthquakes.  This project focused on modeling the deformation in this region over a map-view distance scale of many thousands of kilometers.  To simplify the problem to two-dimensions rather than three, we did not explicitly model variations in properties with depth in oceanic lithosphere, which varies in thickness from a few kilometers for newly created lithosphere at mid-ocean ridges to perhaps 80 km thick for lithosphere that is 100 million years old or older.  Instead we represent a unit of map-view area of lithosphere by its vertically integrated properties.  This is sometimes referred to as a "thin sheet" approximation.  Laboratory experiments indicate that lithospheric deformation processes vary with depth.  At depths less than a few tens of kilometers, the Earth deforms brittlely, that is, mainly by fracturing of rock or sliding of rock along pre-existing fractures or faults as occurs, for example, during earthquakes.  At greater depths in the Earth, stresses relax in the solid state without the formation of fractures or frictional sliding.  The deformation of rock at greater depths is similar to that of metals at surface conditions.  For example, a metal coat hanger can be bent without forming fractures.  At these greater depths, deformation can be modeled as that of a viscous fluid.  When the lower lithosphere and the upper lithosphere are considered together, it is found that the two together also behave like a viscous fluid.  This may be surprising because the lithosphere is composed entirely of solid rock with little, if any, melted rock in it.  Two parameters well describe the behavior of a highly viscous fluid.  One parameter is the effective viscosity of the fluid.  It is the ratio between the stress and the rate of strain at a reference strain rate.  The higher the viscosity, the higher the stress needed to deform the viscous fluid at a given rate of strain.   The second parameter is the power-law exponent.  We assume a rheological law for which the strain rate is proportional to the differential stress raised to the nth power where n as the power-law exponent.  For rocks deforming deep in EarthÆs mantle, a typical power-law exponent is n&asymp;3.  In our investigation, we found that the power-law exponent appropriate for the lithosphere as a whole is &asymp;30 to &asymp;100.  From this result we infer that most of the strength of deforming oceanic lithosphere lies in in the upper part of the lithosphere that deforms brittlely.  This contrasts with the results of analogous studies of continental lithosphere, which indicate that the strength of deforming continental lithosphere lies in the deeper layer that deforms in the solid state without fracturing.  Our results help us to understand plate tectonics better than we did before.  It shows that the boundaries between plates are not necessarily narrow.   They suggest that the diffuse deformation zones form when forces exceed the strength of the lithosphere.  It furt...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
