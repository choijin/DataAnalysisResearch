<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1104470&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Helmut Hofer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first subproject will be concerned with the completion of&lt;br/&gt;symplectic field theory (SFT).  This is currently the most&lt;br/&gt;general and most comprehensive theory of symplectic&lt;br/&gt;invariants. There are three ingredients to this project, namely&lt;br/&gt;the polyfold Fredholm theory, the scale-smooth analysis and the&lt;br/&gt;formulation of SFT as an algebraic presentation of the solution&lt;br/&gt;count of a polyfold Fredholm problem with operations.  The second&lt;br/&gt;subproject, a by-product of the polyfold Fredholm theory,&lt;br/&gt;attempts to construct a homology theory based on equivalence&lt;br/&gt;classes of Fredholm problems. The resulting advantage would be&lt;br/&gt;that transversality issues in studying nonlinear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations would actually not occur explicitly. They&lt;br/&gt;would be hidden in the (one-time) proof that the new homology&lt;br/&gt;theory of a space would be naturally isomorphic to the rational&lt;br/&gt;singular homology.  A third subproject is concerned with finite&lt;br/&gt;energy foliations, either in the context of area-preserving&lt;br/&gt;disk-maps or the restricted planar three-body problem. Finite&lt;br/&gt;energy foliations were introduced by the PI and his collaborators&lt;br/&gt;and are an important tool in the study of the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. The restricted circular&lt;br/&gt;planar three-body problem is not only interesting from a purely&lt;br/&gt;academic viewpoint, but is also used in the orbit design for&lt;br/&gt;scientific space missions. In certain regimes of the Jacobi&lt;br/&gt;energy, finite energy foliations allow to reduce the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;the restricted three-body problem to that of the dynamics of an&lt;br/&gt;area-preserving disk-map.  Then again the same theory facilitates&lt;br/&gt;the understanding of the long-term behavior of iterated&lt;br/&gt;area-preserving disk maps. The project will study the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between the theory of finite energy foliations, a&lt;br/&gt;symplectic construction, and core dynamical systems notions like&lt;br/&gt;entropy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a surprising fact that many physical systems evolving in&lt;br/&gt;time, allow a description as a Hamiltonian system. Systems of&lt;br/&gt;this kind describe the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid, the&lt;br/&gt;movement of a satellite under the gravitational forces of&lt;br/&gt;celestial bodies, or the movement of charged particles in a&lt;br/&gt;magnetic field. Hamiltonian systems are a very particular class&lt;br/&gt;of dynamical systems, which can be studied not only by the&lt;br/&gt;methods from dynamical systems theory, but also by a more exotic&lt;br/&gt;kind of geometry called symplectic geometry. This is a geometry&lt;br/&gt;based on the notion of area, in contrast to usual geometries,&lt;br/&gt;which have length and distance as their fundamental&lt;br/&gt;notions. Recent advances in this field already found some&lt;br/&gt;practical uses.  For example, this novel point of view has been&lt;br/&gt;used in accelerator physics in algorithms controlling and&lt;br/&gt;insuring stability of a beam of particles and called symplectic&lt;br/&gt;tracking.  It is the explicit purpose of this research to&lt;br/&gt;integrate the approaches to Hamiltonian systems coming from these&lt;br/&gt;two different perspectives. This should result in new methods,&lt;br/&gt;which should make it possible to attack problems, which so far&lt;br/&gt;seemed unreachable. For example it seems long term be feasible to&lt;br/&gt;use the new methods to develop algorithms, which would find&lt;br/&gt;fuel-efficient orbits for scientific space missions. Current&lt;br/&gt;technology can verify the properties of proposed orbits extremely&lt;br/&gt;fast. However, currently there is no good method for finding such&lt;br/&gt;orbits. It rather compares to finding a needle in a haystack,&lt;br/&gt;using very large amounts of computing time.</AbstractNarration>
