<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Actin filaments are key components of the cellular machinery, vital for a wide range of processes ranging from cell motility to endocytosis. These filaments (called filamentous actin or F-actin) are made of individual monomers of globular actin (G-actin) arranged in double helices. In the cell, actin filaments are not static; they are constantly fluctuating. Therefore, learning about the bending motions of actin filaments and how these bending motions affect specific conformations on the binding surface of actin is an important step in gaining more information about how actin interact with other proteins. In my project, I used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of actin to probe this question.&nbsp;Though the initial question has not been fully answered due to the short duration of the program, I have developed important methodologies in characterizing the bending motion of actin as well as the structural properties on the binding surface of actin. In terms of broader impacts, this project allowed me to interact with an international community of scientists interested in similar research topics and methodologies. Doing research in Singapore has allowed me to become a more independent and resourceful scientist, characteristics that will help me as I progress in my scientific career.
