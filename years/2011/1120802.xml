<AbstractNarration>The International Botanical Congress (IBC) is the largest international conference in plant biology and extends the broadest disciplinary coverage of any such conference.  The IBC is held every six years and will take place in Melbourne, Australia, in 2011.  This grant will support travel for graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty (within three years of first appointment), who are presenting the results of their research, to attend the upcoming IBC.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IBC serves a critical role in international communication within and across disciplines in plant biology, as well as a valuable opportunity to establish international collaborations.  Participation is particularly valuable for young scientists as they establish their careers.  The opportunity to reach so many scientists within any individual discipline creates an unequaled opportunity for exposure by a young scientist.  The once-in-six-years frequency of the Congresses means that for most young scientists, who are about to complete Ph.D.s, find a job, or compete for tenure in their academic institutions, there is only one opportunity to participate in an IBC during these critical stages of professional development.  For the young scientists supported by these travel awards, connections made here will be career-altering and will create life-long collaborations that will enhance their development as scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award enabled a coalition of professional societies that support plant sciences to assist 28 young scientists (Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellows, and beginning faculty) to attend the International Botanical Congress (IBC)  in Melbourne, Australia, July 23-30, 2011.      The IBC is the largest international conference in plant biology and extends the broadest disciplinary coverage of any such conference.  It provides an opportunity for plant scientists of all disciplines to showcase their research to peers from around the world, while fostering communication and collaboration in ways that only can develop from the sort of personal interactions and networking that occur at such conferences.     The IBC is held once every six years.  This opportunity to attend is especially important for early career scientists who are establishing their research programs.  The six-year interval means that for most graduate students and postdocs, this is their only chance to attend an IBC before entering the job market, and for early career faculty this is the only opportunity to do so before promotion and tenure.      A total of 164 applications were received and a committee of senior scientists representing the various professional societies selected the recipients.  All of the participating professional societies emphasize support of students and early career scientists and are committed to increasing diversity in the Plant Sciences.      Ph. D.
