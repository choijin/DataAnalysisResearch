<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will investigate the types of experiences that undergraduate engineering students have to develop global competencies.  Since globalization and technology have "flattened" the world there is an increasing need for engineering students to be able to work in an environment that is increasingly international.  A variety of means, including surveys and interviews, will help the research team understand the range of experiences available to students, as well as what types of experiences best foster global competencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to inform engineering degree programs and university administrators about the range of options available to develop international competencies.  Since such experiences are increasingly important yet potentially expensive, such insights have the potential to inform program development and evolution.  The results of this study, while focusing on engineering, can be generalized to other STEM fields.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is a study of the impact of international experiences on students? preparedness for global workforces. Through this research, we have documented across a sample of institutions that international activities either prior to entering college or while an undergraduate can have a significant effect on improving a student?s global preparedness. An important finding from this research is the role of pre-college international experiences in students? achieving a high degree of global preparedness.  We have observed that a substantial portion of incoming first-year engineering students have already had at least one international experience, which in general, enables them to score significantly higher on measures of global preparedness than those same peers who entered without the benefit of international experience. This appears to be true, even if that experience is personal travel. We also have consistently observed that those engineering students who have participated in international experiences at both the pre-college and undergraduate years, score even higher on measures of global preparedness compared to their peers who have never participated in international activities at the pre-college or college level. Our rich data set obtained from this research enables us to project that if those same students who entered college without an international experience, did have such an experience in college, that experience will only bring them up to the level of those peers that entered having had an international experience.  In addition, if students continue to avoid international activities, their global preparedness will remain where it was upon entrance, or possibly even decline.   Thorough our research, we learned that even the personal international travel which many students have done prior to entering college can tend to raise global preparedness.  Most importantly, this research indicates that the most important factor in raising students global preparedness effect from "small" to "moderate" or even "large" may be participating in a variety of experiences, rather than simply repeating the same type of experiences.   The broader impacts of this research are that for engineering faculty and administrators who wish to have all graduates achieve a higher level of global preparedness would be to first consider pre-college experiences as providing a solid starting point.  Further, to identify those students who come from more rural or small-town backgrounds, and those whose parents? education is at the high school or associate degree level, and who have yet to have an international experience, as prime targets to encourage participating in an international opportunity, possibly motivated with the use of some scholarship funds.  Unless these students are identified and encouraged early, a substantial number of seniors may graduate without the basic knowledge and attitudes to begin to effectively navigate the global engineering environment.  As for those who enter with some international travel experiences and/or have second language ability, they should be encouraged to explore different types of international opportunities in an effort to substantially increase their global preparedness level.  It appears to be that the second international experience, especially if different than the first, may have the largest impact on "moving the global preparedness needle" in a significant upward direction.
