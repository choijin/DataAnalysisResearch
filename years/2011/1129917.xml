<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research grant is to elucidate the mechanism and predictively understand the physics of coiling patterns obtained when thin flexible elastic filaments (rods) are deposited onto rigid substrates. The investigation requires the complementary interplay between high-precision model experiments and computational geometric mechanics codes. An important aspect of the project is the porting of techniques from the field of computer graphics as predictive engineering tools. The first stage of research examines the base configuration, in which a rod is injected onto a static or moving conveyor belt, generating a series of coiling patterns. The transitions between coiling phases are mapped and rationalized through mathematical modeling. The second stage of research examines more complicated forms of loading of the thin rod including (a) torsion as a control parameter to precisely generate the coiling patterns, (b) aerodynamic drag of the hanging filament, and (c) adhesion onto the substrate. The third stage studies coiling over non-flat complex topographies, seeking to develop a generalized statistical description of the resulting coiling trajectories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The construction of more predictive models for the motion of flexible filaments will help addressing engineering problems spanning a wide range of physical scales: from micro-fabrication of electronic components using the coiling of nanotubes, serpentine interconnects for stretchable electronics, and 3D-printing technologies, to the laying down of transoceanic cable and pipelines onto the seabed in a more efficient and resilient manner. A mathematical, physical and scalable understanding of the deformation of filaments is also a step towards addressing the fundamental question of how geometry governs the mechanics of thin structures; a topic that is currently receiving interest from both the physics and mechanics communities. The computational codes developed in this project will be broadly disseminated. These, together with the gained fundamental understanding, will serve as new design tools for engineers and physicists who deal with slender filaments in diverse fields including automotive-, aerospace-, biomedical-, civil-, environmental-, geological-, and mechanical-engineering.</AbstractNarration>

This seemingly simple phenomenon has profound implications for the microfabrication of electronic components, three dimensional printing and deposition of transoceanic cables and pipelines in the ocean bed. The research objective of this project was to predicatively understand the mechanics and the role of geometry in the coiling when a thin elastic rod is deposited onto a rigid substrate. This work was carried out as a collaborative effort between P. Reis (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and E. Grinspun (Columbia University). The interdisciplinary approach combined high-precision model experiments (P. Reis) with computational techniques (E. Grinspun). The computational tools that were developed were made publicly available. The project consisted of two thrusts.  Thrust I focused on the deployment of a rod-like structure onto a moving substrate, as commonly found in a variety engineering applications; from the fabrication of nanotube serpentines to the laying of submarine cables and pipelines. Predictively understanding the resulting coiling patterns is challenging given the nonlinear geometry of deposition.
