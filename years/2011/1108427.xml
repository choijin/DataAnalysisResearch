<AbstractNarration>Understanding the changing Arctic climate requires detailed knowledge of the spatial and radiative properties of Arctic clouds. However, quantifying the relationships between cloud temporal and spatial distribution and radiative impacts requires more continuous and accurate measurements. Important gaps in the capabilities of current satellite- and ground-based cloud sensors can be filled with an Arctic network of ground-based long-wave infrared cloud imagers. This project will deploy an Infrared Cloud Imager (ICI) to measure the spatial and temporal distribution and optical properties of Arctic clouds continuously (day and night) for a full annual cycle at Barrow, Alaska, while also developing a new, compact version of this unique instrument that will enable future operation of a network of autonomous cloud sensors throughout the non-coastal Arctic. ICI data will enable many studies on relationships such as cloud spatial-temporal variability and cloud radiative forcing. Broader impacts will include providing an immediately valuable data stream in a cross-agency cooperation between the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), helping to establish the long-needed capability of diurnal cloud amount measurements at the North Slope of Alaska facility in Barrow, Alaska, and providing unique cross-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in engineering and science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project involved the use of a custom-designed thermal imaging instrument designed to look upward from the ground to measure Arctic clouds during day and night for long periods of time. The reasons this is important are that clouds have a major effect on climate and models require more detailed information on their spatial and radiative properties to allow effective climate predictions and satellite-based instruments have difficulty measuring clouds in the Arctic because it is hard to distinguish clouds from the underlying white surface and because in winter there is no sunlight illuminating the clouds. Thermal imaging from the ground is an excellent way of measuring clouds in the Arctic because a consistent measurement is obtained during daylight and the long polar night. Previous scientific-grade thermal imaging systems were expensive and required bulky and complex cooling mechanisms, so this research involved the use of uncooled thermal imaging detectors, which arose out of previously classified military research. Uncooled detectors provide outstanding convenience, but extremely poor accuracy and stability, so custom methods were developed to calibrate these room-temperature thermal imaging systems to obtain scientific-grade results from cameras whose price is many times lower than that of previous systems (and dropping rapidly). A two-year deployment in the Arctic was accomplished during this project, and a comparison of the data processed with two independent methods showed that future instruments can be made even smaller, lighter, and with lower cost than even the current generation of infrared cloud imagers built on uncooled thermal imaging technology.
