<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to discover a series of decentralized substructure-based monitoring and control approaches using wireless and mobile sensor networks.  Building upon theoretical foundation in system dynamics and optimization, this fundamental research in decentralized approaches has a potential of practical implementation in developing smart large-scale structural systems. The basic research in structural monitoring and structural control includes two aspects: (i) On structural monitoring, substructure-based finite element model updating and system identification strategies will be created to enable decentralized synthesis of sensor data at high spatial resolution. The decentralized model updating and system identification strategies are to be investigated using climbing and flying mobile sensors that provide dense and flexible deployment.  (ii) On structural control, decentralized substructure-based formulations will be discovered to cast the decentralized structural control problem into a convex optimization problem that can be solved with highly efficient numerical techniques. The decentralized control strategies will be validated through large-scale shake-table experiments using a wireless sensing and control network with real-time feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The protection and monitoring of structural safety is a highly complex issue faced by today?s civil engineers.  This research will enable accurate monitoring and effective protection of the nation?s civil structures, and thus, can generate significant societal and economic impact.  The proposed fundamental research has immense opportunities for application, which includes monitoring and control for not only civil structures, but also various mechanical and aerospace structures. The K-12 education plan includes one-day outreach activities containing multiple interesting modules, including lecture and video, hands-on competition, and live demonstration of mobile sensors.  The promotion of diversity is placed at highest priority, emphasizing K-12 outreach in metro Atlanta area with large African-American student population.  In addition, the international collaboration and student exchange program will further disseminate research and education outcomes generated from this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this project are multi-fold, including both physical implementation and theoretical development for decentralized wireless structural monitoring and control.   On the physical implementation side, a low-cost wireless sensing system named Martlet has been developed for civil structural applications.  The dual-core microcontroller design allows the wireless device to dedicate one core to standard wireless sensor operations while the other core is reserved for embedded data processing and real-time feedback control law execution.  Another distinct feature of Martlet is a standardized hardware interface that allows specialized daughter boards to be interfaced to the Martlet baseboard.  This extensibility opens opportunity to encapsulate specialized sensing and actuation functions in a daughter board without altering the design of Martlet.  On the theoretical front, first, a decentralized feedback control algorithm has been developed for the vibration control of for example, high-rise buildings under earthquake or wind excitations.  The performance of the decentralized control algorithm is first validated through a six-story numerical example. It shows that for cases with acceptable time delay, the more measurement data is available for decentralized controllers, the better the control performance is.  This conclusion is also corroborated by shake table experiments using a two-story frame with two active control devices. Longer time delay can worsen the performance of the controller.  Due to less time delay, decentralized controller achieves better performance than the centralized controller in experiments.   The second area of theoretical development produced a number of model updating algorithms.  These algorithms are applicable to not only civil, but also mechanical and aerospace structures.  They allow accurate calibration of structural mechanics models using experimental data collected from the as-built structures.  Substructure-based model updating algorithms are also developed to enable decentralized architecture.  The algorithms have been applied to both numerical examples and field measurement data.  Their development has particularly been focused on overcoming the challenges in the mathematical optimization problems formulated to find best calibrated models.  The development culminated in an open-source model updating platform published on GitHub and shared with the research community.
