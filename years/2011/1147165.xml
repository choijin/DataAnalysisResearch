<AbstractNarration>Pollen-pistil interaction is a general term referring to a large number of male (pollen) and female (pistil) interactive events in flowering plants that together lead to seed production. Fertilization depends on growth of the pollen tube within the pistil to deliver sperm, which the pollen tube carries as cargo in its cytoplasm, to the female apparatus, known as the female gametophyte, where the egg cell resides. Upon penetrating the female gametophyte, the pollen tube bursts discharging sperm, enabling fertilization while late-arriving tubes are prevented from entering the already-visited female. The goal of this project is to reveal the mystery behind how these intriguing male-female interactive processes are accomplished. This project takes advantage of the excellent plant model system Arabidopsis, in particular two already characterized mutants defective in the proteins called FERONIA (a Roman goddess of fertility and abundance) [FER] and LORELEI (LRE) (the Germanic mermaid who lured sailors to shipwreck). Loss of these proteins results in multiple pollen tubes being lured into the mutant female, but instead of bursting these pollen tubes continue to grow on a wandering journey inside the female, not discharging their sperm, resulting in a sterile interaction incapable of producing seeds. This project combines molecular genetics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to determine how FER and LRE together generate the female environment capable of mediating a productive male-female encounter. The knowledge obtained will explain a major step used by a plant to produce seeds and will help development of strategies to ascertain preservation and diversification of plant species and ensure production of earth?s major food source, seeds. The project will therefore significantly serve the public?s interests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact. By providing training at the doctoral and postdoctoral, this project prepares future leaders in science. Parts of this project are designed to provide research experience to undergraduates, thus broadening the pipeline for future scientists at an early stage. On an even more fundamental level, the project will also create opportunities for hands-on experimentation for high school teachers to extend/renew their classroom and laboratory resources.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1">Reproduction in flowering plants relies on multiple interactive steps between pollen and pistil (the female organ), leading to fertilization and seed formation. A pollen tube develops from the pollen grain and grows inside the pistil, carrying with it two sperm cells. When it reaches its target, the female gametophyte where the egg apparatus is located, the pollen tube bursts, releasing sperm rendering them available for a fertilization process that produces the zygote and the nurse tissue of the future seed. A molecule that guarantees the success of the sperm release process in the model plant Arabidopsis is called FERONIA (FER) [named after a mythical goddess of fruitfulness]. LORELEI (LRE) [named after a siren atop a rock by the River Rhine luring fishermen to their death] is another molecule that is important for the same process. Plants lacking either FERONIA or LORELEI are severely suppressed in female fertility, producing few seeds. In the absence of either protein, the reproductive process could not proceed beyond pollen tube arrival at the female gametophyte. Failing to burst, the penetrated pollen tube continues to grow inside the female gametophyte. Moreover, a second and sometimes a third pollen tube will enter the same female gametophyte, which almost never happens when both FER and LRE are present. As a result, pollen tubes pile up inside the female gametophyte, yet cannot fertilize. The research project focuses on understanding how FER and LRE render pollen tube bursting possible.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project produced several major scientific outcomes aligned with the original goals proposed. (1) Results demonstrated that FER and LRE act in a complex to activate a molecular switch (RHO GTPase), which can switch "on" and "off" by signals that they transmit to&nbsp;confer a highly oxidative environment surrounding the entrance of the female gametophyte, priming the penetrating pollen tube to burst once it enters. (2) LRE functions only in the female gametophyte; a protein called LRE like-glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP) 1 (LLG1)&nbsp;functions in all vegetative tissues where FER actually plays a key role in mediating growth and interactions with the environment. FER-LLG1 interaction in seedlings provides a system that is considerably more accessible for detail mechanistic analyses versus FER-LRE interaction during the reproductive process. &nbsp;Results here demonstrate that LLG1/LRE and FER exist as a complex and function together as receptor-coreceptor that together perceive and transmits signals from outside the cell to induce appropriate cellular responses. Moreover, LLG1 served an additional function, as chaperones while these proteins are still inside the cell, ensuring FER arrival at its proper functional location in the cell membrane. Both findings are novel and important conceptual advances in the general area of signal transduction. (3) We characterized FER-like proteins in the pollen that ensure pollen tubes can grow all the way to the female gametophyte, and also identified novel players in the system, called RALFs (for rapid alkalinizing factors) that play important roles in ensuring success in reproduction. These results were published in Science magazine as a collaborative paper with another group from Beijing University. It was featured in an &ldquo;In this issue&rdquo; introduction and a Perspective essay, reaching a broad readership. (4) A set of biochemical studies established that FER binds to sugar molecules in the cell wall and plays a key role in cell wall integrity and ensures&nbsp;salt stress tolerance. These findings&nbsp;provide evidence to wide-spread speculations that FER and its related receptors can function as cell wall sensors. The results were published as a collaborative paper with a group from The Carnegie Institute of Plant Biology; it is featured in an news dispatch essay in the journal to alert a broader biological research community.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to scientific outcomes that are of interest to the broader scientific and non-scientific community, the project also providing learning opportunities to enhance the pipeline for future scientist. Workshops for high school teachers were offered; some teachers returned for further exposure to experimental work. For the duration of the project, at least twenty undergraduates had been trained, many women or were from under-represented populations. Eight went on to Ph.D. studies, a 9<sup>th</sup> one is accepted to a Ph.D. program already, two went for M.D. and dentistry studies, the rest are in different scientific endeavors in clinical or company settings. These undergraduates together won numerous awards supporting their research studies. Two postdocs are now Professors in universities in China. Results produced by the work were presented in scientific meeting as well as in university seminar settings, reaching broad audiences. Topics within the research areas were adopted for class discussion, and were used in an undergraduate writing class, which also mentored two English writing tutors in scientific writing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/17/2018<br>      Modified by: Alice&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Cheung</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1147165/1147165_10153305_1521159152303_bluedots_--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1147165/1147165_10153305_1521159152303_bluedots_--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pollination and fertilization"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1147165/1147165_10153305_1521159152303_bluedots_--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pollination and fertilization"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Left: normal pollination where pollen tubes reach the female gametophytes, bursts to release its cytoplasm, including two sperm cells for fertilization.
