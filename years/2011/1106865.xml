<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1106865&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Dev Sinha, Ralph Cohen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal organizers will be program organizers for a&lt;br/&gt;one-week summer school program in algebraic topology, to be&lt;br/&gt;hosted at the University of Oregon. This summer school will bring&lt;br/&gt;thirty graduate students and early-career mathematicians together&lt;br/&gt;for an introduction to an area in topology which is ripe for&lt;br/&gt;investigation, and whose techniques will inform and inspire&lt;br/&gt;developments throughout topology. This summer school will use a&lt;br/&gt;unique blend of pedagogical tools, combining elements which have&lt;br/&gt;been successful in other settings. Younger researchers will be&lt;br/&gt;involved with both organizing and giving talks. Attendees will be&lt;br/&gt;encouraged to work problems, fill in background, and do reading&lt;br/&gt;together in addition to attending lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The West Coast Topology Summer School continues a series that&lt;br/&gt;began in summer 2010 and will strengthen the knowledge base of&lt;br/&gt;topologists and others who use topology and build a cohort of&lt;br/&gt;junior researchers familiar with recent developments in the&lt;br/&gt;subject. The program organizers of the Summer School are the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigators, together with Alejandro Adem of the&lt;br/&gt;University of British Columbia and the Pacific Institute of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences (PIMS). PIMS is a partner in the project,&lt;br/&gt;which will bring together US--based graduate students, largely&lt;br/&gt;from the western United States, and Canadian graduate students&lt;br/&gt;sponsored by PIMS. In its role as a basic study of shape,&lt;br/&gt;topology has significant ramifications in other areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, from basic counting problems (combinatorics) to&lt;br/&gt;solutions of equations (algebra) to applications and extensions&lt;br/&gt;of the calculus (analysis). More broadly, knowledge of topology&lt;br/&gt;is essential for example in studying the structure of the early&lt;br/&gt;universe, in designing a robot arm with a minimal number of&lt;br/&gt;controllers, and in searching large data sets for meaningful&lt;br/&gt;groupings as successfully done recently for study of breast&lt;br/&gt;cancer. This summer school will strengthen the ties between basic&lt;br/&gt;areas of theoretical mathematics. Mathematicians from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented backgrounds will be vigorously recruited.&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students and post-docs will gain hands-on experience&lt;br/&gt;with some of the most important developments of contemporary&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, preparing them to be future leaders of the field.&lt;br/&gt;Participants will enlarge their professional networks, which is&lt;br/&gt;especially critical given the geographical distances faced by&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians in the western half of North America. Organizers&lt;br/&gt;and participants will also have the opportunity to reflect upon&lt;br/&gt;the array of pedagogical tools employed, and might employ some&lt;br/&gt;themselves in training graduate students and undergraduates or&lt;br/&gt;reaching out to fellow scientists and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main project outcome was a successful program in Algebraic K-theory - a field which develops deep connections between algebra and geometry - for over ninety participants, mostly early-career, at Stanford University from July 15-19, 2012. Because of the historical importance of the field, its technical nature, and important recent developments, an organizing committee of experts carefully mapped out the field for participants starting with accessible historically significant entry points and progressing to the most exciting current developments.    The structure of the program itself represents a significant outcome.  Participants were active learners, presenting lectures based on outlines written by the organizers.  There was plenty of time each day for reflection on the program, with exercises to provoke further thought, reading materials, and plenty of opportunity to work with other participants or the organizers.  Such active training principles could be adapted for use elsewhere in academic research, in industry, in undergraduate education and even in K-12 settings.    Through deep engagement in material, through novel training methods and through significant community building (which is critical in the more geographically isolated western United States), the participants - who represent a large and diverse portion of early-career topologists - are better prepared to take significant roles in both the mathematical research community and as teachers or in industry.
