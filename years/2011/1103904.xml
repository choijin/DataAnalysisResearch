<AbstractNarration>1103904     &lt;br/&gt;This project supports a cooperative research project by Dr. Ken Shimizu, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC and Dr. Hasan Azab (Ibrahim) of the Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt.  They plan to study luminescent molecularly imprinted polymer (MIPs) sensor arrays by combining (1) the selective luminescent properties of lanthanide-analyte coordination complexes with (2) the shape and functional group selectivity of molecular imprint polymers (MIPs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The increasing use of pesticides has led to greatly improved crop yields&lt;br/&gt;and agricultural productivity. However, this has also lead to the increasing problem of the&lt;br/&gt;contamination of water supplies and food products with pesticide residues. The goal of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to develop luminescent polymeric sensor arrays that can identify and measure the&lt;br/&gt;concentrations of common pesticides in water. The luminescent imprinted polymer sensor arrays&lt;br/&gt;will have long shelf-lives, yield rapid results, and require minimal of instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;The sensor arrays are comprised of different molecularly imprinted polymers that contain lanthanide&lt;br/&gt;binding sites. Each polymer in the array will be synthesized in the presence of a different&lt;br/&gt;pesticide or pesticide analog, which will allow the sensor arrays to be rationally tailored&lt;br/&gt;with selectivity to specific groups or classes of analytes. The arrays will be highly sensitive&lt;br/&gt;and selective due to the luminescent lanthanide coordination sites that have high affinity&lt;br/&gt;and provide a very strong and easily measured change in emissive properties upon binding the&lt;br/&gt;target analytes. The collaboration involves DR. Hassan Azab who is an expert on the synthesis and characterization of luminescent lanthanide sensors and Dr. Ken D. Shimizu who is an expert&lt;br/&gt;the synthesis and analysis of molecularly imprinted polymer sensor arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The technological broader impact will be the development of new rapid and&lt;br/&gt;inexpensive methods for monitoring water purity and food safety. In addition, the new sensing&lt;br/&gt;platform can also be readily adapted to target other analytes of interest such as pharmaceuticals,&lt;br/&gt;environmental pollutants and disease indicators. This international collaboration will also&lt;br/&gt;provide a venue for the exchange of scientific expertise and the training of participating&lt;br/&gt;graduate students. Monthly video-conferencing meetings will be held to allow participants&lt;br/&gt;to practice their presentation and communication skills, as well as, to exchange information.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will have exchange visits in each of the first two years to coordinate the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program where NSF supports the US side and the Government of Egypt funds the Egyptian side.</AbstractNarration>

Prof. Shimizu is an expert in the synthesis of polymer recognition platforms and the optimization of polymer sensor arrays.  A series of lanthanide containing polymers were synthesized with varying selectivities and response profiles due to the insertion of different anionic counterions on the polymeric europium centers.  The polymers were collected together into a sensor array and tested in a high-throughput fashion in a fluorescence microtitre tray reader.  Using pattern recognition algorithms, the fluorescent polymer sensor arrays were able to accurately distinguish and differentiate six different anionic analytes including halides, carboxylates, and phosphates.  Broader Impacts:  Our research group also hosted five high/middle school classes in a hands-on research program, which brings the students to the University of South Carolina for a full day. The students carried out the "Molecular Lock-and-Key" lab, which we developed based on our research program on molecularly imprinted polymers.  Each student synthesizes polymer imprinted with the nucleoside, ethy-adenine-9-acetate, and then tests binding properties of the polymer to verify that it possesses enhanced binding affinity and selectivity.
