<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students to attend the 2011 Nonlinear Optics (NLO) Topical Meeting, to be held July 17-22, 2011 in Kauai, Hawaii.  The purpose of this meeting is to provide an international forum for discussion of all aspects of nonlinear optics, including new phenomena, novel devices, advanced materials and applications. Nonlinear optical phenomena are being studied and applied over a wide range of energies and powers, from single-photons to petawatts, and over broad spectral regimes, from THz to X-ray frequencies. NLO 2011 will also celebrate 50 years of nonlinear optics through several devoted presentations. This grant will make the conference more affordable for the students' research groups, making it more likely that they can attend the meeting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Nonlinear Optics (NLO) Topical Meeting was held July 17, 2011, through July 22, 2011 in Kauai, Hawaii. Nonlinear optical phenomena were studied and applied over a wide range of energies and powers, from single-photons to petawatts, and over broad spectral regimes, from THz to X-ray frequencies. The meeting provided an international forum for discussion of all aspects of nonlinear optics, including new phenomena, novel devices, advanced materials and applications. The funds provided by NSF were used to support student registration fees and travel to encourage student participation that otherwise may not have been possible. Student participation is very important to encourage the future growth of this important field.  Topics Covered    Fundamental studies and new concepts  Quantum optics, computation and communication  Single-photon nonlinear optics  Solitons and nonlinear propagation  Ultrafast phenomena and techniques  Surface, interface and nanostructure nonlinearities  Microcavity and microstructure phenomena  High intensity and relativistic nonlinear optics  Slow light  Coherent control  Pattern formation in nonlinear optical systems  Nonlinear nanophotonics    Nonlinear media  Atoms, molecules and condensates  Cold atoms  Dielectrics  Semiconductors  Nanostructures  Photonic bandgap structures  Fibers and waveguides  Photorefractives    Novel lasers and frequency converters  Micro solid-state photonics Applications  Lasers and amplifiers  Frequency converters and high harmonics generation  Optical communications  Photonic switching  Ultrafast measurement  Frequency combs and optical clocks  THz generation, spectroscopy and imaging  Nonlinear x-ray optics  Materials processing  Optical storage  Biological elements  Laser induced fusion   The meeting included plenary and invited speakers representing the very best people in the NLO community.  The more informal format of a Topical Meeting encouraged networking among participants and one-one-one research discussions.  It represented a fantastic opportunity for students who intend to enter a career in NLO. The support from NSF made it possible several students to attend and is likely to have a long-term impact on this enabling field.
