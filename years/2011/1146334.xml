<AbstractNarration>Memory for the context in which daily life events occur is a hallmark of episodic memory, but how and where context is represented in the brain is an open question. Evidence in multiple species suggests that postrhinal cortex (POR) is critically involved. The PI will study the role of neural circuits in the rodent POR in processing information about contexts. The guiding hypothesis is that POR is necessary for forming representations of specific contexts and for updating such representations when changes occur. What part of the brain notices, for example, when an object has been moved for one place to another in a familiar room? The PI has compelling new data showing that neurons in the POR do, indeed, represent object-place associations, and thus have all the information to signal changes in object location. The proposed studies will employ state of the art techniques in behaving rats to address questions about how context changes are represented in the brain. This work will impact memory research and neuroscience at large in several ways. For example, these studies will advance our understanding of the neural basis of context and visual information processing. In addition to the scientific impact, the proposal will contribute to increasing diversity in neuroscience by recruiting summer research rotation students from historically black colleges including Tougaloo College in Jackson, MS, Spelman College in Atlanta, GA, and Dillard University in New Orleans, LA.</AbstractNarration>

The PER and POR each project to the HC both directly and indirectly through the lateral and medial entorhinal areas. The dominant view posited that the HC, itself, configures spatial and object information into representations of context. This view does not take into account the robust, multilevel connections across the so-called object and spatial pathways. Importantly, the PER and POR are robustly and directly interconnected upstream of the HC. The research supported by this award addressed the hypothesis that 1) the POR represents the local spatial context, including the spatial layout of objects, patterns, and features of the environment, and 2) object and pattern information necessary for context representations arrives to the POR directly from the PER. The supported research employed novel behavioral paradigms and behavioral neuroscience approaches in a rodent model to address these hypotheses. The findings of this research program challenged the existing view that context, itself, is represented in the HC by providing strong evidence that context-guided behavior relies on direct PER-POR interactions, especially in situations in which context and context-guided behavior are complex. In addition to clarifying the neural bases of context, the work established an excellent model system for studying how contextual information is processed, represented, and used to guide behavior in humans. Clarifying how context is represented in the brain is essential for a basic understanding of how context-guided behavior, including episodic memory, works in the normal brain. In addition, we know that the use of contextual representations to guide behavior is disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and schizophrenia, and there is associated pathology in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. Thus, knowing more about the role of context in behavior and cognition is also important for understanding and treating the disordered brain.
