<AbstractNarration>Earthquakes represent a significant natural hazard in many inhabited areas of the world. Yet, despite much study, the conditions that control the stability and nature of the slip on faults are still poorly understood. An important control on fault-stability arises from the fact that faults zones are often filled with granulated rock and the interstices of these grains are filled with groundwater. Variations in the pressure of this fluid have been observed to trigger movement on faults. The proposed project will result in a better understanding of the basic physics behind slip on faults, in particular the coupling between solid stresses and fluid pressures in the fault zone.  The insight gained from this work will contribute to the efforts to assess the seismic hazard associated with individual faults, and the risk of triggering earthquakes by natural or man-made changes in local groundwater levels. This work should also add to the understanding of saturated granular flows, such as landslides and offshore turbidity flows (both of which constitute significant natural hazards to lives and structures).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The saturated gouge-fault block system includes several coupled mechanisms that may control fault stability and determine the conditions under which faults creep, slip slowly (slow earthquakes), or accelerate into earthquakes. Increases in fluid pressure reduce the effective stress across a fault, which weakens the fault and promotes sliding, while the dilation that accompanies the onset of slip will lead to pressure reductions that can strengthen the fault. Fluid flow into and out of the fault will mute pressure fluctuations, but is highly dependent on permeability in both the granular fault gouge and in the confining wall rock, which in turn can vary greatly with gouge dilation and stress-induced damage. We will study this system using a grain-scale numerical model. This model couples together the discrete element method (DEM) for granular dynamics with a continuum finite-difference solution for fluid flow through permeable media. This grain-scale approach allows for heterogeneity and localization within the fault gouge, and accounts for effects of the pressure on the dilation of the fault. We will simulate sections of a gouge-filled fault zone confined by breakable wall rock (simulated with bonded cohesive granular material). The modeled fault will be subjected to various types of loading, including slow increases in tectonic shear stress and the transient passage of seismic waves and fluid pressure waves. The goal will be to map out the conditions for fault stability, and quantify the relationships between fault stresngth and the evolving permeability and fluid pressure in both the fault gouge and damaged wall rock.</AbstractNarration>

It is the transmission of stresses through this layer of microscopic grains that determines the macroscopic strength and stability of the fault. It has long been recognized that fluids may play an important role in frictional sliding: fluid pressures along the fault surface partially offset the stress on the fault surface, which has the effect of reducing the frictional strength.  In a layer of grains, as grains rearrange pore spaces must be created and destroyed and change shape. This creates localized perturbations in fluid pressure. This project used computer simulations of the motions of grains that are surrounded by pore fluid to investigate the interactions between grain motions and fluid motions, and to predict the effect on fault properties.  We modified our existing computer code using the Discrete Element Method, which models a system of hundreds to thousands of individual grains, which interact with simple elastic and frictional forces.  We use this to model a small part of a gouge region that is undergoing a rapid localized slip event (an earthquake). We applied a range of different boundary forces to this gouge layer, to simulate different depths of faults, and to examine the onset, peak velocity and the end of a particular slip event.  The model also tracks how changes in pore pressure are caused by grain motions, how pressure gradients drive fluid flow between different regions, and how this, in turn, affects the grain motions. Our experiments have shown that grain rearrangement during shearing of gouge can create perturbations in fluid pressure large enough to affect the macroscopic behavior of a fault even if fluid is allowed to flow into and out of the gouge zone.  This is due to the low permeability of fine-grained gouge, and the rapidity of local grain motions during the high velocity slip in an earthquake. A closing pore increases fluid pressure, which reduces the frictional strength of nearby contacts.  Conversely an opening pore reduces fluid pressure, which causes strengthens frictional contacts, a process referred to as dilational hardening. We find that, although both opening and closing are typically occurring simultaneously in different parts of a slipping granular system, the macroscopic behavior of the fault is controlled by the dilating regions.   Using the unique strengths of a computer model, we can compare the behavior of systems that are identical in terms of grain size, arrangement and forces, but differ only in the ability of fluid pressure to affect the grain motion. We do this by changing the permeability from a typical fault gouge value to a much higher one, in which fluid flows between pores so easily that it has no effect (a nominally "dry" experiment).  We find that "dry" faults have a slightly lower strength at the onset of an earthquake and a bigger drop in frictional resistance during the earthquake than the corresponding saturated layer. During our simulations of slip, movement typically localizes to regions in the gouge that are 8-10 grains thick. These slip regions migrate away from areas of lower permeability. We also find that simulations of saturated gouge can produce behavior similar to the "slow earthquake" motion observed in some deep fault zones.

However we find that the creep and slow slip behavior here arises from the fluid strengthening the system due to dilational hardening that arises only during the slip itself.  We explain "slow earthquake" and creeping fault behavior as a result of fluid-enhanced strengthening of the fault zone. We have also made predictions of the characteristics of perturbations in effective confining stress that can trigger slip events.
