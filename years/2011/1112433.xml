<AbstractNarration>Professors Carol J. Hirschmugl and Roshan M. Dsouza of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Professor Frank Vogt of the University of Tennessee Knoxville are supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct a collaborative project to advance in-vivo chemical imaging and analysis. The research will be conducted by combining synchrotron-based infrared data obtained with the hyperspectral imaging spectrometer (IRENI) at the Synchrotron Radiation Center at Madison, WI with rapid spectral image analysis using graphics processing units and quantitative chemometrics. The research involves high resolution imaging of live cells, scattering corrections, chemometric methods for concentration measurement in complex systems and application to algae growth studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the project will improve the performance of IRENI, the premium facility of its kind, and enable the chemical imaging and analysis of samples that were previously considered to be too complex to handle, such as live cells. The project will have a broad impact in chemistry and biology. Students will be trained on a state-of-the-art infrared imaging instrument in a Synchrotron Radiation Center. Undergraduate students from diverse groups and their teachers will be involved in the project through existing REU and RET programs, and workshops will be conducted to familiarize the community with IRENI and to broaden its technical user base.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of the proposal entitled, " " is summarized as identifying, for a range of applications, novel chemistry at the micrometer scale (of the order of 1/100ththe thickness of a hair strand).  We were able to apply this novel, incisive analysis to: retina and neurons in brain tissue from diseased (Alzheimer?s and stroke) mice and humans; paint layers from imperiled paintings of Henri Mattise; processed polymers; nanocellulose; stem cells; breast cancer cells; wood samples relevant to forestry; zinnia cells; graphene-based advanced materials; pain sensory neurons; wings of cicada insects, MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus); retinas from diabetic mammals;  brown fat tissues; biofuels; wood degradation; and breast cancer calcifications. These efforts led to more than 40 peer-reviewed papers in wide-ranging disciplines, and three Ph.D. dissertations from the Hirschmugl laboratory. These results were obtained in collaboration with a global network of colleagues who traveled from all over the world to use the unique facilities that Hirschmugl had developed from prior NSF Major Research Instrumentation funding, and continued to make available for peer-reviewed proposed work.  From the outcome of this effort, Hirschmugl gave more than 15 invited talks at international and national conferences.  One of the final demonstrations with the facility was the development of chemically sensitive Computed Aided Tomography (CAT) for infrared, which showed that 3D chemical information can be measured and determined at the micron scale.  This effort opens the possibility of understanding complex chemical systems in much greater detail.   Hirschmugl mentored and co-mentored the following personnel: 3 postdoctoral associates, 12 graduate students and 5 undergraduate students, one high school student and additional students through collaborations.  Under the auspices of this program, these nascent scholars were trained in instrument development and the use of large accelerators for a variety of experiments. In addition to the publications across a broad array of disciplines, Hirschmugl?s broader impacts include a variety of professional activities. Hirschmugl helped organize symposia at national and international meetings. Hirschmugl has also given talks for high school students and undergraduates. She has developed and presented a Science Bag lecture, which is a free, lay lecture, delivered five times in one month to explain scientific concepts to general audiences 5-95 years of age; this presentation was attended by about 1200 people. She has developed a writing-intensive honors course for non-science majors regarding Energy and the Environment with a Physics emphasis; she has also developed  a specialty Physics laboratory course for undergraduate Physics majors, where the students read and discussed recently published journal articles, worked at the accelerator and presented their findings in an open poster session.
