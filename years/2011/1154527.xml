<AbstractNarration>This enhanced renewal S-STEM project is awarding 64 scholarships to academically talented STEM students (in all majors) with financial need. The objectives of the project are: 1) decreasing student reliance on loans and full-time work 2) increasing the graduation rate of the Scholars compared to the graduation rate of other students in STEM disciplines who are not receiving scholarship support; 3) improving the educational support system by providing cohort activities, academic support services, research projects, STEM internships, and mentoring; 4) increasing the number of students entering the STEM workforce or graduate school; 5) widening the pipeline to STEM programs via outreach to local schools and in-reach to CSU freshmen; 6) increasing access to education to underrepresented minorities and first generation students. Recruitment, selection, and career placement are the responsibility of a faculty committee with the support of an industrial/community advisory board. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the expected increased understanding of how to best engage underrepresented minorities and first generation college students in obtaining a baccalaureate in a STEM field. The academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are extensive academic support activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this activity is directly related to providing better systems of support and cultivation of untapped natural resources within their communities: human capital unrealized. Many underrepresented minority and first generation students are very talented but face many barriers that impede their success. The project is enabling these students to complete a STEM major and enter the workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the University Scholars in STEM Program at Cleveland State University was to give financial and academic support to academically talented CSU students with demonstrated financial need in order to increase graduation rates and prepare them for entering the STEM workforce or continuing on to graduate level studies in a STEM discipline.   Scholars in the program were offered weekly cohort activities in combination with the Choose Ohio First Success in Math Program.  These activities included speakers from within and outside of the University.  Sessions included personal development of key workforce skills (i.e., cover letter writing, creating and presenting a research poster), talks by STEM industry professionals, presentations from campus resources, and social activities.  The purpose of these sessions was to further enhance the Scholars? education and build a supportive community. Each year, the scholars were required to complete a research poster and present it at a regional conference.  This activity allowed the scholars to develop their presentation skills and also gave them the opportunity to work directly with a faculty advisor.  Scholars were given a chance to practice their presentation in front of faculty before the conference, which provided them with feedback on how to improve their presentation.  These research posters served as an introduction to research for students, some of whom would not have acquired it elsewhere in their undergraduate career.     Of the 33 students funded by this grant, 27 completed their undergraduate STEM degree while in the program. Of the remaining students, 4 of the 6 finished their STEM degrees: 1 student chose to take 5 years in order to complete a double electrical engineering and physics degree and so was not funded their final year, 1 student needed to move to being a part-time student and so was not funded but finished the following year, and 2 students will finish in 2018 in engineering after having completed one or more semesters of coop experiences and would have remained in the program if the funding had been available during their final year.  So, our effective graduation rate in a STEM major is either 82% or 94%, depending on who is included, compared to around a 40% 5-year graduation rate among STEM majors at our university.  While tracking of scholars once they have completed the program is never easy, at least 15 of our scholars have gone on to pursue further STEM education.  Cleveland State University will continue to support new STEM undergraduate students using the successful combination of activities, advising, and financial assistance that we developed in this and previous grants by utilizing funding provided by the State of Ohio?s Choose Ohio First Success in Math program.
