<AbstractNarration>In this project, the principal investigator will pursue two major themes: (1) the Kadison-Singer problem and (2) the theory of tensor products of operator systems. The Kadison-Singer problem is a major problem in this area of mathematics that has been unsolved since 1954. The principal investigator has made some recent progress on the problem and will explore three new avenues of attack on it. Operator systems and completely positive maps play a central role in several areas of mathematics, including quantum computing, quantum information theory, and applications to C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras. The principal investigator will continue to develop the general tensor theory of operator systems and continue to apply this theory to problems in quantum information and quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of mathematics known as frame theory is concerned with systems that are used to sample signals of various types and then to reconstruct the signals from the samples, such as one does when sampling a soundwave, burning it to a CD, then playing back the music from the CD. Engineers always build redundancy (or oversampling) into such systems in order to ameliorate the effects of errors in the numerical values of the samples. Progress on the Kadison-Singer problem should translate to a more precise understanding of how redundancy behaves than exists at the present time. Roughly, it asks whether or not systems with "finite redundancy" can always be divided into finitely many systems with no redundancy. The second goal of the project is concerned with developing the mathematics of quantum information theory and quantum computing. Although no one can predict whether or not quantum computers will ever be built, if they are, it is certainly vital to the national interests to have developed sufficient human resources to be competitive in putting them to use. Consequently, the principal investigator's students are introduced to this area, and his work on the tensor theory of operator systems has applications to questions about parallel structure in the quantum setting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When one uses the inherent randomness of quantum experiments to generate bivariate probabilities, then, because of a phenomenon known as entanglement, one can get a much larger family of possible correlation matrices.  However, there are two mathematical models that can be used to determine these sets of correlations, called the commuting and tensor models, and we still do not know if these two models yield the same sets of possible correlation matrices. Whether or not these sets are the same is equivalent to a deep problem in operator algebras known as Connes' embedding problem.  To describe these correlations more carefully, suppose that two independent experimenters, Alice and Bob, each have n quantum experiments that they can perform and each experiment has k outcomes. If these experiments share some entangled state, then the probability that Alice observes i and Bob observes j, given that they conduct experiments x and y, respectively, yields a probability density, p(i,j|x,y). The set of all possible p's that can be generated by some set of quantum experiments in some state is called the set of (n,k)-quantum correlation matrices.  Currently, there are two models that can be used to describe the set of all possible (n,k)-quantum correlation matrices and no one knows if these two models yield the same sets or not. But we do know that this question is equivalent to this embedding conjecture of Connes, which arose in a different area of mathematics.  My work has helped to clarify our understanding of this conjecture and has made it easier for mathematicians and theoretical physicists to understand why these two problems are equivalent.  The theory of tensor products of operator systems gives us a means to more easily and quickly find equivalent restatements of problems of this type and has helped to show that the Connes' embedding problem can be reduced to a problem in 16 dimensions.
