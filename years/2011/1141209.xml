<AbstractNarration>This project supports four small teams of experts in key areas of applied computing to synthesize the results from a number of related projects and create curricular exemplars focusing on "computing in context."  These can then be used in conjunction with the Computer Science 2013 curriculum guidelines and in other widely disseminated materials to support the breadth of relationships between computing and other disciplines. By exploring these relationships, students understand how the power of computing informs and shapes ideas throughout the academy and society. The project focuses on four areas of collaboration: computational finance, computing and music, computational linguistics, and web science. The modules developed each utilize at least one active-learning technique such as problem-based learning (PBL), process-oriented guided inquiry (POGIL), or a classroom response system (clicker) format that facilitates effective learning for students working on interdisciplinary teams. Full group and small topic area project faculty workshops support consistency and evaluation of the developed materials. Additional faculty are engaged in reviewing and testing the materials, resulting in the participation of approximately 40 faculty over the life of the project. A multi-faceted evaluation of the curricular guidelines, course structures, and pedagogical approaches developed is led by an external evaluator assessing both the process of developing the materials and the resulting products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Computing in Context project seeks to develop teaching materials &ndash; outlines, projects, experiments, models &ndash; that make computing concepts relevant and understandable to a wide spectrum of students. The project presents these materials in ways that promote active learning, especially inquiry-based learning and related pedagogical strategies. The project team tested the materials in the classroom, making improvements and enhancements to address the learning approaches that are effective for the current generation of college students.  These materials show that regardless of context, the power of computing informs and shapes ideas throughout society.     The project team focused on five areas of study: business security, linguistics, music, social networks as a component of web science, and sustainability of the environment.  To understand the diversity of the materials, consider the following examples:  Investigate the security of a mobile health application (best if it is one on your smart phone) in light of the five-part security guidance that requires administrative safeguards, physical safeguards, technical safeguards, organizational policies and procedures, and formal documentation.  In music, what is a note, and more specifically, what are its properties? [This question aims to get the students to discover the MusicXML description of a note.] Extract material from the Web focused on a particular event or topic (time-limited) and develop a plan for cataloguing and archiving the information using natural language processing tools. Develop strategies using concepts from persuasive human computer interaction to encourage behaviors that promote sustainability.  For example, refill a water bottle. Compare visualization techniques for large graphs that model social networks.       The project team used a standard template to describe each module.  The template includes information about prerequisite knowledge, estimated time, materials needed, learning objectives, and pedagogical strategies that can be used.  The modules are stored in several repositories including computingportal.org and engagecsedu.org (for modules appropriate to the first two courses in an undergraduate degree program in computer science).      The unifying result of the project is the relationship map (Figure 1) the participants developed, showing the connections and overlaps among the active learning approaches that are used in the models.  This map will continue to evolve as researchers and practitioners reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches in the computing in context setting.
