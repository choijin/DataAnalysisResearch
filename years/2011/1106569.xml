<AbstractNarration>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are potentially significant but of unknown importance as a source of aqueous-phase secondary organic aerosol (SOA). GLVs are reactive, oxygenated, organic compounds that are emitted from plants in significant quantities and that can react both at the surface of fog drops and within the bulk of the drops. These aqueous reactions can occur via photochemically generated oxidants such as hydroxyl radical, singlet molecular oxygen, and excited triplet states of organic compounds. GLVs are also oxidized in the gas phase to make more water soluble products that could also participate in fog-drop reactions to form SOA. The hypothesis driving this research is that the uptake and photooxidation of GLVs and their first generation oxidation products can be a significant source of secondary organic carbon in fogwater. This hypothesis will be tested through four objectives: (1) Collect and chemically characterize fogwaters from Louisiana and California. (2) Measure GLV photooxidation, changes in organic composition, and the formation of SOA in illuminated fogwaters. (3) Quantify photooxidants  in the illuminated fog waters and their reactivity with GLVs. (4) Integrate results from each objective in order to determine the mechanisms for GLV reactions in fogwaters and assess the significance of GLVs as an aqueous source of SOA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A post-doctoral scholar, a graduate student, and undergraduate students will be mentored during the project, including through an LSU-UCD undergraduate exchange research program. The results from the research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate teaching at both institutions. And, because fog events can affect the concentrations of regulated pollutants, especially PM2.5, in both Louisiana and California, results from this work will inform state air quality policy agencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Aerosols play a significant role in climate, air quality, pollutant transport and fate in the atmospheric environment.  According to the most recent IPCC assessment, there exist significant gaps and uncertainties in the aerosol effects on climate change. Among the chemicals that contribute to the formation of aerosols in the air are anthropogenic emissions and plant emissions.  Aerosols are essential in the well-known smog-fog-smog cycle that prevails in the lower near-surface troposphere.  Fog is formed by the condensation of water on sub-micron particles in the atmosphere.  During the existence and deposition of fog, uptake of gases and particles, and reactions with atmospheric oxidants occur in the bulk and at the surface of fog drops.  These transformations lead to a slew of organic and inorganic compounds at high concentrations inside fog droplets.  Thus, the atmospheric quality can be affected by fog and, therefore, there has been a resurgent interest in quantifying the organic fraction in fogwater.It is believed that much of the carbon in fogwater arises from reactions of organic precursors from the atmosphere and particles that form the fog.  The origins of the precursors are suggested to be anthropogenic, biogenic, and soil-derived. Of these, the biogenic volatile organic carbon (BVOC) fraction is a large source of organic carbon in fog and aerosols. Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) represent a significant fraction of the non-isoprene, non-monoterpene fraction of BVOCs.  In this work, we collected and chemically characterized fog waters from Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Davis, California  and measured GLV photooxidation in the fog waters.  We also quantified the photooxidants in fog waters and their reactivity with GLVs via three steps: (a) Characterizing the formation of photooxidants in each fog water, (b) quantifying the kinetics of photooxidant reaction with the GLVs, and (c) measuring the mass yield of SOA from the reaction of photooxidant with GLV. We then integrated the results from each objective to: (a) determine the mechanisms for photooxidation of GLVs in fog waters and (b) assessed the significance of GLVs as an aqueous source of SOA.  Results from this work can be shared with state and federal policy makers who are involved in making decisions regarding air quality.  The two investigators both have contacts at their state resource agencies (the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the California Air Resources Board) who are interested in this research since in both regions fog events can affect the concentrations of regulated pollutants, especially PM2.5. We hope to share the results of our research with both the LA DEQ and CARB to help them understand the conditions under which impaired air quality may be experienced in the region during fog events.  We are also involved with the long-term collection of data on wet deposition in Louisiana and California through the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) program.  We have been involved with programs  that recruit and help mentor students from underrepresented groups. Two postdoctoral, three gradaute students and 3 undergraduate students have directly obtained training in atmospheric chemistry through this work.  Two out of the three graduate students were female students whose representation in the STEM fields has been low.
