<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to develop a low power, autonomous solid state sensor for simultaneous measurement of seawater pH and Total Alkalinity. The proposed research involves micro sensor development, electrochemistry, marine chemistry, and electrical engineering. Combination of two ISFET measurement principles will be used for rapid, sequential measurement of pH and Total Alkalinity in order to generate a full thermodynamic description of the CO2 system in the analyte solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making sensors to measure pH and total alkalinity in real time and at the appropriate precision is important to our understanding of ocean acidification. If successful, they plan to commercialize it. Other situations where total weak acid or base concentration in combination with the pH form useful information, this proposed system might be used, like in food industry and for biomedical applications. Two graduate students will be involved in this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaborative effort between oceanographers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and a nanoengineering group at UCSD to develop a new sensor to measure two important chemical properties of seawater: the pH and the Total Alkalinity. These properties are among the most important quantities measured by ocean chemists because they reflect and define the carbon dioxide system (the primary acid-base system in the ocean) through well-understood reactions. The impact of this research is to simplify the amount of work required in the field by enabling a sensor to carry out measurements that otherwise require a great deal of effort by trained laboratory personnel.  The sensor we developed may find many applications in the oceanography communities studying, for example, coral reef metabolism, sedimentary processes such as benthic respiration, and open ocean processes such as phytoplankton blooms.    The bulk of this project was spent in the laboratory developing techniques to make the sensor.  Following several years of testing different approaches to building the main component (a semiconductor chip), a working prototype was completed.  Tests were carried out first in a controlled laboratory environment, then in a large test tank and, finally, several field experiments were conducted where the sensor was shown to work continuously in the ocean for several days at a time.  We plan to continue this work with a field-focused scientific experiment using several copies of the prototype developed in this work.  Outcomes include a PhD dissertation and accompanying peer-reviewed paper detailing how the sensor works and demonstrating its accuracy and precision.
