<AbstractNarration>SES-1129123&lt;br/&gt;Paula England&lt;br/&gt;Alison Fogarty&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: A Hierarchy of Gender Discrimination in the Workplace&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on gender based discrimination in the workplace particularly as it is influenced by issues related to gender expression and fixity.  The research examines how underrepresented gender groups experience the workplace and how others respond to their presence, and thus, it provides a lens on individuals' cultural understandings of gender and its binary and fixed nature.  This research expands the conceptualization of the dimensions of gender based discrimination in its differentiation of gender expression and gender fixity, two concepts frequently considered as a unit, to see if one or the other plays more into prejudice or discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;The research involves both quantitative and qualitative research and employs Respondent Drive Sampling (RDS) to compute unbiased calculations of population estimates for the survey work so that solid generalizations can be made. It examines  data about workplace experiences at various time periods in order to assess changes in discrimination.  Interviews of individuals who have or are contemplating transitioning genders and of individuals who work with them makes it possible to assess the attitudes that motivate behaviors and  handle challenges to their binary and fixed view of gender. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;This research has the opportunity to result in positive social change by helping to increase awareness of the socially constructed nature of gender. It has the potential to facilitate reducing gender inequality and gender based discrimination and abuse in the workplace.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Over the course of my in-depth qualitative research with 25 gender- individuals in the San Francisco Bay Area, I have exhaustively documented a   array of trans narratives, each one unique, complex, and nuanced. The goal of the research was to document the nature of the discrimination contemporary gender-nonconforming individuals face in the workplace, explore patterns  types of gender nonconformity and discrimination, and describe the participantsÆ  strategies for managing this discrimination. The extensive discrimination  have provided reveals the myriad ways in which gender-nonconforming people  discriminated against in hiring practices and in the workplace. Strategies for  and reducing discrimination reveal the equally diverse ways in which gender-nonconforming people navigate this discrimination. My research shows that  discrimination towards gender-nonconforming identities and expressions, as well as the discrimination-reduction strategies they utilize, are organized by the widely believed cultural ideas that masculinity is superior to other gender expressions and that adherence to the gender binary is desirable and appropriate.   While masculinity is usually favored in the workplace, it is not always true that all  men by default experience better treatment than all women. Often those  masculine women experience more positive workplace treatment than those  as men displaying non-hegemonic masculinities. The experiences of trans men  alternative masculinities and trans women who are perceived to be  both suggest that masculinity by default is not always superior. Rather,  that strives toward hegemonic performance is rewarded, while masculinity that  is punished. In the context of trans identities, this often means that a trans  relationship with masculinity is likely to be tenuous.   Despite an increase in trans visibility that reveals the mutable and fluid nature of  gender, most cisgender folks nevertheless maintain a belief that gender is  fundamentally fixed and binary. Non-binary individuals often "do ambiguity," or  purposefully perform an ambiguous gender expression in attempt to have their non-binary identity socially validated. However, because non-binary and gender- identities and expressions are unlikely to be recognized as legitimate, gender-ambiguous people are often pressured to "just pick one" constant and binary  expression. Binary and consistent gender presentations are privileged over  and fluid expressions.   Patterns in strategies to avoid and reduce discrimination support the ideas that  masculinity is superior and that consistent and binary expressions are deemed  desirable and appropriate in the workplace. Butch women and passing trans  described strategies to reduce discrimination far less often than trans women, gender-binary people, and gender-fluid folks. I document various discrimination- strategies, including concealing gender identity and modifying gender  modifying interactions with coworkers and clients, perusing intentional job  and utilizing support systems. Only a handful of discrimination-reducing  were successful for both the individual and the greater trans community.  these strategies relied on pre-existing situational factors that made workplace  discrimination reduction possible in the short and long-term, allowed gender-nonconforming individuals to be authentic in the workplace, and positively  the larger trans community through challenging misconceptions and celebrating  visibility. Apart from the presence of trans-inclusive workplace policies, which  to primarily benefit binary-identifying trans folks, the largest situational factor  predicted this type of far-reaching discrimination reduction was the presence of  authority figures that legitimized and supported authentic gender-nonconforming  identities and expressions in the workplace.
