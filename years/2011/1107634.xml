Elevation: How deep does the RO sounding reaches into the lower troposphere (2km above surface)? Levels: How many levels does the RO sounding have? E.g. vertical level.         It was unimaginable how much I learned from this program. Before this program and been in Taiwan I did not have the idea of how much you can do with COSMIC data.
