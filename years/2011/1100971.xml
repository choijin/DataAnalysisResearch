<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the performance of brick and mortar wall panels under different combinations of in-plane loading representative of masonry structures under seismic events.  An experimental program will take advantage of the existing "Universal Panel Tester" at the University of Houston to examine 1.4mx1.4m masonry panels under different combinations of biaxial compression and tension. A digital image correlation system will be used to trace progressive cracking and sliding in the bed and head joints of the brick and mortar material system and potential cracking of the brittle brick units. A computational model will be developed to capture the brittle-ductile failure mechanism of the two component material system, which will be validated from experimental observations to quantify inherent uncertainties in masonry construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves two graduate students under the direction of the two faculty in addition to one undergraduate student who will be trained (a) in the fields of servo-controlled multi-axial testing, (b) in the use of powerful imaging to track emerging failure mechanisms, and (c) in the field of computer modeling of effective material properties of masonry construction under different in-plane load scenarios. Special efforts will be undertaken to recruit diverse Undergraduate and Graduate students through the proximity with the Texas Southern University, TSU, located next to the University of Houston, and with Prairie View A&amp;M University. National and international cooperation with our colleagues at the University of California-San Diego and at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, UPC-Barcelona, will serve to reach out to the Hispanic communities, whereby a student exchange program will provide additional incentives.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Masonry is the oldest building material which is still used in constructions around the world for its low cost and broad availability, its insulation properties, energy efficiency, and construction simplicity. In addition to the above characteristics, it is an environmental friendly but fragile material. These characteristics are sufficient enough to motivate researchers and engineers to develop state of the art design methods for masonry structures, competitive to those of concrete and steel. &nbsp;Due to the lack of in-depth insight and models for the complex behavior of masonry composite consisting of brick units, mortar joints, and their bonds as its constituents, its development of design rules has not kept pace with those of concrete and steel. Moreover, the current building codes for masonry structures do not take the fracture-based behavior of brittle masonry into account. Therefore, this lack of in-depth insight has resulted in preventing the innovative applications of structural masonry, though it is a durable and resilient material.</p> <p class="Default">Although masonry is made of &ldquo;brittle&rdquo; constituents, the use of fracture mechanics in its analysis and design guidelines has not yet been adopted. The brittle fracture of brick-mortar bonds or interfaces, as the weakest link in masonry, plays an important role in the failure of this composite. The micro-level fracture processes control the complicated nonlinear behavior of the brick-mortar interface which significantly affect the global behavior of the masonry at the structural macro level. Therefore, a numerical lattice approach based on the concepts of brittle fracture mechanics was developed in this study which evaluates progressive debonding of brick-mortar interfaces in form of evolving cracks in unreinforced masonry. The computational lattice model is capable of evaluating the fracture toughness of brick-mortar interfaces along with other fracture properties such as energy release rates, configurational forces, and stress intensity factors for Mode 1 and Mode 2, using strength data of lattice struts and their configurational changes. This information may be employed to upscale the lattice fracture arguments onto the meso-level which distinguishes brick, mortar, and their interfaces to quantify traction-separation cohesive zone models in the context of continuum finite element simulations of heterogeneous media.</p> <p>The lattice fracture approach is independent of specific base material. Henceforth, the micro-meso interface fracture methodology may be applied to a wide range of bi-material interface problems which are governed by brittle fracture. The novel lattice methodology and the discussion in this study may be applied in other areas like adhesives, joints in rock and stone works, contact problems between bodies and, in general, all types of interface behavior where de-bonding, delamination, and friction between constituents form the basic mechanical response. In sum, the conceptually simple 2D lattice formulation, which is based on engineering failure modes of tension and compression cut-offs augmented by shear failure criteria, will open an opportunity to introduce fracture mechanics concepts into the performance evaluation of masonry behavior. &nbsp;This will assist researchers, engineers, and practitioners in the masonry society to develop fracture-based design rules to quantify the resilience of the under-appreciated material.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/19/2016<br>      Modified by: Kaspar&nbsp;J&nbsp;Willam</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100971/1100971_10106571_1473454316233_prism--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100971/1100971_10106571_1473454316233_prism--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Masonry Prism under Compression"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100971/1100971_10106571_1473454316233_prism--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Masonry Prism under Compression"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Distribution of von Mises strain, on the surface of the masonry prism during the direct compression test.
