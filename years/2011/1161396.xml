<AbstractNarration>The main thrust of this project is to further the understanding of the long-time behavior of solutions to dispersive equations with broken symmetries. Specifically, the principal investigator considers global well-posedness, scattering, soliton formation, and finite-time blowup questions for equations such as the following: nonlinear Schrodinger outside nontrapping domains, Gross-Pitaevskii, nonlinear Schrodinger with combined focusing and defocusing nonlinearities, generalized Korteweg-de Vries. The common feature of these equations is that each has one or more broken symmetries such as spatial-translation, scaling, or Galilei invariance. By this is meant that, while the solution can concentrate at arbitrary positions in space (or length scales or frequency locations), the evolution depends nontrivially on the position (or scale or frequency location) of concentration. One of the remarkable new phenomena that can occur in this setting is that minimizing sequences of solutions to an equation with broken symmetries can converge to a solution of the same equation but in a different geometry, or even to a solution of an entirely different equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partial differential equations to be investigated in this project arise as effective models in various areas of physics, such as models for waves in shallow water, laser light in Kerr media, Bose-Einstein gases in a trap, and superconductors. While they are oversimplified models for engineering purposes, the study of these examples allows one to focus on the new phenomenology that arises when symmetries are broken. Stability of results under such perturbations is essential to make a meaningful connection to real-world systems; indeed, engineering limitations mean that real-world systems never have perfect symmetry. Conversely, failure of stability implies that computer simulations cannot be relied upon to accurately predict experimental phenomena.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The problems investigated by the PI under the purview of this award have a long history and are still matters of active research. They have been studied numerically and rigorously by mathematicians and physicists alike because they capture important facets of certain physical behaviors, while maintaining an attractive simplicity which maximizes the chances for progress and for subsequent development and dissemination.   The cubic-quintic Schroedinger equation is a model in superfluidity, descriptions of bosons and of defectons, the theory of ferromagnetic and molecular chains, and in nuclear hydrodynamics. This model captures an important phenomenology: the constituents of most fluids experience an attractive interaction at low densities and a repulsion at high densities. With zero boundary conditions at spatial infinity, this equation describes the dynamics of a finite body of fluid; when posed with non-zero boundary conditions, this equation describes the behavior of a localized disturbance in an infinite expanse of fluid that is otherwise quiescent. Together with collaborators, the PI has studied both these models. For the problem with zero boundary conditions, we discovered and described the sharp threshold for solutions to relax to the linear evolution in the distant future. For the problem with non-zero boundary conditions, we constructed global solutions with a prescribed future profile.  Further work funded by this grant studied the nonlinear Schroedinger equation in settings other than the idealized case of flat Euclidean space, including studies in the exterior of an obstacle, on the torus, and in the presence of external potentials.  From the physics point of view, this is essential to make a meaningful connection to real-world systems, which suffer from real-world defects.  On the mathematical side, it stimulates the development of new techniques that are not wedded to the use of the Fourier transform.  This award also had a component involving the development of human resources. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows were involved in key aspects of the investigations.
