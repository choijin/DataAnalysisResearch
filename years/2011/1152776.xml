<AbstractNarration>In this collaborative GOALI award, co-funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering and the Chemical and Biological Separations Programs of the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transports Systems Division, Professor Joern Siepmann of the University of Minnesota, Prof. Jake Rafferty of North Hennepin Community College and their undergraduate and graduate student researchers will work collaboratively with scientists from the Dow Chemical company to model the molecular processes taking place in a variety of analytical and separations experiments, including:  reversed-phase liquid chromatography, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatrography, ion chromatography, and the analyte distribution in self-assembled monolayers used for surface-enhanced Raman scattering.  The computational approaches that Profs. Siepmann, Rafferty and their students are developing will be combined with experimental data measured by Dr. Mark Schure and collaborators at Dow Chemical to better understand the process taking place in these experimental systems.  The ultimate goal of these kinds of experiments is to improve these processes for science and engineering applications.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The ability to cleanly and efficiently separate complex chemical mixtures into their separate components is of critical importance to a number of important industries, including the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc.  The separation and purification steps in the production of these commodities is also one that can use significant quantities of materials and produce significant amount of waste. By developing better methods for separations, Siepmann, Rafferty and others hope to improve the selectivity and efficiency of these important processes.  The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in academic and industrial settings, which will help prepare them well for a wide variety of careers in science and technology.  This project will also involve the participation of high school and community college students in this research, which will help to excite and engage the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is one of the foremost methods for the separation of complex mixtures, especially when that mixture contains a group of compounds with the same chemical formula, but different shapes (isomers).  The ability to discriminate between molecules of different shape, termed shape-selectivity, is crucial in the analysis of a variety of samples including environmental samples containing PAHs, a carcinogenic class of contaminants.  This work focused on the use of molecular simulation to understand the mechanism of shape-selectivity for PAHs in RPLC.  The molecular insight gained from this work is not only applicable to a better understanding of the RPLC technique and the development of new separation technologies, it also can help shed light on similar process such as the partitioning of molecules in the cell membrane.  By carrying out simulations of a variety of different RPLC phases under different conditions, the main factors leading to enhanced shape selectivity for PAHs became understood at the molecular level.  In agreement with experiment, it was shown that decreased temperature and increased surface coverage of the alkyl chains led to an increase in shape-selectivity.  It was also observed that for phases of equal surface coverage shape-selectivity was most pronounced for monomeric phases, a result that has not been previously reported.  With regards to the molecular mechanism of shape-selectivity for PAHs, the simulations indicate that there are specific regions within each RPLC stationary phase that can accommodate each different PAH isomer.   However, these regions are not static cavities that can be identified when the PAH is not present in the stationary phase.  Rather, the hydrocarbon chains in the stationary phase respond to the presence of the PAH molecule and adapt to accommodate it.
