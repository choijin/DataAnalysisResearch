<AbstractNarration>In this project, the researchers focus on the challenges of designing a real-time networked sensing and actuation platform for future 'intelligent' metropolitan traffic management with the aim of simultaneously reducing congestion, pollution, and traveler delays. Today, most urban traffic control is rudimentary: in smaller cities many traffic signals remain isolated, and while most larger cities have integrated systems of signals, they for the most part, are not dynamically timed in response to real-time vehicle information. Congestion fees, which are increasingly popular as a traffic management and revenue-generating tool, are usually based on historical traffic data rather than varying dynamically to reflect instantaneous conditions. Recent advances in communication, navigation, and sensor technologies present far more opportunities to increase the intelligence and efficiency of metropolitan streets than are in place today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pivotal element of the proposed Green City intelligent transport architecture will be the ability to 'close the loop' between traffic/pollution sensing and traffic control; a system achieved through an incentivized collaboration between the central traffic management and the drivers. In this collaboration, the 'intelligent' traffic signals, the Navigator Server and the on-board navigators play key roles. In addition to the traditional control of vehicular flow at signalized intersections, future traffic signal systems will sense traffic characteristics and vehicular emissions, collect data from vehicle sensors (pollution, emission, position, etc.), and broadcast traffic advisories, routings, and restrictions to on-board navigators. The Navigator Server interacts with central traffic controllers, and proposes optimal routes to the on-board navigators. Finally, the on-board navigators, incentivized by congestion/pollution fees and/or 'good navigation' credits, propose optimal routings based on drivers' preferences, local perceived traffic, and signal timing. All this is enabled by efficient vehicle to roadway infrastructure communications, from 3G channels to DSRC radios (roadside and on-board) that enable real-time, low cost, scalable information exchanges among the various architecture components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project will be highly interdisciplinary; it will benefit from the collaboration and expertise of computer science, atmospheric science, and urban planning faculty and students. The efficacy of our solution will be demonstrated via simulation, emulation, and experimentation. New education opportunities will result from the multidisciplinary nature of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF 1111971:  Closing the loop between traffic/pollution sensing and vehicle route control using traffic lights and navigators (2011-2015)  Project Team: UCLA (Computer Science, Atmospheric Sciences, Public Policy); UC Riverside; Rutgers University     Project Outcomes     Major Cities throughout the world have experienced an incredible increase in vehicular traffic causing delays in daily commutes and major pollution due to vehicle emissions. It is commonly agreed that the two problems can be jointly solved by streamlining the traffic using intelligent traffic management. The NSF Green City Project (formal title is "Closing the loop between traffic/pollution sensing and vehicle route control using traffic lights and navigators") is addressing this issue. The Project was started in Fall 2011 with a set of ambitious goals:     design a sensing and actuation platform for future "intelligent" metropolitan traffic management to simultaneously reduce congestion, pollution and traveler delays "close the loop" between traffic and pollution sensing on one end and distributed traffic control on the other, through incentivized collaboration between traffic management center and drivers Interconnect (a) sensors and actuators available on vehicles; (b) traffic, congestion, and air quality modeling tools in the Metro Traffic Control Center, and; (c) city traffic signal infrastructure to carry out both short-term vehicular traffic routing/traffic assignment (e.g. "green waves", eco routing), as well as longer term traffic planning (e.g. new installations, facilities). demonstrate the efficacy of the Green City architecture via simulation, emulation, and small scale experimentation on a Campus Vehicular Testbed (C-VeT)      These Goals were accomplished through the following Tasks:   1. Vehicular Communications and Content Centric Networking for timely propagation of urban information content (traffic, pollution, pavement conditions, accidents, possible urban disturbances, etc). Since much of the data collected by vehicles is not uploaded to the Internet, for sheer volume reasons, new Content Based Routing (a form of Vehicular NDN) was developed and tested in the UCLA vehicular Campus Testbed. Among the experiments was the retrieval of traffic/pollution information from a specific area.  2. Vehicle traffic management: Safety message and collision avoidance. The problem of routing vehicles safely and efficiently is still a top priority.  Shock wave formation, a major cause of accidents as well as increased emissions in suburban highways, was addressed. A novel car to car communication protocol was designed to help vehicles "absorb" the shockwave eliminating accidents and drastically reducing emissions (see Fig 1 below).  3. Optimal traffic rerouting. The rerouting of traffic in order to minimize a well defined utility function (the combination of driver delays and vehicle emissions) was studied, leading to efficient multi-commodity flow solutions computed in the Cloud and disseminated to car navigators. In addition, totally distributed rerouting solutions were implemented via on board navigators, to address short term congestion problems. Both solutions have been successfully tested via simulation  4. Congestion and Pollution interplay. The effect of vehicular traffic on various types of pollutants (CO, CO2, NO2, fine particles, etc.) was studied for various areas in Southern California as well as in New York using properly instrumented vehicles. Some of the studies revealed the interplay of traffic,  buildings and atmospheric conditions in determining the propagation of pollution (see Fig 2 below).  Intellectual Merit -The scientific achievements include:   Developed and demonstrated efficient, scalable Content Based Networking protocols that extend NDN to vehicles;  Produced and validated a novel vehicle traffic optimization scheme that accounts for traffic lights.  Developed and tested eco-routing based on emission models produced by UC R...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
