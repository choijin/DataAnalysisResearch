<AbstractNarration>This project integrates original research directly into undergraduate courses at both the lower and upper division level.  Students in a variety of biology laboratory courses are using DNA sequencing and bioinformatics techniques to create a biodiversity inventory of the Scripps Coastal Reserve, a wildlife refuge adjacent to the university campus.  Students learn to compose and answer compelling and timely questions about how to identify, understand, and conserve biodiversity.  For example, students in one course collect intertidal invertebrates as part of a study of anthropogenic impacts on species diversity, while students in another course sequence genes from these organisms, and students in a third course use the generated sequence data to design and test hypotheses about evolutionary processes. The objectives are to 1) engage students in the process of original research, 2) connect different courses by developing modules in which students use the same data in different ways, and 3) facilitate collaborations among courses with a web site that gives an overview of the issues, highlights student projects, and serves as an accessible repository for the data.  The ultimate aim is to help students create their own connections between disparate topics and discover the interdisciplinary basis of original research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The data the students generate will contribute to a local biodiversity database, linked to an international database and will be available through the San Diego Biodiversity Project website. In the pilot students were excited about sequencing genes of local species not yet included in any sequence database.  In addition to the intellectual impact on students, the project is adding important information concerning a highly diverse, but sparsely documented, ecosystem situated adjacent to a highly developed urban area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT:  Over 2000 students per year are directly benefiting from this project.  Approximately 700 students in the core laboratory course are learning molecular biology techniques by sequencing specific genes (molecular markers) from local terrestrial and marine species found at the Scripps Coastal Reserve. Around 1500 students in satellite courses are collecting organisms or using student-generated data to learn about ecological and evolutionary processes.  The infrastructure is designed to serve as a resource for future students wishing to advance this effort throughout the region. The curriculum being developed at UCSD can be easily exported to universities nationwide for use by those interested in creating or adding to biodiversity databases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many working scientists state that an undergraduate research internship was transformational for them.  And recent education research supports this &ndash; research opportunities increase student engagement and retention in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, or math).  But for both institutional and personal reasons, not every undergraduate science major participates in a research apprenticeship.  A way that many more students can experience the "thrill of discovery" is to incorporate authentic research into courses.  That is our goal.  Through the San Diego Biodiversity Project, close to 2000 undergraduate students over 3 years were able to participate in original research as part of their coursework.  Seventeen instructors have been involved, creating opportunities for professional development      Students are contributing to an international effort to document the worldÆs biodiversity (http://www.ibol.org).  The long-term goal of our specific project is to inventory all of the invertebrate animals at the Scripps Coastal Reserve, one of the properties of the UC Natural Reserve System (http://www.ucnrs.org).  We chose invertebrates because the need is great: scientists estimate that as many as 70% of insects, spiders and their relatives have yet to be discovered or described by science.  How can we conserve what we donÆt even know we have?     This project is possible because of a technique called DNA barcoding.  Just like every product in the store has a barcode that uniquely identifies it, every species has a region in its DNA that differentiates it from other species.  Students collect &amp; voucher specimens and generate DNA sequence data.  Through a student data portal they communicate their data to the public via the international Barcode of Life Database (BOLD, http://www.boldsystems.org).  So far, 70% of the specimens that students attempted yielded DNA sequence data.  In a recent course (winter quarter 2015) 19% of the species that students sequenced were new to the BOLD database.  Many specimens were new habitat or distributional records.     We developed a new assessment survey to evaluate student outcomes specific to this project.  We also conducted focus groups to explore student perceptions of research and how research influenced their understanding of themselves as scientists.  We are specifically examining how different groups of students respond to research, working towards a more mechanistic understanding of how research increases student engagement and retention.  This work has been submitted for publication.      Partly in collaboration with the NSF-funded Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative (CCURI), we conducted four workshops on DNA barcoding for about 100 faculty and postdoctoral scholars that are interested in teaching in the future.  As a result of these workshops, at least 13 community colleges across the country have incorporated DNA barcoding into their curriculum as a research opportunity for their students.  We have initiated a southern California barcode working group with three of these community colleges and their students have presented research at a UC San Diego research symposium.
