<AbstractNarration>The project will determine whether the creation of new species provides an opportunity for other organisms to take advantage of this and speciate in kind. In particular, the research will test whether when fruit flies of the genus Rhagoletis speciate by shifting and attacking new host plants, the parasitic wasps that attack the flies also speciate by following the flies and specializing on the new fly resources. The question is important for understanding nature because there are more species of plant eating insects like Rhagoletis and the parasites that attack them than any other types of life forms on Earth.  Thus, understanding whether speciation has rippling effects through ecosystems to sequentially amplify the creation of new species has important implications for understanding the basis for biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to helping integrate science training, education, and research activities at the local, university, and international levels, the project also has practical benefits for U.S. agriculture. Rhagoletis flies are serious pests of apples, cherries, blueberries, and several other economic crops. The question of whether the fly?s parasitoids have formed new species, therefore, has important repercussions for developing effective integrated pest management strategies. Specifically, if different wasp species attack each fly, then biocontrol efforts would need to rear and release each of the wasps separately to control each of the fly pests. In contrast, if the wasps are all part of the same population, then a one-size-fits-all strategy focused on mass release of a single cultured wasp strain may succeed.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The grant centered on testing the ideas that biodiversity begets new biodiversity. And that the evolution of new species is repeatable and can be seen in our backyard in our own lifetimes. Specifically, we tested whether the divergence of one species has consequences that reverberate through an ecosystem in nature to repeatedly cause the subsequent speciation of other members of the organismal community. We typically consider speciation from the perspective of processes operating on a single diverging lineage. However, speciation does not occur in a vacuum. Indeed, the adaptation of a population to a new environment or habitat can open up new opportunities for others to adapt and diverge in kind setting up a potential chain reaction transcending trophic levels in a community. To test this &ldquo;sequential divergence&rdquo; hypothesis, we investigated whether host shifts by <em>Rhagoletis</em> flies to new plants have had cascading consequences that amplify biodiversity at the higher parasitoid trophic level of Braconid wasps that attack the flies. The idea of sequential divergence in which biodiversity begets new biodiversity has been argued by paleontologists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists alike to help explain adaptive radiations after mass extinctions (e.g., Cambrian explosion), species richness in the tropics, and patterns of phylogenetic co-diversification. Sequential speciation is difficult to test, however, because host and parasitoid organisms could speciate together in geographic isolation or vertical parasite transmission (that is, for example, if parasites only live and reproduce inside their hosts and never leave them) can also generate patterns in which parasitoid mirrors host divergence. In this regard, the known history of the shifts of <em>Rhagoletis</em> to new host plants in the absence of geographic isolation in the last 150 years and a free living sexual stage in the wasps allowed us to rule out geographic isolation and vertical transmission.
