<AbstractNarration>Spatial navigation is a complex cognitive process that relies on robust and adaptive mechanisms to relate current and future spatial positions to specific locations in the environment. The goal of this project is to provide a better understanding of spatial navigation by integrating information obtained from experimental studies in rats, computational models, and experiments on robots that will test new hypotheses on how these mechanisms work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are major brain regions involved in mammalian spatial navigation. While the role of place cells in the hippocampus has been extensively studied, there are still many open questions on the functional role of MEC grid cells and their interaction with the hippocampal place cells. Of interest to this proposal is the recent finding that grid cells are organized in an orderly fashion along the dorso-ventral axis of the MEC, with dorsal grids being much more tightly spaced than ventral ones. The investigators hypothesize that this multiscale organization endows the navigation system with a coding mechanism that will inherently achieve robustness with respect to external perturbations such as obstacles or unexpected changes in visual cues. In order to evaluate this hypothesis the investigators will develop computational and robotic models while systematically performing experiments in rat in which the dorsal or ventral portions of MEC or hippocampus will be inactivated. They will introduce new types of mazes in which the spatial frequency of the trajectories will be controlled. This work will contribute to better spatial navigation in robotics by: (1) providing a robotic testbed to evaluate hypotheses on the role of the entorhinal cortex and (2) providing biologically plausible models for robust spatial navigation under uncertain and dynamic environments. These models will suggest alternatives to classical probabilistic methods commonly used in robot Simultaneous Localization And Mapping paradigms. This work will also contribute to studies of spatial navigation in rats by: (1) showing the usefulness of robots in providing a physical testbed beyond pure computational modeling, and (2) exploiting the shorter cycle of robot experimentation to produce maze configurations that are optimal for testing specific hypotheses in rat experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Contenido">Recent investigations of the role of dorsal versus ventral place and grid cells during multi-scale spatial navigation involve the study of dorso-ventral organization of the hippocampus and enthorinal cortex. These studies generated new anatomical and physiological data highlighting the differences between dorsal and ventral levels. Our effort was to leverage this basic research and explore the functional consequences of these differences during spatial navigation in cluttered environments. We conducted experimental rat studies and developed a new computational model based on these studies producing a multi-scale representation of space that could be used by rats and robots for spatial navigation. The results of this work demonstrated the relevance of both dorsal and ventral place cells during rat navigation. The computational model included the integration of place cells and grid cells in providing a multi-scale space representation for robot navigation in goal-oriented tasks. The experimental studies involved learning to select 3 out of 8 available feeders in an environment having no obstacles. After training, obstacles were introduced on the maze, and the animals were required to recall the learned feeders. The results obtained from these studies are quite novel in giving new relevance to ventral place cells during memory-driven navigation in complex environment. The rat experimental results provide new insights beyond past studies that had emphasized the relevance of dorsal place cells in relation to place representation but that had found that ventral place cells were hardly involved. The computational model provided results similar to those of the rat studies including dorsal versus ventral place cell inactivations. The model produced a novel multi-scale spatial representation of the environment with overlapping place fields of varying sizes depending on their dorso-ventral organization. The model also integrated grid cell firing patterns that stabilized the spatial representation by using a reset mechanism that influenced place cell firing. The model was evaluated during extended periods of exploration in both simulations and physical robot navigation.
