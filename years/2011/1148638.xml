<AbstractNarration>One of the primary tools in the investigation of perception and memory is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), which is a plot of hits ('yes' responses on target trials) vs. false alarms ('yes' responses on non-target trials). Researchers commonly claim that the details of these curves provide insight into cognitive phenomena of interest. It is not clear, however, that ROCs are sufficiently rich so as to allow differentiation of processes. The basic idea to be explored is whether ROCs collected across disparate domains have the same pattern, that is, can all be explained by common processing, or have different patterns, that is, can support rich theories of processing. Based on our observations, we will develop flexible, nonparametric, model-free tests of ROC pattern equivalence. These tests will allow us to assess whether ROCs can be used to make detailed inferences about processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding human memory has many practical consequences in education, professional training, health delivery, and even in legal settings.  Memory researchers have posited many two-process models to account for their results, including 'remember-know', 'automatic-controlled', and 'unconscious-conscious'. Unfortunately, direct tests of these models have often lacked rigor, because they have used statistical tests such as ROCs in a confirmatory mode. This project will allow perception and memory researchers to understand how to use ROCs in a more principled way.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  One of the long-standing questions in psychology is whether people have partial information or partial feelings of knowing.  For example, is it possible to not quite remember something but still feel like one knows it.  Likewise, is it possible to vaguely and imprecisely see some object without recognizing the whole? Phenomenological experience seemingly affirms that there are feelings of knowing without precise knowledge, but subject experience is a poor scientific guide.   Whether human cognition is mediated by discrete all-or-none states or is mediated by continuous, partial information remains topical in understanding memory and perception.  The above question about the nature of information processing is not straightforward.  Our approach is to look for statistical signatures of mixtures. Mixtures are the hallmark of discrete all-or-none states.  We develop conventional and Bayesian statistical analyses for assessing mixtures.  We considered whether simple stimuli, such as words, letters, and those that vary in a single dimension, such as length or orientation, are processed in an all-or-none manner or with partial information.  And we do so in both perception and memory tasks, where in perception tasks participants just have to report what they see, while in memory tasks they have to report what they remember of previously studied episodes.    The main result is that stimuli matter much than task.  If the stimuli are rich&mdash;that is they are multidimensional and have semantic content such as words and letters&mdash;they seem to be processed in an all-or-none-fashion.  But if the stimuli vary smoothly and continuously, as with lengths and orientations, they seem to be processed with partial information, and the mental representation seems smooth and continuous.   These results seemingly held for both perception and memory.  Characteristics of the stimulus rather than the nature of task determine the modality of processing.   We also assessed whether simple stimuli of a few dimensions are processed likewise.  Indeed, multiple letters or numbers are processed in parallel without any speed loss for many features.  Stimuli composed of separable, continuous dimensions, say rectangles with smoothly varying lengths, are processed in a serial fashion.  Adding more dimensions takes more time to process.  These results jointly form a cohesive picture of processing.  Rich, abstract stimuli are processed in an all-or-none fashion.  Simple stimuli that vary smoothly: duration, length, orientation and the like, are represented continuously and smoothly as well.  A smooth, continuous partial representation is necesary for ideal or lossless processing of stimuli.  Discrete all-or-none states represent lossy processing in as much as no partial information is retained.  Though smooth, continuous partial representations are necessary for ideal processing, this mode is not sufficient. We also tested whether people combined stimulus information ideally, that is as a Bayesian ideal observer.  The results were a dramatic failure of ideal-observer properties.  Even when information was continuous and smoothly varying, people seemingly had large degrees of loss.    In addition to these substantive results, we have made strides in advancing reproducible social science.  Reproducibility---the property that anyone can reach the same results with research---is a hallmark of science.  Nonetheless, reproducibility has been fleeting in psychology, and more generally, throughout the social sciences.  With support, we have developed two real-world practical elements of reproducibility.  The first is what we call "Born Open Data."  Here we use modern archiving under Git and GitHub to make our data publicly available within 24 hours of creation.  This archiving is done automatically every night, and anyone with an internet connection can access our data.  The second is what we call "total transparency."  Our papers are not so much written as scripted.  The script calla in the data, performs the analysis, creates figures and tables, and typesets the text.  These scripts are publicly available, and anyone with an internt connection can see the complete set of decisions, manipultions, and computations we do in analysis.
