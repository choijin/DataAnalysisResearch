<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to San Francisco State University (SFSU) that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2016. The program's focus is in the area of ecology, evolution, and developmental biology. REU fellows will work with an exceptionally diverse team of REU mentors with active extramurally funded research labs, many of which are located at SFSU's marine station, the Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies (RTC). The program will feature a one-week intensive lab/lecture/field methods course, a 9-week independent research project conducted on the main campus or at RTC, a 9-week professional development seminar, a bioethics workshop, a variety of networking activities, and a campus-wide research conference where students present their research projects to the broader community. The program's recruitment effort consists of "hard copy" and digitally based advertising, as well as through networking activities by REU alumni and faculty. The goals of this program are to provide research training for students at an early stage of their academic careers and to encourage them to not only complete their undergraduate degrees in the sciences but also to consider graduate-level training and careers in the sciences. Therefore, students are selected based on their academic record, letters of recommendation, specific interest in the area of ecology, evolution, and development, and future career goals. Students are tracked to determine completion of their degree program and the impact of the research experience on their career path. Pre and post surveys as well as an REU common assessment tool will be used to evaluate the program. More information is available by visiting http://biology.sfsu.edu/faculty-pages/reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Carmen Domingo at cdomingo@sfsu.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Sarah Cohen at sarahcoh@sfsu.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In addition to providing a stimulating research experience, our REU program incorporates social events, ethics workshop, and networking opportunities designed to foster the development of an ongoing community of learners, allowing students to make connections that endure beyond the end of the summer and help support them in their academic and career paths. Over the long-term, the program has contributed to the diversification of the research profession and the scientific workforce, as it is designed to interest URM students in the biological sciences, provide a solid foundation for students to launch their upper division science coursework, nurture the development of both formal and informal support networks that can make a crucial contribution to retention and academic success, and encourage diverse students to consider careers in the sciences. During our current funding cycle we were funded to support 10 students per year. Since 2009 we trained 81 REU fellows, 57% were URMs, the majority had no prior research experience (78%) and were early in their college careers (72% completed only lower division course work). Of our REU students that have had time to complete their undergraduate degree, 26 (53%) of them have gone on to PhD or master&rsquo;s programs. Moreover, of those pursuing graduate studies, 54% of them are URMs. These are very strong outcomes especially given that our REU program, in most cases, was the first research training opportunity that these students experienced. Lastly, our applicant pool has continued to expand with over 300 applications received each year since 2013.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Carmen&nbsp;Domingo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1156452/1156452_10165529_1522645945562_2013REUretreat--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1156452/1156452_10165529_1522645945562_2013REUretreat--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2013 SF State REU Retreat"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1156452/1156452_10165529_1522645945562_2013REUretreat--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2013 SF State REU Retreat"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2013 SF State REU Retreat at Jug Handle Cove, CA</div> <div class="imageCredit">Carmen Domingo</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carmen&nbsp;Domingo</div> <div class="imageTitle">2013 SF State REU Retreat</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
