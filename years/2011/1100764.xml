<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to model the effect of aerodynamic damping on the dynamics and stability of flapping flight, based on our recent discovery of flapping counter torques and flapping counter forces.  We will undertake a combined experiment and analytical method, including aerodynamic force measurements using dynamically scale robotic wings, flow visualization and measurement using Digital Particle Image Velocimetry, and mathematical modeling based on dynamics and control theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will advance scientific bases and develop comprehensive theories of flapping flight in animals and man-made systems.  It is the first attempt to model the flapping flight dynamics under different flight conditions and the first step in explaining why flying animals possesses both superior stability and maneuverability. The research results will be disseminated broadly to the biology, physics, and engineering communities.  The theories developed in this work can be translated into other forms of locomotion such as walking, crawling and swimming.  Advances in flapping wing micro aerial vehicles can be used in various civilian and defense applications.  The project will provide a unique, interdisciplinary training environment for graduate and undergraduate students.  In particular, the undergraduate researchers will participate through Purdue SURF and NSF REU programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This research advanced the fundamental knowledge in the aerodynamics, system dynamics and stability of flapping flight in man-made or natural flyers.  We explored the effect of aerodynamic damping on the dynamics and stability of flapping flight.  In nature, insects and birds demonstrate superior stability and maneuverability compared to conventional fixed wing aircrafts.  Based on systematic experiments and analysis using live flying animals, robotic prototypes, fluid mechanics experiments, dynamics and control theories, we have discovered a unique aerodynamic damping mechanism - caused by body motion coupled with flapping wings - which significantly affects system dynamics and stability.  Based on this mechanism, we revised and modeled the full body dynamics and analyzed their effect on flight stability and control. The problems are interdisciplinary and involve fundamental scientific problems in the fields of biology, physics and engineering.  In this proposed research, we will undertake a combined experiment and analytical method, including aerodynamic force and torque measurements using dynamically scale robotic wings in an oil tank, flow visualization and measurement using Digital Particle Image Velocimetry, and mathematical modeling using dynamics and control theories. Robotic prototype development and a scale study across insect species were also erformed.   The scientific merit of this work is in developing a science-base for understanding how aerodynamic damping is caused by body motions in flapping flight and how it affects the overall dynamics and stabilities of the system.  Mathematical modeling and validation by case studies across a variety of insect species with wing morphological and kinematic differences were performed.  Ultimately this scientific basis will advance the development of a comprehensive theory of animal flight.  The empirical force database developed from this research advanced our understanding on fundamental physics of fluid in flapping flight. The theories developed from this research are potentially transformative and will provide important design guidelines and significantly advance the development of bio-inspired micro aerial vehicles with inherent stability and maneuverability. The broader impact sulting from this research enhanced the infrastructure for research and education through interdisciplinary research in biology and engineering.  The research results were published and be disseminated broadly to the biology, physics, and engineering research communities.  The theories developed in this work can potentially be translated into other forms of locomotion such as walking, crawling and underwater swimming.  Advances in high performance flapping wing micro aerial vehicles can be used in civilian and defense applications such as search and rescue in collapsed buildings, or indoor surveillance such as in crowded airports.
