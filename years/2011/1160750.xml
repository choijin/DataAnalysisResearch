<AbstractNarration>This RAPID project will examine the current drought in East Africa in a timely manner. There are four scientific goals (i) to assess the severity of the drought and the extent of regional area affected; (ii) to determine the seasonal nature of the drought; (iii) to investigate the factors contributing to its unusual severity; and (iv) to predict the likelihood that the drought will persist into 2012. Reaching this understanding is more challenging for the Horn of Africa than for most areas of Africa because of the complexity of the seasonal cycle, the multiple factors that influence drought in this region, the lack of access to meteorological data from some of the countries afflicted, and the sparse history of meteorological research on this region. The prediction will be carried out in collaboration with the research group of Prof. Peter Webster of Georgia Institute of Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase understanding of meteorology in an area of the world that is frequently plagued by weather disasters and where we currently have little understanding of the factors governing such disasters. Finally the project will demonstrate a forecast approach that, if successful, has the potential to be applied to other locations and situations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major research activities were two-fold: documenting the recent drought situation in the Horn of Africa and developing a forecast scheme for rainfall in the region.  Both the analysis and the forecasting emphasized two geographical regions: the summer rainfall region (mostly northern Ethiopia) and the equatorial rainfall region. The latter includes southern Ethiopia, Somalia, most of Kenya and Uganda, and northern Tanzania.  We documented widespread drought occurred 1998, 2000, 2005/06, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011 and we showed that both the frequency of drought episodes and the duration of conditions with below-average rainfall have increased during the last seven years.  During the four years 2008 to 2011 rainfall was 30% to 75% below normal over the Horn of Africa, northern Kenya and most of the Sudan.  The situation was particularly severe during the twelve months of July 2010 to June 2011 when over three consecutive rainy seasons rainfall  was at least 50% below normal over nearly all of Somalia, northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia.  A surprising feature of the recent droughts is the persistence through all three rainy seasons. This may indicate a common factor operating in  all three seasons, although prior work has indicated very different factors in interannual variability in each of these seasons.  A simple statistical method, multiple linear regression, was developed for all three rainy seasons.  It provides excellent predictability of the July-to-September and October-November seasons in both the summer rainfall region and the equatorial rainfall region (where rainfall generally occurs in the two transition seasons).  Forecast skill was weaker but acceptable for the March-to-May season, but with little lead time (February input data).   We found that circulation variables, especially lower and upper tropospheric winds, were generally much better predictors than surface variables such as sea-surface temperature or surface pressure.  By using these variables, we obtained higher forecast skill than prior attempts and was applied to a longer time period. The correlation between observed and predicted regionally-averaged rainfall was generally between .72 and .8, calculated for the period 1950 to 2005.  We also found that forecasts for the long rains  of March-to-May are improved if a separate regression model is created for each month.  Global teleconnections (simultaneous) are also very different for each month).  Our forecasts and the methodology were transmitted to the meteorological departments in several East African countries.
