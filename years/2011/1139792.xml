<AbstractNarration>The research program, which is in collaboration with Kennametal, Inc., Latrobe, PA, aims to advance the fundamental understanding of nanoscale ceramic composites for potential use in abrasive and cutting tool materials. Ceramic eutectic surface layers will be deposited onto commercial cutting tools via laser solidification, which is a commercially scalable technique.  Moreover, the laser processing allows for high processing velocities that lead to well-oriented, nanoscale eutectic microstructures, smaller than that achievable by conventional processes.  This resulting nanoscale microstructures are expected to lead to marked property enhancements (e.g. in hardness, strength and wear).  The research will develop two classes of eutectics: oxides and carbides for the surface modification of Al2O3- and WC-based cutting tools, respectively. Through quantitative microstructural and mechanical property characterization, the dominant deformation mechanisms and microstructural scaling laws for these classes of ceramic eutectics will be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program is anticipated to lead to a new method for enhancing the mechanical properties and lifetimes of high-performance cutting tools. The direct interactions with Kennametal Inc. will increase the likelihood that the methods can be quickly adopted and integrated into a commercial process. In addition, the research program will train students, both graduate and undergraduate, in a unique academic/industrial research setting and prepare them to enter and lead the growing fields of laser processing and tribological surface coatings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research program aimed to advance laser-surface processing of hard, naturally formed composite ceramics to enable the development of high-performance cutting tools. A high-hardness WC-W2C eutectoid composite was produced via directional laser processing, and the size-scale of the microstructure could be controlled via the solidification velocity.  The smallest microstructure samples exhibited enhanced indentation mechanical properties in comparison to previously reported and commercially available WC&ndash;Co composites and WC-based materials used in cutting tool and abrasive technologies. In addition to improved mechanical properties, the newly developed composite materials should also provide greater thermal stability since they are entirely composed of ceramic phases and do not contain lower melting-point metallic inclusions.  Extensive microscopy investigations showed that the internal interfaces between the two constituent phases impede deformation, and the high interface density results in the improved mechanical behavior.  This material system has the potential to serve as a future cutting tool material, although manufacturability needs to be further studied.     In collaboration with research partner, Kennametal Corp., the research also explored the feasibility of applying eutectics directly to existing commercial cutting tools.  While limited success was achieved with adhesion between the surface processed layer and underlying substrate material, the research illuminated the difficulties in controlling thermal stresses during the processing.   In addition to the technological implications of the research, the program also provided fundamental insight into how the size of the composite microstructure can be controlled via the laser solidification conditions.  Furthermore, quantitative relationships between microstructural size and hardness were experimentally established.  Finally, the project demonstrated that the hardness in these materials decrease with increasing indentation load, until it converges to a constant value concomitant with the appearance of cracking.  The project taught numerous undergraduate and graduate students research methodologies and methods by providing hands-on research opportunities in a technologically important field.  Specifically, the students learned scientific methods related to ceramic processing, indentation mechanical properties and microstructural characterization.   In addition, the students developed their scientific communication skills through both written and oral dissemination of the technical findings.      The research program also supported outreach activities aimed at increasing the exposure of K-12 students to engineering and science disciplines. For example, in 2012 Professor Dickey assisted in developing and delivering curriculum for a pilot "Science Everywhere STEM Program" as part of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America new STEM initiative.
