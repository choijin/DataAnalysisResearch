<AbstractNarration>This project deals with algebraic dynamical systems and their applications to number theory. It has been observed for a long time that many problems concerning diophantine approximation, that is, various phenomena related to the theory of integer equations or inequalities,  can be cast in terms of the behavior of trajectories of a suitable homogeneous flow. The principal investigator plans to continue his study of those trajectories, aiming at new applications to number theory. Dynamical tools to be used are: quantitative nondivergence on the space of lattices, Schmidt games and their modifications, recurrence of random walks, measure rigidity, mixing and equidistribution properties.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A dynamical system here stands for an abstract set of points together with an evolution law which governs the way points move over time. It turns out that many problems concerning simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers can be understood in terms of the behavior of certain orbits. Furthermore, systems that arise in this context are of algebraic nature, which makes it possible to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools for their investigation. The educational aspect of the proposal involves exposing graduate and undergraduate students to new methods and techniques in number theory and dynamical systems, and supervising research projects of high school students within the framework of the PRIMES program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project deals with a connection between dyamical systems and number theory. A  dynamical system here stands for an abstract set of points together   with an evolution law which governs the way points move over time. It   turns out that many problems concerning simultaneous approximation of   real numbers by rational numbers can be understood in terms of the   behavior of certain orbits. Furthermore, systems that arise in this   context are of algebraic nature (so-called homogeneous spaces), which makes it possible to use a wide   variety of sophisticated tools for their investigation.  One important theme of the project was studying exceptional trajectories and corresponding number-theoretical objects. For example, it was conjectured by Margulis in 1990 that for so-called partially hyperbolic flows  there always exist many orbits which are both bounded and stay away from a fixed finite set of the space. This was proved in 2013 by Kleinbock and Weiss. Along the way a techhnique of Modified Schmidt Games was developed, which later was replaced by Hyperplane Absolute Games, a p?werful tool to prove abundance of certain objects in dynamics and number the?ry. N?te that b?undess ?f th?se ?rbis c?rresp?nds t? being badly appr?ximable by rati?nal vectvrs.  An?ther directi?n was related t? rati?nal p?ints ?n spheres and, m?re generally, quadratic hypersurfaces, using dynamics. Supp?se that there is a dense set ?f th?se p?ints. H?w are they distributed? and h?w likely is it t? find a rati?nal p?int with relatively small den?minat?r n?t far fr?m a typical p?int ?n the sphere? This was the subject ?f Kleinb?ck's paper with Merrill, and then, in a m?re general set-up, with Fishman, Merrill and Weiss. The dynamical system resp?nsible f?r the appr?ximati?n pr?perties happens t? be a fl?w ?n a qu?tient ?f the special ?rth?g?na gr?up ?f the c?rresp?nding quadratic f?rm,  An?ther interesting number-the?retic pr?pertiy ?f vect?rs/matrices -- singularity  -- was studied using dynamical meth?ds. It c?rresp?nds t? divergence ?f traject?ries; upper estimates f?r their Hausd?rff dimensi?n were ?btained using a meth?d ?f integral ineqalities (with Kadyr?v, Lindenstrauss and Margulis).   The br?ader impact ?f the pr?ject is related t? its educational  aspect. It exposedg graduate and undergraduate  students to new methods and techniques in number theory and dynamical  systems, by means ?f reading c?urses and invited lectures. It als? inv?lved: supervising research projects of high school students  within the framework of the PRIMES program, lecturing t? talented high sch??l students in a summer camp in Beijing, and rec?rding a Y?uTube vide? highlighting c?nnecti?ns between dynamics and number the?ry f?r general n?n-mathematical audience.
