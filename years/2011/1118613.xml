<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Biological nitrogen fixation - the reduction of N2 to yield two moles of ammonia (NH3/ NH4+) that are available as plant nutrient - is catalyzed by the metalloenzyme, nitrogenase. The agronomic, economic, and social significance of nitrogenase can be appreciated by recognizing that the lives of about two-thirds of today's human population depend on plant growth, which relies on biologically fixed nitrogen generated by nitrogenase. The other third depends on nitrogen fixation by the industrial Haber-Bosch process, but this process is a significant component in the world's energy usage, demanding approximately 1 percent of human energy consumption. Whether the biological process can be more effectively exploited for human benefit remains an urgent question, and thus it is imperative that an understanding be achieved of the means by which organisms manage to activate and cleave N2 at ambient temperature and pressure. This project is addressing these questions through the use of electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies to characterize catalytic intermediates that form during the process of nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. ENDOR/ESEEM studies uniquely provide information about the electronic properties of the substrate-binding/reduction active site, and supply detailed structural information regarding metal-bound substrates, intermediates, and products. No other technique offers this information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The outreach program associated with this project can be viewed (roughly) as a pyramid. At the apex are intellectual/scientific contributions to the discipline itself, and to the research community. Supporting these intellectual endeavors are contributions to the training of post doctoral scholars and graduate students, not only for this project but throughout the country and the world. The foundation level involves the encouragement of undergraduates and even high-school students, especially of women and underrepresented minorities, to participate in the scientific enterprise.</AbstractNarration>

A central defining feature of this scheme is a mysterious and puzzling, obligatory (mechanistic) requirement for the formation of one H2 for each N2 reduced. This, in turn, leads to a limiting enzymatic stoichiometry for enzyme-catalyzed nitrogen fixation, given by eq 1,  N2 + 8e- +16ATP + 8H+ &rarr; 2NH3 + H2 + 16ADP + 16Pi                   (1)       We recently proposed that obligatory H2 formation was required to explain the multitude of mechanistic observations by numerous investigators that had accumulated over decades. This proposal focuses on the E4(4H) ?Janus intermediate? (See Fig 1 for notation), which has accumulated four of the eight required reducing equivalents, storing them as two [Fe-H-Fe] bridging hydrides. E4(4H) sits at a transition in the N2 reduction pathway, poised to ?fall back? to E0 by release of two H2, but equally poised to bind and reduce N2 through the accumulation of four more equivalents, hence the appellation.       We proposed that the E4(4H) state becomes activated for the binding of N2 and its  hydrogenation to a N2H2-level moiety through the reductive elimination (re) of the two hydrides as H2, the forward direction of the equilibrium in Fig 1.  and supported this proposal by first using it to explain key constraints on nitrogenase mechanism that had been revealed over the years, and then by a variety of experiments designed to test it.

The photolysis quantum yield is temperature invariant at liquid helium temperatures and shows a rather large kinetic isotope effect, KIE = 10. These observations imply that photoinduced release of H2 involves a barrier to the combination of the two nascent H atoms, in contrast to a barrierless process for mono-metallic inorganic complexes, and further suggest that H2 formation involves nuclear tunneling through that barrier. This leads us to the preliminary picture of the energy surfaces for photoinduced re/oa for the Janus intermediate presented in Fig 2.       The oa recombination of E4(2H)* with the liberated H2 offers compelling evidence for the Janus intermediate as the point at which H2 is necessarily lost during N2 reduction; this mechanistically coupled loss must be gated by N2 addition that drives the re/oa equilibrium toward reductive elimination of H2 with N2 binding/reduction. Viewed more broadly, photolysis of the Janus E4(4H) intermediate embeds FeMo-co even more deeply within the body of organometallic chemistry, which underpins our growing understanding of the enzyme function, while breaking new ground.
