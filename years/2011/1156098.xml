<AbstractNarration>PROGRAM DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1156098 &lt;br/&gt;Missouri University of Science and Technology &lt;br/&gt;Madria &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missouri University of Science and Technology (MUST) is planning to join the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)entitled "Center for Net Centric Software and Systems" which currently is a multi- university center comprised of the University of North Texas (lead institution), the University of Texas at Dallas, and Arizona State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MUST requests funding for becoming a site of the Center for Net Centric Software and Systems, under the leadership of Professor Sanjay Madria. The funds from this planning grant will be used primarily to organize an industry-university meeting that will help market the proposed site to industry. The proposed site will bring capabilities in situational-aware collaborative computing to the center. Initial research projects at the planning meeting will be in areas such as sensor data fusion, secure and trusted data aggregation, software code optimization and cloud computing. The research group at MUST will, therefore, bring several complementary research capabilities to the current Net Centric research thrusts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research findings at the proposed site will enhance knowledge of scientific community and industrial members in the area of Net-centric computing and wireless technologies. Utilizing existing programs and facilities, MUST will support and extend its efforts and seek to integrate new paradigms developed in its educational curriculum. Plans are also detailed for outreach to recruit students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
