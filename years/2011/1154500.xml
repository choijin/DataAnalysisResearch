<AbstractNarration>This Engineering the Future project provides scholarship support for 30 academically promising but financially disadvantaged students in four engineering technology departments: Computer Engineering Technology (CET), Computer Systems Technology (CST), Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering Technology (ETET), and Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET) at New York City College of Technology of The City University of New York. To close the significant gender gap that exists in enrollment, retention, and graduation of female students at the associate and baccalaureate degree levels, this project focuses on a matrix of enhancements and supports to meet the needs of female scholarship recipients while providing a rich array of opportunities for all scholars in the program.  These include peer mentoring, tutoring, counseling, outreach, research and internship opportunities, First-Year Learning Communities, and peer-led team learning (PLTL) and laboratory-based learning.  The project intends to:  increase the number of female students, a severely underrepresented population in engineering technology programs at City Tech, by 25% over four years; enable 80% of the S-STEM scholars to persist in their studies to the following year; and graduate 20% more STEM recipients than the general student population. The project seeks to reduce the significant gender gap in the targeted engineering technology fields, raise the profile of successful students in engineering technology programs, and lay solid groundwork for women and underrepresented students to participate in the technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In 1988 the movie "Stand and Deliver" was released. The movie is the true story of Mr. Jaime Esclante,&nbsp; a dedicated math teacher who believed that a school's role was to encourage their students (mainly low income minority), to get goals, and to achieve them beyond their expectations. We too, at City Tech also believe that the NSF-S Stem scholarship program will promote the opprrtunity for City Tech scholar students to become highly motivated, academically competent and successful, leading to productive and professional careers in the current engineering technology work force. From fall 2012 to spring 2016, 95 students have been granted NSF-S scholarships, 21 students being female. Approximately, 89% of the students are low income minority students.</p> <p>Students were asked to set career golas. The highest ranked selected professions were computer engineers, eletrical and telecom engineers, followed by mechanical engineers.</p> <p>Stipens were awarded to all students based on their qualifications and financial needs, and goals and project&nbsp;objectives were clearly defined by the&nbsp;administration and the PIs.</p> <p>Retention/persistence rates were set and carefully monitored between fall 2012 to spring 2016. The S-STEM Scholar persistence rate was 86.4%. Students were also required to maintain full-time status, and a minimum GPA&nbsp;of 3.0 every semester. A comprehensive matrix of academic/personal support was established which included peer mentoring, tutoring if necessary, counseling, advisement, and internships.</p> <p>In addition, research, seminars/conferences, field trips, and poster presentations involved all S-STEM receipents.&nbsp;These activates help to improve the scholar's motivation, confidence, academic performance, may provide the edge in securing a rewarding career in the private or public sector work force.&nbsp;Scholars indicated high levels of satisfaction with the program's academic/personal support.</p> <p>Field trips to institutions/companies such as NASA, Microsoft Technology Centers, IBM, Infor.com, the MTA, and Brookhaven National Labs help expose NSF scholars to the current needs of industry and encourage exploration to make our students active participants in their learning experiences.</p> <p>As of spring 2016, 47% of the S-STEM scholars participated in a research activity. Based on their interest and some career experience gained from internships, student wrote research papers under the guidence of their faculty mentors. Typical research papers included topics such as cyber security, satellite imaging, Fourier analysis, software testing, reducing medical waste, biomedical tissue, engineering education, and meteorology. Their papers reflects a high degree of professionalism, understanding, stamina, and a high degree of summative assesment.</p> <p>In conclusion the NSF S-STEM scholarship program has had a significant impact in improved educational opportunities, improvable program support incrase persistence, and increased female participation.
