<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the support of an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship, I contributed to the field of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations, broadly interpreted, by publishing original research in peer-reviewed journals, by actively participating in relevant conferences and workshops, and by carrying out other activities and duties related to professional academic work, such as reviewing journal articles.  Partial differential equations are used to describe many physical processes, and the systems I concentrated on in my research are motivated by problems arising in two-dimensional physics. The particular systems I studied were Schroedinger maps, which are used to model magnetism, and the Chern-Simons-Schroedinger system, which, among other things, explains the quantum Hall effect.  My research and results on these systems extends in several different directions. One very interesting result concerns the unconditional uniqueness of solutions to the infinite radial Chern-Simons-Schroedinger hierarchy. This joint work with Xuwen Chen contributes to our understanding of how large numbers of particles in the same quantum state can exhibit group behavior modeled by a nonlinear system of equations. A novelty of our approach is that we take into account a self-generated electromagnetic-like field, which introduces serious technical challenges.  One result of mine on Schroedinger maps concerns the discovery of an unconstrained Lagrangian formulation for the system. As a result, several conservation laws obeyed by the system can be derived in a systematic manner. Moreover, the entire approach respects the inherent geometry that is present, and so can be considered a very natural approach.  Additional results include proving global wellposedness of the equivariant Chern-Simons-Schroedinger system (joint with Baoping Liu), finding a controlling norm for energy-critical Schroedinger maps (joint with Benjamin Dodson), proving conditional global regularity of Schroedinger maps in a dispersed energy setting, and proving low-regularity local wellposedness of the Chern-Simons-Schroedinger system (joint with Baoping Liu and Daniel Tataru).  While these results are by nature technical, in general terms they mainly describe how physical systems behave under certain conditions. The mathematical techniques that were advanced can also be applied to totally different physical systems, or perhaps even to applications outside the scope of nonlinear dispersive PDE.
