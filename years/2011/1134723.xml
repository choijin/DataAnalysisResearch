<AbstractNarration>Program Director's Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1134723 &lt;br/&gt;Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI); Shur &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Connection One site at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is proposing a Phase II support (second five-year period) for the Center, including support for central personnel, evaluation and research. The center is currently comprised of the Arizona State University (lead), the University of Arizona, the University of Hawaii, and the Ohio State University as research partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this Phase II RPI proposal is to build on and continue its successful Phase I effort as part of the "Connection One: Communications Circuits and Systems Center" (C1 Center) already funded by the National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Program. The proposed program will expand the C1 research base in advancing the understanding of advanced terahertz electronics and RF devices, developing the principles of technologies for fast and secure communication, and fast and efficient optical-to-electrical signal conversion in nanoscale heterostructures. The program will also include the development of novel device designs with dual electrical/optical control and the corresponding circuit design concepts and methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site will serve as a catalyst for the next generation of communication and data transport industries in the United States. This Research Site will serve as a focal point for collaborative research and for the education of a diverse new generation of students and scientists prepared to develop and lead the deployment of such new technologies. The Center/site will facilitate the industrial experience of students improving their job prospects and exposing them to experts from industry. The transformative nature of the program at RPI will be instrumental in engaging students, attracting them to REU, graduate programs and summer internships; it will also be a key tool towards increasing the participation of minority students in cutting edge research by recruitingthem for REU projects and establishing joint programs with HBCUs.</AbstractNarration>
