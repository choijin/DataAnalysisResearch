<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop a probabilistic ground motion model that takes into account the time-varying characteristics of earthquake ground motions to better describe their damage potential.   This research will result in new methodologies to identify the most relevant seismological features affecting the severity of ground motions, to describe the manner in which seismic energy is distributed in the joint time-frequency domain, and to quantify the prediction uncertainty in a unified and structured manner. The research approach is to use a combination of signal processing, feature selection, and machine learning tools that will be customized for ground motions. Deliverables include new methodologies and software tools for analysis and simulation of ground motions, research reports and publications, and education of undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will help establish improved guidelines for selection and simulation of ground motions to be used in seismic design of structures, which in turn will help reduce the cost of damage due to future earthquake occurrences.  The methodology established in this project will be applicable to other real world processes such as wind and ocean waves.  The research findings will be disseminated to broader audiences through journal articles, conferences, and a project website.  All the software tools developed in this project will be made available to engineers, researchers, educators and students. Graduate and undergraduate students in engineering and computer science departments will benefit from this project through enriched curricula and research experience. Two graduate students will be trained to perform the research tasks.  Students at K-12 levels will be exposed to earthquake engineering through outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Establishment of reliable seismic design guidelines requires reasonable estimates of the seismic loads that a structure will experience during its service life.  Earthquake ground motions are produced by complex processes that are not yet fully understood. The gaps in our understanding of the involved physical mechanisms, coupled with the lack of a sufficient number of recordings from a wide variety of seismological conditions have challenged the task of ground motion estimation. As a result, traditional ground motion prediction models have relied on simplistic equations that are based on a set of strong assumptions. Recent advances in computer technology and the growth in seismic databases have led to an increased interest in data-driven modeling approaches where the relationship between input and output is inferred from the observed data, without using a fixed, parametric equation. This project sought answers to the following questions: (1) Can a data-driven model reliably estimate the ground motion from a scenario earthquake dominating the seismic hazard at a given site?  (2) Which seismic predictors should be included in the model? (3) Can the prediction uncertainty be quantified in a manner accessible to researchers and engineers not well-versed in data-driven modeling?  Our findings showed that data-driven ground motion modeling is a viable alternative to its traditional counterparts. We used cross validation to identify the set of predictors to be included in the model. The selected variable set depends on the amount of information provided by each candidate predictor, as well as the information shared by different predictor subsets. For a special case where we allowed incorporation of known, well-justified knowledge into the model, we derived analytical equations for confidence and prediction intervals. For more general settings, we used Bayesian inference to quantify the prediction uncertainty.  The methodology we followed in this project was aimed at fuller utilization of the information contained in seismic records facilitating construction of improved ground motion models, ultimately, enabling more accurate assessment of the performance of the nationÆs critical infrastructure in future earthquakes. This project is highly interdisciplinary, drawing from earthquake engineering, machine learning, classical and Bayesian statistics, data mining, and information theory.  Since, at a broad level, this project addresses the problem of extracting meaningful patterns from observations, the findings are relevant to a wide array of disciplines encompassing engineering, science, and medicine where empirical modeling is of interest.  This project funded three graduate students, one of whom has earned a PhD degree. The Principal Investigator introduced and taught a graduate level course on reliability, and the Co-Principal Investigator used project findings in course projects.
