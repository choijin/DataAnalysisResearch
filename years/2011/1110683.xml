<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation improvement project will study the loss of nitrogen from soils to the atmosphere, a process called denitrification.  Traditionally, denitrification was thought to occur mostly in surface soils, but recent evidence suggests that deeper soils can also play an important role in the nitrogen cycle.   This project will conduct a series of experiments to assess the rates of denitrification from deep soils and how this affected by specific agricultural practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Denitrification represents one of the major pathways that biologically available nitrogen leaves terrestrial ecosystems, along with leaching, volatilization, and runoff, and is the only process capable of returning nitrogen to its inert form of dinitrogen gas. Understanding where and at what rate dinitrification occurs is fundamental to understanding the nitrogen cycle.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas roughly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2). Agriculture is the major source of anthropogenic emissions of N2O. Knowledge of sources and factors affecting N2O production in agricultural soils is required for assessing effective management for emission reduction and mitigation potential.  This project examined the links between soil N2O concentrations throughout the growing season and their relation to N2O emissions from the soil surface. We were able to confirm N2O emission increase for irrigated plots as well as with increased nitrogen fertilizer input. This validates an assumption that concentrations in the soil and emissions from the soil surface are related in a significant manner and poses a further question: which part of the soil produces the majority of seasonal N2O flux and under what conditions?  Our work examined the significance of N2O production at different depths in the soil profile and their contribution to overall emissions. We found that the contribution of the deeper soil layers to seasonal N2O emissions could be significant and equal to that of the surface soil for some conditions. We observed the most significant relative contribution to seasonal N2O emissions (up to 50%) from subsoil (below 30 cm) in highly fertilized rainfed treatments. Irrigated treatments had more than 80% of the relative emissions produced in top 10 cm of the profile. This is probably due to the surface soil of the rainfed treatmentÃ†s being dry for a significant period of the growing season, whereas in the irrigated treatment the surface soil layer has much more water for a majority of the growing season.  Outcomes of the project will help to improve our understanding of connections between land management, the distribution of N2O concentrations at depths, and total emissions to the atmosphere, and results will help build better models for predicting N2O emissions at field scales.
