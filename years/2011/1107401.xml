<AbstractNarration>Apex predators such as killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) directly compete with humans for ecosystem services such as fishery resources. One example of this type of competition is whale depredation on longline fisheries in Alaska. Sperm whale and killer whale depredation occurs when whales remove fish from longline gear, damage fish and/or fishing gear. This interaction has negative consequences for the longline fishery and for the whales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary dissertation project explores how whale depredation is impacting longline fishing practices and fishery resource use in Alaska. This research will synthesize social research interview and written questionnaire results with quantitative NMFS fishery data to construct a detailed economic analysis of the costs associated with depredation. Results from this study will establish baseline information on the socio-ecological and socio-economic impacts of cetacean depredation and how depredation impacts the long-term sustainability of longline fisheries in Alaska.</AbstractNarration>

More frequent killer whale depredation on the longline survey relative to commercial operations is consistent with other findings reported in this dissertation that commercial fishery operations actively avoid killer whales and generally will not continue to retrieve their gear when killer whales are present.  Killer whale depredation had a significant effect on NMFS longline survey catch rates for five of the six groundfish species evaluated: sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus).  Catch reductions were consistent between the NMFS survey and commercial fishery data despite different modeling approaches (Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models, respectively), averaging 35-69% for sablefish, Pacific halibut and Greenland turbot in the commercial fishery and 51-73% for the same species in the survey.

This project advanced our understanding of toothed whale interactions with Alaskan longline fisheries and associated impacts to the socio-economic sustainability of Alaskan longline fisheries. We refined estimates of catch removals by killer whales and resulting reductions in catch per unit effort (CPUE). We...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
