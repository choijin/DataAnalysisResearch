<AbstractNarration>The project is a collaborative program of research, education and training based on the Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI) Workshop and the Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling (GSMM) Camp.  These annual meetings, held during successive weeks in June, attract mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from academic institutions and from indusry.  University participants include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty.  The focus of the MPI Workshop is a set of problems brought by contributing participants from industry.  These problems span a wide range of areas of applications, often in fluid and solid mechanics but also in mathematical biology, data analysis, and mathematical finance, among others.  Recent problems have included, for example, mathematical models for electromagnetic wave interactions with nanostructures, mathematical problems related to drawing of glass sheets, medical ultrasonic imaging, and automatic defect recognition in industrial inspection applications.  The work on the problems is done in vertically integrated teams consisting of the representatives from industry, senior and junior faculty, postdocs and graduate students.  The scientific objective of the activity generated by the Workshop and its intellectual merit is the study of mathematical problems of significant interest for industrial applications.  The GSMM Camp is held during the week prior to the Workshop, and graduate students attending the Camp also attend the Workshop.  The main objective of the Camp is graduate student education and training.  At the Camp, graduate students work together in teams, with the guidance of invited faculty mentors, on interdisciplinary problems typically inspired by industrial applications.  The problems are carefully chosen to promote a rich set of problem-solving skills, both analytical and numerical, and to provide a warm-up for the difficult problems considered at the Workshop.  The two meetings complement each other and form a comprehensive program of interdisciplinary research, education and training that is unique amongst universities in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is an ongoing effort organized by the principal investigators at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, University of Delaware, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and New Jersey Institute of Technology.  The MPI Workshop has run annually for the past 26 years with the principal aim of promoting research and education in applied mathematics and of developing links between academics and industry for the mutual benefit of both sides.  For the past 8 years, the research and educational activities of the Workshop have been enhanced by the introduction of the GSMM Camp.  In addition to these established meetings, the project involves a number of new activities associated with the Workshop and Camp designed to further advance the research and educational objectives of the collaborative program.  These activities include the introduction of a graduate student fellowship program, support for early-career mathematicians to attend the meetings, and the development of a graduate student exchange program in cooperation with the Oxford Center for Collaborative Applied Mathematics.  Overall, the Workshop and Camp, and its associated activities, have a broad impact on the education and development of early-career mathematicians, and on the interdisciplinary research and educational activities of participating faculty.  The Workshop also promotes collaborations with industry and has an impact on the development and analysis of new technologies in industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       The Mathematical Problems and Industry Workshop (MPI) is a problem-solving workshop that attracts leading applied mathematicians and scientists from universities, industry and national laboratories.  During the one-week workshop, engineers and scientists from industry interact with the academic participants on problems of interest to their companies.  The MPI 2013 Workshop was hosted at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), with problems presented by Corning, Gore, Pall, and OMAX. Copies of the initial presentations, final presentations, and final reports can be found at http://math.wpi.edu/MPI2013/index.html.  Graduate student participants include those who take part in the Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling Camp (GSMMC), which is also supported by NSF.  In total, 35 graduate students participated at WPI, along with 22 faculty and postdoctoral associates from academia, and 6 industrial participants.  Corning is interested in developing models of materials used in environmental remediation applications.  The focus is an interest to determine if models can be developed at the microscale level that capture key trends in reactive batch firing.  In these reactive systems, there are two quantities that are of interest:  the compositional fraction of a component at a location, and the phase of the material at this location. Mathematically, there is a phase function that varies from two distinct values, which represents either the phase of the material or its composition. All of these models require that the range of these functions remains bounded, and the question proposed by Corning focused on better understanding two models of interest.  The first was the Cogswell model, and the second was the Heulens model.  In both cases, equilibria are found by minimizing the total energy of the system, so the manner by which the range of the phase functions remain bounded can affect the minima of the total energy.  Examples of the phase segregation that can occur in these ssytems are shown in Figure 1.  Gore is interested in a mathematical characterization of a porous fiber structure and the connection of this structure to macroscopic quantities, such as porosity and tortuosity.  A refined understanding of microscopic structural features and how they relate to membrane permeability and particle retention efficiency can aid in the design and in performance optimization. The idea is to start with a series of fibers and nodes (places where fibers cross).  From this network, with a large number of fibers and nodes, can models be developed that describe macroscopic properties of the material (see Figure 2). To develop this understanding, we formulated two different algorihms to generate porous media iteratively based on global distributions of nodes and fibers.  In addition, we modeling the trajectory of a particle through our constructed porous media, and determined the tortuiosity of the material based on the flow pattern.  OMAX has developed abrasive water-jet technology for several years, and although the abilities of the jets to cut hard materials very precisely, the distribution of particle velocities at the exit is broad, and these particles wear the tube prior to their exit from th orifice.  The group was able to develop a mathematical model that describes the distribution of particle velocities as a function of the volumetric flow rate of the jet (see Figure 3), and a simple particle dynamics model was able to describe the onset of wear in the cylinder.  Pall Corporation is interested in understanding how pleating of a filter can affect the capture efficiency over time.  Pleating is required to maximize the available surface area of the filter within a confined volume. The group was asked how does pleating affect the flow flow through the three-layer filter.  The effort was multi-faceted, with some successful descriptions of the flow (as showin in Figure 4), along with some initial ideas that have matured to work which will be...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
