<AbstractNarration>The Milky Way Laboratory will create interactive access to one of the largest numerical simulations of cosmological structure ever created. With its data volume close to a petabyte, it illustrates the emerging data challenge -- how new breakthroughs require non-incremental changes in the way we do science. As datasets are doubling in size every year, traditional analysis techniques are no longer adequate. Scientists need a new instrument, like a "microscope of data", a data-scope, that can look at both the details and the large-scale features in the mountains of digital data. Increased raw computer power is necessary, but not enough -- we also need to use new computational thinking to develop the new approaches needed. The NSF-supported research aims to achieve such a breakthrough in data-intensive computational analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular science focuses on the compelling question of the origin and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy, the home of the Sun and our solar system. Understanding our place in the Universe will in turn lead to insight into the nature of the enigmatic 'dark matter', the substance whose gravity holds the Milky Way together, but about which little is known. The project will create a publicly accessible 'Milky Way Laboratory' that will combine the output of the largest state-of-the-art computer simulations of the formation of the Milky Way with the largest observational datasets of the properties of stars (like the Sun) in our Galaxy, and provide the means to answer questions that go beyond the scope of either dataset. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publicly accessible data and the tools developed will enable scientists to run their own innovative experiments at unprecedented scales, demonstrating that it is possible to tackle problems on the petabyte scale in a university setting today. The project will provide a blueprint to address similar data-intensive problems in other areas of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international team consists of astronomers, particle physicists and computer scientists from academia (Johns Hopkins and UC Santa Cruz) and industry to accomplish its ambitious goals. The project will be using the NSF-funded 5.5-petabyte Data-Scope system, under construction at the Johns Hopkins University, a unique data-intensive environment designed to carry out experiments like the Milky Way Laboratory. The Data-Scope will be located at a new computational facility at JHU, funded by an NSF ARRA grant.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Milky Way Laboratory was started with the idea of taking a large numerical simulation of a large galaxy, store it in a database, and turn it into an interactive numerical experiment, where scientists can interact in almost real-time with the data.  In the real Milky Way Galaxy the Sloan Digital Sky Survey project has found several remnants of "galactic collisions", when a smaller, dwarf galaxy merged with the Milky Way and its stars ended up spread out in a very thin, cold strem through the Galaxy.  In order to simulate this process and reproduce the observed streams, the Milky Way Laboratory project has used a large precomputed simulation of the Milky Way galaxy and came up with an intective way to launch dwarf galaxies in intersecting orbits and watch their disruption on the screen. A screen capture can be seen on Figure 1, and an animated gif movie is displayed on Figure 2.  The Fermi statellite is measuring high energy radiation from space. Over the last few years it has observed a slight excess of radiation from the direction of the Galactic Center, which can potentially be attributed to annihilation of the elusive, but omnipresent dark matter. From gravitational measurements we know its density, but do ot know its physical properties. The intensity of the emitted radiation is strongly dependent on the physical properties of the particles (cross section). The project devised a way to compute maps of such radiation that is 1,000 times faster than previous techniques, and thus enabled the team to perform a large array of these calculations, making detailed predictions on the dark matter properties. Figure 3 shows an all-sky map of the annihilation signal. The bright spot is the galactic center. Figure 4 shows four different satellites to the main galaxy in the simulation, and their image in gamma-rays as the velocity dependence of the cross section is varied. The changes are obvious.  With these techniques the project has demonstrated that one can do interactive science with very large numerical simulations, and used one of the largest simulations of the Milky Way to derive interesting results, connecting theory, computation, particle physics, astrophysics. This research will hopoefully enccourage oithers to follow and create new way to interact with data at petabyte scales.
