The work performed at the Human Interface Technologies Lab New Zealand provided important enhancements to the handheld navigation platform being developed at the lab, allowing handheld devices to interact directly with a large stereo-projection system capable of presenting an immersive computer-generated 3D environment.

Finally, the project also successfully established important collaborative research links between the Principle Investigator and colleagues in New Zealand, offering a valuable research link in an area of computer science that continues to develop internationally.
