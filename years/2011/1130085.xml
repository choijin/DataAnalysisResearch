<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this grant is to support US based graduate students for traveling to and attending the ACM MobiCom 2011 conference to be held in Las Vegas, Nevada on September 19-23, 2011. MobiCom is a premier conference that serves as a meeting point of researchers from academia and industry, as well as practitioners in different fields of wireless networking and mobile computing. In conjunction with the main conference, MobiCom 2011 will also host several workshops and tutorials on topics of emerging interest. The NSF travel grant will allow a diverse set of students from US institutions to participate in this forum and gain valuable experience by interacting with senior researchers as well as peers in this field. Such interactions and exposure can positively influence the quality of the students' individual research and professional growth, in turn shaping the future of wireless networking and mobile computing technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was used to allow students to attend ACM Mobicom 2011 conference held in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA by helping them cover some of their travel expensees. It allowed students who were unlikely to attend the conference due to the unavailablity of travel funding to attend. Priority was given to students who would benefit the most from attending this conference.  The intellectual merit of this award lies in the contributions that these students made to the mobile computing and networking conference event through their participation and interaction. In addition, the exposure of these students to the wide variety of technical activities such as paper presentations, keynote presentations, poster sessions, and worskshops that the conference offered is expected to inspire students to address the tough problems in their fields, which benefits the scientific community in the long run.  The broader impact of this award lies in the development of the graduate students that were able to attend MobiCom 2011 due to the provided travel support. The award allowed graduate students conducting research in the field to attend high-caliber technical presentations, be exposed to the state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students.
