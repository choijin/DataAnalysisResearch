<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to demonstrate broadband wavelength conversion across the near- and mid-infrared wavelength regions in chalcogenide waveguides.  Chalcogenide glasses are important waveguide core materials because of their broad transparency range, high refractive index and high optical nonlinearity relative to silica.  Their high nonlinearity can enable efficient four wave mixing (FWM) for a variety of nonlinear signal processing applications including wavelength conversion and parametric amplification.  The intellectual merit is in the first demonstration of broadband, chip-scale FWM for near- to mid-infrared wavelength conversion and parametric amplifiers.  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are new source and amplifier options spanning the near- to mid-infrared and providing hands-on fabrication experience and broadening the educational scope of undergraduate and graduate electrical engineering students, including underrepresented groups. .  Applications include high resolution molecular spectroscopy, greenhouse gas monitoring, combustion gas detection (e.g. methane and sulfur dioxide), industrial gas sensing, and liquid and solid phase infrared analysis based on attenuated total reflectance (ATR), typically used with Fourier transform infrared spectrometers (FTIRs), on a chip.  Society will benefit through advancements in optical chip-scale processing as well as optical sensing for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics and homeland security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have demonstrated through designa and simulation, as well as fabrication and measurements, a novel optical waveguide platform using chalcogenide glass deposited and patterned on lithium niobate waveguides.   The chalcogenide glass enables devices that are very compact, such as ring resonators, due to its high refractive index, as well as nonlinear interaction and processing with light.  We have demosntrated sidewall gratings in As2S3 glass, which can be used to resonantly enhance the optical power and thus lower the threshold power required for nonlinear interactions.  We have designed, fabricated and characterized novel optical devices ranging from broadband nonlinear amplifiers to narrowband gratings.  The work has produced four PhD dissertations in addition to journal and conference publications.  Undergraduate students have learned about the research through classroom discussion in both the optical engineering and photonics lab course.    For the infrared and for very broadband optical devices, it is challenging to measure their properties because of the limited range of tunable lasers and their expense.  We demonstrated a low coherence interferometer for measuring the gratings.  To verify its performance, we compared it to the commercially-available swept-wavelength measurement system and found excellent agreement.    Another challenge is coupling light into very small waveguides from optical fibers.  While we originally planned to couple into larger waveguide modes, there were issues with the number of fabrication processes and complexity of the overall fabrication scheme.  In order to reduce the number of fabrication steps required, we have designed, fabricated and demonstrated gratings that couple light between the small As2S3 waveguide and optical fibers.
