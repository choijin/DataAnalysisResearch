<AbstractNarration>This award supports a new international collaboration between the University of Florida and the Federal University of Pernambuco in Recife, and the Federal University of Cear√°, in Fortaleza, Brazil. The collaboration will be focused on studying the hydrodynamics of low-inflow estuaries in tropical, arid regions. This type of estuaries may change the circulation structure from the wet to the dry season because of excess evaporation or precipitation. A main outcome of the seasonal change of the hydrodynamic regime in estuaries with marked dry and wet seasons is the likely loss of flushing efficiency by the estuary during the dry season. Specific objectives to be addressed with this collaboration consist of (a) initial data collection with Brazilian scientists and students to investigate the hydrodynamics of strongly seasonal arid estuaries during wet and dry seasons; and (b) delivery of a short course on estuarine hydrodynamics at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. At a later stage a visit of Brazilian scientists and students to Florida is envisaged, with funding from Brazilian sources. The Brazilian host, Dr. Schettini, has developed expertise in identifying systems with seasonal reversals and the logistics necessary to study them. The US Principal Investigator has the expertise to collect and analyze necessary data to place the results in the context of theoretical and new findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity will foster international collaborations and will expose graduate students to other scientific settings and study areas. Future research will advance our understanding of the physics of low inflow estuaries in tropical arid regions, a topic that has remained essentially unexplored throughout the world. With increasing use of freshwater resources for human consumption and sea level rise, it is evident that these systems will be most vulnerable to a drastic change of function caused by enhanced salt intrusion and hypersalinity conditions. This project will train several Latin-American students (between 20 and 30 individuals) in the topic of Estuarine Hydrodynamics through a course to be taught in Brazil. A US graduate student will participate in the prospection trips, collect data, analyze data and write a descriptive paper on the data that will be collected in the wet and dry seasons.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We carried out two sampling campaigns with the participation of US and Brazilian graduate students.  One of the campaigns also included Latin-American students from different countries.  We organized and delivered a short course on estuarine hydrodynamics to 27 participants from the US and Latinamerica.  We prepared and submitted two proposals to continue on the collaboration. One of them got funded.  We have found that in the arid region of northeast Brazil, an estuary can show water going out of the estuary over shallow areas and into the estuary in the deepest parts.  This occurs in the wet season as expected from theoretical considerations.  The flow structure reverses in the dry season.  There are not many examples of these reversals.  So we are providing evidence that it can happen, as speculated by theoretical results.  The short course on estuarine hydrodynamics was a complete success.  The students were so enthusiastic about it that they encouraged scientists in their countries to organize more courses like this one.  An additional course will take place in Tamandare, Brazil, from May 7th to 14th.  Moreover, another short course will take place in Ensenada, Mexico, from May 18th to 30th.  The PI of this project will teach both courses. The need for extended knowledge on the hydrodynamics of estuaries is evident and several countries in Latin-America are pushing hard to build capacity to face the challenges related to sea level rise.  This type of activity, the short courses, will be one avenue of capacity building in those countries.  Graduate students funded by this project to travel to Brazil, executed field work under demanding conditions.  Students from the US had to face unexpected conditions in the field, working in reduced-space boats with challenging supply of power for instrument functioning.  They met the challenge with the collection of valuable data sets that will become peer-reviewed publications.  In addition, the findings provided by data collections will provide information for planning of coastal communities at the imminent threat of sea level rise.   Data were collected in regions where only hypothetical behavior could be drawn.  We were successful in our intent of collecting data in a region where only speculative hydrodynamic behavior could be proposed.   We have written a successful proposal that will allow continuation of the Brazilian collaboration.  This funding has been obtained through the Institute for International Education (IIE) as part of their new program: Global Innovation Initiative (GII).  The program required collaboration among US, British and other selected country including Brazil.  Therefore, we have added a British portion to our collaborative efforts with Brazil.
