<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on problems in the calculus of variations and partial differential equations. A theory, now called direct methods of the calculus of variations, was developed by Charles Morrey in the middle of the last century wherein he introduced various fundamental concepts of convexity. This theory has wide application to many fields, including John Ball's groundbreaking work in elasticity theory. Recently, John Ball published a list of outstanding problems in the calculus of variations whose solutions will not only  advance that field but will also have major impacts in elasticity theory.  In recent work, the principal investigator has started to develop tools to handle specific concrete problems from that list. This will, he hopes, lead to general theories.  The project will extend this study to include important classes of variational problems that have defied existing theory, such as the stored energy functional of Ogden material, which appears in elasticity. Another class of problems to be studied arises in mass transportation theory.  It was first formulated by Monge in 1771 as a simple geometry problem and later extended by Kantorovich to more general cost functions. It consists in finding the optimal (minimal work) method for transporting a pile of earth at one location to an excavation site at another  location. These classical results have been extended  to more  general cost functions by the principal investigator, his students, postdocs, collaborators and many others, with special attention to the Wasserstein (or Kantorovich) metric.  Building on these results, the project will investigate so-called axi-symmetric flows, which preliminary computations indicate are Hamiltonian systems on the Wasserstein space.  The principal investigator has established a link between the study of these flows and a poorly understood (challenging) class of parameter-dependent Monge-Ampere equations. He will study the existence of paths satisfying a certain basic stability criterion and connecting two prescribed symplectic forms. These problems, interesting in their own right, include searching for geodesics in the set of symplectic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tproject will have a number of important scientific and educational components.  First, the theoretical advances will directly aid other scientific research areas, including meteorology, elasticity theory, and other applied sciences, that use variational methods in their algorithms. Second, the principal investigator will continue to disseminate the research by giving courses and lectures in international conferences, workshops, and seminars. Finally, in addition to continuing to mentor undergraduates and Ph.D. students at his home institution, he will extend his active support of underrepresented groups in mathematics, in part by mentoring students and faculty at Spelman College, a local HBCU. Current projects involve Spelman's Professor Yewande Olubummo, who together with the principal investigator plans to develop tools for use in the study of shape recognition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project has been conducted in ways that address  intellectual merit and broader impacts as defined in the NSF review criteria.  The first part of the PI's work has been on optimal transport theory, which in the past two decades has emerged as a fertile field of inquiry and a powerful tool for  applications to problems within and beyond mathematics. The PI and his collaborators participated into this transformation and helped resolve some long-standing problems  in several areas, such as Mean Fields Game Theory and  nonlinear dynamics. Another part of the PI's work entails looking for metrics on the space of closed differential forms, metrics rich enough to be useful in the study geometric equations which are dissipative or conservative systems. Under the NSF contract, together with collaborators, the PI initiated studies on optimal transport of differential k-forms. This resulted in a discovery of  a nonlinear factorization of $k$--forms or of vector fields which, at less formally, yields the classical Hodge decomposition of differential k-forms.   In a joint  with collaborators, the PI unearthed properties of a self--interacting force field generated by a fluid, as sufficient to obtain  long time existence results in compressible pressureless fluids. A description in Lagrangian coordinates, in the one space dimension, is provided with an explicit representation formula for the solutions. The flow is described by a differential inclusion on the space of transport maps, in particular when a sticky particle dynamics is assumed.      The PI has organized several long term programs to gather leading experts in optimal transport and areas of potential application, to invigorate ongoing research and stimulate new investigations. The participants include an emerging generation of young researchers.The PI gave numerous talk inside and outside the USA. The PI has been very active supervising the research of postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students.  The PI is currently serving on several editorial boards as well as National and International Committees.       Last Modified: 06/21/2017       Submitted by: Wilfrid Gangbo]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
