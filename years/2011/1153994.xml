<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests travel funds from NSF to assist 50 US students to participate in IROS 2011, which will be held in San Francisco, CA, Sep. 25-30, 2011. The purpose of this Group Travel Grant Proposal is to make it possible for US students and postdocs to attend the conference, present their work, and forge connections with colleagues from around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year mark the 50th anniversary of robotics. In addition to the regular conference, IROS 2011 will feature interactive presentations, robot demonstrations, thematic plenary sessions on design, bio-robotics, and intelligent transportation, and special-topic symposia celebrating 50 years of robotics. As part of this award, students will also have the opportunity to participate in these historical events and learn more about the field of robotics. Travel funding will be in the form of partial airfare reimbursement and full reimbursement for student registration to approximately 50 U.S. students who plan to present at least one paper at the Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "big two" major international robotics conferences were outside of North America this past year, so demand should be very high from American students and professors to attend this major robotics event. The benefit to student learning and mentorship by encouraging attendance of students by direct monetary means brings large dividends in student confidence, knowledge and expertise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview   The purpose of the  grant was to increase the presence of US graduate students at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Robots and Intelligent System (IROS) 2011 Conference in San Francisco, CA, and to assist them in attending the unique programs from the 50th year anniversary in robotics during IROS 2011.  Funds were requested to partially reimburse student airfare, to compensate for the workshop and tutorial registration.   The 2011 IROS conference, sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society and the Robotics Society of Japan, has become one of the largest annual conferences in the field of robotics: the conference received 2541 submissions, a record number of submissions for any conference at that time. As a networking opportunity, IROS has been organized since 1989 and has attracted an increasing number of international attendees.   IROS is truly multi-national. The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society and the Robotics Society of Japan have held the conference overseas on a regular basis.    The awards:    The potential for NSF travel assistance was advertised on the web site of IROS 2011 and to all U.S.-based participants who had a paper accepted to the conference. We received a total of 92 complete applications. Funds made it possible to support 66 of the applicants (a selection rate of approximately 72%). The awards were given on a reimbursement-only basis; students submitted receipts and the maximum  total funds possible per student depended on the region from which they needed to travel. We split the US into three regions, and set the cap to $560, $635, $710 for the Western, Central, and Eastern regions respectively. These values  were computed by sampling flight costs, and assessing  comparative costs.   The figure on the previous page gives a break down of the geographical regions from which the awardees were drawn.       Last Modified: 12/04/2012       Submitted by: Dylan A Shell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
