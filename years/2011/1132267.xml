<AbstractNarration>The investigators will conduct a focused on the ionospheric effects of sudden stratospheric warmings. This project will focus on comprehensive experimental studies, using existing experimental data as well as new data from dedicated experimental campaigns. The aim is to (1) improve understanding of the relationship between sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW) and the variations in the ionosphere/thermosphere system and (2) to characterize these variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamic coupling of the atmosphere-ionosphere system is a complex interdisciplinary problem. Current thinking suggests that the upward propagation of internal atmospheric waves (planetary waves, tides, gravity waves) from the lower atmosphere is an important source of energy and momentum for the thermosphere and embedded ionosphere. SSW is the clearest and strongest manifestation of the coupling in the atmosphere-ionosphere system. Recent studies suggest that a SSW couples all atmospheric layers from the ground to the thermosphere and from the poles to the equator. However, the mechanism of this coupling is only partly resolved. While the processes in the lower and middle atmosphere are related to planetary wave anomalies, the coupling to the upper layers and the roles of planetary waves, tides and gravity waves, are less clear. This research will be based on a unique combination of new measurements at the NSF Incoherent Scatter Radar facilities and in-depth case studies of multiple ionospheric parameters over a large altitude range. The results will illuminate the kind of variations can occur in the ionosphere and thermosphere during large changes in stratospheric dynamics and temperature. The focus on large dynamical events with strong vertical coupling holds promise for discovering new sources and mechanisms of quiet-time ionospheric and thermospheric variability. Understanding the roles played by planetary waves and tides is a crucial step in understanding and predicting the state of ionosphere and thermosphere. The study will foster collaboration between international researchers, support a young scientist from an underrepresented group, and involve several undergraduate students through MIT's Undergraduate Research Opportunities (UROP) program and the NSF's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1">A sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is one of the most radical changes of weather observed on our planet, and produces a number of intriguing atmospheric features. Within several days, North Pole temperatures can increase by more than 50 K (90&deg;F) in an SSW event. Haystack researchers have discovered that, contrary to previous ideas, the effects of sudden stratospheric warmings do not merely stay in the stratosphere. Instead, large and dramatic disturbances are also observed far above the stratosphere in the charged part of the upper atmosphere, or ionosphere, at altitudes from 200 to 800 km. These disturbances include large changes in such basic ionospheric parameters as electron density, electron and ion temperature, and plasma velocity. These changes are very large, create ionospheric density changes of as much as 100&ndash;150% compared to background levels, and at times last for over 40 days. &nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">We have organized a series of experimental campaigns with incoherent scatter radars in order to collect detailed information on an extensive range of ionospheric features, and have analyzed historically available data using both ground-based and satellite-based observations. We developed methods to separate the effects of an SSW from the effects of solar activity, seasonal change, and geomagnetic storms, and discovered that large ionospheric changes can occur not only during low solar activity, but also during solar maximum conditions, in contrast to available simulations. We have demonstrated significant longitudinal differences in the ionospheric effects of an SSW, and found oscillations with periods of 8 hours and 12-hours, as well as 16&ndash;17 hours, 3&ndash;4 days, and 10&ndash;13 days. We have also discovered that SSW events can lead to deep depletions in the nighttime ionosphere, with a decrease in electron density by a factor of up to 4&ndash;6 and development of plasma instabilities (spread-F conditions) in the areas of largest depletions. Another surprising finding is that the largest SSW-driven ionospheric effects happen not at high latitudes, where stratospheric warming occurs, but near the low latitudes and equator, with particularly strong disturbances all the way across the globe in South America.</p> <p class="p1">We have engaged a broad scientific community in this research and actively collaborated with multiple colleagues, both nationally and internationally. These results triggered an explosion of studies of the mechanisms and types of possible connections between terrestrial and space weather, and they also provided the core set of data describing major features of the observed ionospheric disturbances. Understanding of the importance of lower atmospheric processes on the ionospheric plasma spurred active efforts in the development of global circulation models and indicated further directions for model development. The numerical simulations of the SSW-disturbed ionosphere show that models can reproduce some observed features, like morning enhancement and afternoon decrease in the vertical plasma drift and total electron content. However, notable discrepancies between observations and simulations are seen in terms of the magnitude of the perturbations and rate of the local time changes. The scientific community is actively investigating the role of many different mechanisms in the formation of these disturbances.
