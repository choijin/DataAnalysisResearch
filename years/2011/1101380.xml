<AbstractNarration>Géométrie Algébrique en Liberté, also known as GAeL, is an annual workshop organized by and for young algebraic geometers. It gives these young mathematicians an opportunity to explore concepts from algebraic geometry they are not yet familiar with, discuss recent developments in their subspecialities, and present their work to their colleagues. The upcoming 19th edition of GAeL will take place in Berlin, Germany from July 18th until July 22nd. All participants give talks or present posters. Participant talks will be supplemented by short courses on the topics of Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants, the minimal model program, and theta characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop provides a unique opportunity for young mathematicians to present research to their peers and experts as well as widen their mathematical horizons through the short courses. Support from the National Science Foundation will cover the costs of up to &amp;#64257;ve US-based participants each year for the next three years.  The other participants come from a wide range of countries, and the communications and collaborations started at GAeL will serve to strengthen ties between young researchers in the US and their international peers.</AbstractNarration>

Their objective is not only to introduce participants to subjects that are likely to be of relevance in the forthcoming years, but also to allow them to participate actively in scientific communication at an early stage of their career. This is fostered by the selection of participants who are PhD students or early-career postdoctoral fellows, and the inclusion of numerous junior talks.

We believe that this concept for a school is very well adapted to research, specifically in algebraic geometry where the threshold for developing independent research projects is particularly high and complete results are only achieved at the end of a thesis project.   The annual character of the meetings contributes to the network spirit of GAeL. The establishment of these networks at an early stage contributes to output in the highly specialized field of algebraic geometry. In addition the provision of international contacts is invaluable to students who aim to join algebraic geometryÆs workforce at the end of their PhD studies.   This yearÆs edition, the 21st, gathered 82 participants (including organisers), most of them junior mathematicians at a doctoral or post doctoral level, from a wide range of European and American countries. In addition, three senior participants took part in the conference, namely Alexander Kuznetsov, Robert Lazarsfeld and Tomasz Szemberg. They gave three independent introductory lectures on the topics "Derived Categories of Coherent Sheaves", "Syzygies of algebraic varieties" and "Seshadri constants and Nagata Conjectures". However, the emphasis was on talks by young participants, of which there were 15 in total. These covered a wide variety of topics in algebraic geometry. Most of the junior speakers followed the organisersÆ request to give introductory talks without too many technical details. This fact, along with the ample time for free interaction, contributed to many enthusiastic discussions during and after the talks.
