<AbstractNarration>An REU Site award has been made to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center that will provide research training for twelve undergraduate students for 11 weeks, during the summers of 2012- 2016. The program will allow students to obtain a significant research experience in the area of plant and life sciences. Students will conduct a research project under the guidance of senior scientists at the Danforth Center, an independent non-profit private research institute located in Saint Louis, Missouri . The Danforth Center is dedicated to fundamental research in plant science leading to discoveries for the benefit of human health and nutrition and agricultural sustainability. Students will be exposed to a rich research environment due to the wide range of projects they can work on, including cell biology, molecular biology, structural biology, biochemistry, microbiology, chemistry, computational biology, bioinformatics, developmental biology, genetics, genomics, and plant pathology. Each student will design and conduct a laboratory research project in collaboration with a faculty mentor, present findings in a final symposium, and prepare a written report summarizing the research. The research component is supplemented with additional educational activities including workshops in proteomics, microscopy, and tissue culture and transformation. Weekly meetings feature guest speakers and discussions covering topics that include guidance in written and oral reports, career options, ethics in science, and the impact of, and controversies surrounding, agricultural biotechnology.  The program will use the BIO REU common assessment tool to evaluate the program.  More information is available at http://www.danforthcenter.org/internship, or by contacting the PI, Dr. Leslie M. Hicks (lhicks@danforthcenter.org, 314-587-1224).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (DDPSC) was funded for a five-year period from 2/1/2012-1/31/2017 under federal award 1156581.  The Danforth Center is an independent non-profit private research institute dedicated to fundamental research in plant biology.  We trained 101 interns during the award period, primarily funded from this grant and supplemented by other funding sources.  Intellectual Merit.  As an NSF-REU site, we provided a well-rounded, comprehensive program for undergraduate students to obtain significant research experience in the areas of plant and ilfe sciences.  Students conducted research projects under the guidance and close mentorship of senior scientists.  In addition to laboratory research, students prepared oral presentations and written reports summarizing their research projects.  The research component was further supplemented with additional educational activities, including workshops in the Center's Integrated Microscopy, Proteomics &amp; Mass Spectrometry and Tissue Culture and Transformation facilities.  Weekly meetings featured guest speakers covering topics that included guidance in written and oral reports, ethics in science, and current research conducted at the Danforth Center.  Tours and lectures at the plant research facilities of Monsanto, Missouri Botanical Gardens, and Washington University provided exposure to several possible career paths in the plant sciences.  Several events were organized to encourage interactions among interns and other scientists in various career stages at the Center.  Broader impacts.  Since a goal of the Center's research is to have an impact on agricultural productivity, the research conducted by interns has the potential to be of significant interest to the plant biology community and the community at large.  The Danforth Center REU program helped prepare students for careers in the fields of plant biology and biotechnology.  In addition to the training they received in the lab, our interns interacted with scientists in academia, industries, biotechnology startups, filed biologists, science communicators and patent attorneys.  This gave interns an expanded view of the possible careers in science and provided a better understanding of how different disciplines interfaced to work towards solving the problems affecting our world.  Our program aimed to increase the diversity of the scientific field by offering extensive research experience and training to students from underrepresented groups, women and students from smaller colleges that had limited research opportunities.  Twenty-seven percent of our interns were from underrepresented groups, 58% were women, and 50% came from small schools.  The program activities were designed to fashion successful future scientists and entrepreneurs.  A recent survey of former interns showed that 87% were working in STEM careers or pursuing degrees in STEM.          Last Modified: 05/02/2017       Submitted by: Sona Pandey]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
