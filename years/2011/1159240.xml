<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1159240&lt;br/&gt;Pan, Xiaoqing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gradual coarsening of the catalytically-active metal particles in a catalyst is one of the fundamental reasons for loss of activity over time. For three-way automotive exhaust-gas catalysts, a recent phenomenon, the redox-induced cyclical re-dispersion of the metal in novel precious-metal-doped-perovskite formulations has been proposed as a possible means of reducing this problem. Recent work showing that this phenomenon occurs over distances of only a few nanometers in these systems suggests that a practical perovskite-based catalyst will likely involve ultra-thin perovskite films or coatings. In an effort to assess the viability of such a catalyst, this GOALI award covers a carefully designed combination of electron microscopy and catalytic measurements on model planar and high-surface-area powder catalysts to be conducted at University of Michigan and Ford Research and Innovation Center under the supervision of Profs. Xiaoqing Pan and George Graham and of Dr. Robert McCabe, respectively. Specific objectives include the observation of self-stabilizing or self-regenerative catalyst behavior in ultra-thin perovskite films on planar supports, the production of perovskite-coated high-surface-area powders, the measurement of kinetics and detailed chemical potential dependence of structural transformations in model powder catalyst systems, the catalytic characterization of perovskite-based precious-metal catalysts using simple reactions to probe three-way catalytic activity, and ultimately the durability assessment of perovskite-based precious-metal powder catalysts under realistic conditions.  An important aspect of the structure-property relationship testing will be to clearly assign catalytic activity to either supported metal particles or metal-doped perovskite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance and Importance: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automotive exhaust-gas catalysts currently account for 30-50% of the world-wide demand for Pt and Pd, and the corresponding demand for Rh is even higher, ~80%. Since the utilization of these metals in this application has historically never exceeded a few percent by end of life, due primarily to particle coarsening, the attainment of even a modest increase in efficiency would be of tremendous significance, both commercially as well as scientifically. The proposed work affords the opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students at University of Michigan to collaborate closely with catalyst researchers at Ford Motor Company and their suppliers in the pursuit of this goal, which is to improve metal utilization efficiency through the development of a practical perovskite-based three-way catalyst.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Background and Project Overview  Catalytic converters have been used to remove toxic and smog-producing pollutants from the exhaust gas of automobiles for almost half a century, and their positive impact on air quality, especially in urban areas, has been remarkable.  Precious metals, typically platinum, palladium, and rhodium, in the form of highly dispersed oxide-supported nanoparticles are the most important ingredient in these converters.  Although the quantity of metal needed for each converter is only a few grams, the overall demand represents a substantial fraction of the world?s supply, which imposes limits on the development of other beneficial technologies, such as fuel cells.  The opportunity to alter this situation exists, however, since the efficiency of precious metal utilization in catalytic converters is on the order of 1%.  It is generally recognized that if the gradual coarsening of the oxide-supported metal nanoparticles that tends to occur over time while the converter is in use can somehow be mitigated, the efficiency of precious metal utilization in catalytic converters can be significantly improved.  Researchers at Daihatsu Motor Company have proposed a novel self-regenerative process for accomplishing this difficult task, which involves the alternating dissolution and precipitation of the metal nanoparticles into and out of a metal-specific perovskite-structured oxide support material during catalytic converter operation, but a number of scientific questions and practical considerations need to be addressed before this approach will be widely accepted.  This project, conducted by researchers at University of Michigan in collaboration with Ford Motor Company, was aimed at both answering some of these questions and developing a practical form of perovskite-based catalysts in which a thin layer of the perovskite-structured oxide is coated onto a more conventional, thermally stable high surface area oxide, such as &gamma;-alumina.  Intellectual Merit  Clarification of the nature of the self-regenerative process and the assessment of intrinsic catalytic activity of the most prominent of the proposed perovskite-based catalysts were the main outcomes of this project.1-3,5,7,8,21,22  Successful development of perovskite-coated alumina was not achieved, though preliminary work with a collaborator has shown that atomic layer deposition can produce such layers.  Additional, unanticipated outcomes include the discovery and development of methods to prepare and characterize single-crystalline films of titania-based materials that are of interest in energy-related fields,6,9,10,14,20 and the generation of new information about re-structuring within a variety of heterogeneous catalyst systems through application of novel in-situ TEM techniques.11-13,15-17,19  In all, nineteen papers have been published or are under review, and three more are ready to be submitted for publication.  Broader Impact  This project has afforded the opportunity for a diverse group of graduate students, undergraduate students, and visiting scholars to work at University of Michigan in close collaboration with researchers at other universities, Ford Motor Company, and its catalyst suppliers.
