<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The PIs will use the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, as a model system and will attempt to optimize the design of networks of no-take reserves as a strategy for maintaining metapopulations of this commercially harvested species.  The project specifically recognizes that network persistence depends on (1) the potential for growth, survival, and reproduction within reserves, and (2) the potential to distribute offspring among reserves. Thus, demographic processes within reserves and settling areas play important roles, along with variability of physical transport.  The PIs plan to: (1) test and refine 3D bio-physical models of connectivity due to oyster larval transport in a shallow, wind-dominated system; (2) test, refine, and apply technology to detect natal origins of larvae using geochemical tags in larval shell; and (3) integrate regional connectivity and demographic rates to model metapopulation dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This study will produce new tools and test and refine others used for studying larval connectivity, a fundamentally important process in the maintenance of natural populations, and thus in biological conservation and resource management.  The tools include a hydrodynamic modeling tool coupled with an open-source particle tracking model that will be available on-line with computer code and user guide. The project will use integrated modeling approaches to evaluate the design of reserve networks: results will be directly useful to improving oyster and ecosystem-based management in Pamlico Sound, and the methods will inform approaches to network design in other locations.  There is extensive education and outreach in the form of training undergraduate and graduate students, mentoring post-docs, and providing hands-on research opportunities for high school students and their teachers.</AbstractNarration>

Therefore, a major challenge in marine ecology and marine resource management is describing patterns of larval dispersal and population connectivity in the sea. The goal of this study was to gain insight into the larval connectivity and dispersal of a commercially and ecologically important invertebrate, the Eastern oyster (<em>Crassostrea virginica</em>), within a large estuarine system along the eastern US (Pamlico Sound, NC). To accomplish this, we applied two approaches: geochemical tags stored in the shell of oysters formed during the larval stage, and computer model simulations that accounted for physical transport processes and larval swimming behaviors.</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Studies utilizing natural or artificial tagging methods have greatly enhanced our quantitative understanding of larval connectivity in the ocean. Geochemical markers (e.g., Strontium, Barium, Manganese) stored within growing calcified structures, such as fish &ldquo;ear stones&rdquo; and bivalve shells, are useful for examining marine larval connectivity as many marine organisms begin recording environmental signatures with these &ldquo;hard parts&rdquo; soon after egg fertilization. Thus, provided that there are spatial gradients in environmental conditions, these hard parts can carry a permanent record/tag that allows researchers to retroactively track individuals through time and space (i.e., a flight data recorder). Estuarine systems provide an ideal setting in which to apply geochemical tagging methods and explore larval connectivity as they are characterized by high environmental variation, encompass complex and patchy habitat landscapes, and function as important nursery, juvenile, and adult habitats for many marine organisms of ecological and economic value.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">We began by evaluating the utility of geochemical tagging methods to discern oyster larval connectivity among reefs across Pamlico Sound. We used both laboratory incubations and field surveys to assess how gradients in temperature, salinity, and trace metal concentrations affect the incorporation of geochemical signals in larval oyster shells. Our studies demonstrated that across regional (35 km) scales within Pamlico Sound, spanning salinity and temperature gradients, there were distinct multi-elemental signatures between potential natal sites for oysters. For instance, we observed higher Sr concentrations within larval shells in cooler and fresher water, such as occurs in the northwestern portion of the Sound. </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Following these ground-truthing efforts, we used geochemical tagging to assess estuarine-scale larval connectivity among subpopulations of oysters. To generate &lsquo;atlases&rsquo; of geochemical signatures associated with potential spawning sites, we outplanted/incubated recently spawned oyster larvae at multiple stations across Pamlico Sound. Using these atlases, we predicted the natal origin (i.e., connectivity) for newly settled oysters (spat) during three field trials conducted over two summers (2013- 2014). Patterns of larval connectivity varied both seasonally and annually, but were predominately directed south to north following wind patterns. Predicted self-recruitment was variable, as 0-100% of spat in a given region displayed signatures consistent with natal origin within that same region. </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: small;">We also used a biophysical model to simulate dispersal of eastern oyster larvae and connectivity among an existing network of 10 oyster reserves in Pamlico Sound. Modeling parameters were varied to assess the relative importance of spawning location, spawning date, larval behavior, larval mortality, and adult reproductive output to predicted dispersal and connectivity patterns. Spawning location and date of spawning relative to physical processes, particularly frequency of wind reversals, were the dominant drivers of dispersal and connectivity patterns. To a lesser extent, larval behavior (i.e., vertical depth regulation) and mortality modified dispersal and connectivity, whereas spatiotemporal variability in adult reproductive output was of minimal importance. Over a 21-day larval duration, mean dispersal distance of passive surface particles ranged from 5-40&nbsp;km. Reserves were too small (&lt;1&nbsp;km</span><sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">2</span></sup><span style="font-size: small;">) relative to mean dispersal distances to promote extensive local retention or promote extensive inter-reserve connectivity.
