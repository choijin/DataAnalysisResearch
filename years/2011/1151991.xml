<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports Prof. George R. Newkome of The University of Akron to investigate fractal nano- and macroscale molecules (self-similar components at differing size scales) based on multicomponent, supramolecular, directed and self-assembly protocols that rely on terpyridine-metal-terpyridine building block connectivity.  The ability to incorporate site-specific, multiple metal centers into a predesigned molecular array or network affords a method to fine-tune the desired physical and chemical properties of the molecular fractals.  The potential to introduce and exchange differing metals within the fractal framework, either during or after construction, will facilitate the study of precisely designed multimetal ensembles that have ramifications in molecular electronics, self-repairing frameworks, and antenna incorporation at the nanoscopic level.  Precise pattern-based molecular structures are also envisioned.  Use of these charged, polymetal lattices for composite fiber formation, based on alternating charged species will be investigated with increasingly higher generation fractal-based materials.  Physical properties and uses envisioned involve energy storage and release, molecular electronic devices, data storage, solar cell nanocomponents, sensor and optical display capabilities, molecular antennas, and metamaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New materials comprised of repeating similar shapes of differing sizes (termed "fractal") held together by metal glue-like interactions will be assembled, based on their components interactions, such as their potential to fit, pack, and associate in an orderly manner.  This will lead to new types of macromolecules for use in electronic devices and components, such as with batteries for energy storage, switches in electric circuits, and antennas in miniature communication devices.  Educational opportunities arise from the training and development of students and scientists at all academic levels.  Educational outreach is promoted through regular presentations at regional, national and international public and private schools, universities, and conferences.  Industrial and international collaborations continue to enhance this research through personnel and information exchange.</AbstractNarration>
