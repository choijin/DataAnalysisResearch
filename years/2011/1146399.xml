<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI requests support for preparation of a large collection of vertebrate fossils recently recovered from the Central Transantarctic Mountains (CTAM) of Antarctica. These fossils will be used to place early Mesozoic Antarctic dinosaurs and other vertebrates into a global evolutionary, biogeographic, and faunal context; assess the degree of endemism in Triassic vertebrate faunas of Antarctica; constrain temporal relationships of the Triassic Antarctic vertebrate faunas; and refine the stratigraphic context for the Triassic Antarctic vertebrate assemblages to establish a paleoenvironmental framework. The lower and middle Triassic fossils offer a rare window on life in terrestrial environments at high-latitudes immediately after the Permian mass extinction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The PI will use their fossils to educate the public about the geologic, climatic, and biologic history of Antarctica by visiting local schools. They will create and publish at least two new videos to the Burke Museum blog that relate the graduate student?s experience of fieldwork in Antarctica. They will also update the Antarctica section on the UWBM "Explore Your World" website with images and findings from their field season.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the austral summer of 2010-11, Sidor (PI) and two of his students were part of a multi-disciplinary research team at the Central Transantarctic Mountains (CTAM) base camp.  Along with a collaborator from South Africa, our team was there to investigate the geology and paleontology of the Buckley and Fremouw formations, rocks that document the Permo-Triassic mass extinction.  As part of this research, we collected fossils from 40 localities in the Beardmore Glacier region.  This grant (ANT-1146399) funded the preparation and conservation of these fossils, which is the process by which these fossils become research-ready and therefore can contribute to answering research questions.  Fossil preparation is a time-intensive process requiring highly skilled technicians.      The importance of the fossils collected at CTAM can be divided into two general categories.  First, fossils from the lower Fremouw Formation help to document the recovery of high-latitude terrestrial ecosystems after the Permo-Triassic mass extinction.  The second major category of discovery concerns the Middle Triassic (Anisian) fauna of the upper Fremouw Formation.  Fossils from this interval (~243 Ma) shed light on the establishment of provincial faunas in the wake of the Permo-Triassic extinction.  Any analysis of Antarctic vertebrate evolution is only as good as the taxonomic identifications on which it is based.  And these identifications are based directly the detailed anatomy apparent only after preparation is complete.     All fossils collected at CTAM were accessioned at the University of Washington Burke Museum (UWBM) and are accessible to the public on the Burke MuseumÃ†s online database: http://www.burkemuseum.org/databases/paleontology/index.php.      We have published three peer-reviewed research papers (Sidor et al. 2013, 2014a, b) and six conference abstracts on the CTAM collections.  Two additional papers that are being spearheaded by graduate students are in preparation.  One major finding of our research is that during the Triassic, the vertebrate communities inhabiting southern Pangea became more distinct from one another than they had been in the Permian (i.e., before the mass extinction).  We have also continued to engage the public about Antarctic science with support of this grant.  Sidor and his students have visited local K-12 schools in the greater Seattle area, displayed Antarctic fossils at Burke Museum family day events, and included these fossils in a temporary exhibit that ran from April&ndash;October, 2014.  All in all, nearly 20,000 members of the public were reached.             Last Modified: 10/01/2015       Submitted by: Christian A Sidor]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
