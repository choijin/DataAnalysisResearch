<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to convene interdisciplinary teams of STEM scholars to identify, explore, create, and engage in culturally relevant research and activities on digital technology. It seeks to help STEM scholars and their students to benefit from careers in STEM.  The project conducts this work through two face-to-face meetings, continuous online discussions, and ongoing group interactions via social networks. It uses 25 STEM scholars to review and discuss existing and future research. Participants work collaboratively to: (1) develop a forum where interdisciplinary teams share knowledge, devise agendas and action items that lead to broadening understanding and pragmatic solutions for traditionally underserved students to enter and persist in STEM fields; and  (2) disseminate results from dialogues and group actions to various audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research workgroups synthesize and disseminate research articles, best practices, and evidence-based culturally relevant programs that chart new directions, challenge deficit thinking, and promote greater interest and participation in STEM. The project benefits from ongoing partnerships with representatives from the United Negro College Fund, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, National Urban League, National Society of Black Engineers, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, and the After-School Corporation that have agreed to contribute to this effort. The lead institutions establish contact with media organizations that target STEM scholars, which can assist with project dissemination.  A five-member advisory board helps guide and inform the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[STEM For All pursured the following objectives: #1- to explore and develop a multi-faceted strategy to infuse mainstream entertainment media with STEM images, stories, and positive messages to increase and sustain the interest of young Americans; and #2-- advance research, inform policy, and impact the evaluation and assessment of STEM entertainment media.  In collaboration with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), we engaged in the below activities to achieve our objectives:  Conducted STEM media roundtable discussion(s) with White House leaders, scientists, educators, and      members of the entertainment community to strategize on how entertainment      media can foster STEM inclusion and diversify images in film and      television.  Identify,      organize, and synthesize scholarly research related to STEM media in      order to conduct      a gap analysis that identifies best      practices and exemplary projects that identify areas of need, potential      partnerships, and required resources.    Organize a STEM Media Summit to highlight the role of entertainment media in fostering STEM inclusion as well as encourage greater synergy among scientists, STEM media groups, mainstream entertainment organizations, and potential funders to identify opportunities for collaboration, areas of need, ways to foster greater inclusion of evidence-based approaches into content development, and increase awareness of funding resources.
