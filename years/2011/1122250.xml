<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  This project aims to develop genome-wide experimental tools and technologies for analyzing gene regulation and function in Arabidopsis. Computational analysis of the initial genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana, completed in the year 2000, provided evidence for the existence of approximately 25,500 protein-coding genes. Intensive efforts during the past ten years to experimentally annotate this genome sequence have now identified 31,128 genes, which include additional protein-coding genes as well as non-coding RNA genes. The identification of T-DNA insertion mutations in all Arabidopsis genes has been an on-going aim of worldwide functional genomics programs. Analysis of the available set of TDNA mutants reveals that ~24,000 additional mutant alleles are needed to create a comprehensive homozygous mutant collection. This research specifically addresses the following goals: to identify two genetically stable loss-of-function mutations in all Arabidopsis genes and to complete the goal of isolating two homozygous alleles for every gene in the genome. llumina paired-end deep sequencing  will be used to identify mutations in these "missing" genes, thereby allowing completion of the "unimutant" for the annotated set of Arabidopsis genes. Further development of the T-DNA-Seq method for large scale capture and sequencing of ~ one million T-DNA insertion sites will allow identification of the inventory of essential genes as well as provide insights into the mechanism of T-DNA integration and associated gene silencing events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The genomic resources developed by this project will be widely available to a large number of researchers and will provide the basis for a variety of research projects that rely upon whole genome information. Completion of the proposed research will provide a new important resource for the plant biology community, enabling a variety of genome-wide mutant screens for any visible phenotype of interest. An important feature of this research is that all of the mutant plants/populations will be available to the research community as soon as they are produced. The beneficiaries of this program will be the entire plant biology community, providing essential reagents necessary to elucidate the functions of the Arabidopsis genes. Additionally, the new technology developed to rapidly and inexpensively index insertion mutants by next generation sequencing in any plant or animal will have applications far beyond Arabidopsis research. The long-term impact of these enabling tools and technologies on agriculture is expected to be profound, providing fundamental knowledge for the construction of new plant varieties with superior agronomic traits. An equally important aspect of our research program is the hands-on training in plant genome research that will be provided at a variety of levels, including outreach to minority high school and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

Plant biologists often study phenotypes related to development, such as fruit size or leaf shape, responses to pathogens or stresses, drought or high heat, all of which have important implications for agriculture. It is now possible to understand how these traits are determined at the individual gene level (genotype).    In order to elucidate the relationship between genotype and phenotype, biologists frequently use mutants. By mutation anlaysis, single gene can be altered or removed and its determined . By comparing phenotypes between a mutant with a known gene disruption and a normal non-mutated plant, phenotypes can be identified which will indicate a direct relationship between disrupted gene and physical outcome (altered trait).  Answering the question of "how does a gene impact a trait" is known as "forward genetics" as it starts by observing a phenotype or trait and asks the question of what is the gene causing it.   In another genetic approach known as "reverse genetics", one begins with a mutation in gene or genes without well-described functions and examines these plants for phenotypes, thus reversing the classical forward genetics approach.  Arabidopsis thaliana has become the reference organism of choice for studies of flowering plants. Sequencing of  its genome (~135 million base pairs) long revealed the presence of ~ 27,207 protein coding genes,  similar in functional diversity to the fruit fly or a nematode worm yet still possesing the structural complexity of any flowering plant.

We calculate that there are some Arabidopsis genes that will never be altered by T-DNA methods because the gene size and the probability too low of landing in it, or because the gene is essential for the plant to survive. As shown in figure 1, gene At1g01080 is surrounded by many insertion sites but none of them fall inside the protein coding region, this is a sign that the gene may be essential for the plant to live. For example, the seeds many not germinate without this gene.  Using our website one can see that this gene codes for a RNA-binding motif.  On the left side of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
