<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator's (PI's) team will calculate the injection and acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) caused by shock wave events associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The proposing team will use a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic  model of CME shocks to trace the evolution of these shock waves in a realistic manner and to calculate the SEP source particle distribution in space. The team will obtain the temporal and spatial variation of SEP source intensity and spectra in the solar corona, and input this data into their three-dimensional interplanetary particle transport model for calculation of SEP intensity at Earth and other locations in the solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI states that the results of this study will assist the development of improved space weather tools to forecast the near-Earth space radiation environment resulting from solar events. The PI also notes that particle injection and acceleration by shock waves is one of the great unsolved problems in space physics and astrophysics. This investigation of particle acceleration and transport in the solar system will enhance our understanding of many other high-energy astrophysics phenomena in the universe (such as cosmic rays, supernova remnants, and gamma-ray emissions). In addition, the project will provide training to a young postdoctoral scientist.</AbstractNarration>

The production mechanism of high-energy particles by shock waves is one of the unsolved problems in all areas of space physics and astrophysics. Understanding the fundamental physics can help us understand high-energy phenomena in many astrophysics environments and laboratory plasmas. The come of the project are the following:  (1)    The code developed in this project is a significant piece of tool for future studies of particle production and transport in space. It will eventually be adapted into tools for forecasting space weather.  (2)    We found that energization efficiency can exceed 100% relative to the standard theory of shock acceleration. At high enough energies, the acceleration of particles automatically approaches to diffusive shock acceleration spectrum.  (3)    Wave growth at shock is extremely fast, which could invalidate the formulation of the quasi-linear theory. A nonlinear theory is needed to study the formation of shock ramp with detailed structures in order to understand the energization process of low-energy seed particles.  (4)    Interplanetary transport of high-energy radiation from the sun is important to observations at 1 AU Earth location. We found that solar energetic particles do not only transport along the magnetic field.  (5)    Results and major understandings are published in Journal and presented at scientific conferences.  (6)    We have used this project to train young scientists to become more mature and productive researchers.          Last Modified: 06/22/2017       Submitted by: Ming Zhang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
