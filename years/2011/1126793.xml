<AbstractNarration>1126793&lt;br/&gt;Choutapalli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed state of-the-art stereoscopic PIV equipment will serve as an essential research tool and improved measurement capability because it: a) permits detailed study of the three dimensional velocity field for a variety of jet flow conditions; b) provides more accurate turbulence flow field data as compared to 2D PIV measurements; c) facilitates higher spatial and temporal resolution of the flow field; d) can integrate readily into the existing laboratory infrastructure and hence provide valuable information that can facilitate application-oriented development of flow control technologies; e) facilitates the acquisition of experimental data needed to elucidate fundamental physics and facilitates the development of an experimental database for computations; and f) serves as a shared resource for departments within the university as well as other universities, research organizations, and industry. The acquisition of the stereoscopic PIV system will therefore yield rich fundamental flow physics knowledge leading to transformative research and hence transformative technologies in the field of flow control.</AbstractNarration>
