<AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Nanomanufacturing for Energy and Biomedical Engineering", at Drexel University under the direction of Dr. Ying Sun,seeks to develop an interdisciplinary education and research training program in nanomanufacturing to prepare the next generation of engineers to meet the challenges of efficiently integrating nanoscale building blocks into functional micro devices and meso/macroscale systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary education plan will better prepare the next generation of engineers to meet the growing demand of economically fabricating nanostructure, multi-functional devices and engineering systems with properties beyond what is currently available. Direct impacts at Drexel include a new undergraduate technical elective course targeting 30-40 students per year, lab teaching modules for the required course sequence on Experimental Measurements impacting about 600 students per year, and intensive research opportunities for 10 students from the College of Engineering, School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, and College of Arts and Sciences.  Broader impacts outside of Drexel include publishing lab materials and course modules developed in this course, creating a central library for nanomanufacturing technologies and applications, introducing course modules into the curriculum at local community and four year colleges.  The community outreach programs extends to inner-city K-12 teachers and students through the Philly Materials Science &amp; Engineering Day, Philly Science Festival, and Girl Scouts of Eastern Pennsylvania in Science events.</AbstractNarration>
