<AbstractNarration>In this U.S.-Mexico workshop researchers and students from the University of Arizona (UA) and Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) will gather in Mexico City to identify the "grand challenges" in energy, water, ecosystem services and sustainability (SEES) confronting drylands of the U.S. and Mexico and to inventory the relevant resources to address them.  The workshop will engage ten researchers from UA and 15 from UNAM with an eye towards developing complementary proposals for a research coordination network (RCN) to NSF's Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program and to CONACyT, NSF's counterpart agency in Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal covers an important topic that the attendees will address in a creative and promising way, relating their work on the U.S.-Mexico borderlands to a broader set of dryland settings.  The potential attendees constitute a mix of established and early-career scientists, and the research that would result from this interaction will lead to better approaches for managing and responding to vulnerabilities in dryland systems, not only in the U.S. and Mexico, but also in similar environments around the world.  The workshop should provide a fruitful setting to stimulate future collaborative activity between UA and UNAM.  Two graduate students and three junior faculty will be involved in the workshop and subsequent activities.  Involvement of young researchers in collaborative international activities is a major goal of OISE.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON PAIRED AND SHARED DRYLANDS: U.S. and MEXICO  Introduction  The University of Arizona (UA) and the Universidad Nacional Aut&oacute;noma de M&eacute;xico (UNAM) held a planning workshop on October 23-24, 2011 in Mexico City, with 9 participants from the US and 18 from Mexico.  The purpose of the workshop was to develop a joint research agenda that would address the common challenges that confront the US and Mexico in the development and management of their shared drylands.  The premise being that while the larger challenges are common &ndash; climate change, wildfire, invasive species, habitat fragmentation, and the multiple dimensions of urbanization &ndash; political institutions, national economies and divergent environmental histories have brought about different outcomes to-date, and offer contrasting future trajectories.  We argue that to better understand options for adaptation to change, there is value in exploring these differences in the dryland environments that are (1) literally adjacent and separated only by an arbitrary boundary ("shared" environments), or (2) physically separated but analogous physical and biological environments on either side of the border that have comparable or even ecologically linked biomes ("paired" environment).  The study of these environments and the contrasting management regimes in which they exist might yield a set of problems that would be appropriate for study in a controlled environment.   Objectives:  Catalyze new international connections and collaborations between researchers and students at the UofA and UNAM, as they relate to the shared/paired drylands in the US and Mexico. Analyze the "grand challenges" confronting drylands in both countries and inventory relevant resources to address them. Identify key research approaches and strategies for moving forward. Provide draft products that can be developed into research proposals for various sponsors and funders.   Results  Grand Challenges   Working groups (random groups with representation from both UA and UNAM) were asked to define the "grand challenges" that confront their dryland environments.  The topic was intentionally broad to allow wide-ranging discussion. Although broad, the discussion was focused on four areas of primary concern (1) energy, (2) ecosystem services, (3) water, and (4) sustainability). Within this framework, four working groups identified more the 50 challenges.   Key Research Questions   Within these grand challenges, three working groups then were asked to identify the underlying research questions that must be pursued in order to address these large problem sets.  Group A  What is the carrying capacity of environment (current and future)? How we develop and integrated assessment framework? How we develop scenarios for the main drivers (ecological, climate, human, economical, etc.)? What are the impacts and end risks of biofuel alternatives? What are top down and bottom up drivers of adaptation in both countries? Bonus Question: Do we know enough?   Group B  How do dry lands elucidate opportunities for development of new sustainability science?  What are the water, energy, and ecosystem challenges (present and future) for dry lands and what are the assessment and tradeoff tools needed? a.      Both 1 and 2 must consider climate scenarios.  What are opportunities to achieve ecosystem-energy-water cross-efficiency and what are bi-national comparative potentials? What are water, energy, and ecosystem tradeoffs of conversion of dry lands to agriculture?  How to minimize the water and ecosystem, social economic impacts of 20 X 20 kilometer solar facility to power North America?    Group C  How can we develop models and tools for adaptation in NW Mexico and SW U.S.? What is the impact of local land surface change on regional and global climate?  What are the relative contributions of water and energy markets to poverty, vulnerability and options for adaptation? Can we manage water d...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
