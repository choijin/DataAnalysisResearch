<AbstractNarration>Many of the tectonic processes expressed at Earth's surface are the&lt;br/&gt;manifestation of processes rooted deeper within the planet.  Variations in&lt;br/&gt;temperatures and composition of the upper mantle (the layer below the&lt;br/&gt;crust) combined with the forces that drive motion contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;deformation patterns at the surface and/or melt generation (possibly&lt;br/&gt;resulting in volcanoes).  Models of the mantle further our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the evolution of these processes, but these models require accurate&lt;br/&gt;estimates of temperature and composition of the upper mantle---neither&lt;br/&gt;of which can be measured directly.  To estimate the state of the mantle,&lt;br/&gt;geophysical models of a physical property sensitive to temperature and&lt;br/&gt;composition are typically used as a proxy (e.g. seismic velocity and electrical&lt;br/&gt;conductivity).  Using electrical conductivity as a proxy requires&lt;br/&gt;laboratory measurements on minerals at a range of conditions expected&lt;br/&gt;for the mantle.  Most interpretations of upper mantle&lt;br/&gt;electrical conductivity are based only on the mineral olivine,&lt;br/&gt;which comprises 60-70% of the mantle, and often ignore the possible&lt;br/&gt;influence of the remaining mineral components.  While olivine typically&lt;br/&gt;dominates the electrical conductivity, there are cases, particularly&lt;br/&gt;when bound water content is high, where electrical conductivity&lt;br/&gt;contributions from orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene, the next most&lt;br/&gt;abundant upper mantle minerals, may be disproportionate to their volume.&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve the collection of electrical conductivity on&lt;br/&gt;mantle pyroxenes in a laboratory controlled setting over a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;physical conditions, leading to an improved model of dry pyroxene&lt;br/&gt;conductivity.  This model will help improve current,&lt;br/&gt;and aid in future, interpretations of mantle conductivity models and the&lt;br/&gt;processes that potentially drive melt generation and surface dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;This project will also include the building of a conductivity apparatus&lt;br/&gt;than can be used in future studies as well as the training of a postdoc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been few electrical conductivity studies on orthopyroxene and&lt;br/&gt;fewer on clinopyroxene.  While they suggest anhydrous conductivity of&lt;br/&gt;orthopyroxene is similar to that of olivine, with clinopyroxene about one&lt;br/&gt;order of magnitude lower, they were conducted along predetermined oxygen&lt;br/&gt;fugacity paths, thus limiting their application to specific conditions.  This project&lt;br/&gt;will focus on the collection of electrical conductivity and thermopower&lt;br/&gt;measurements on mantle derived pyroxenes over a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;temperatures and oxygen fugacities relevant to the mantle.  By&lt;br/&gt;collecting thermopower measurements in tandem with electrical&lt;br/&gt;conductivity at several oxygen fugacity states and temperatures it&lt;br/&gt;will be possible to estimate the concentration and mobility of the&lt;br/&gt;various charge carriers and build point defect models that extend&lt;br/&gt;conductivity estimates to a much larger range of mantle conditions.  A&lt;br/&gt;similar model for olivine has become a standard for comparison with&lt;br/&gt;laboratory experiments and repeatedly verified in recent experiments.&lt;br/&gt;In the past few years there has been a great deal of attention paid to&lt;br/&gt;the effect of water on olivine conductivity.  However, water partitioning&lt;br/&gt;experiments show that pyroxenes may hold ten times as much bound H2O as&lt;br/&gt;olivine.  Apart from contributing to bulk composition, pyroxenites (rocks&lt;br/&gt;with &gt;50% pyroxene) are found regionally in veins which are important to&lt;br/&gt;the geochemical budget, and may be responsible for the "garnet&lt;br/&gt;signature" in mid-ocean ridges and ocean island basalts.  If such veins&lt;br/&gt;form interconnected networks they would have a disproportionate effect&lt;br/&gt;on mantle conductivity.  A reliable anhydrous pyroxene conductivity&lt;br/&gt;model developed as part of this study will aid interpretation of future&lt;br/&gt;electrical conductivity experiments on hydrous pyroxenes, as well as &lt;br/&gt;improve the interpretation of  mantle conductivities inferred from&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic sounding.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We have developed, built, and tested a laboratory apparatus to measure the electrical conductivity of rocks and minerals found in Earth's upper mantle, the part of Earth below the crust (which is 5-8 km thick in the oceans, 30-60 km thick for the continents) and above the transition zone (440 km deep).&nbsp; This is important because we can independently estimate the electrical conductivity of the upper mantle using measurements of electric and magnetic fields at the surface, by magnetotelluric sounding (using portable equipment) and geomagnetic depth sounding (using data from magnetic observatories and satellites).&nbsp; By comparing estimates of electrical conductivity made this way with measurements made in the laboratory we can estimate the temperature, water content, oxygen content, and amount of melting in the mantle.&nbsp; This in turn helps us understand the mechanisms that create volcanoes, earthquakes, continents, and new oceanic lithosphere.<br /><br />Electrical conductivity increases exponentially with temperature, and at mantle depths temperatures are between 600 and 1400&deg;C, so our apparatus must heat the rock samples to high temperatures.&nbsp; The apparatus operates at atmospheric pressure so that the chemistry of the minerals can be controlled using flowing gases (discussed below).&nbsp; Without the pressures found in the deep Earth, rocks will start melting above about 1200&deg;C, and so this is the highest temperature the new apparatus needs to create.&nbsp; Heating is done with a custom designed, but commercially built, furnace.&nbsp; <br /><br />The minerals that make up mantle rocks contain iron, bonded to oxygen and silicon.&nbsp; When heated, iron in mantle minerals can leave the minerals as metallic iron if there is insufficient oxygen in the experimental atmosphere, or hematite (iron oxide, or rust) if there is too much.&nbsp;
