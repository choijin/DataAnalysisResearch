<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate species diversity and relationships in a group of ants, Crematogaster, on the island of Madagascar. These are diverse and dominant arboreal ants with a worldwide distribution for which accurate estimates of the number of species are much-needed but notoriously problematic. This study uses morphological and genetic methods to identify species and to describe any new species of these ants in Madagascar and to investigate their relatedness to other members of the group that are found in different geographical regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madagascar is one of the world?s biodiversity hotspots, harboring a unique flora and fauna, including the charismatic lemurs and plants such as the Madagascar periwinkle, valued both as an ornamental and a source of anti-cancer drugs. This research contributes significantly to understanding the unique evolutionary history of Malagasy plants and animals and delivers complete distribution records and species estimates that are needed as a basis for all further ecological and conservation measures. Broad dissemination of data is achieved through the development of web-based species identification tools, and through the education of local students and resource management authorities in Madagascar.  This study thereby supports ongoing efforts to define areas for the expansion of the protected area network in Madagascar, and further enhances the local research capacity through educational activities.</AbstractNarration>
