<AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase II) for an I/UCRC for the Connection One Center for Radio Frequency Systems &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1134641 Ohio State University (OSU); John Volakis &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Connection One site at the Ohio State University is proposing a Phase II support (second five-year period) for the Center, including support for central personnel, evaluation and research. The center is currently comprised of the Arizona State University (lead), the University of Arizona, the University of Hawaii, and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as research partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this Phase II Ohio State University proposal is to build on and continue its successful Phase I effort as part of the "Connection One: Communications Circuits and Systems Center" (C1 Center) already funded by the National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Program. The Ohio State University adds unique capabilities to the C1 Center for two reasons: (1) Has an established large program in Electromagnetics, RFICs and Radio Frequency Systems with over 120 graduate students and nearly 15 undergrads; (2) Extensive experimental facilities for antennas, RFICs, systems-on-a-chip testing and evaluation, polymer and ceramics fabrication, LTCC screen printing, terahertz imaging up to 3THz, and remote sensing. A recent State of Ohio $3M grant for terahertz equipment will be leveraged during Phase II as well. Ohio State will substantially increase the visibility and activity of the C1 NSF Center by focusing on measurements and system design activities (passive and active component integration for multifunctional all-in-one devices for high data rates). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site will focus on training students in a truly interdisciplinary arena for research in integrated communications systems, critical to many U.S. industries. The inherent aim of the Center is to integrate industry needs with University research and provide hands-on student experiences in a well-developed and supported laboratory setting for RFIC hardware, 4G wireless, coding and signal processing techniques, software radios/radars and MIMO technologies, RFIDs, new materials and metamaterials, sensors and sensor networks to mention a few. Collaborative projects with other universities within the C1 Center are another key aspect of the proposed site. The Ohio State University site has maintained from 7 to 10 industry and government members over the term of its phase I award, and has had success during its phase 1 award in the training of students through newly developed course work and the center's research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This IUCRC ConnectionOne Center site at Ohio State was highly successful in providing innovations for technology transitions to companies and in educating many graduate students that were hired by U.S. companies. Specifically, 26 projects with 16 unique organizations where carried out in the areas of radio frequency communications, radio frequency IDs (RFIDs), antennas, body worn electronics and imaging, and fast radio frequency integrated circuits, among others.&nbsp; At any one year, 10 graduate students were working on these projects with 3 or more post-docs. These students, post-docs and faculty generated 17 patent disclosures or patent awards, 83 journal papers in archival publications and 108 conference papers.</p> <p>A sampling of four high-impact research achievements are listed below:</p> <p>1) RFIDs&nbsp; have been widely used for tracking information (production date, origin, and health status information) for high value items. In the case of tires, RFIDs can be embedded within the rubber tread to monitor tire pressure, replacement interval and also provide damage warning. A challenge with existing RFIDs is their reliability (due to breakage) and reading range. During the course of this IUCRC, we worked with tire manufacturers to design a new class of RFIDs that can be read reliably from a distance of 4 ft away. A patent was generated based on our new RFID technology.</p> <p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conventional antennas are metallic and cannot be readily integrated into fabrics for body warn communications. As the interest for wearable devices grows, there is need to develop antennas that can be full size and inconspicuously integrated into clothing. With this goal in mind, we developed a new process to fabricate stretchable and flexible wire antennas using conductive textile threads that feel much like those cotton fibers. Of importance is that the new textile electronic surfaces provide for a fabrication accuracy was down to 0.1mm. That is, the new electronic textile fabrication process is equivalent to printed circuit board accuracies. Therefore actual electronic circuits can be fabricated using the proposed wearable fabrication technology. A relevant patent has been submitted (see Figures 1 and 2).</p> <p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using recently developed electronic textile antennas, we proceeded to introduce a novel body-worn monitoring method to image the electrical properties of deep human tissues pixel-by-pixel. Results demonstrated that the sensor can retrieve 16-pixel images of the underlying human body cross-section with accuracy better than 6%. A new imaging algorithm is based on a modified Gauss-Newton method was employed. The impact of this technology relates to the capability to monitor water in lungs and therefore prevent congestive heart failure weeks before. Several papers were published in archival journals describing this novel method of imaging (see Figure 3)</p> <p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the continuing data and information growth, there is a concurrent need to design data chips that are much faster and can handle much high data throughputs. With this in mind, we developed a new class of analog to digital data converters (ADCs) of high resolution and speed. The goal is to achieve 67.2 Gbps data transfer integrated circuits (ICs) with applications for wide bandwidth emerging applications in imaging, wireless base-stations / handsets, cable TV, and Internet of Things. Towards this goal, 1) Completed the design of a &ldquo;sample and hold&rdquo; circuit; 2) Completed schematic level design of the entire ADC with 2.8GS/s sample and hold; also a 13-bit sub-ADC consisting of 3 pipeline stages, high speed clocking network, data realignment circuitry and reference generation circuits were developed; 3) Designed and fabricated a rate-conversion ASIC (RCASIC) to convert the 67.2 Gb/s of aggregate data to many parallel channels within the ADC at a lower rate for processing by an FPGA. The RCASIC de-serializes three lanes of high-speed serial low voltage differential signal (LVDS) data at 5.6 Gb/s and converts them to 18 lanes of low-speed LVDS data at 0.9Gb/s. The RCASIC die have been fabricated for future testing (see Figures 4 and 5)</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/09/2017<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;Volakis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1134641/1134641_10118977_1507547582245_Figure-1-high-accuracy-textile-antennas--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1134641/1134641_10118977_1507547582245_Figure-1-high-accuracy-textile-antennas--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1134641/1134641_10118977_1507547582245_Figure-1-high-accuracy-textile-antennas--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">High fabrication accuracy textile antennas</div> <div class="imageCredit">Asimina Kiourti and John Volakis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;Volakis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1134641/1134641_10118977_1507547724271_Figure-2-textile-antennas-achieve-higher-communication-distances--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1134641/1134641_10118977_1507547724271_Figure-2-textile-antennas-achieve-higher-communication-distances--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1134641/1134641_10118977_1507547724271_Figure-2-textile-antennas-achieve-higher-communication-distances--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Textile Antennas Achieve Higher Communication Distance</div> <div class="imageCredit">Asimina Kiourti and John L.
