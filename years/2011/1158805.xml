<AbstractNarration>This project will catalyze collaborations between US and Japanese scientists working on the Tropical Tropopause Layer by convening a bilateral workshop in Honolulu to discuss research and educational questions in this field. This is an underdeveloped area of US-Japan research and is timely. There is significant support of students and young researchers. Significance and importance are that outcomes include better understanding of Tropospheric climate and stratospheric chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

In all three of these areas, the proposal team and our collaborators have achieved success.  Specifically, we achieved the following outcomes:1) We invited 8 graduate and post-doctoral students from U.S. institutions to attend the Bilateral Workshop, three of whom received NSF funding to support their travel.

All discussions and presentations at the workshop appear in the digital archive and are available to the general public at scholar.valpo.edu/ttlworkshop.3) A proposal was submitted by workshop attendees and organizers (BATTREX) to NSF in June 2012 to fund a balloon measurement field campaign centered at Manus, a key location in the Western Pacific region from which productive studies of the tropical tropopause layer had already taken place.

Funding was decined, however, and a subsequent, revised proposal could not be submitted in time for the project to be relevant to the already scheduled field campaigns.4) The entire workshop is archived on the website (see above).  To our knowledge, this is the first and most complete digital archive of a workshop or conference proceedings using the Berkeley Press system.  The site has received 5,999 total page hits by 4,221 unique visitors who have downloaded 2,697 unique pages/documents and viewed videos posted on YouTube associated with the workshop 142 times.

We estimate an attendance of 50 at the oral session.  In a follow-up survey to this session, two respondents indicated that new collaborations developed as a result of this session, with 4 respondents indicating the session led to publications (two already published and two in press or under review).8) Ten of 19 respondents ot our survey of Workshop participants in...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
