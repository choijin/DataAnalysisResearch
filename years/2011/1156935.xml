<AbstractNarration>The Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) is an invasive wood-boring insect that is a grave threat to urban forests in New England, because it is unique among invasive forest pests for attacking a broad array of tree species. The 2008-present Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) infestation of central Massachusetts poses a greater stress on ecosystem services, as well as response groups ranging from federal/state resource managers to local residents, than any previous ALB outbreak in other localities due to the predominance of favorable host-species and the finely inter-connected nature of urban-rural forests as well as the presence of a competitive interaction at the federal-stakeholder-neighborhood level surrounding how the infestation should be treated and understood. Unanswered questions abound regarding the level of ALB impact at social and ecological levels. This REU Site renewal project is built on 12 years of success engaging undergraduate researchers at Clark University with the Human-Environment Regional Observatory--Massachusetts (HERO-MA) program on land change/vulnerability studies, which followed the REU Site approach (Polsky et al., 2007) since its inception, and as an official REU Site since 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The Beetle Impact Assessment stream produces validated measures of spatial and temporal changes in tree cover composition in the ALB-infestation area. This team also evaluates impacts of ALB on forest diversity and cover at present and in the future. The Place-Making Assessment team assess management and policymaking responses to community concerns in response to ALB impacts, involving stakeholders throughout the analysis. They also evaluate ALB impacts by socio-economic status, race/ethnicity and management/governance regime to explore how a more engaged stakeholder group would respond to policy as a result of the ALB experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project integrally involves undergraduate students (with an emphasis on those from underrepresented groups in the implementation of established research design, and learning outcomes are assessed using a proven methodology within HERO-MA. It is expected to produce salient results that provide resources for practitioners and urban-rural communities experiencing changes associated with loss of urban forest; publications are expected to be produced for both scholarly and stakeholder (e.g., UDSA-APHIS, federal/state/municipal/community groups/elected officials) audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Clark University Human Environment Regional Observatory (HERO) REU Site program had two key objectives: (1) to conduct cutting-edge research on human-environment interactions concerning the socio-ecological impact of the invasive Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) in Central Massachusetts, while at the same time generating a data archive of these interactions to serve future urban sustainability/vulnerability researchers and community-/state-level decision-makers; and (2) to facilitate the transformation of undergraduate students into the next generation of environmental, social, and geographic information scientists who examined the ALB impacts using rigorous scientific analysis, and who communicated in oral and written form their results in front of professional and stakeholder audiences on numerous occasions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This REU project has significant impact on the discipline of natural resource management. Scientists and resource managers are continually challenged and empowered by the use of current research in decision-making. HERO is a model in that it engaged stakeholders throughout the process and worked collaboratively with them to determine resultant actions and future research and management questions. In addition, students were integral to this collaboration. The process itself is worthy of future research.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the course of the REU project the Clark University HERO program addressed the following five key questions:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1. How does the presence of ALB, and the associated present and future policy interventions such as tree planting, affect neighborhood-level urban ecological vulnerabilities?</p> <p>2. How have eradication and response to the ALB in Worcester informed stakeholder responses at multiple scales to ALB in other towns?</p> <p><br /> 3. How has the ALB infestation and the ongoing tree planting programs (by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation and the Worcester Tree initiative) influenced residents&rsquo; sense of place, ecological awareness and place identity?</p> <p><br /> 4. How does tree canopy loss and subsequent tree planting affected temperature over space and time?</p> <p><br /> 5. How do tree planting programs in Worcester, MA contribute to the sustainability of the city&rsquo;s urban forest?<br /> <br /> <strong></strong></p> <p>Numerous substantive and technical resource outcomes resulted from answering the five research questions, listed below.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>ALB Impact and Response</p> <p>Tree loss from ALB eradication comprised 2% of total canopy loss in the USDA quarantine zone, but in core infested areas (northern Worcester, neighborhoods of Burncoat and Greendale), fully 25% of canopy loss was due to ALB. Noteworthy, however, were findings that throughout the area, 47% of tree canopy loss was due to routine urban development.&nbsp; Tree canopy cover loss associated with the ALB eradication effort resulted in increases in land surface temperatures locally by ~5 degrees Celsius. Local residents and neighborhood associations responded to the eradication program with protests and policy engagement, resulting in the formation of a non-profit tree planting agency, working in collaboration with state agencies.&nbsp;This outcome represents an adaptation strategy, providing enhanced tree stewardship in the Worcester quarantine zone region.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Tree Planting Program Success</p> <p>The survivorship of trees planted by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation Tree survivorship was 77.6% (79.6% without White Fir, which had particularly low survivorship). The high survivorship rate was hypothetically linked to greater care of ornamental/non-native/front yard trees. Opportunity exists to improve communication with tree stewards and residents about shade/native/back yard trees and their ecosystem services in tree planting programs. Most residents were appreciative of the tree planting programs and had a positive feeling regarding the partner agencies, Worcester Tree Initiative and MA Department of Conservation and Recreation. The majority of residents said that they watered their trees and did not feel burdened by caring for their trees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Innovative Student Engagement</p> <p>Undergraduate students were integrally involved in the implementation of established research design, and learning outcomes were assessed with the Grinnell SURE survey, a proven methodology within Human-Environment Regional Observatory (HERO).&nbsp; Results show that students strengthened their abilities to handle setbacks in the research process, improved communication and teamwork skills, and gained familiarity with interdisciplinary investigation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Stakeholder Summit</p> <p>A stakeholder summit was held at the end of each summer. A mix of managers, policymakers, scientists and residents attended to hear the students present their research findings and to engage with each other. The facilitated workshops that followed each stakeholder summit resulted in a list of possible collaborative next steps to continue the relationship between Clark University and the stakeholders in subsequent years of the program, and beyond it.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/21/2016<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;Rogan</p> </div> <div
