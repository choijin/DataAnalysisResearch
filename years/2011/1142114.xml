<AbstractNarration>The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has experienced unprecedented warming and shifts in sea ice cover over the past fifty years. How these changes impact marine microbial communities, and subsequently how these shifts in the biota may affect the carbon cycle in surface waters is unknown. This work will examine how these ecosystem-level changes affect microbial community structure and function. This research will use modern metagenomic and transcriptomic approaches to test the hypothesis that the introduction of organic matter from spring phytoplankton blooms drives turnover in microbial communities. This research will characterize patterns in bacterial and archaeal succession during the transition from the austral winter at two long-term monitoring sites: Palmer Station in the north and Rothera Station in the south. This project will also include microcosm incubations to directly assess the effects of additions of organic carbon and melted sea ice on microbial community structure and function. The results of this work will provide a broader understanding of the roles of both rare and abundant microorganisms in carbon cycling within the WAP region, and how these communities may shift in structure and function in response to climate change. Results will be widely disseminated through publications as well as through presentations at national and international meetings. The research will provide training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students and will enhance international collaborations with the British Antarctic Survey.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a landscape of unprecedented climate warming that has resulted in the reduction in winter sea ice over the last 50 years. While the impacts of sea ice melt on large animals such as penguins and seals are more obvious, impacts at the microscopic scale are less so, but more challenging to address and critical for sustaining this fragile ecosystem.  Our research program addressed changes in the composition and structure of microbial communities at the base of the Antarctic food chain associated with the release of organic matter resulting from phytoplankton blooms in the WAP. The goal of this project was to test the hypothesis that environmental forcing explains how microbial communities are set up and turnover (assembly) from one year to the next in the WAP. Understanding controls on microbial assembly has practical and intellectual relevance for predicting climate warming impacts and addressing controversies in ecology. Two objectives were used to test our hypothesis:    1. Characterizing and contrasting natural patterns in seasonal succession in diversity and function as microbial communities (Bacteria and Archaea) transition from austral winter to fall. Two long-term monitoring stations, the Palmer Long Term Ecological Site Station in the north and Rothera Antarctic Times Series Station in the south were the focus of sampling from the austral winter through the austral fall to determine temporal variation in microbial succession as phytoplankton blooms develop. The spatial gradient in warming and parallel changes in sea ice represented by each station simulates the effects of expected warming.  2. Conducting experiments to determine the influence of Spring phytoplankton blooms, the introduction of dissolved organic material (DOM), and melted sea ice on microbial community assembly.  Microbial community structure and composition were determined using a combination of marker gene next-generation DNA sequencing to tell us which microbes were present, and sequencing of select metagenomic (genes involved in metabolism) and metatranscriptomic (the expression of those genes as functions) samples.    Our research has shown:  Evidence for important two-way interactions between bacteria and phytoplankton that may have bearing on seasonal succession in future years when sea-ice melt is earlier or if climate change continues to strengthen the warming trend in the region.  Accurate prediction of bacterial biomass from organic and inorganic food sources based on which bacteria are present, how many are there and how much DNA they contain.   The composition of the microbes at the start of our dissolved organic matter addition experiments influenced the final community composition and varied when we repeated this experiment during different times of the year. This suggests a mechanism by which different seasonal successional patterns in bacterial communities could occur.  Microbial populations in Palmer and Rothera Stations showed similarities in their bacterial compositions during the austral winter but differences in Spring when phytoplankton begin to bloom in Antarctica.
