<AbstractNarration>In this project the PI will develop symbolic, numerical, and hybrid methods in computational algebraic geometry and implement the resulting algorithms. He expects to advance both heuristic and certified methods in numerical algebraic geometry aimed at solving systems of polynomial equations and extracting exact geometric invariants and combinatorial information from algebraic varieties via approximate numerical methods. The proposed research includes certification of results obtained with numerical homotopy continuation, applications to tropical geometry and Schubert calculus, as well as the development of the numerical algebraic geometry engine of Macaulay2. The proposed multi-level educational program includes a new undergraduate course in algebraic computation, a graduate topics course, and a graduate summer program. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Polynomial systems are ubiquitous in mathematical models in science and engineering. As engineering community opens up to algebraic methods, applied algebraic geometry is bound to make impact on a multitude of areas. The software produced in this research project will help scientists and engineers confronted with problems algebraic in nature. Certification in homotopy tracking algorithms will bring absolute assurance of the correctness of computation valuable to practitioners and provide a status of proof to the results obtained with homotopy methods important to theoreticians. The educational part of the project will promote algebraic computation in Georgia Tech within and outside the School of Mathematics and is perfectly suited for a large engineering school with a diverse student body.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project the PI advanced several topics in the area of computational algebraic geometry that is often referred to as nonlinear algebra nowadays. This effort involved an educational component: a graduate summer program, a graduate topics course, and an undergraduate topics course in the subject.   The PI's research highlights include theoretical and practical development of both heuristic and certified methods in numerical algebraic geometry aimed at solving systems of polynomial equations. Apart from numerical algebraic geometry the PI collaborated on a study of stabilization phenomena observed in the area of asymptotic algebra which led to several significant results. The PI also implemented his algorithms in Macaulay2, a mathematical open-source software system used within and beyond the nonlinear algebra community.  The PI accomplished all educational goals set in the  project: organized a 3-week summer school, developed a graduate topics course and a  special undergraduate course, and delivered several tutorials aimed at students  and early career mathematicians.   Four graduate students benefited directly from the involvement in the project. One has defended a PhD thesis (GT School of Math best thesis award) and has continued his mathematical career in a postdoctoral position. The other three are on course to complete the PhD program.  Undergraduate and graduate students training, algorithms and software for solving polynomial systems useful to scientists and engineers, and wide dissemination of the results through both presentations delivered and events organized by the PI---all of these attest to the broad impact of this project.
