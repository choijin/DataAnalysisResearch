<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. Severe technical challenges associated with the extremes of hydrostatic pressure have prevented major advances in hadal ecological studies, and relegated hadal systems to among the most poorly investigated habitats on Earth. The recent development of the fully functional Hybrid Remotely-Operated Vehicle Nereus has now prompted scientists from around the world to join together to identify the foremost standing questions in hadal science. Through this project,  Hadal Ecosystems Studies (HADES) program, PIs from 7 Institutions from around the world will determine the composition and distribution of hadal species, the role of hadal pressures (piezolyte concentrations, enzyme function under pressure), food supply (distribution of POC with the abundance and biomass of trench organisms, and metabolic rates/energetic demand), and depth/topography (genetic divergence and spatial connectivity of populations) have on impacting deep-ocean community structure. This project will examine these factors using the world's first full-ocean depth hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV) in conjunction with the only full-ocean depth imaging lander (Hadal-Lander). This will pose a comparative framework for investigating hadal and abyssal community structure as driven by pressure (and associated factors), food supply, physiological adaptations, and topographic relationships. The investigators' first order hypotheses to explain how faunal diversity and communities are structured in trenches completely lack the data necessary to test them. Thus this project will provide the first seafloor data and samples in one of the world's best, yet little known trenches- the Kermadec Trench (SW Pacific Ocean). The first international Trench Connection Symposium in 2010 concluded the need to identify patterns of trench faunal composition and understand the first order factors that play a role in structuring these ecosystems. Megafaunal community structure and the relationship between POC and benthic bacterial biomass will be examined as a function of depth and location by systematic high-definition imaging and sediment/faunal sampling transects from abyssal to full trench depths both along and perpendicular to the trench axis. Population genetic approaches will provide levels of genetic divergence and evolutionarily independent lineages to assess the role of depth and topography in trenches and their adjacent abyssal plain in promoting the formation of species. Physiological constraints will be investigated by examining in-situ respiration of selected fauna and tissue concentrations of such protein stabilizers as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), and the structural adaptations of macromolecules. These objectives represent an achievable and powerful combination of current technological capability, scientific understanding and theory, and the expertise of an international consortium of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The project will direct new avenues of research in the deep ocean. The expedition and results will be disseminated broadly to the scientific community and the public through both active metadata and data sharing mechanisms, award winning sea-going web-based education curricula and data-posting web portals, museum exhibits, and a major National Geographic television event featuring trench and deep-sea science, including life forms at the deepest depths on earth will engage the imagination of scientists and public alike. Outreach with respect to global scientific literacy will focus on the fundamental planetary processes associated with hadal faunal ecology and evolution at the world's deepest trenches. A daily-updated web site from sea will provide real-time public, museum, and aquaria access to the ongoing cruise activities and discoveries. The integral involvement of postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students will foster professional and educational advancement opportunities for underrepresented groups. In addition, we will stimulate a broader collective of interested biologists, chemists, geologists, and others to advance the application of ecological and evolutionary theory to better understand the biodiversity that inhabits hadal ecosystems. To this end, the investigators will develop an international consortium for hadal science dedicated to training the next generation of marine scientists and in conjunction with INDEEP, international collaboration for deep-sea research. The  use of the HROV Nereus will advance this vehicle's capabilities for a broad range of disciplinary use, drive advances in applying technologies for conducting rigorous hadal and abyssal science, and further off-shoot technologies for use by the broader scientific community. The results of this project will be the first of its kind regarding the environmental variables that structure trench communities and lay the essential foundation for future work on the dynamic processes that create and maintain biodiversity in the deep ocean.</AbstractNarration>

Much of our knowledge of hadal biology is derived from two sampling campaigns in the 1950s (the Danish Galathea and the Soviet Vitjaz expeditions).

The successful development of the Hybrid Remotely-Operated Vehicle Nereus (Fig. 1) prompted our international team of scientists to come together to address the foremost standing questions in hadal science. In short, we worked to determine the composition and distribution of hadal communities and how depth/pressure, food supply, metabolic rates/energy demand, and topography affect these communities.  This report covers the research conducted by the University of Hawaii, namely efforts to evaluate patterns of food supply and energetic demand.  Our work took place in the Kermadec trench at depths between 4000 and 10000 meters (Fig. 2).  We also leveraged NSF funding and conducted another expedition (shiptime funded by SOI) to the Mariana trench where we conducted similar sampling but without the Nereus ROV.    Intellectual Merit A key outcome of our research has been to support the detrital or food accumulation hypothesis.  The hypothesis suggests that food, often as small detrital particles, accumulates with increasing depth in the trench causing increases in animal densities, activities and changes in communities.  Accumulation may occur through funneling of sinking material into the narrowing trench, downslope accumulation and/or earthquake induced slumps or turbidity currents.  Our results provide considerable evidence for detrital accumulation with depth.  Collaborator Dan Mayor (U. of Aberdeen) has found increases in total sediment organic carbon content and microbial organic content (phospholipid fatty acids) with depth in the Kermadec trench.  We find extremely high sediment community (Mariana trench, Fig. 3) and megafaunal community (Kermadec trench) respiration at great depths suggesting high food demand. Further, increases in nutritional condition of hadal snailfishes from ~6000 to 8000 m suggest better feeding at depth (Fig. 4).  Preliminary results from collaborators also show that densities of animals increase with depth.  Together these results show that trenches can be locations of high animal and/or microbial biomass and activity in the deep ocean.  It is also interesting to speculate on whether subduction of detrital rich sediments could lead to carbon sequestration in trenches.   In the rest of the deep-sea food supply declines predictably with depth due to water column consumption of sinking detritus.  Identifying the factors leading to changes in marine communities with depth has been difficult because temperature, pressure, and food supply all covary with depth.  Our finding of a reverse pattern in food supply with depth in the lower half of the ocean presents an unusual and intriguing ecological situation and provides an interesting opportunity to disentangle the relative importance of these environmental parameters on communities.  Broader Impacts During a 10000m dive in the Kermadec trench, the Nereus vehicle imploded, attesting to the great technical challenges of working in the EarthÆs deepest places.  Several new instruments were developed as part of this project including systems to measure respiration of hadal animals and sediments for the very first time.  In addition, the use of landers, or vehicles which ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
