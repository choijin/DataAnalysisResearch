<AbstractNarration>The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans (SACNAS), a non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving and expanding opportunities for underrepresented groups in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce.   At the core of the SACNAS' mission is the organization's marked focus on encouraging students to pursue advanced degrees in STEM through mentoring, exposure to cutting edge science, and professional development training offered at the SACNAS National Conference.  In addition to attending scientific symposia, receiving information on various graduate and internship programs, student participants have the opportunity to submit abstracts on and present their academic research at poster sessions, which are judged by professional research scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds will be utilized to support the attendance of students and post-doc in NSF-supported disciplines to attend the National conference as a vehicle to increase the diverse participation of students in STEM, particularly in the fields of the biological sciences, geosciences, mathematics, chemistry, physics, computer science,engineering and the social and behavioral sciences.  The activity creates a unique opportunity for the National Science Foundation, in partnership with SACNAS, to meet goals aligned with the America Competes Act, as well as to assist in the development of the intellectual capital of young professionals in the quest to achieve excellence in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by contributions from the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Directorate for Engineering, Directorate of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, Division of Earth Sciences, the Division of Human Resource Development, and the Office of Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The goal of this project was to offer underrepresented minority (URM) students an opportunity to travel to and attend the national conferences of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) from 2011-2014. The programming at the conference is specifically tailored to supporting URM STEM students as they advance to the next stage of their educational and professional careers.   There are multiple reasons why this activity had a much larger impact at the SACNAS National Conference than at any particular university. SACNAS is an over 40-year-old society of scientists that fosters the success of minority scientists, from college students to professionals, in attaining advanced degrees, careers and positions of leadership. SACNAS has pioneered successful mentorship strategies and the conference offers 45-50 workshop sessions on graduate school survival, applying to graduate school, job search, mentorship, funding, and more. This project was designed to fund the participation of URM students that could not be funded from other sources. The SACNAS conference has fine-tuned mechanisms for establishing and maintaining a network of contacts. This project took full advantage of the opportunities for students at the conference. In this sense there was tremendous leverage of the SACNAS conference program.   Intellectual Merit. The topics of the sessions in this project represented current research in a variety of STEM fields. The speakers were selected for their outstanding research accomplishments, ability to involve students in research, speaking and mentorship qualities.  Broader Impacts. Despite considerable efforts by diverse organizations including the federal government, African Americans, Latinos and American Indians remain underrepresented in the STEM fields. The students who received travel scholarships to the 2011-2014 SACNAS National Conferences were exposed to mentors and role models from across the STEM spectrum.
