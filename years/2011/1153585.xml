<AbstractNarration>The objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to improve physical understanding of Graphene - the thinnest possible sheet of just atomic thickness. In addition to its remarkable mechanical strength, Graphene has tantalizing electronic, magnetic, and optical properties which could lead to a host of applications ranging from nanoelectronics, highly sensitive sensors, strong materials and energy storage devices among others. One property missing from Graphene is the so-called "piezoelectricity," which allows a voltage to be developed when a material is mechanically deformed and vice-versa. Thus the specific research objective of this investigation is to elucidate "if" and "how" Graphene can be endowed with piezoelectricity (even though it may not be expected to exhibit such behavior ...). Advanced quantum mechanical calculations and state-of-the-art fabrication and testing techniques will be employed to realize such goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project puts forth a high-risk high-payoff concept and, if successful, will establish a new paradigm in creating multifunctional materials and the use of Graphene as the thinnest material capable of a variety of functions - sensing and actuation, among others.  Piezoelectricity is important in a host of applications where both sensing and actuation are needed - piezoelectric Graphene, for example, could be used to create artificial muscles.  Other potential applications range from biomedical to space. Graduate and undergraduate students working on the project will develop a strong foundation in the highly multidisciplinary areas of nanotechnology, computational materials science and mechanics. Plans are in place to reach out to school-children through the concept of "Science behind Harry Potter."</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the proposed research, we made attempts to "coax" graphene to act as a piezoelectric. Even when graphene is insulating (e.g. in ribbon form or with porosity), due to manifestly centrosymmetric crystal structure, graphene is non-piezoelectric. Our quantum mechanical calculations indicate that simply creating holes of the right symmetry will lead to the graphene acting as a piezoelectric.     Experimentally creating such small-scale holes in graphene ribbons turned out to be quite difficult through top-down fabrication methods. However, as an alternative, we explored a variant of graphene; so-called graphene-nitride. In this atomistically thin monolayer, very small triangular holes, the size of one nm, are spontaneously created.  Consistent with our predictions, piezoelectricity was detected in these samples.     The proposed research will pave the way for the use of graphene (and its variants) as a sensor and actuator; potentially opening up the possibility of a complete multifunctional system embodied in graphene: electronic devices, sensing, actuation among others.     As part of this project, one peer-reviewed journal paper has been published and two are in advanced stages of submission.     In so far as broader impact concerned, we made efforts to recruit female graduate students, link with an existing GK12 program on science behind Harry Potter to excited school kids about science, incorporated the state-of-the-art findings in advanced graduate courses and widely disseminated the results through conference presentations, invited talks and peer-review journal papers.
