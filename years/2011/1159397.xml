<AbstractNarration>1159397&lt;br/&gt;Bara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program supports work by Professors Jason E. Bara and Christoffer H. Turner from the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of Alabama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Membranes potentially offer a highly energy efficient technology by which CO2 can be captured from sources such as coal-fired power plants.  While the currently available membranes present some desirable performance characteristics, only marginal gains can be made in CO2 transport rates via structural modification of these polymers.  However, polymers containing hindered, basic groups offer unprecedented opportunities to develop membranes with much higher transport rates via facilitated transport of CO2.  In the presence of water, these groups can promote the formation of bicarbonate (HCO3-) anion, which can enable extremely high transport rates for CO2, minimizing energy requirements and the cost of CO2 capture.  Because of the large number of possible membrane materials that can be developed around this concept, as well as a crucial need for detailed, molecular-level simulation efforts in the field of polymer gas separation membranes, a fundamental understanding of the design, facilitated transport mechanisms and polymer structures of these membranes for CO2 capture will be most readily achieved via coordinated experimental and computational studies.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this project will significantly advance the fundamental understanding of polymer membranes and facilitated transport mechanisms for CO2 capture.  Additionally, the results generated will be of interest to other major research areas, such as pharmaceuticals and biomaterials, where similar structures are used for their therapeutic, antifungal and antibacterial properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project provides an excellent educational platform for graduate, undergraduate students, as well as outreach activities.  The students involved with the project will benefit from an excellent synergy and training opportunities within the combined experimental and computational efforts.  The PI and co-PI are directors of the NSF-REU Site "Engineering Solutions for Clean Energy Generation, Storage, and Consumption" and this research proposal can provide multiple synergies and opportunities for students in that program.  Additionally, our project will provide the basis for a new Honors Forum class taught within the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department at UA. This is an interactive, discussion-oriented class, which focuses on a new (contemporary) topic each semester.  Bara and Turner will co-teach this class, focusing on emerging technologies for addressing CO2-related issues.  Funding provided through this proposal will enable additional short-term research opportunities for undergraduate students.  During the studies, students will learn skills related to the use of polymer synthesis, membrane characterization, NMR, instrument design using LabView, as well as develop skills in molecular simulations and electronic structure calculations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied the synthesis and polymerization of imidazole-based compounds for use as membranes for the selective separation of CO2 and other acid gases from process streams related to the energy industry.  The efficiency of these separations is a very important aspect of improving global energy consumption and streamlining chemical processes.  Imidazoles are heterocyclic molecules containing two nitrogen atoms within a five-membered ring.  In the context of this project, of these nitrogen atoms is functionalized with an organic group (e.g., vinyl, styryl, etc.) while the other nitrogen remained reactive.  The polymerization was then carried out via conventional free-radical methods such as photopolymerization to create solid polymers directly from the imidazole.  The reactive nitrogen site is retained in the polymer and can be used for the facilitated transport of CO2, H2S, SO2 or other acid gas species and their separation from N2, CH4, or other non-reactive gases.  Experimental and computational studies were carried out in a complementary and synergistic manner.  The experimental worked demonstrated the synthesis of new momoners, improved methods of polymerizing these monomers and the viability of using imidazole-based compounds for gas separations.  The computational work provided molecular-level understandings and visualizations of the experimental work, and also helped guide the synthesis of new organic monomers and polymers with targeted properties such as pKa (i.e., relative basicity).  This project generated a wealth of new knowledge about imidazole-based materials and new computational techniques.  The results have been disseminated through a number of peer-reviewed journal articles and conference presentations.  Several graduate and undergraduate student researchers directly participated in the project, including females and underrepresented minorities.  The PI and co-PI also performed outreach activities including the development of an undergraduate course relating to economics and the energy industry, and demonstrations of the use of 3-D printing as a means to create tangible visualization of polymer structures and the outputs of molecular dynamics simulations.
