<AbstractNarration>In partnership with Los Alamos National Lab, Los Alamos County, and other employers, the University of New Mexico-Los Alamos is building a robust two-year cybersecurity program that both increases the number of highly-skilled technicians for the region's employers and provides opportunities for retraining and certifying existing workers. For this program, the investigators are adapting cybersecurity curricula developed by the Cyber Security Education Consortium (CSEC), an NSF ATE center of excellence. Activities include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* providing rich internship and hands-on classroom experiences that deepen students' understanding of complex IT systems and their security needs;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* creating a pipeline to IT careers for high school graduates and college students;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* exciting students' interest in IT and cybersecurity through events such as a "Capture the Flag" challenge and mini-technology workshops;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* creating seamless transfer opportunities from the two-year program to four-year programs;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* providing opportunities for existing IT workers to build their skills and achieve certifications in cybersecurity; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* providing professional development for two-year college faculty and high school technology teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To improve retention, the project is emphasizing student support through a career development facilitator, a redesigned Tutor Center, and an equity awareness program. To reach Hispanic and Native American students better, the project is utilizing contacts with educational organizations tied to those constituencies and showing those students local job opportunities that allow them to stay close to family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other features of the project include integrating problem-solving skills with hands-on projects to prepare students for the workplace, establishing a successful internship/co-op program, expanding and enriching online components with smart-classroom technologies, and testing an arrangement for small institutions to share courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are sharing the program design, curriculum, and sustainability concepts with partner community colleges across New Mexico, and helping train both community college partners and high school teachers in the curriculum and hands-on activities through combined workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project created a quality associate degree in Information Technology with Cyber Security as a focus.  We designed a program that includes critical thinking, problem-solving, and ethical issues, as well as the usual skills sets in associate level IT work. It has been industry reviewed by IT experts at our national laboratory in Los Alamos and IT professionals at Los Alamos County.   Continued mapping of the curriculum to CISSPcertification  standards is ongoing. Additional concentrations to increase expertise are under consideration.  Our plan to create a pipeline means that we have created awareness of and participation in IT from youth, middle school and high school with summer programs, "Capture the Flag" and other "challenge" events, and even females only events.   We provided high school teacher training for IT and created a high school level IT curriculum mapped to common core standards, which is available for any high school that requests it.   Our two-year degree also offers the opportunity for students to compete for an internship at Los Alamos National Lab.  Such an internship provides ten weeks of training in various departments, so students gain real workplace knowledge, soft skills needed by employers, and - in our case - job offers at the end of the internship.   Additional student support was built  by increasing our Academic Support Center's capacity, as well as working with Student Services advisors and faculty, with intrusive advising and tutoring, particularly in math.  Progress toward degree is a primary concern when over 90% of our students work and support families, so education is an additional but incredible important aspect of their lives.  Advanced IT training offered through continuing education, with Attack Research providing "Red Hat" type workshops furthered the idea of a pipeline of IT education even to career IT specialists.  An 18-hour  CISSP certification review course was also offered to our community and professionals.  Community awareness and participation in IT was created through home computer security classes. Partnerships  with Los Alamos National Lab and Los Alamos County included curricuum review and recruitment of adjunct faculty. We have some of the most qualified IT faculty in the nation.   Our achievements came in spite of significant challenges, including a delay in processing and inputting our new degree into the University of New Mexico's system, which took over 12 months longer than expected.  This delayed everything.  The difficulty and in fact, resulting failure to find full time faculty was another challenge.  A small two-year college cannot compete with national lab salaries, and in these days of budget cuts, no additional funds were available to compete.  We do have, however, partnering with the lab to find great adjuncts who serve our students well.  Our partnering work with SUN Online, a New Mexico attempt like Maryland online, with course sharing, etc is uncertain at this point, since that program does not appear to be sustainable now that its grant funds are gone  That was a loss, but our offerings include many online options, so flexibility for our students does exist.  An upgraded, ADA accessible IT classroom provides students with the opportunity to work on a separate network to do challenges, attacks, pen testing,etc.   We consider the links to our high school teachers and possible programs to be a key element that we'd just begun to address this year.  We hope that the curriculum we have designed for high schools that meets common core standards is a significant step forward.  However, New Mexico schools often have few qualified teachers in IT.   In addition, our hope to continue preparing our students to compete for internships at LANL, competing with 4-year university students, will greatly enhance our students' understanding of the work world, the additional skills needed, and how such opportunities lead to significant employment in their fields.
