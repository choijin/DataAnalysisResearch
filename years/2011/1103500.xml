<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Intersections of Biology and Mathematical and Physical Sciences. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow at the intersection of biology with physics and engineering. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Daniel Allen is "Biodiversity and engineering function: integrating physical processes into biodiversity and ecosystem function research." The host institutions for the fellowship are the University of Michigan and Virginia Tech, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Bradley Cardinale and Theresa Wynn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some pressing environmental problems are being exacerbated by human-induced changes to riparian ecosystems that result in erosion and jointly influence fluid dynamics and materials transport along steam banks. It is not fully understood how plants modify the physical processes that control erosion by reinforcing soil with their roots. However, past research in this area has held a narrow view of biology, limiting ?biota? to a single species or functional group of plants. A completely separate area of research has shown that plant biodiversity can increase the density and biomass of roots produced by plant communities. The goal of this research is to merge these two areas of research to investigate how biodiversity influences physical processes and to conduct laboratory and field experiments to test if plant biodiversity reduces stream bank erosion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include fluid mechanics and sediment transport and, in biology, biodiversity and species coexistence theory.  Career development activities include learning to publish proficiently, especially at the interface of biology and physics; mentor undergraduate students; and improve teaching skills. A practical outcome of the research is determining which plants best stabilize stream banks, as stream bank erosion is one of the most pressing environmental problems affecting North American streams.  Educational outreach to undergraduate students and organizing a stream restoration project with public high school students are also being conducted.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientists have a long history of studying how organisms modify physical processes. Interest in this topic dates as far back as Aristotle and Charles Darwin, and more recently, organisms that physically modify habitats and have significant effects on ecosystems have been termed "ecosystem engineers" or "biophysical couplers." In spite of these efforts, studies in this field tend to view "biota" as a single species or functional group, though they do acknowledge differences between types of organisms (e.g. differences between of grasses and trees ). But this view ignores one of the most fundamental principles of ecology, that ecosystems contain multiple species that interact.   Results from ecological studies have shown that as plant communities contain more species, it increases their ability to convert belowground inorganic resources to biomass. Plant species have evolved different root morphologies to partition belowground resources, reducing competition and allowing them to coexist. But studies investigating how multi-species communities modify physical processes are scarce.  Here, we present the results of a manipulative greenhouse mesocosm experiment and a comparative field study to test the following hypotheses:  H1: The biodiversity of plant communities increases the density and biomass of soil rooting systems.   H2: Plant community biodiversity will decrease the erosion of stream banks.   Mesocosm Experiment:  In our mesoscosm experiment we, we constructed over 100 stream bank "mesocosms," stream bank mimics that were seeded with 8 different species of herbaceaus plants in species treatments that were either one species by themselves, or 2, 4, 6, and 8 species in combination.  The most important result of our mesocosm experiment is that plant biodiversity reduced the erosion rate of stream bank soils.  Although decreasing erosion is an ecosystem service that is often attributed to plant biodiversity, yet to our knowledge this is something that has not been explicitly demonstrated. Interestingly, our analysis suggests that plant biodiversity effects on soil erosion rates were due to effects via aboveground biomass, rather than via effects on root volume. The effect of species richness on normalized erosion rates manifested itself indirectly via increasing aboveground biomass, which was then negatively affected soil normalized erosion rates manifested. We expected to see that plant biodiversity would increase root biomass, which would then decrease soil erosion rates, but this pathway was not supported by the structural equation model. It might seem counterintuitive that aboveground biomass might affect the soil erosion rates, but this may represent an effect of evapotranspiration rates on soil consolidation. Plant biomass was positively related to evapotranspiration rates, and greater evapotranspiration rates would increase the number of wet/dry cycles experienced by the soil. Soil drying increases soil consolidation and aggregate stability increasing the erosion resistance of soil, so soil in mesocosms with greater plant biomass likely experienced more drying and thus more drying associated sol consolidation.  Comparative Field Study:  In our comparative field study, we used 38 sites along three rivers in the northern part of Michigan's lower peninsula.  At each site we calculated the historical stream bank migration rate (a surrogate measure of stream bank erosion) using historical photos and satellite imagery, combining and rectifying them using Global Information System (GIS) technology.  We also sampled each site for woody plant species composition, identifiying each woody plant (tree and shrub) to species and measuring its size.  In contrast to our hypothesis, our data supportec a pathway where a higher migration rate indirectly increased woody plant abundance by directly increasing woody plant species richness. We did find more woody plant biomass at sites with more plant species, however our data appears to sup...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
