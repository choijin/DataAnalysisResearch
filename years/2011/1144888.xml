<AbstractNarration>Plants absorb the chemical element silicon from soil through their roots and transport it into their aboveground parts. The deposit of silicon results in minute structures inside the plant known as phytoliths. During phytolith formation, small amounts of carbon and other elements can also become trapped and in the process become physically protected after the plant dies and undergoes decomposition. Since photosynthesis is the main way that plants acquire carbon to make their own food, it has been assumed that phytolith carbon only comes from the air and that the properties of carbon trapped in phytoliths should reflect those of the atmosphere at the time the plant was growing and fixing carbon into its leaves. In fact, building up phytolith-protected carbon in soils was recently considered as a possible way for removing some of the excess carbon in the atmosphere. However, the assumption that phytolith carbon only comes from the air has been recently challenged by the dating of carbon in phytoliths extracted from live grasses that has been found to be several thousands of years old. Because plants also take up small amounts of carbon from soils during nutrient uptake, the unexpected old ages of some of the phytolith carbon suggest that soil carbon could become trapped in phytoliths as well. If this is the case, opportunities for sequestering carbon via phytoliths are probably overestimated. To test these ideas, this project will analyze phytoliths extracted from grasses exposed to distinctly labeled carbon isotopes in two experiments. The results should reveal the origin - root uptake from soil or leaf uptake from the atmosphere - of the carbon in phytoliths. Additionally, an independent verification method using nanoparticles will be developed and applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution. The recent interest in sequestering atmospheric carbon by promoting plants capable of producing large amounts of phytoliths makes it essential to evaluate the origin of phytolith carbon. If phytoliths are merely recycling carbon from soil, then their potential for additional sequestration is minimal. To test this, a new phytolith extraction method for reliably obtaining isotope results will need to be developed. Since many fields of science rely on isotope measurements of carbon inside plants, they will be informed by these findings. In addition, doctoral students in the United States and France will work in tandem to evaluate the new procedures. A postdoctoral fellow will work on the nanotechnology part of the project. Results will be used in annual short courses open to all undergraduate students at the University of California in Irvine, and also available to both national and international established researchers. Finally, the methods and results will be presented at meetings, incorporated into a text book, and publically released on a project web page.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We often think that plants, as photosynthetic factories, should have a very well constrained carbon isotopic signature distributed to all their organs. In fact, plants are far more complex and can manipulate carbon resources whenever it pleases them. Recently, researchers have shown that they store metabolites (sugars and starches) from previous years to be used under stress conditions, trade carbon through roots with neighbors, and acquire carbon from soils through their roots or mycorrhizal fungi networks (amino acids and proteins for nutritional purposes - Fig. 1). Most of this carbon appears to be non-structural or mobile and, once chemically separated before isotopic analysis, will not bias its results. For decades the carbon occlusions in biosilica formation of higher plants (phytoliths or plantstones) has been assumed to be solely from atmosphere. Since phytoliths can serve as fingerprints of a particular vegetation type and survive in soils after plant decay, researchers have been using them to study environmental changes, determine paleo-diet habits, and establish when certain crops were domesticated. Fearing future climate change scenarios and assuming that carbon credits can be obtained and traded through biosequestration (or phytosequestration), other researchers have launched several studies on the potential of global grassland and cropland phytoliths as a carbon sink. However, the source of the carbon embedded in those silica structures has never been directly examined regardless of the several failed attempts on matching radiocarbon signatures of phytolith carbon to host plants.</p> <p>In this project our main goal was to determine the source of the carbon to phytoliths (photosynthetic, soil carbon or both). But the results of our experiments gave us a number of new insights into how carbon is allocated and protected into the biosilica structure, as well as its overall concentration and molecular makeup. We reported for the first time that the radiocarbon offsets of phytolith carbon to plant tissue were due to the incorporation of soil organic carbon via roots, and reallocation into phytoliths. Conclusions were based on over 200 isotopic measurements with several isotopic results as duplicates or triplicates by using phytolith extracts from plants under controlled carbon conditions (above- and below-ground experiments) (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, innovative phytolith investigations using plant biomass subjected to root isotope labeling (13C and 15N-aminoacid tracers - Fig.3), biosilica C-N imaging techniques (such as 3D X-ray, NanoSIMS mapping, and Raman spectroscopy - Fig. 4), and biomolecular analyses (DNP-NMR spectroscopy) allowed us to determine the fate of C encapsulated in the phytolith structure, and gave insight to its molecular make up. We found that dark spots in biosilica are mostly voids, and that a second pool of carbon and nitrogen are fairly distributed in the silica matrix (Fig. 4). We also found that phytolith carbon is not simply inherited from the composition of the host leaf (e.g. photosynthesis). The high proportion in amino compounds indicates that the (poly)peptides associated with the phytoliths are partly imported from compartments outside the silicified plant cells, probably from soil solution as we directly demonstrated by our previous work on 14C (Fig. 2) and 13C-labelling (Fig. 3) analysis. Our findings support the controversial hypothesis of phytolith carbon mixed pool due to incorporation of soil carbon. Since radiocarbon signals of fractions isolated from mixed carbon pools are methodologically dependent, it should come as no surprise that different degrees of oxidation when extracting phytoliths will yield different age results (Fig. 5). Consequently, we found that phytoliths are inappropriate to be used in dating studies. Furthermore, we recalculate the phytosequestration fluxes based on realistic silicate dissolution and carbon concentration percentages (Fig. 6), and conclude that promoting cropland changes to increase biosilica rates is insignificant to carbon mitigation efforts.</p> <p>Broader Impacts:&nbsp; This project provided research opportunities and training to a PhD candidate from CEREGE/France, two postgraduate-scholars, an undergraduate senior student from ESS/UCI and NSF-REU student through the Department of Chemistry/UCI.
