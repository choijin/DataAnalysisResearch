<AbstractNarration>OISE 11-30978 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this three year project, the PI will bring US students to the Lough Hyne Marine Reserve in County Cork, Ireland to conduct ecological research.  This reserve is Europe?s first statutory marine reserve and is among the world?s most studied protected shores with more than 70 years of ecological study.  This sea lough, known for extremely rich habitats and high species diversity, is faced with imminent change due to a recent series of large-scale alterations in the lough data.  Each year two undergraduate and two graduate students will participate in the project.  The Irish collaborators are Colin Little (University of Bristol) and Rob McAllen (University College Cork).  &lt;br/&gt;Lough Hyne is an ideal field model system and the location has many logistical scientific and educational advantages.  The unifying research theme is understanding the marine benthic ecology of the Lough Hyne primarily by recording species abundance and distributions and comparing these over time and over different spatial scales.  The students? participation in long-term monitoring of historical sites will allow for detection of long term changes that are otherwise difficult to assess.&lt;br/&gt;Working in a marine protected area with local scientists is an invaluable experience for students that will translate well into their futures in marine sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Objectives: No-take marine reserves are important tools to learn about marine systems and to protect areas for future generations. These ideas, encapsulated by national and regional marine reserve programs, offer an ideal opportunity to train young marine scientists about international marine reserves: their structure, function, and management. A total of 19 outstanding American students (undergraduate and graduate) conducted ecological research with foreign colleagues at Europe's first statutory marine reserve (Lough Hyne Marine Reserve in Co. Cork, Ireland) as part of the International Research Experiences for Students  (IRES) program. IRES students participated in a 5-day orientation workshop and a 4-week research period between summer and fall academic terms (2012-2015). Students worked at the University College Cork Renouf Lab, a small field station accessible by boat, and lived in a nearby cottage. Each IRES student took the research lead on one ecological aspect of the rapid, community-level changes of lough biota. Students also participated in long-term, rocky intertidal shore surveys and shallow-water, snorkel surveys.   Outcomes: IRES fellows and mentors investigated the juvenile and adult stages of the purple urchin Paracentrotus lividus as part of our effort to determine why the urchin population crashed in the early 2000s. We sampled planktonic urchin larvae and conducted larval settlement experiments to evaluate the possible causes of the dramatic urchin decline. We found few larval urchins in our extensive plankton tows and extremely few juvenile purple urchins that had settled. Adults continue to die, with many necrotic specimens seen each year. Based on our measurements using water-temperature sensors, low temperatures have been largely discounted as an explanation of reproductive failure and subsequent urchin demise. Extensive visual fish surveys indicate that predation by fishes is unlikely. Two possibilities that were not investigated were (i) large-scale urchin poaching and (ii) outbreak of urchin diseases. However, we did document that the environmental conditions in the shallow waters of the lough are currently too stressful for many invertebrates to survive, given the extreme fluctuations of dissolved oxygen from significant daytime high levels (up to 200% of air saturation) to nighttime low levels (down to 0%). Many areas of the shore have little or no dissolved oxygen, killing existing invertebrate communities.  IRES participants investigated the shallow subtidal areas previously inhabited by urchins and found other generally-overlooked species. We have tripled the known species list for ribbon worms in the lough, rediscovered an octocoral species not seen since the 1930s, and recorded many seaweed and invertebrate species never before seen in the lough.  Intellectual Merit: The urchin Paracentrotus lividus is one of the most important species structuring the lough benthic communities. Elucidating the basis of urchin decline would determine whether or not urchin populations would eventually increase without human intervention (the preferred approach of the Irish National Park and Wildlife Service). Given the 8-10 year lifespan of the purple urchins, the 4-year period of recruitment failure, and the small remaining population, we suggest the local population is currently too small to recover; urchin restoration using nursery stock may be the sole management option. The efficacy of any restoration endeavors would be contingent on restricting urchin poaching and confirming the lough seawater to be disease-free.   Broader Impacts: IRES students participated in (1) crucial conservation efforts (e.g., eradicating the invasive brown seaweed Sargassum muticum in the lough); (2) long-term monitoring (of 24 invertebrate and 21 seaweed target species) at historical sites surveyed annually since 1994 and originally in the 1950s; and (3) educating the public about marine life and conservation through annual touch...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
