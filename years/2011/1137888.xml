<AbstractNarration>Preferences, fashions, and languages change through time.  Where this culture comes from and where it is going is a perennial subject of scientific and philosophical debate and a continually fascinating topic of popular speculation.  In the last half century, population geneticists have revealed much of the genetic history of the human species, yielding a story of our migration and relatedness that has revitalized anthropology, archeology, and ethnology.  The story of culture sometimes fits the story of the genes, but sometimes contradicts it and always changes more quickly.  This project takes central insights from population genetics, especially coalescent theory that explores lineages backwards in time to see how they converge or coalesce into common ancestors, and appropriates these insights to a study of culture.  Through both mathematical theory and empirical data, this project aims to implement coalescence as a central tool by which to understand the history of culture. This will pave the way for solutions to persistent questions relating to the speed and timing of cultural change and divergence, the degree of contact between cultures, and even the mechanisms behind these changes.  Tests of progress on these questions will be conducted on bird song (the best studied nonhuman example of culture) as well as human language.  This work will be conducted by an academically and ethnically diverse team of scientists including specialists in evolutionary biology, anthropology, mathematics, and cultural change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cultural evolution is the change in socially learned traits over time, resulting in patterns of variation in nearly all human behavioral traits, from pottery styles to language to music, and also in a few animal traits such as learned birdsong. The gradual change in such traits due to innovation and copy errors bears an interesting resemblance to genetic evolution, inspiring us to develop a model for the spread of cultural traits over time that is inspired by "coalescent analysis", a retrospective genealogical analysis that predicts the time to the most recent common ancestor of a cultural trait. Concomitantly with this, we examined the patterns of variation in a complex socially learned trait&mdash; the song of the house finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) over a broad variety of spatial and temporal scales, as a model system. To this end we developed a new software package designed specifically for the extraction of focal sounds from a natural background, the quantitative characterization and categorization of song elements, and the detection of similarities and differences between individuals such that songs can be used much like DNA sequences in estimating relatedness.  Both the cultural evolutionary theory and the computational analysis of empirical data have converged such that we are approaching the ability to use the house finch results to parametrize and test the model, which will allow us to further refine theory and produce predictions that might eventually be applicable to the histories of other cultural traits, including in humans.
