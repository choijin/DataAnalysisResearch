<AbstractNarration>One of the most intriguing discoveries of the past 20 years of evolutionary genetics is the rapid evolution of some reproductive genes.  That genes with such critical roles should functionally diverge over time seems paradoxical. Selection imposed by mate choice may drive some of this functional divergence as individuals continually grapple for reproductive success.  This research project focuses on ~10 mouse species that differ in mating system and population size, offering a unique opportunity to predict and test the strength and direction of reproductive selection.  The evolution of ~1000 reproductive genes gathered from ~150 individuals across these species will be studied via high throughput sequencing and rigorous computational approaches.  This work will significantly advance our understanding of the forces that moderate genetic variation within and between species.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To broaden the impacts of our research, we have engaged students of West Adams, a downtown Los Angeles high school with a typical inner city story.  Nearly 30% of students drop out before graduating and more than 50% failed first year biology. However, the teachers are eager to bring alternative strategies into the classroom.  Several of their students have already taken "ownership" in specific aspects of this research project and will be co-authors on resulting publications.  Immersing high school in all aspects of our research will demystify the scientific process and expose them to new ideas about potential career paths.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant supported research on the influence of effective population size and mating system on genomic variation.
