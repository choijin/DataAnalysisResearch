<AbstractNarration>Gravel and cobble transport by rivers governs channel change, and is therefore of great importance to geomorphologists and river engineers. The most commonly used approaches to estimating bedload transport rates are empirically calibrated relationships based on flume experiments.  However, it is difficult to assess how effectively such relationships predict transport rates during extreme events in large rivers because quantitative measures of bedload transport are labor intensive and, at high flows, often dangerous to obtain. For logistical reasons, most bedload studies have been carried out in small mountain streams. Particle impacts on the river bed transfer momentum, which in turn generates elastic (seismic) waves. Therefore, seismology (the study of elastic waves in the Earth) can potentially constrain bedload transport rates in rivers.  Taking advantage of a well-instrumented catchment with independent constraints on when and at what rate sediment moves in the channel, we will deploy an array of seismometers to test theoretical predictions for the generation of seismic waves from bedload sediment impacts with the bed during transport.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding more clearly when and at what rate coarse sediment moves in river channels is essential for planning infrastructure in and adjacent to rivers (e.g., bridges, dams, roads).  Approaches to predicting coarse sediment transport are typically developed in controlled settings and can be inaccurate in large floods, when it is most critical to be able to predict sediment movement.  Using a novel application of an existing science (seismology), we are developing an approach to measuring bedload transport in large rivers without requiring the deployment of any instrumentation in the river.  This work has the potential to greatly improve our capacity to cheaply, safely, and efficiently monitor sediment movement in rivers while simultaneously advancing understanding of the processes influencing bedload transport rates in rivers.  Additionally, this project will have an outreach component in which an undergraduate geology class will conduct a sediment transport monitoring exercise using the approach developed here.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The transport of coarse sediment in rivers is a fundamental control on erosion, and therefore has broad implications for a wide array of fields including landscape evolution, ecology, land-use management, and civil engineering. However, sediment transport is extremely challenging to accurately monitor and predict.  Growing support for continuous, low-cost and non-invasive measurement techniques has led to promising research into monitoring bedload transport via the elastic waves generated by sediment as it impacts the river bed during transport.  However, to date studies of seismic waves sourced from rivers have lacked independent, quantitative constraints on coarse sediment transport.   In this study we deployed a network of seismometers to the Erlenbach Stream, which is a small, steep mountain stream in the Swiss Alps that has an extensive sediment transport monitoring infrastructure maintained by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL). We examined broadband (16 &ndash; 450 Hz) seismic data from the Erlenbach stream and exploited isolated flood and rain events that had no transport.  This allowed us to remove the contributions of turbulence and rainfall impacting the groud from the seismic spectra, isolating the signal of bedload transport. We then calibrated a regression for bedload transport during one storm, and used this regression with precipitation and discharge data to calculate bedload transport rates from two months of seismic spectra.  Our predicted bedload transport rates correlate well with transport rates from calibrated impact sensors embedded in the channel, although we systematically overpredict transport at low transport rates, which may reflect the greater sensitivity of the seismometers to the impacts of small particles. We find that the seismic response to rainfall is broadband, while water turbulence and sediment transport exhibit seismic power primarily in lower frequencies (&lt;100 Hz), likely due to longer attenuation path lengths.
