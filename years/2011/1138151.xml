<AbstractNarration>This award supports the development and publication of a policy report and a special edition of a peer-reviewed journal to disseminate the findings of an OECD-NSF workshop on Building a Smarter Health and Wellness Future.  The report will analyze how technological developments such as high-speed and mobile applications, sensor-based devices, and electronic health records can support new models of care to address 21st century health and wellness needs,  reflecting a vision of a patient-centered, rapidly learning healthcare system.  It will consider the challenges encountered in redesigning processes of car, the socio-technical and usability factors, access and privacy issues, the sustainability of the new models and their impacts.  The special edition will include renowned experts from the United States and Europe.  The special edition journal, which will be published online, has an international readership and is recognized for its high impact and extensive citation.  The publications provide a way to engage a broad international audience and go beyond describing current trends to focus on governance issues and policies, looking to promote the most efficient and effective roles for both the public and private sectors in sustaining health care innovation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Building a Smarter Health and Wellness Future"  This report examines the challenges facing health care systems and the strategic directions for a smarter health and wellness future, from both technological and policy viewpoints.  It looks at the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and discusses the research and policy options that could further the development of smarter health and wellness systems.  Health and wellness are an increasingly important topic of discussion in all OECD countries because of social and demographic changes, the rise in chronic diseases, and the need to improve the efficiency and quality of health-care delivery. There is broad and growing consensus that any systematic effort to address these challenges will require the intensive use of information technology to support new and "smarter" models of care.  TodayÃ†s health care is reactive, episodic and focused on disease. The new smart models of care will need to be proactive, preventive and focused on quality of life and well-being. Current health care is hospital- and doctor-centred. The new smart models will need to be patient-centred, personalised, more evidence-based and much care will be provided at home and include the broader social network.  Alongside these new models of care, a vision for a "learning health system" is taking shape, one in which "progress in science, informatics and care culture align to generate new knowledge as an ongoing, natural by-product of the care experience, and seamlessly refine and deliver best practices for continuous improvement in health and health care." Achieving this vision will require enhanced capacity to share process and analyse large streams of data from different and heterogeneous sources and a major change from traditional practices.  The report draws on the OECD workshop entitled "Building a Smarter Health and Wellness Future", which was held in Washington D.C., on 15-16 February 2011. It gives an overview of the expertsÃ† presentations and debates at this workshop, combined with additional evidence based on six authored papers (M. Rigby, T. Kuiken, B. McMahon, S.L. Normand, C. Gunter and J. Leib).  An initial document summarising main points raised at the workshop was published online in 2011 (www.oecd.org). A more scientifically detailed output has been produced as a Special Issue of the International Journal of Medical Informatics.    The report identifies a number of areas where the OECD can provide further policy insight and expertise:  Address the Big Data Challenges: the complexity of health data collection and use is growing exponentially. Conventional technology today cannot effectively manage or even capture the many health data streams and ensure that they will be turned into useful and actionable health information. For smooth data transfers, applications also require sufficient capacity, very low latency and high quality of service guarantees in order to work safely and efficiently. The new range of devices and IT platforms has to function seamlessly and adapt to multiple user needs in the health sector and partner sectors.  Foster Meaningful Innovation: An open architecture can pave the way for rapid exploration and innovation in this sector, as well as iterative improvement. Innovation, however, needs to be far more than technological innovation.  Health care responses, and means of delivering smart services, need radical organisational and social innovation given the multiplicity of Ã¦actorsÃ† with different cultures and roles. This change is vital, but must be managed sensitively and constructively.   Understand and Address the Potential New Risks: With any new technology or other innovation come new risks, and unanticipated outcomes. The challenge for system designers is to balance the inherent benefits of the new smart technologies against the potential new risks. Widely accepted privacy and security standards for personal data collection, analysis and use are needed...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
