<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate a prototype wave energy harvester using advanced materials developed in the Phase I effort.  We have developed a patented concept for wave energy harvesting using low-cost magnetostrictive alloys. This technology shows promise as a means for delivering utility-scale electric power to the grid at a price that is competitive with conventional fossil or renewable technologies. The technology will also be applicable to other proprietary energy harvesting systems that we are developing. In the Phase II project, we will design, build, optimize and demonstrate a sub-scale system in one of the largest open-air salt water wave tanks in the world. After prototype validation in Phase II, we will pursue further scale up and commercialization of the device with additional private/government funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact and commercial potential of this project address the global need for the rapid development and deployment of low-carbon, renewable electricity sources, which unquestionably ranks as one of this century's global grand challenges. Such technologies will fuel our economic growth, contribute to global environmental sustainability, and reduce our dependence on polluting and exhaustible fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. The world's oceans, with global capacity estimated to be around 2 TW, constitute a vast but untapped energy source that is particularly well-suited to address underserved and/or growing coastal populations. The World Energy Council estimates that wave energy can meet up to 6.5% of U.S. energy needs. Efforts to tap utility-scale energy from the ocean continue to be hampered by high capital costs, high maintenance costs, and low energy efficiencies. The technology developed through this project will accelerate the commercialization of a wave energy harvester with substantially lower capital and operating costs than existing alternatives, enabling a levelized cost of electricity that is competitive with conventional electric power technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Intellectual Merit:  The project was aimed at developing a novel, and potentially transformative materials-enabled solution that can reduce the cost of wave energy significantly over conventional options.  The idea was to develop and demonstrate a generator that utilizes magnetostrictive materials, which have the property that their magnetic permeability is a function of applied stress.  The project work involved (1) new materials development; (2) magnetostrictive generator modeling; (3) sub-scale generator design, construction, and testing; (4) design, construction and testing of an integrated generator assembly (i.e. a "drive-train" including a novel hydraulic amplification system); (5) wave energy harvester system concept improvements. The feasibility of a new concept for energy generation from ocean waves was demonstrated &ndash; to the best of our knowledge, this was the first project to ever study magnetostrictive materials for this application.  The basics of a new heave plate concept was developed through this project that can allow a broad class of wave energy harvesters, including our own, to achieve high levels of performance in capturing energy from ocean waves while also being very reliable under extreme wave conditions. The project has resulted in 6 patent filings which will ultimately allow this learning and knowledge to be disseminated to the industry at large.     Broader Impacts:  This project was aimed at developing technology that could lower the cost and increase the reliability of wave energy converters with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost to the point where wave energy can be a viable energy option to a number of nations around the world, including the Unites States, that have substantial coastlines.  Utility scale wave energy, which is more predictable and can be located closer to major demand centers than solar or wind energy, is a significant market opportunity whose dormancy is due to the unavailability of reliable and economically viable energy conversion technologies. As such, the mitigation of these issues through projects such as ours resulting in the successful commercialization of wave energy can have far reaching impact on the United States and the world as a whole.  The World Energy Council indicates that the potential global market for wave energy is worth about $1 trillion and that wave energy could supply 6.5% of the US energy requirement.  Wave energy will provide low-cost, utility scale power to the electric grid that will directly offset expansion of fossil-fired power plants. With rapid expansion enabled by commercialization of a low cost wave energy converter, domestic ocean energy that offsets fossil fuel expansion and replacements will directly reduce US CO2 emissions by approximately 120 million metric tons per year.
