<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports the work of Professor Edward L. Clennan at the University of Wyoming.  The research will focus on the synthesis and characterization of 2nd generation dicationic light harvesting molecules.  The highly charged frameworks of the 1st generation of these unique materials were designed to improve their efficiency as photoinduced electron transfer (PET) sensitizers by inhibiting energy wasting return electron transfer.  The 2nd generation sensitizers that will be synthesized will have structural features that will improve their hydrolytic stabilities.  They will also be partnered with a series of different charge balancing counterions in order to probe the counterion effect on reaction efficiencies.  The photophysical and electrochemical characteristics of these new materials will be investigated and their abilities to increase the number of product molecules formed per photon used in several PET reactions will be determined.  The ability of these new sensitizers to increase the chain length of a prototypical electron transfer chain reaction by inhibiting the chain termination step will also be examined.  The value of these new sensitizers will also be demonstrated in several synthetically useful transformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new sensitizers will provide access to greener, more environmentally friendly, higher efficiency photoinduced electron transfer reactions. These reactions have the far-reaching impact of being able to produce new materials that are difficult or impossible to obtain using other methods.  In addition, these new sensitizers are themselves fascinating new materials that have potential uses in devices as diverse as molecular switches, field-effect transistors, organic photovoltaic devices, and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).  Finally, the students who will work on this project will obtain valuable experience in a wide range of computational and experimental tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award has resulted in the synthesis and characterization of two fundamentally different, but related, types of organic dications called pyrylogens and viologens.  Both types of dications have core structures consisting of two heteroaromatic rings.  The pyrylogens have one oxygen and one nitrogen containing ring and the viologens have two nitrogen containing rings.  In addition, many of the synthesized viologens, but not the pyrylogens, are chiral and exist as isolable mirror image isomers.  These molecules were characterized with both photochemical and electrochemical techniques because of their anticipated use as green alternatives to the use of heavy metal oxidants in photochemical electron transfer (PET) reactions.  PET reactions belong to a fundamental class of transformations that have wide-reaching implications in many areas including organic synthesis, in the study of biological systems, and in the construction of new devices such as solar cells and sensors.  In synthetic applications PET reactions allow access to new materials  that are difficult or impossible to obtain using other synthetic  methods. These PET reactions are initiated by absorption of light to generate an energetic form of the pyrylogen or viologen that function as potent electron abstractors (oxidants) from organic substrates.  The removal of an electron activate the organic substrates towards a variety of different reactions.  The pyrylogens and viologens synthesized in this work are superior to previously utilized electron transfer agents because they are designed to discriminate against energy wasting return electron transfer that regenerate the starting materials.
