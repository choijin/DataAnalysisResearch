<AbstractNarration>25th IEEE International Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS takes place May 16-20, 2011 in Anchorage (Alaska) USA. &lt;br/&gt;IPDPS is an international forum for engineers and scientists from around the world to present latest research findings in all aspects of parallel computation. In addition to technical sessions of submitted paper presentations, the meeting offers workshops, tutorials, and commercial presentations &amp; exhibits.&lt;br/&gt;IPDPS seeks to increase student participation in symposium and the field.&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to offer up to 20 NSF-sponsored student travel for a total budget of $20,000. Applications were solicited via email mailing lists, personal contacts, and the conference web site. The selection process will consider the applicant?s level of participation in IPDPS, followed by how closely the student?s research interests match areas covered by IPDPS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research and Education Activities:  With the NSF support, IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP) awarded travel support to about two dozen graduate students authors evenly split between those who either presented their research papers at the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS-11) or posters on their dissertation research at the TCPP PhD forum at Alaska.  IPDPS-11 is the flagship conference sponsored by TCPP, and is the premier such event in the area (see ipdps.org).  A few additional awards also supported US student authors to presente their papers at TCPP-sponsored conferences including ICPADS-12 in Singapore and HiPC-12 in India.  In addition, IEEE TCPP funded a dozen and half students primarily from international institutitions.  PhD Forum: There was a solid response to the 4th PhD Forum at IPDPS. The PhD Forum was launched to provide an opportunity to graduate students to present a poster describing their proposed and/or partially completed dissertation work to a broad audience of both academic and industrial researchers and practitioners in parallel and distributed processing and related overlapping areas.  The selection process involved students formally applying for the award along with endorsements of their advisers and indication of their need. The focus was to support those who otherwise would not be able to present their work. The evaluations and scoring made by program committees of IPDPS conference and workshops and that of TCPP PhD Forum were considered in making the award, in addition to ensuring diversity across ranks of students and universities.  This grant particularly allowed several underrepresented women and minorities to be awarded travel support, increasing the likelihood of their participation. Each award provided support for reimbursement of actual travel, accommodations, and registration expenses. In making these awards, the TCPP gave priority to individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend and to students presenting their own published work.     Outreach Activities:  One of the main objective of this grant was an outreach to diverse student community and connecting them with experts within academia and industry. A sizable contingent of students from international insittutions were also supported with IEEE TCPP funds, which allowed for mutual exposure of US and international students.
