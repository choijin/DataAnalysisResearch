<AbstractNarration>Towards enhancing trustworthiness of wireless integrated circuits, this project investigates the problem of hardware Trojans in the analog/RF domain. Hardware Trojans are maliciously-intended modifications to fabricated integrated circuits, making them capable of additional functionality which is unknown to the designer and user, but which can be exploited by the perpetrator after chip deployment to sabotage or incapacitate it, or to steal sensitive information. The motivation for this research is two-fold: First, partly because of design outsourcing and migration of fabrication to low-cost areas across the globe, and partly because of increased reliance on external intellectual property and design automation software, the integrated circuit supply chain is now considered far more vulnerable to such malicious modifications than ever before. Second, wireless integrated circuits constitute an indispensable part of modern electronic systems and their ability to communicate data (possibly encrypted) over public channels makes them a prime attack candidate. To address this problem, this project focuses on (i) delineating the threat and potential impact of hardware Trojans in wireless cryptographic ICs, (ii) elucidating the shortcomings of existing test methods in exposing them, (iii) developing preventive countermeasures for obfuscating the chip design and complicating the development of hardware Trojans, and (iv) devising efficient hardware Trojan detection methods based on statistical analysis and machine learning. The anticipated impact of this research lies in the attainment of a better understanding of the hardware Trojan threat and in the development of appropriate remedies, thus enabling secure deployment of wireless integrated circuits and fostering technology trustworthiness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Outcomes Report: Malicious  modifications introduced in a manufactured integrated circuit (IC),  which can be exploited by a knowledgeable adversary to cause erroneous  results, steal sensitive data, or even incapacitate a chip, constitute a  serious contemporary threat to the security and trustworthiness of  electronics. Especially for ICs used in wireless networks, which have  become an inseparable part of most electronic systems, the threat of  such hardware Trojans is quite severe. Since such ICs receive and  transmit information over public channels, an attacker does not need to  obtain physical access to their nodes, making them particularly  vulnerable to malicious attacks. Moreover, most modern wireless ICs  employ some form of encryption to protect the privacy of the information  that is communicated over a public channel.

Intellectual Merit: The key findings of this project summarized below:    Attack complexity: Minor modifications to a wireless cryptographic chip suffice to leak  secret information without violating any digital, analog, or  system-level design specifications. Hardware Trojans can easily leverage  the tolerance margins allowed for process variations to hide additional  information in a wireless transmission.   Detection difficulty: Evading  detection by traditional manufacturing test methods is trivial, as such  methods are geared towards testing known functionality. In contrast, by  hiding in the process variations margins, the impact of hardware  Trojans appears perfectly legitimate to the unsuspecting user.   Possible Solution: Despite the fact that hardware Trojans can be hidden within the process  variation margins, statistical side-channel fingerprinting methods are  very powerful in exposing their presence. The underlying reason is that  for the attacker to be able to discern the leaked data, it needs to be  systematically encoded, resulting in statistical structure which  fingerprinting methods can detect.   These  findings were corroborated through a Trojan-free and two  Trojan-infested versions of a wireless cryptographic IC, integrating an  AES core and a UWB transmitter, shown in Figure 2, 40 copies of which  were fabricated and tested. This was the first silicon demonstration of  the threat that hardware Trojans impose on wireless cryptographic ICs  and the effectiveness of side-channel fingerprinting methods in  thwarting such attacks, as further depicted in Figure 3.    Broader Impact: This  project contributed to a better understanding of the risks that  hardware Trojans impose on wireless networks and to the development of  remedies, thereby enabling secure deployment in a broad range of  applications and fostering technology trustworthiness. As part of the  educational and outreach activities of this project, one post-doctoral  research associate, and two Ph.D. students were trained, all three of  whom have become faculty members in various universities (Dr. Ke Huang -  San Diego State University, Dr. Michail Maniatakos - New York  University in Abu Dhabi, Dr. Yier Jin - University of Central Florida).  The aforementioned two Ph.D. students...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
