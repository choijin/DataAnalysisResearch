<AbstractNarration>1133153&lt;br/&gt;Buma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is a promising technique that relies on pulsed optical excitation and ultrasonic detection. Exquisite in vivo images of tissue microvasculature, including individual capillaries, have been obtained with excellent contrast based on optical absorption rather than reflectance. Physiological changes can alter the wavelength dependence of optical absorption, making functional PAM (fPAM) possible with optical excitation at multiple wavelengths. fPAM has received considerable interest for oxygenation studies of tumor microvasculature and monitoring brain activity in small animal models. &lt;br/&gt;A major limitation of fPAM is imaging speed. Although single-wavelength images can be acquired quickly, multi-wavelength images require excessively long acquisition times. Therefore, conventional fPAM cannot produce functional images of fast dynamical events (e.g. blood oxygenation in a developing embryonic heart). The slow wavelength tuning of conventional pulsed lasers makes it impossible to obtain video-rate fPAM images. Promising preliminary studies suggest that high speed fPAM is possible with a multicolor optical source based on stimulated Raman scattering. The fundamental hypothesis of this proposal is that wavelength agility can revolutionize the capabilities of fPAM. The PIs propose to develop this compact source to switch wavelengths in less than 1 millisecond, representing a 1000-fold improvement in switching speed over conventional lasers. This wavelength agile source provides the breakthrough necessary to realize video-rate fPAM. They further propose to combine our high speed fPAM system with their existing optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. This combined system will provide high resolution structural and functional images of both microvasculature and surrounding tissue at video frame rates.</AbstractNarration>

A pulsed laser illuminates tissue while an ultrasonic detector receives the resulting signals. Image contrast is based on the absorption of light by tissue. Physiological conditions can affect how tissue absorbs light of different wavelengths. Therefore, PAM is a promising method to detect, diagnose, or track a variety of diseases.  PAM requires pulsed lasers with an adjustable wavelength, but such lasers are very expensive. Therefore, a low-cost wavelength-tunable pulsed laser will help broaden the applications of PAM. This project focused on a relatively simple technique, where the output from a low-cost pulsed laser is sent through an optical fiber. As the highly intense light travels through the fiber, new wavelengths are produced by an effect called stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). The fiber output contains many wavelengths, so an optical filter is used to select the desired wavelength for PAM.  2. Outcomes  Our efforts have concentrated on developing this technique for visible and near-infrared wavelength ranges. Visible wavelengths (e.g. 530 &ndash; 650 nm) are useful for imaging blood, such as tumor microvasculature. Near-infrared wavelengths (e.g. 1200 nm) are geared towards imaging lipids, such as atherosclerotic plaques.  2.1 Visible Tunable Pulsed Laser  We explored a variety of optical fibers to better understand and optimize the generation of new wavelengths by SRS. We found that three fiber properties can significantly affect the wavelength generation process. First, polarization must be maintained within the fiber to avoid "blurring" the different wavelengths. Second, fibers with a larger "core" allow higher energy laser pulses, which is important to image deeper-lying objects in tissue. Third, fibers that carry only a "single mode" produce the most number of well-defined wavelengths.  Wavelength agility refers to the ability to rapidly switch the laser wavelength. We focused on an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) to select the desired wavelength from the optical fiber in our system. In an AOTF, polychromatic light is sent through a crystal, where radio-frequency acoustic waves preferentially diffract the desired wavelength to the output port.
