In order to address the second technological issue, a study of the atomic nature of the materials is necessary. The junctions discussed earlier are achieved by replacing a small number of silicon atoms with impurity atoms in a process called doping. At CSM, we have the unique ability to measure local electronic environment through a technique known as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). EPR has the ability to tell whether or not the doping process is being carried out in these materials or not. In addition to answering the technological questions of how to create...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
