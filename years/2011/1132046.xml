For 40 years, SOSP has been the premier forum for innovative research in operating systems. SOSP 2011 brought together 540 of the leading researchers and luminaries in the field, featuring the best and brightest of the Ph.D. candidates in computer systems. Twenty-eight papers were presented at this single-track conference.  In addition to covering traditional topics as the performance, functionality, and security of kernels, file systems, and networks, this year's conference placed increasing attention on such emerging topics as key-value stores, virtualization, OS architecture, debugging at scale, geo-replication, and large-scale practical systems deployments.  Two award papers were recommended for publication in ACM Transactions on Computer Systems.  In addition, there was a works-in-progress session, a poster session with 29 posters, and a Diversity luncheon.  Prior to the main conference, four concurrent workshops were held on different topics.     The scholarship committee was able to use NSF funds to provide full travel support to 13 graduate students from US universities. All told, accounting for corporate and government sponsorships, SOSP was able to provide full travel support to 71 students worldwide, including 14 female students.
