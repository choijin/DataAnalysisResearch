<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the size of electronic structures continues to decrease, the classical view of electron motion transforms into a fully quantum picture based on interacting electron states and wavefunctions. To understand this quantum picture, we need to visualize where electrons are and understand how they move.  A liquid-He cooled scanning probe microscope (SPM) is used to extract both the energy and the wavefuction of individual electron states inside a semiconductor nanostructure, using Coulomb blockade spectroscopy.  The sample is a long, thin InAs quantum dot in an InAs/InP nanowire, which contains a row of electrons that form a one-dimensional electron gas.  The wavefunction can be imaged by locally denting the wavefunction with the SPM tip, which acts as a moveable gate, and recording the resulting change in energy of the quantum state as the tip is moved along the dot.  The group plans to investigate the predicted transition from a Wigner crystal to a Luttinger liquid as the number of electrons is increased. Research and education will be integrated through the training of graduate students, and through summer research experiences for undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the size of electronic devices decreases, quantum mechanics becomes increasingly important.  Our classical view of electron motion transforms into a quantum picture based on interacting electron states and wavefunctions.  A technique is being developed to measure the energy of individual electron states and map their wavefunctions using a cooled scanning probe microscope (SPM).  A row of electrons is held inside a long quantum dot formed in an InAs/InP nanowire - the nanowire is so narrow that the electrons must line up, one after the other.  The energy of a single electron state is measured using Coulomb blockade spectroscopy - current can flow through the dot only when the energy required to add or remove an electron drops to zero.  The wavefunction is mapped by denting the wavefunction with the charged SPM tip, and measuring the change in energy of the quantum state as the tip is moved along the dot.  In this way, the SPM can visualize the quantum picture in order to develop new types of quantum devices from nanostructures. Research and education will be integrated through the training of graduate students, and through summer research experiences for undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit - Graphene is a remarkable new material that is only one atom thick.  Remarkably, one can peel an atomic layer of graphene from a graphite crystal with a piece of sticky tape.  Despite being so thin, graphene conducts electricity well, and it is extremely strong, opening the way for new types of atomics that are truly atomic in size.  In addition, electrons move through graphene in new ways - they behave as if they were massless, ultrarelativistic partcles whose motion is described by Dirac's equation.  This is what one would expect for high energy physics, but not for a sheet of carbon.  If the graphene is strained, the electrons see the strain as an effective magnaetic field, even though no magnetic field is applied.  This remarkable behavior opens the way for new types of sensors and devices.  In our research, we have developed ways to image graphene materials with atomic resolution using high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), and to cut a suspended graphene sheet into atomic scale structure by using the TEM electron beam.  Both abilities are required to make and study atomic scale electronics made from graphene.  In addition, we have developed ways to probe the pseuodmagnetic field produced by straining a suspended graphene sheet with the tip of a cooled scanning probe microscope, to see how the electrons move under these conditions.  Broader Impacts - Graphene is attractive as an electronic material, because it conducts well, despite being only one atom thick, and because it has remarkable electronic properties with massless electrons that move at a constant speed, like light.  In addition it has record strength, and is commonly available.  Conventional electronics based on silicon technology has experience tremendous growth since the 1950's and is the basis of the industry.  However the ultimate limits are being approached, and it is wise to examine new materials such as graphene that provide new capabilities and allow device size to reach the atomic scale.    Our research has developed methods to shape and image graphene devices at the atomic scale using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), and to probe the electronic properties using a cooled scanning probe microscope (SPM).  The sharp tip of the SPM is used to strain a suspended sheet of graphene and bend the orbits of electrons inside, as if they were in a magnetic field.  By exploring how electrons move in these pseudomagnetic fields, we open the way towards new types of sensors and devices.
