<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to develop an in situ incubator called PHORCYS (PHOtosynthesis, Respiration, and Carbon balance Yielding System). PHORCYS will include development of a simple, modular, low-cost PHORCYS system capable of making high-precision oxygen measurements in clear and opaque incubation chambers deployed in situ; configuration of PHORCYS for use on a drifting array in order to study upper water column primary production; configuration of PHORCYS for use with sediment traps in order to assess sinking particle respiration rates; creation of an experimental version of PHORCYS with extended capabilities that can be used for in situ amendment incubation experiments; testing different configurations on short cruises in coastal waters and on cruises of opportunity to the open ocean; comparison of PHORCYS results with those collected using other techniques; and creation of a standalone unit for education. The goal is to create a PHORCYS system that will be widely adopted by the oceanographic community and used for a variety of process studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;These instruments would be of great value to the oceanographic community since they are relatively cheap and portable and would eventually permit widespread use and worldwide intercomparisons. Beyond the training of MSc and PhD. students this activity will target the education of high school students. The PI's have a successful long term commitment to broadening ocean education (e.g. the Ocean Inquiry project) to constituents outside the community and this will be furthered in this activity. Exciting young scientist about the ocean is both a vehicle of recruitment to the field as well as a vehicle to enhance science and ocean literacy in the greater public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We developed a new analytical instrument that measures the processes of photosynthesis and respiration by plankton in the ocean.  Understanding these two processes is really important because photosynthesis consumes the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, while respiration releases it.  Thus the balance between photosynthesis and respiration by plankton determines whether the ocean soaks up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Right now, it does.  However, as carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning continues to build up in the atmosphere, we are not sure exactly how plankton in the ocean will respond in the future.  We need new ways to measure photosynthesis and respiration, and that is what our instrument does.  Our instrument, which we call PHORCYS (pronounced four-kiss) is kind of like an underwater robot that does chemical measurements that are usually done by people. That's a good thing because when people make these measurements it is expensive and slow.  We designed the PHORCYS with three principles in mind: we wanted it to be more accurate than a person, to operate on its own without much help from people, and to be affordable enough that many units could be built so that information from PHORCYS would become available to people everywhere, from students, to scientists, to statesmen.    We accomplished our goal, and now PHORCYS to go to sea and do this important work.  We are confident that academia and industry will soon see the merits of PHORCYS, and many additional units will be manufactured in teh near future.
