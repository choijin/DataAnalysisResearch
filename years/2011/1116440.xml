<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to develop robust controllers for mobile boom cranes. Such mobile cranes often operate outdoors. Therefore, it is important for the controller to be robust not only to outside disturbances caused by the terrain on which the crane is driving and possibly wind, but also to the various lighting and background clutter that exists when a crane operates outdoors. Conducting research at Kumoh National Institute of Technology will provide the student with a unique opportunity to utilize an existing system to develop and test a low-cost, robust control system. The specific objectives of this project are:&lt;br/&gt;? Evaluate the Existing Image-Processing Algorithm.&lt;br/&gt;? Develop a Robust Image-Processing Algorithm.&lt;br/&gt;? Design an Input Shaper and a Feedback Controller.&lt;br/&gt;? Experimentally Evaluate a Combined Feedback and Input-Shaping Controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conducting research at Kumoh National Institute of Technology in Gumi, Korea, will provide the graduate student with valuable experience of international research collaboration as well as access to facilities not available in the domestic institution.  The advisor has successfully collaborated with foreign colleagues and will provide appropriate guidance to the student.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
