<AbstractNarration>Proposal # 1101939&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Wideband Microwave Metamaterials&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Weldon, Ryan Adams, Kasra Daneshvar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The main objectives of the proposed research are to develop, demonstrate, and disseminate theory, design methods, and experimental results for advanced microwave metamaterial devices that demonstrate wideband negative permittivity, negative permeability, and negative refractive index. In particular, the theory and design for these new metamaterials will be developed, simulations will be performed, and prototype microwave metamaterial devices will be fabricated and tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The proposed research aims to develop and experimentally confirm the theory and design methods for novel microwave metamaterials that offer significantly wider bandwidth by using active devices. The proposed effort offers the promise of broad, fundamental, and transformational impact in metamaterial technology in microwaves, terahertz, electromagnetics, and optics that lays the foundation for novel wideband devices having negative permeability, negative permittivity, and negative refractive index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The proposed activity advances discovery in the areas of metamaterial phenomena and integrates these discoveries with significant teaching, training and learning activities. In particular, we plan to work with K-12 students in presentations, workshops, and laboratory tours. Underrepresented K-12 students will be particularly targeted for inclusion in the educational efforts. Also, underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students will be asked to participate in the proposed research wherever possible as research assistants as well as through course topic modification, course additions, senior design projects, class projects, and summer REU opportunities. The results of the proposed research are planned for dissemination in top?tier peer?reviewed journals; intermediate results will be presented to the international community through professional conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The new science of metamaterials has seen tremendous growth ever since the first demonstrations of microwave metamaterials in 2000 and invisibility cloaks in 2006, but the fundamental components comprising metamaterials are typically constrained to operate over narrow frequency bands.   This project has made significant contributions to increasing the bandwidth of metamaterials through the development of novel theoretical approaches, simulation results, patent-pending inventions, and experimental prototypes.  The most significant contribution of the project is the discovery and invention of new digital non-Foster circuits with the potential to not only increase the bandwidth of metamaterials, but to enable advances in a host of other important research problems, such as reducing antenna sizes and implementing artificial magnetic conductors.  Importantly, this new digital approach can also be applied to problems well beyond non-Foster circuits and negative capacitors, because it also provides the basis for a digital implementation of nearly any microwave or radio frequency analog circuit.  The intellectual merit of the work is that the new digital non-Foster technology offers transformational approach to resolving the challenging problem of limited bandwidth in metamaterials. Furthermore, this new digital technology also has the potential to replace an extraordinarily wide range of conventional analog circuits in applications such as cellular phones and wireless networks.  The broader impacts of the project include advances in the fields of metamaterial phenomena and digital implementation of non-Foster and other circuits.  Throughout the phases of the project, these discoveries have been integrated with significant training and educational activities, including disseminating results through numerous technical papers at conferences, conducting outreach to parents and K-12 students through and open house laboratory tours, filing of an international patent application, and supporting the education, practical training, and mentoring of diverse graduate, undergraduate, and underrepresented students engaged in the project.
