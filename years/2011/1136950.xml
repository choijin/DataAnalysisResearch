<AbstractNarration>Climate change is rapidly transforming forests over much of the globe in ways that are not anticipated by current science.  Large scale forest diebacks, apparently linked to interactions involving drought, warm winters, and other species, are becoming alarmingly frequent.  Models of biodiversity and climate have not provided guidance on if, where or when such responses will occur.  Instead models tend to provide potential numbers of extinctions, but such forecasts are not linked in any mechanistic way to the processes that could cause them.  Both modeling and field studies rely on aggregate measures of species presence or absence, or their relative abundance at regional scales. However, climate acts on individuals. Aggregating data on individual trees to the level of a whole species hides or may even change predictions of climate effects.  This study aims to link individual scale tree processes to regional species level responses by sampling and analyzing data about individuals across their entire range and corresponding range in climate conditions.  It will use data from existing research sites, plus the platform of sites that form the core of the new National Ecological Observatory Network. These data will be collectively synthesized and used to develop computer models that can help determine when and where predicting climate impacts on biodiversity is a plausible goal. The models will also reveal where surprises are likely to occur and can provide feedback to expectations of individual tree health and vulnerability to environmental changes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide the first forecasts of the vulnerability of forest biodiversity to changes in climate that are directly linked to the biological processes that are most sensitive.  The goal is to provide forecasts of the distribution, growth, reproduction and risks of mortality for tree species making up the nation's forests.  These predictions will help scientists, forest managers and policy makers anticipate the combined risks of increasing drought and longer growing seasons.  Methods and results developed during this project will be disseminated through workshops for training resource managers, as well as graduate students and postdoctoral associates at a number of universities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the 2012-2017 full grant period, the Mohan Lab quantified 15,360 tree years worth of growth and survivorship rates at four Ordway-Swisher Macrosystem plots in Floridas Coastal Plain, and 6,640 tree years at two Whitehall Forest Macrosystem plots in Georgia. This represents 22,000 tree years in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain of the southeastern U.S. This project supported the education and research experiences of one postdoctoral fellow, five graduate students, five undergraduate students, one research professional, and three research technicians. Many of these graduate students are now professors and research scientists today. A number of the undergraduate students supported by this project have since completed graduate and medical degrees. Support from this project contributed to a Mohan et al. (2014) review paper for which Mohan Lab members were co-authors, entitled: <em>Mycorrhizal fungi mediation of terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change</em>. This grant also supported efforts resulting in an Academic Press-Elsevier book published in 2019 entitled <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ecosystem Responses of Soil Warming: Microbes, Vegetation, Fauna, and Soil Biogeochemistry</span> with seventy-four authors. This project contributed to an Organized Symposium at the Ecological Society of Americas 2016 Annual Conference: <em>Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics in Anthropocene Ecosystems</em> in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Mohan Lab members supported by this project also participated in five NSF Macrosystem Group meetings with the associated PIs for the full Proposal lead by Duke University. With this project, Mohan Lab members presented over 13 papers and posters at organized national and international scientific meetings. Doctoral student Megan Machmuller was one of four total graduate students honored for her "best poster" scientific presentation at the International Association for Ecology 2013 Annual Meeting in London, UK. This project contributed to two doctoral dissertations and two theses. Support from this project has resulted in over thirty scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals and edited book chapters. We found, for example, that the manner in which southeastern tree species often respond to variations in climate/weather depends on the local hydrology of the community in which they occur.
