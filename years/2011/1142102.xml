<AbstractNarration>The McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica are among the coldest, driest habitats on the planet. Previous research has documented the presence of surprisingly diverse microbial communities in the soils of the Dry Valleys despite these extreme conditions. However, the degree to which these organisms are active is unknown; it is possible that much of this diversity reflects microbes that have blown into this environment that are subsequently preserved in these cold, dry conditions. This research will use modern molecular techniques to answer a fundamental question regarding these communities: which organisms are active and how do they live in such extreme conditions? The research will include manipulations to explore how changes in water, salt and carbon affect the microbial community, to address the role that these organisms play in nutrient cycling in this environment. The results of this work will provide a broader understanding of how life adapts to such extreme conditions as well as the role of dormancy in the life history of microorganisms. Results will be widely disseminated through publications as well as through presentations at national and international meetings; raw data will be made available through a high-profile web-based portal. The research will support two graduate students, two undergraduate research assistants and a postdoctoral fellow. The results will be incorporated into a webinar targeted to secondary and post-secondary educators and a complimentary hands-on class activity kit will be developed and made available to various teacher and outreach organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Early investigations of McMurdo Dry Valley (MDV) soil bacterial communities using culturing techniques yielded only a handful of unremarkable bacterial isolates, leading to the conclusion that these soils were essentially sterile and inhabited solely by exogenous organisms incapable of functioning under these conditions. However, with the application of molecular biology techniques to investigate MDV soil biodiversity, a surprising bacterial richness has been revealed.  Such a high level of microbial diversity is inconsistent with much of the eukaryotic diversity in the region.  This apparent discrepancy has led us to question how such a high level of microbial diversity could exist in the MDV.  Could this bacterial richness be essentially illusory, perhaps a relic of the aerial transport, deposition, and preservation of exogenous bacterial cells?  Because this is a microbially dominated system, knowing what fraction of the microbial diversity of the region is active and what functional role it plays is critical to understanding the ecology of the MDV.  Equipped by recent advances in molecular microbial ecology techniques including highly sensitive techniques like pyrosequencing, metatranscriptomics, and stable isotope probing, we can now directly study the active members of a community, even in a low biomass system like the MDV. The overall objective of this project was to identify active members of the Dry Valley soil microbial community and determine their ecological role.  We investigated the MDV soil bacterial community using an integrated molecular ecology approach to address three goals:  1) identify active members of the community  2) determine their metabolic functions in situ  3) develop a habitat suitability model describing the abiotic controls on bacterial activity  We performed repeated soil amendment experiments to determine how increased moisture and nutrients affect microbial diversity and function.  Soli microbial responses to alleviation of primary limitations (water and organic matter) were measured in three soil plots that were representative of the range of salinities found in Taylor Valley soils. Changes in the function and composition of microbial communities were determined in the context of changes likely to occur as climate change impacts this region.  Soil respiration and the activity of carbon-acquiring extracellular enzymes increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) with the addition of resources at the low- and moderate-salinity sites but not the high-salinity site. The bacterial community composition was altered, with an increase in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes with water and organic matter additions at the low- and moderate&shy;salinity sites and a near dominance of Firmicutes at the high-salinity site.  Results were confirmed using a technique called stable isotope probing, which allows active and inactive populations to be differentiated.  While the results from this experimental work suggest that microbial communities in this environment will undergo rapid change in response to the altered resources resulting from climate change impacts occurring in this region, we were unable to determine specifically how community function might change using these techniques.  Thus we used metatranscriptomics to further characterize the community functional response to soil amendments.  Metatranscriptomics revealed that the addition of water and organic matter appear to be stressors in this ecosystem, resulting in losses of biodiversity and function. Dry soils of the MDV may harbor greater functional diversity, as seen in the controls of this study, but the impending increases of soil moisture and organic matter due to climate change may diminish the functional capacity of these soil communities. The most significant positive responses were observed in the Bacteria, whereas negative responses were largely among the Eukaryota. Many of the transcripts under-expressed by Eukaryota are indicative of basic cellular growth, thus repressed growth accounts for the observed taxonomic decline in abundance of Eukaryota in response to amendments. Conversely, the transcripts lost by Bacteria are largely components of specialized pathways, rather than basic cellular functions.  Within the Bacteria, significant decreases in transcripts were observed among specific populations. Three phyla (Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes) dominate the few positive transcript responses, and the resulting loss of biodiversity even within Bacteria is apparent.   Given that dry soil bacterial communities of the MDV contain distinct endemic taxa relative to wetted soils, and increased water and organic matter availability decreases diversity of dry soil bacterial communities, we expect that as this region of Antarctica becomes wetter, there will likely be a loss of dry adapted endemic oligotrophic taxa and a few generalist taxa may dominate the new soil microbial community.  The project contributed to the training of three graduate students and three undergraduate students.  All sequencing data and associated metadata are available through Genbank at NCBI and MG-RAST.
