<AbstractNarration>Understanding how quickly environmental reactions take place is the goal of EarthKin, a&lt;br/&gt;geochemical database focusing on the rates of geochemical reactions. EarthKin&lt;br/&gt;scientists from University of Maine, Penn State, Columbia, and Saint Francis University&lt;br/&gt;will compile existing reaction rates into a one-stop database that will allow access to&lt;br/&gt;researchers working on a diverse range of projects ranging from removing carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently storing it beneath the ground to cleaning&lt;br/&gt;up contaminated environmental sites. When completed EarthKin will be available to&lt;br/&gt;scientists free via the web at www.earthchem.org. Not only will we compile existing&lt;br/&gt;data, but we will also encourage new researchers to become involved by uploading their&lt;br/&gt;new results into the database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in geoinformatics (the subdiscipline of developing technological&lt;br/&gt;and computation tools to facilitate information dissemination in the geosciences) have&lt;br/&gt;drastically increased access that researchers have to geological information. Many&lt;br/&gt;recent endeavors have focused on online publishing of large data sets in order to make&lt;br/&gt;data available to the wider community. EarthKin is especially interesting in that it is one&lt;br/&gt;of the first attempts to include experimental data in a web-based data management&lt;br/&gt;platform. To do this, we will need to build new tools and data structures that will allow&lt;br/&gt;the existing EarthChem platform to incorporate a new type of data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reaction kinetics describe how fast chemical processes occur. Numerous earth scientists have made measurements of reaction kinetics for the chemical processes that are shaping the environment in which we live, but those measurements have been hidden away in technical publications.  The research conducted under this award was focused on building a database called EarthKin where reaction kinetics information can be stored and shared. The volume of information that could go into such a database is monumental, so the initial work conduction from 2011 through 2012 was focused on mineral dissolution rates as well as the reactions through which bacteria can enhance mineral dissolution rates.  The resulting database is being used to develop better ways to predict reaction kinetics in environmental settings.
