<AbstractNarration>This award supports the doctoral dissertation field research of Ms. Abilgail Watrous in China. Her research seeks to answer the student?s thesis question: "How will the factors of education, income, and migration influence solid-fuel use in rural China over the next 20 years?"  The project, which is designed to advance knowledge and understanding of rural energy use in China, has three components: surveys of migrant workers to understand how migration affects energy perspectives and fuel use, adult energy-education programs, and continued documentation of rural energy use. Ms. Watrous will collaborate with Prof. Xudong Yang of Tsinghua University in Beijing and make use of innovative analytical and modeling methods (agent-based models) as well as the public surveys. &lt;br/&gt;This is a unique project that will develop important data as well as the related analytical tools to address the challenges of expanding energy use and the associated climate change. Because energy use raises several social and environmental challenges, especially at the scale of the issue encountered in China, this proposal is especially timely. An important contribution of the project is to understand better the impact of the migration of rural Chinese to cities as it relates to overall energy use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Based in a desire to better understand the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of energy use as millions of people migrate from rural China into the cities, this study sought to evaluate what are the key factors involved in how rural Chinese families and migrant workers make their energy choices for home heating and cooking. An additional research goal was to determine if education about renewable energy effects energy consumption patterns. The final output of the research was an agent-based model to predict how these factors will affect ChinaÆs energy consumption patterns over the next 25 years.  By creating, administrating and evaluating the Beijing Migrant WorkersÆ Energy Survey, analyzing the Tsinghua Rural Energy Survey data set, and incorporating these results into an agent-based model, we are able to predict solid fuel use and income levels for rural, urban, and migrant populations in China over the next 25 years.  Data from the Tsinghua rural energy survey was used to calculate the top factors impacting rural energy use and connections between education and solid fuel use, and income and solid fuel use. Data from the Beijing migrant workers survey was used to evaluate factors impacting fuel use by migrant workers, how their energy use changes when they move to the city, and connections between their education level and solid fuel use, and income and solid fuel use.

An entire curricular unit "Environmental Challenges in China: From Rural Villages to Big Cities" for elementary students based on this research was created and published on the NSF-sponsored webpage www.teachengineering.org: http://www.teachengineering.org/view_curricularunit.php?url=collection/cub_/curricular_units/cub_china/cub_china_unit.xml.
