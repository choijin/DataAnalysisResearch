<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Sarah Pabian is "From soils to songbirds: movement of calcium, aluminum, and mercury in food webs of forest ecosystems impacted by air pollution." The host institutions for this fellowship are Syracuse University, Colorado State University, and State University of New York College of Environmental Science &amp; Forestry, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Charles Driscoll, Colleen Web and Colin Beier. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air pollution, including acid rain and mercury deposition, has the potential to negatively affect entire forest ecosystems through decreased availability of calcium and increased availability of aluminum and mercury in forest soils.  These three changes in soil conditions could act synergistically to negatively affect songbird reproduction.  However, little is known about the availability of aluminum and mercury in terrestrial systems, their interactions with calcium supply, or the mechanisms of trophic transfer to songbirds.  Also, modeling these complex interactions requires advanced mathematical and analytical techniques.  This research evaluates and compares trophic pathways for calcium, aluminum, and mercury acquisition by forest songbirds using a combination of field studies and dynamical network modeling.  A better understanding of the availability and interactions among these elements permits an evaluation of the degree to which air pollution is posing threats to the health and structure of forest ecosystems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include acquiring new skills in environmental chemistry, community ecology, and mathematical modeling.  In addition, the Fellow gains skills in advising graduate students, scientific outreach, and managing multidisciplinary collaborations with scientists working at different institutions.  Broader impacts of the research include providing undergraduates with research opportunities and sharing results with scientific, policy, and public audiences.  The Fellow uses her knowledge and enthusiasm in science to work with many different organizations, including 4-H, Women in Science and Engineering, and nature centers, to stimulate science interest in a diversity of young people.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  This award allowed researchers to study the effects on air pollution on forest ecosystems, including how mercury pollution and acid rain affect nutrient and toxin availability to reproducing songbirds.  Through this research, we determined that calcium depletion, caused by acid rain, and mercury pollution are not directly impacting the eggshell quality of reproducing terrestrial songbirds.  We observed highest mercury concentrations in bird eggs collected from nest near bodies of water, indicating the potential for aquatic sources of mercury to enter the diets of terrestrial songbirds.  Egg mercury concentrations were not high enough to cause eggshell thinning.   We identified snails and millipedes as the only invertebrate groups to contain enough calcium to meet the demands of egg-laying songbirds.  Detritivores (including snails, millipedes, slugs, and earthworms) contained over 70% of the mercury and 99% of the calcium contained in invertebrates living in the leaf litter.  Detritivores play an important role in accumulating mercury and calcium from the environment and making it available to birds and other animals.   Ground-foraging birds are at highest risk of being exposed to both high levels of mercury and low levels of calcium at the end of the breeding season, when birds are primarily raising young.  Because birds are exposed to lower mercury and higher calcium levels during egg formation, eggs may not be the best indicators for risk.  We also identified environmental variable that predict mercury and calcium availability.  Mercury concentrations in invertebrates was best predicted by mercury concentrations in the soils, which, in turn, was related to soil moisture and nitrogen content.  No environmental variables predicted the calcium concentrations of invertebrates, but we found higher biomasses of detritivores in areas with more soil calcium.  Broader impacts:  The PI promoted teaching, training and learning throughout the project:   I included high school and undergraduate college students in field data collection, chemical analyses, and disseminating results to the scientific community.  Students were trained in the concepts of scientific research, developed specific field and laboratory skills, and data interpretation and presentation through research posters.  I co-taught a freshman seminar, for two years, introducing students to career opportunities in natural resources.  I was responsible for introducing students to careers in science and research, while the co-instructor represented management opportunities.  I assisted several graduate students in study design, data analysis, and grant writing.  I mentored a graduate student, with an overlapping research project, through study design, field methods, statistics, and writing.  I volunteered at a local middle school to expose children to scientific research using guppies in small behavioral studies.  The results of these research projects were made into posters and presented by the students at a Colorado State University research poster session.  I gave guest lectures at several undergraduate and graduated classes based on my research.  I gave several invited seminar talks based on my research at Colorado State University, University of Colorado-Denver, and Syracuse University.  I worked with undergraduates and a high school student to develop posters for a research symposium.  I volunteered to judge student posters at several conferences.  Underrepresented groups were included throughout this project.  I mentored several women and minorities through NSF grant applications.  Minority students participated in the class I taught and helped with field data collection and laboratory analyses.  I additionally participated in a workshop promoting women in academics.  Through this research I initiated collaborations between disciplines and institutions.  I brought together my three sponsors from three fields (statistics, environmental engineering...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
