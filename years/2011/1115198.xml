<AbstractNarration>This project will create InvertNet, an on-line virtual museum comprising &gt;50 million insect and related arthropod specimens housed at 22 Midwestern institutions, focusing on the research theme of effects of land use changes on the biota of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi River drainage basins.  These collections document 160 years of environmental change and are an invaluable and irreplaceable resource but, at present, are largely inaccessible to scientists and the general public.  Most previous efforts to capture and disseminate invertebrate collection data have focused on label data alone.  InvertNet will use advanced digitization and networking technologies to capture and display 2D and 3D images of specimens and labels, and incorporate them into a searchable database. These new techniques should reduce the cost of digitizing insect specimens substantially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By allowing users to find and view detailed images of specimens of particular species and their associated data labels, InvertNet will provide universal access to collections previously restricted to researchers.  It will include links to the popular BugGuide.net insect identification website and to other biodiversity data portals used by researchers, educators, and the general public.  This will facilitate and support many aspects of biological research and education, including species discovery and identification, pest management, ecology and biogeography.  InvertNet will serve as a model, applicable to other kinds of biological collections, for the use of efficient, computer-assisted procedures to increase the speed and accuracy of collection data capture. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The primary goal of this project was to design and build a new system to digitize insect collections throughout the midwestern U.S.  This new system would involve using a flat-bed scanner to capture images of scientifically valuable microscope slides and alcohol vials containing preserved specimens.  Specimens conserved in insect drawers in cabinets were to be digitized using a new robotic camera setup which could quickly and efficiently take photographs of insect drawers at various angles; the software would then stitch the various images together.  The lead institution (University of Illinois) was to create, build, and test this new system.  The collaborating institutions (including North Dakota State University) was to test the new process.  Significant delays occurred in the develpment process such that we were not able to fully test the new equipment.  This does not mean that the project did not have significant outcomes, or will in the future.  In preparation for the digitization process, this project allowed for (and required) much new curation of the collection.  This has been accomplished, although it is an ongoing endeavor.  New identifications were made, various parts of the collection were reorganized and curated.  Approximately 90% (about 2000-2500) of the scientifically valuable microscope slides and 20% (about 350-400) of the alcohol vials were digitized.  About 200 insect drawers were also photographed using an alternative method (camera mounted on a tripod).  These images will be made available to the scientific community and to the general public by placing them on the project's website.     Broader Impacts  Digitization of the insect collection at NDSU primarily targeted the scientific community, especially those involved in systematic research.  The information contained in these images will have a broader impact, however, in that they can be used for other research endeavors (biology, ecology, biodiversity, biogeography, etc.) by both other scientists, and even the general public.  This project also allowed our institution to purchase a scanner, cameras, and the camera robot, all of which improved our institutional infrastructure, and will be available for our use for many years to come.  Finally, this project also allowed for the training of three students, one each working on a Ph.D., an M.S., and a B.S.  The Ph.D. and B.S. students have already graduated and are employed at another institution where they will be involved in systematic research, museum curation, and possibly digitization projects.  The M.S. student will graduate soon, and will likely end up where he can also be involved in the same activities.       Last Modified: 10/03/2017       Submitted by: David A Rider]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
