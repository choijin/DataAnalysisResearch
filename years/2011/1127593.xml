<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for a doctoral dissertation research into academic misconduct of science researchers. Academic misconduct among students has been the focus of a tremendous amount of literature for a number of decades, unlike academic misconduct among faculty, which has received much less empirical attention. A few studies have examined organizational effects on misconduct, including education and mentoring in graduate school. This research will contribute to the literature by empirically examining the possible effects of rational and moral judgments on faculty research misconduct, with a focus on the social sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the proposed study is to explore the application of a particular theory of human behavior, Rational Choice Theory, to the phenomenon of misconduct in research. This will be done in the context of a moral decision-making framework. In one influential model for moral decision-making, four factors are involved: Moral awareness/sensitivity, moral judgment/reasoning, moral intent (the balancing of moral with other pertinent issues to form an intent to act in one fashion or another), and moral behavior. The relationship between these factors and rational choice measures of the perceived likelihood of detection and sanctions will be explored using scenarios of common research situations involving clear or ambiguous misconduct. Participants will rate the likelihood they themselves would take the action described in the scenario while also rating the moral and rational choice features of the situation. Statistical methods will be used to predict the intent to engage in misconduct in light of these moral and rational choice assessments, and other explanatory factors such as past exposure to misconduct and perceived procedural justice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has significant implications for academic training, scientific and scholarship practices, and public policy. In particular, it may influence the way that research misconduct is perceived and addressed in public and private academic institutions. To the extent that moral and/or rational choice factors are at work, new policies may be developed in institutions that address the system of rewards for faculty in addition to advancing greater attention to moral sensitivity and intent. Broad dissemination of the results in scholarly venues likely will stimulate further discussion of these important issues as well as additional empirical work in this area, and thereby eventually contribute to a reduction in the problem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this study was to explore the application of Rational Choice Theory as a possible causal explanation for research misconduct, in the context of the Rest, et.al., four-component moral decision-making framework of moral awareness/sensitivity, moral judgment/reasoning, moral intent or motivation, and moral action/behavior/character.   A national survey was conducted of 2,070 faculty members in sociology and psychology departments from a random sample of 40 research-intensive universities, which resulted in 581 completed surveys for analysis.  The relationship between moral assessments and rational choice measures of the perceived likelihood of detection and sanctions was explored using scenarios involving clear or ambiguous research misconduct.  Participants rated the likelihood they themselves would take the action described in the scenario under the same circumstances while also rating the moral and rational choice features of the situation.  Results showed that the perceived likelihood of the most serious misconduct (Fabrication, Falsification, and Plagiarism) generally was very low (e.g., 3.5% for a scenario involving fabrication of data), and the likelihood of faculty engaging in Questionable Research Practices was quite variable (the highest being 39.1% for a scenario that involved awarding authorship status for little effort).  Respondents reported a high likelihood of feeling shame and embarrassment if they were caught doing the most serious actions described (e.g., 91% on average for the fabricated data scenario).  In addition, preliminary regression analysis tested the effect of moral and rational choice assessments on the probability of engaging in misconduct.  Results showed statistically significant effects for moral judgment as well as potential shame and embarrassment on reducing misconduct, but not for likelihood of detection or university sanctions.  These exploratory results could have important implications for regulatory policy and scientific misconduct prevention and education efforts in research institutions.
