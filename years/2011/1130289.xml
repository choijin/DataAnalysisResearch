<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate the effects of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) using advanced finite element (FE) modeling techniques.  This study will focus on the posterior fossa region of the brain (brainstem, cerebellum, great vein of Galen and other vasculature).  Previous studies and recent animal model experiments indicate that this important region of the brain sustains damage in bTBI cases.  Further, such injuries are consistent with symptoms reported by subjects.  An anatomically correct, biomechanically-based, 3-dimensional FE head model will be produced.  A detailed FE submodel of the brainstem and veins will be created, which uses the stress/strain distribution from the global head model as the boundary conditions on the separate assembly model. The effects of blast strength and direction will also be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is the direct result of the convergence of several important needs in medicine, engineering, education, industry, and the military.  If successful, the research benefits will be broad and influence several areas.  Early diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury is critical for long term treatment success and even survival.  Both can be aided by developing treatment modalities and dose/response relationships that complement the precise injury mechanisms.  The work will lay the ground work for the development of better protective equipment for bomb squads, industrial firefighters, and soldiers.  For example, head models can be augmented with models of protective equipment or vehicles.  Other injury mechanisms (e.g. impacts, flying shrapnel) could also be incorporated into the models.  Making these models available in the public domain will be a considerable contribution to the scientific and engineering community.  Students and faculty will interact across traditional disciplines, a synergy highly beneficial. The research materials and procedures resulting from this project will be adapted for classroom use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nature and Goals:  In recent years, blast-induced traumatic brain injury has become a major concern in both military personnel and civilians in war-ravaged communities around the World.  Although many studies have investigated the subject of impact-induced traumatic brain injury, such as those induced by contact sports and automobile accidents, limited studies have examined the fundamentally different traumatic brain injury induced by blast waves.  Unlike the case of impact-induced traumatic brain injury, where a direct collision between the skull and a solid object prompts the injury, blast-induced traumatic brain injury is an outcome of the interaction between the skull and a high pressure blast wave propagating from the detonation site faster than the speed of sound.  Therefore, the uniqueness of the blast-induced traumatic brain injury inhibits the development of a simple correlation from the results of the thoroughly studied impact-induced traumatic brain injury.  Hence, the goals of this project were to 1) Develop Anatomically correct Finite Element computer models of the human head, incorporating state of the art material models. 2)  Simulate the head-blast wave interactions for a range of blast strengths and propagation directions utilizing Finite Element computer codes. 3) Use results of whole head simulations to develop further refined Finite Element models for the brain stem and veins.  4)  Develop mechanical properties of the human bridging vein to be used in Finite Element models.     Results and Outcome:   Utilizing the results from Magnetic Resonance Imaging, an anatomically correct solid computer model of the head was developed.   The head model is segmented into 5 geometric parts, consisting of the Scalp, Skull, Cerebrospinal Fluid, Nasal Cavity and Brain.  Each of the 5 parts is discretized into a high quality mesh, which is required for solving the numerical Finite Element computations.  In addition to high quality meshing of the segments, appropriate material models assigned to each of the 5 brain segments.  Linear equations of state are assigned to the Scalp, Nasal Cavity, and Brain, while a Shock equation of state is used for the Skull and Cerebrospinal Fluid.  The above described Finite Element head model was numerically validated using previous experimental studies by Nahum, et al., 1977 and is available for download (http://d-scholarship-dev-3.library.pitt.edu/21654/).  Using the validated Finite Element head model, pressure wave propagation and shear stress distributions were found throughout the head as well as the relative skull-brain motion.  Pressure patterns and relative skull-brain motion confirmed that there is indeed a fundamental difference between impact-induced traumatic brain injury and blast-induced traumatic brain injury mechanisms.  While impact induced traumatic brain injuries result from the relative skull-brain motion, there is found to be negligible relative skull-brain motion in the blast simulation.  Furthermore, from the results we conclude the most likely locations for blast-induced traumatic injury include the brainstem and the blast-proximal portion of the brain.  On the contrary, the most likely location for injury in impact-induced traumatic brain injury is the side opposite to impact location.  Through various simulations, an injury threshold was developed for a given combination of blast strength and blast propagation direction.  Another accomplishment of the current project was the development of an injury threshold of blast-induced subdural hemorrhage using a refined Finite Element model of the human bridging vein.  Incorporated into the Finite Element model were the experimentally determined mechanical properties of the bridging vein.      Use of Project Outcomes:  The results from the above research project can be used in the advancement of medicine, in areas such as diagnosis, assessment and treatment of blast-induced traumatic brain injuries.
