<AbstractNarration>This award will fund a combined observational and theoretical study of luminous blue variables, which are massive stars experiencing strong mass loss and evolving to be red supergiants.  They are widely believed to the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae, but many of these may not explode if the mass lost during their lifetimes is high enough.  This team will conduct long-term observations of these variables in several nearby galaxies, in order to get an improved census of these objects, elucidate the mechanisms that may be responsible for giant eruptions, and to better understand the mechanism of mass loss and how stars evolve as they experience episodic (rather than steady) mass loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern supernova surveys are finding a number objects in nearby galaxies which are not true supernovae, the "supernova impostors," which may be objects like eta Carinae that shed 10-20 times the mass of our Sun in a few years.  The final stages of these most massive stars are important for a valid picture of stellar astrophysics and they are increasingly significant in cosmology. They are the likely progenitors of Gamma Ray Bursters used as cosmological probes, and many of the first stars in the universe are thought to have been very massive.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Supernovae impostors are little understood eruptions by massive stars that mimic the explosive event of the supernova without destroying the star.  We donÃ†t know the physics behind these events, the kinds of stars that produce them or how they are related to core collapse supernovae of massive stars.  This project was initiated to help increase the quality and quantity of data we have on these events.    In the first part we initiated a program to monitor the activity of massive stars that have been identified in two nearby galaxies: the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and Triangulum Galaxy (M33). We hope that monitoring these stars provides a useful baseline of information if any of them begin to exhibit supernova impostor activity.  This program will be continued beyond the end of the grant.   The second part of the project was to get high quality observations of the light-curves (changing brightness) of supernova impostors during and after their outbursts.  Weather and other challenges make it difficult to get good constant coverage with a single telescope.  So we developed a method and network to crowd-source many of the observations to skilled non-professionals.  The participants sent us calibrated images taken with their own telescopes in exchange for mentorship to improve their skills and active participation in project as citizen scientists.  This part of the effort produced good light curves for four bright supernovae and supernova impostors:  SN 2009ip, SN 2014G, ASASSN-14il, and ASASSN-15lf.  We plan to continue this work with non-professionals as well as find ways to give other professionals the tools to facilitate other crowd-sourcing efforts for astronomical observations.  The grant also contributed directly to the education and training of two undergraduate students who were paid to do work on the project.
