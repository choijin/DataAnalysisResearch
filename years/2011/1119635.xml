<AbstractNarration>This project will study how the Grand Canyon region is responding to surface uplift driven by upper mantle convection. The goal of the research is to use the continental-scale Colorado River system as a well exposed field laboratory and sensitive gauge of the complex interplay between the processes of faulting, volcanism, uplift, river dynamics, and climatic processes that, collectively, are shaping the landscape of this classic region. The methods and approaches to be used include a variety of dating techniques (Ar-Ar dating of basalt flows, U-series dating of travertine cements, cosmogenic ages of gravels, OSL dates on young terraces) that will be used to determine terrace gravel ages. These deposits preserve past landscape positions and hence can be used to gauge uplift, incision rates, and changing landscapes. The aim is to test the idea that mantle flow and buoyancy modification are driving surface uplift and long wavelength surface deformation of the Colorado Plateau by determining whether or not there are spatial patterns in incision rate that mimic mantle anomalies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will test the idea that the rugged topography of the Grand Canyon and western United States are being re-shaped today by upper mantle convection. This movement of mass and fluid is taking place hundreds of kilometers below the surface and involves upwelling domains of hot buoyant asthenosphere that consists of flowing rock, partial melt, and fluid, as well as downwelling domains of cold dense North American lithosphere. The upwellings appear to be responsible for 400-1000 meters of surface uplift that has taken place in the Colorado Plateau region in the last 10 million years. This amounts to 25-50% of the present average elevation of the region. This uplift is still ongoing. The research plan involves integration of teaching with research and mentorship of numerous graduate and undergraduate students, including Hispanic and Native American students from the southwestern U.S.. The project will lead to improved written and web materials on Colorado Plateau uplift and canyon carving that will be linked to geoscience interpretation for Plateau Parks via the National Park Service web pages and the newly opened Trail of Time Geoscience Education Exhibition at Grand Canyon National Park.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Project Outcomes Report  How do mountainous regions such as the Colorado Rockies and the Colorado Plateau form?  Plate collisions commonly form mountains as in the case of the Himalayan Mountains.  However, the Colorado Rockies and Plateau are far removed from active plate boundaries and in this sense, these mountainous regions are enigmatic. At one time, these areas were located at sea level.  Today, however, the average elevations of these areas are 1.9-2.3 km above sea level. How did this dramatic change in elevation occur?     This project tested this question by studying patterns of river incision in the Colorado River system. Specifically, mapping and age dating of ancient river sediments in the upper Colorado, upper Green, and Yampa Rivers were used to establish 1) the timing of when these rivers began to cut deep canyons (e.g., Glenwood Canyon, Lodore Canyon) in their watersheds, and 2) how fast did this downcutting occur.  What we found is that rates of downcutting have been surprisingly constant for different areas of the Colorado River system despite the long periods of time involved (the last 10 million years). This is surprising because we expected to see faster rates of river incision during the Ice Ages, which have occurred over the past 2 to 3 million years.  The other major discovery is that rates of river downcutting are significantly faster in the upper Colorado River basin in Colorado compared to the upper Green River basin in Wyoming.  This is a particularly important result because it is consistent with recent discoveries regarding the properties of rocks that underlie the Rocky Mountain and Colorado Plateau regions.  Newly completed surveys of the properties of deep (mantle) rocks beneath the Colorado Rockies show that these mountainous regions are underlain by what is probably warm, buoyant rock that is slowly rising.  This slow rise of deeply buried rocks beneath the surface of the Earth may be the driving force behind why rivers such as the Colorado are cutting deep canyons in the Rockies such as Gore, Glenwood, and Westwater Canyons.      Another way of thinking about this concept is that the rivers of the Rockies are like knives and the rocks through which the rivers are cutting are like layers of a cake.  We think that the knife (i.e. the rivers) are static but that the cake layers (i.e., the rocks) are rising up through the knife, which leads to the cutting of the layers and the formation of river canyons.  In summary, the results of this project suggest that the mountains regions such as the Rocky Mountains and Colorado Plateau may be rising due to upwelling of warm buoyant rocks located deep below the EarthÆs surface, and that plate collisions are not the only way to form mountain ranges.
