<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant will investigate how to implement writing techniques that enable engineering students to develop broad technical problem-solving skills.  Such problem solving is a key outcome of engineering degree programs.  The techniques developed are expected to be easily incorporated into existing engineering degree programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be in the area of student development, and creation of the engineering workforce.  Student participants are expected to develop both as engineers and future researchers.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to develop a practical writing-to-learn exercise that encourages students to think about, articulate and reflect upon their confusion about concepts taught in an engineering statics class. We anticipated that this metacognitive (self-reflective) activity would result in students having an improved understanding of course material, as manifested by improved course performance. Secondarily, it is was our goal that students perceive the writing-to-learn exercise to be useful, and that it has the potential to affect their approach to problem-solving beyond the semester that the writing intervention is implemented.
