<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop innovative computational methods for solving random eigenvalue problems commonly encountered in modeling and simulation of high-dimensional stochastic dynamic systems. The proposed effort will involve: (1) a new polynomial dimensional decomposition (PDD) method for predicting the statistical moments and probability distributions of random eigensolutions; (2) a solid theoretical basis by quantifying approximation errors from the PDD and polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) methods; and (3) new multiplicative PDD, hybridization, and respective error analyses. The new PDD method will challenge or disrupt existing computational thinking, specifically by addressing highly nonlinear input-output transformations, large number of random variables, and arbitrarily large uncertainty of random input. Therefore, a long-standing stochastic problem associated with the curse of dimensionality will be alleviated to some degree, with positive ramifications in engineering and sciences. Deliverables include development of fast and reliable stochastic methods and algorithms, generation of modeling and simulation tools, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and hands-on experience for K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will be applicable to a broad range of industrial applications, such as civil, automotive, and aerospace infrastructure. Potential applications include analysis and design of civil structures; noise-vibration-harshness and crashworthiness of ground vehicle systems; and fatigue durability of aerospace structures. Beyond engineering, potential applications include nuclear physics, number theory, computational biology, among others, where random eigenvalue analysis plays a vital role. The transfer of knowledge created by this award will take place through organization of dynamics-related symposia, peer-reviewed journal publications, presentations at major conferences, software development, and student education.  Educational goals include graduate student recruitment from an underrepresented minority group, implementation of software tools to upgrade existing courses at The University of Iowa, and active participation in Iowa?s Project Lead the Way program for middle- and high-school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mathematical modeling and simulation to calculate the natural frequencies and modes shapes of complex dynamic systems often lead to large-scale eigenvalue problems.  Generally, the coefficient matrices or operators in these eigenvalue problems are not precisely known because of insufficient information, limited understanding of underlying phenomena, and inherent randomness.  Eigenvalue problems defined for such random matrices or operators are referred to as random eigenvalue problems.  Under this National Science Foundation award, the principal investigator and his students conducted fundamental research on modeling and simulation of complex dynamic systems in the presence of uncertainty; in other words, developing accurate and efficient methods to predict the natural frequencies and modes shapes in which the nature of the dynamic system behavior is uncertain.  The research involved new theoretical developments and integration of novel computational methods from engineering, mathematics, and statistics.  New computer models were created to study two principal classes of dynamic response characteristics: (1) the means and variances of natural frequencies or mode shapes, which describe the influence of the input uncertainty in mass, stiffness, and damping properties on the statistics of dynamic responses; and (2) the probability distributions of natural frequencies or mode shapes, including rare-event probabilities, which quantify the failure probability of dynamic systems. The innovative formulations of probabilistic methods, finite-element simulation, and eigenvalue analysis &ndash; the necessary ingredients of the computer models developed &ndash; have achieved not only highly accurate, but also computationally efficient solutions for complex dynamic systems.  Therefore, these new models are capable of performing industrial-scale probabilistic dynamic analysis.  The results of this research are envisioned to address a broad range of scientific issues in engineering and applied sciences.  Potential engineering applications comprise dynamic analysis of civil infrastructures; noise-vibration-harshness analysis of ground vehicle systems; and fatigue durability analysis of aerospace structures and materials, to name just a few.  Beyond engineering, potential application areas include nuclear physics, number theory, computational biology, computational finance, among others, where random eigenvalue analysis plays a vital role. Moreover, any application discipline that can be simulated using computer software or tools should benefit from this research.  Transfer of knowledge acquired under this award was accomplished through organization of computational-dynamics-related symposia, peer-reviewed journal publications, presentations at major conferences and meetings, software development, and student education.
