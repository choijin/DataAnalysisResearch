<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Scott Sieburth of the Department of Chemistry at Temple University to study a photochemical cycloaddition reaction between aromatic rings and enynes (a.k.a. vinyl acetylenes) and application of the products.  Cycloaddition reactions are among the most powerful ways of building molecules.  This new cycloaddition assembles an eight-membered ring, a medium ring that is not easily accessible, by bringing together two four-atom components.  The [4+4] class of cycloadditions is itself unusual and use of enynes for this reaction is unprecedented.  The product contains a strained and highly reactive allene that undergoes subsequent chemistry, including rearrangements and additional cycloaddition reactions.  Overall, this photoreaction takes simple components and builds complex products in a single step that are rich in functional groups and stereochemistry.  With a goal of building useful new chemical structures rapidly, trapping of the reactive allene functional group will be studied, both inter- and intramolecularly.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work could lead to new chemical structures with useful properties, structures that are not accessible using standard synthetic transformations.  Moreover, the use of light to induce reactions, instead of chemical reagents, is an intrinsically "green" process.  Successful development of this chemistry will have a broad impact on research that relies on novel molecules and their properties, such as the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.  In addition, this project will provide training in both modern organic synthesis and photochemistry for students, from undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Formation of carbon-carbon bonds using light is environmentally friendly and it allows access to molecules that would be otherwise extremely difficult to prepare.  The chemistry investigated under this grant uses light to combine two readily available components, an aromatic ring (1) and an acetylene-containing unit (an enyne 2).  The resulting products like 3 are far more complex and highly reactive, with a bent allene.  Our investigations have demonstrated this reaction for the first time (an enyne [4+4] photocycloaddition) and discovered ways to catch these reactive species and direct them to the production of desired products in high yield.  The reaction brings together two four-carbon units and creates an eight-membered ring (3), which is one of the most difficult rings sizes to prepare.  As part of this investigation we have demonstrated that the reactive intermediate can be stabilized by protecting it with bulky silicon groups ((5), which has allowed us to characterize the allene and investigate its reactivity.  Replacing the enyne with a benzene ring (6) has produced a series of new, more stable (but still very strained and reactive) products 7, formed in a [4+4] cycloaddition process.  This part of the project was sufficiently straightforward that undergraduates could not only participate, they could work independently and break new and exciting ground in the area.  Most recently, they have discovered a potent solvent effect for this pyridone-benzene cycloaddition, an effect that breaks the paradigm of "no solvent effect" for the pyridone photochemistry.  Along with the [4+4] products, a new higher-order "meta" cycloaddition process was discovered, a reaction that converts two rings (6) to five rings and six stereocenters (8)!
