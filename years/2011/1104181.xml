<AbstractNarration>The Center for Aviation and Automotive Technology Education Using Virtual E-School is a resource that develops and disseminates E-learning modules with virtual reality and similar high-level visualization/simulation tools for automotive and aviation technician education.  The aviation and automotive industries in South Carolina and elsewhere, as well as appropriate ATE Centers, are providing input and validation of the content for the modules being developed and extensively tested.  The modules also contain pedagogical strategies and assessments.  The primary target audience is the two year college faculty and students in associate degree programs.  The virtual teaching environment is also being used to interest high school students and to recruit students from populations underrepresented in technical careers.  Since the need for technicians in the industries greatly exceeds the number that can be educated in the two year colleges, the modules provide other venues for learning and recruiting.  The Center also provides an online student internship and placement service.  The efficacy of high definition modules is compared to that of lower quality that can be viewed on laptops.</AbstractNarration>

Additionally, CA2VES currently partners and collaborates with 5 NSF ATE Centers--AMTEC, CAAT, CARCAM, FLATE, and SpaceTEC; all 16 SC 2-year colleges and their high school partners; and the SC automotive and aviation industry. The CA2VES e-learning modules and curriculum developed to date support a wide range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) interests and technician education career pathways.  Accomplishments under the current NSF funding include: (1) an innovative, high-impact personalized learning "Virtual E-School" curriculum model for educating 2-year college students and industry employees in aviation and automotive manufacturing technology; (2) an increased pool of highly-skilled, work-ready technicians for immediate transition into industry; (3) development of targeted recruiting resources to attract and retain underrepresented groups to A2 technology; (4) development of the Virtual E-School as a standard pedagogical tool; and (5) creation of a national collaborative venture among universities, 2-year colleges, high schools, and key industries.  Accomplishments to date:  Digital Learning Tools (DLTs) to Expand Technician Education Capacity at 2-year Colleges  Development of over 30 virtual reality tools and simulations which have been integrated into automotive, aviation, and other general technician education curricula. Development of over 50 advanced e-learning modules for technician education providing innovative curriculum  Evaluation of pedagogical effectiveness through a pilot study (Spring 2012), analysis of results of pilot sites (5 in 2013), and a large-scale study (ongoing) to determine impact and educational effectiveness of DLTs.   Increasing Access and Supporting Recruitment for Students in Technician Education Programs  Development and distribution of DLTs, lessons, and materials to expose students and build interest in STEM fields, technician education, and 2-year college programs: Utilization of industry partnerships to develop and implement program-specific recruitment activities   Broad Dissemination of Advanced Technology Digital Learning Tools  Development of a state-of-the-art dissemination portal, www.educateworkforce.com, offers basic and advanced DLTs focusing on the needs of technician education programs.   Utilization of ATE Center relationships (AMTEC, CARCAM, FLATE and SCATE) to introduce and distribute DLTs to 2-year colleges and technician education programs throughout the Southeast.  Established pilot sites throughout SC to test and validate new curriculum (pilots ran at 1 high school career center and 25% of SCÆs 2-year colleges).  Continuous implementation and professional development support for CA2VES curriculum model and templates in 100% of SC 2-year colleges.   Ongoing research studies in emerging technologies, VR simulations for educational and industry applications, and innovative platforms for teachi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
