<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to understand the motivations and contributions of engineers who return from industry positions to pursue Ph.D. degrees.  This project hypothesizes that such students can play key roles in building bridges between academia and industry, and may play important roles in the innovation ecosystem.  By helping to increase understanding of this student population, the proposed research can help universities recruit, retain, and maximize the potential of such students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to impact academic policy and recruitment strategies, as well as contribute to research-based best practices.  If the project is successful, the research can have broad impact on the research community, innovation policy, as well as government programs designed to support student research.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is a well-documented need for highly skilled engineers, including those with doctoral level training, in engineering practice and research. In order to best address complex societal issues, these engineers must possess both technical proficiency and the perspectives and experience necessary to recognize important problems and develop innovative engineering solutions. To increase the number of engineers in the workforce and ensure diversity of perspectives and experiences that facilitate greater innovation and problem-solving within the field as a whole, it is critical that we consider and support multiple pathways through doctoral engineering education.  One largely overlooked pathway through engineering education is that of returners, students who pursue advanced engineering study after significant professional experience. In our project, we focused specifically on PhD-level engineering returners. We contrast returners with direct-pathway students, who pursue a PhD shortly after completing a baccalaureate, the more "typical" path through engineering education. Returning students with extensive professional experience can contribute to the intellectual and experiential diversity with engineering and are likely to bring both technical skills and distinct insight into applied engineering problems to their academic work.  While returners represent an underutilized pathway through advanced engineering study and may be particularly well poised to contribute to innovative solutions to important engineering problems, little prior research exists about returning students. Our 3-phase study consisted of:  1) a national survey characterizing the PhD experiences of returning and direct-pathway students and their decisions to pursue a PhD,  2) interviews with returning and direct-pathway students focused on students? PhD research work and how their past experiences may shape their research decisions and approaches, and  3) interviews with engineering professionals in industry and government organizations focused on workplace practices, policies, and attitudes that may shape employees? decision-making about returning for a doctorate.  Collectively, our findings provide greater insight into who returning students are, their reasons for pursuing doctoral study, motivations and thinking about their academic work, intersections between their past experience and current research, and elements of their academic and professional environments that may advance or inhibit their persistence and success in engineering PhD programs.  We found that, compared to direct-pathway students, returners recalled lower levels of confidence in their ability to successfully complete a PhD prior to enrolling. Returners also reported higher levels of perceived academic, financial, and work-life balance costs associated with pursuing a PhD These differences could have implications for returners? decisions to enroll or persist in engineering PhD programs and suggest specific areas in which universities may be able to target support for these returning students.
