<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to develop an integrated instrument package including a polarized imaging sensor capable of measuring all Stokes parameters of the optical field with high temporal and spatial resolution. This instrument package will be deployed underwater and will be programmed to automatically record measurements of the near-surface polarized optical field at regular time-steps while re-orienting over the full solid angle. These measurements, used in combination with measurements of the associated water's Inherent Optical Properties and Monte Carlo based radiative-transfer modeling, are expected to lead to enhanced understanding both of optical radiative transfer relevant to remote sensing, and also of the adaptation mechanisms employed by biological organisms, either to enhance their contrast for communication or to conceal themselves against the polarized optical background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the PIs will have developed an underwater polarimetric camera that can be deployed in variety of ocean conditions. This could lead to new discoveries in engineering, oceanography, biology, geology, and physics. The instrument itself may also lead to advancements in biomedical imaging, where polarization has shown significant promise. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will certainly appeal to a large number of groups, and is prime for educational outreach for all age groups. All three PIs are actively engaged in educational and community outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We published 21 very significant papers and book chapters with this award.  A summary of the outcomes is listed below:   The white stripes of the pyjama squid optical system may provide a bio-inspired template for low-energy, reflectance-based synthetic displays.   A numerical combination of the extended boundary condition method (EBCM) and the invariant imbedding method (IIM) (hereafter, the EBCM+IIM) was developed to compute the single-scattering properties of spheroids and cylinders.     A full-vector, adding&ndash;doubling radiative transfer model was used to investigate the influence of the polarization state on cloud property retrievals from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations.    A Mueller matrix holographic method was generalized to include arbitrary incident and scattered polarization states for particle characterizations, thus potentially offering more information about general particle characterization.   The backscattering properties of small layered plates as a model for iridophores were studied for various size parameter values with respect to the plate thickness, plate aspect ratio, number of layers, incident direction, and polarization states of the incident light.    A review was written to bring together some visual biology and optical physics in order to understand the role of polarization in navigation, communication, and identification of marine animals as well as a possible tool for remotely sensing underwater objects.   The Amsterdam discrete dipole approximation (ADDA) was used to study the effects of an inhomogeneous refractive index in the surrounding medium of a microspherical resonator on the quality and position of the whispering gallery modes (WGMs).   The optical properties of diatom chains in the ocean could be modeled based on a combination of the many-body iterative T-matrix (MBIT) method and an improved implementation of the ray-by-ray (RBR) geometric optics method.    A rigorous vectorial complex ray-tracing technique was used to get the scattering properties by a general spheroid with the geometric optics method by considering the wavefront distortion effect.     The effects of surface roughness on the single-scattering properties could be modeled using a new statistical model employing the Edwards-Wilkinson equation.   We showed that detecting the back scattering S14 Mueller matrix signal could be a promising method to monitor dinoflagellates such as Karenia brevis, the causal agent of the Florida red tide.   We showed that scattering properties of infinite scatterers can be used as a substitute for finite scatterers with large aspect ratios.    We discovered a new method to provide insight into the understanding of the extinction properties of non- spherical particles illuminated by polarized incident light.    We found that dust particle aspect ratios for single- and multiple-scattering processes could be used to obtain a better understanding of the radiance and polarization signals at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) under various dust- aerosol-loading conditions.     We found that the soft, compliant, glycosylated proteinacious spheres of the cuttlefish may provide a template for bio-inspired approaches to efficient light scattering in materials science and optical engineering.   We found that the corona and glory phenomena due to spheres and halos associated with hexagonal ice crystals are found to disappear if the incident light tends to be highly incoherent.   We formulated a new many-body iterative T-matrix method (MIBT) to calculate the scattering properties of a prolate particle (i.e., a particle with an aspect ratio larger than unity).     By making Measurements of the upwelling polarized radiance in relatively shallow waters of varying depths and benthic conditions that the detection of benthic materials as well as future studies of camouflage by benthic biota; to hide underwater successfully, animals must reflect light just as depolariz...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
