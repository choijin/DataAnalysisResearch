<AbstractNarration>Dr. Lada and her team study the dependence of circumstellar disks lifetimes on stellar mass and stellar cluster environment. This is important to understand the disk development into planetary systems. The researchers combine near-infrared FLAMINGOS spectroscopy and photometry to study the stellar populations for a sample of eight young (about 1-2 million years old) embedded clusters in the molecular clouds Perseus, Orion A, Orion B and Mon OB1 with archival mid-IR Spitzer photometry. The sample of clusters covers a range of sizes, stellar populations, stellar densities and morphologies. The spectroscopic data provide extinction, stellar spectral types, median ages, age spreads, stellar masses and distribution of stars within each cluster. The derived extinction is combined with Spitzer mid-infrared photometry to obtain the intrinsic infrared excess for the sources, which is an indicator for distinguishing sources with disks and envelopes, sources with optically thick disks, sources with optically thin anemic disks, and diskless sources. The disks lifetimes might depend on both stellar mass and cluster environment and the goals here are to assess the dependence of fraction of stars with discs on stellar mass, and to evaluate the dependence of disks fraction on cluster environments such as cluster stellar density, stellar population, morphology, and median ages. This research also provides training for graduate students and young scientists in astronomical research, and they participate in educational outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

Using low to moderate resolution spectra from the FLAMINGOS instrument, we classified low temperature young stars using established methods, and we successfully developed a method to classify medium temperature stars (spectral type A through K) within several embedded clusters.  We then identified which of these young stars had proto-planetary disks using the data from the Spitzer Telescope.

In most cases this material is lost within 2 million years.

In addition to our main goals, we also investigated the distribution of young stars and confirmed that stars form preferentially in the densest environments within star forming molecular clouds.   This award funded a total of eight scientific publications, including five publications in peer-refereed journals, one conference proceeding, one University of Florida PhD thesis and one UF undergraduate Senior Thesis. It also supported the participation of young scientists at two scientific conferences.  The broader impacts resulting from this NSF funding included providing teaching/educational outreach and improving the science education of elementary and middle school students. As part of our outreach program, we did activities with K-12 students that included arts and crafts, planetarium shows, presentations, telescope use, and experiments. We emphasized the understanding of seasons, motions of the sun and stars, comets and the night sky with elementary school students; supplemented the 6th grade physical science curriculum with activities on the evolution of stars and cosmology (origin and evolution of the universe); and invited high school students interested in astronomy to participate in workshops at the Astronomy Department.  In addition funding from this grant helped to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in astronomical research.  Specifically it funded the research and aided in the professional development of six young scientists (1 postdoctoral fellow, 1 graduate student and 4 undergraduates) including three Hispanic and three female researchers.
