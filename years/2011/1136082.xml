<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative award to advance mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) science by developing and operating advanced upper atmospheric lidar instruments.  The Consortium of Resonance and Rayleigh Lidars (CRRL) includes six universities:  the University of Colorado (CU) hosts the CRRL director and the unique CRRL Technology Center (CTC); the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in collaboration with Embry-Riddle University operates the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) in Cerro Pach√≥n, Chile; Northwest Research Associates/CoRA Division contributes to the operation of the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR) in Norway; and Utah State University (USU) in collaboration with Colorado State University (CSU) operates a sodium lidar in Utah.  The increasing number of middle and upper atmosphere observing stations around the globe, and the recent increase in data assimilation schemes for numerical models, indicates the growing movement in the community to address the middle and upper atmosphere as a global system requiring studies spanning a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  The Na resonance wind and temperature (Na W/T) lidar technique, central to CRRL, provides fundamental measurements of the MLT region at temporal and spatial resolutions that are difficult to achieve by other means.  As a result, Na W/T lidars have yielded fundamental advances in our understanding of MLT dynamics, thermal structure, chemistry, and microphysics that were previously impossible.  They are, therefore, key instruments for achieving the community goals of whole atmosphere modeling and system science studies.  The effort will consolidate and advance middle and upper atmosphere lidar systems leading to 1) improved coordination, performance, and scientific productivity of the three Na lidars currently at low, middle, and high latitudes, 2) more rapid and more efficient advances in lidar technology developments, implementations, and transfers, 3) active education and training, guest investigator, and outreach programs to educate future researchers and broaden the lidar user base in the upper atmosphere community, and 4) a coordinated vision and plan for the upper atmosphere lidar community.  The expanded measurement capabilities and community involvement anticipated within RRL, especially the ability of the Na lidars to measure both temperature and winds day and night, and the ability of the lidars to support and enhance correlative instrumentation at key sites, will ensure the maximum scientific benefit and the broadest possible applications of these systems.  Finally, CTC technology developments will strive to ensure the most efficient and comprehensive utilization of advancing technologies to the benefit of lidar research within and outside of CRRL.  The CRRL activities will have a broad impact 1) by enhancing the infrastructure for middle and upper atmosphere research and 2) by defining a new means of educating, managing and coordinating correlative research activities.  The greatest research benefits will occur through comprehensive and coordinated studies that merge multiple data sets and diverse scientific interests which will enable the greatest scientific return on the research investment.  CTC technology developments will also benefit from, and be of benefit to, technology developments currently outside the Aeronomy community.  The anticipated CRRL education, training, and guest investigator programs will ensure a group of talented and enthusiastic users to pursue lidar developments and applications in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Temperature, wind and density, these are the fundamental quantities necessary to describe and understand the motion of the atmosphere around us.  Measuring these quantities is a real challenge at altitudes ten times higher than airliners could fly, but fortunately nature has provided a layer of sodium atoms around the earth replenished by micrometeorites entering the earth?s atmosphere.  For over 28 years narrowband Sodium Lidar Systems, such as the one developed at Colorado State University, have sent into the atmosphere pulses of laser light that interact with these sodium atoms a million billion times more strongly than it interacts with air molecules.  This strong interaction and the Doppler effect, the light equivalence of the familiar passing-train-whistle-frequency shift, opens the door for measurements of the fundamental quantities.  How the sodium atoms interact with the light depends crucially on the color or frequency of that light.  Using three different frequencies of orange laser light and measuring the amount of light returning from the atmosphere allow for the determination of the three fundamental quantities, temperature, wind and density.              The present project has had three main roles in this effort:  (a) using the basic atomic physics of the sodium atom including quantum and relativistic effects, along with the ideal gas law, to connect the individual measurements of light returning from the atmosphere to the three fundamental quantities, (b) using these measurements over 25 years to shed light on, for example, long term trends of temperatures, and (c) to maintain a database of measurements as a resource for scientists throughout the world.              Effort (a) resulted in two primary publications which are the culmination of over 25 years of experience by two faculty and numerous graduate and undergraduate students as well as post-doctoral research associates.  The first paper, "Optical processes for middle atmospheric Doppler lidars: Cabannes scattering and laser-induced resonance fluorescence", provides the theoretical foundation for sodium lidar by calculating the necessary quantities, for example, the probabilities of various fundamental processes.  The second, "Retrieving mesopause temperature and line-of-sight wind from full-diurnal-cycle Na lidar observations", provides details gained over the years in how to implement these theoretical quantities into practical measurements, including equipment limitations.  Measurements during the night when the main background light is from the moon are, of course, simpler than daytime measurements when the sunlight threatens to overwhelm the measurement.  For daytime measurements the Faraday filter technology, which removes the effects sunlight, was invented and implemented first for sodium lidar at Colorado State University and requires special treatment in the theory and the conduct of the experiments.  This is rigorously included in the two papers.               Effort (b) is characterized by the paper, "Long-term midlatitude mesopause region temperature trend deduced from quarter century (1990&ndash;2014) Na lidar observations ".  Long-term trends are notoriously difficult because of challenges in maintaining consistent equipment and experimental techniques.  Over the years lasers and detectors must be replaced.  However the stability of the sodium lidar system results from the inherent advantage of being solidly based on the atomic properties of the sodium atom with a single electron outside a closed shell, which are relatively simple, and unchanging.               Effort (c) has resulted in 657 days of data since January, 2012, from the University of Colorado, University of Illinois, Utah State University and Alomar being included in the NSF sponsored Madrigal database.  Also included is 1322 days of reanalyzed data from Colorado State University.   The Madrigal database is accessible at (http://madrigal.physics.colostate.edu/htdocs/).
