<AbstractNarration>The project aims to address student retention and graduation in STEM by providing innovative teaching technologies in introductory mathematics courses, a pre-freshman summer bridge, undergraduate research opportunities, faculty development workshops, and graduate school preparation activities in the STEM academic programs at Elizabeth City State University. This project will emphasize learning with technology, content and pedagogy for inquiry-based learning, and faculty professional development in new media and instructional technology to raise achievement of STEM majors and non-STEM majors in the algebra, pre-calculus and calculus courses. Faculty learning communities will be created to support faculty in developing problem-based learning pedagogies and use of new media and instructional technology, and techniques to integrate successful practices into effective teaching and learning for STEM students. The pre-freshman summer bridge, a STEM freshman seminar course, a special college algebra course for STEM majors, and a STEM learning community through peer-led supplemental instruction are the strategies employed to increase retention of STEM freshman. A mentoring program, a "Vikings Explorer's Academy" for sophomores, undergraduate research opportunities, and preparation workshops for graduate school are the strategies employed to address persistence and graduation rates in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes for the VESTEM Implementation Project  Objective 1:  Increase Targeted Majors by 30% over the duration of the Project. Due to a myriad of external challenges, the project did not reach the 30% increase projection for the targeted STEM majors as outlined in the original proposal.  Unlike the institution overall enrollment decline, the VESTEM program was able to either maintain or increase the percentage of students in the targeted majors. Moreover, the university discontinued the Physics program in 2013 as part of the institution?s right-sizing plan and this included the loss of several STEM faculty members. These changes not only had an impact on the enrollment of STEM Majors but also influenced the retention rates for all of the STEM majors.  Objective 2: Increase the retention rates of the targeted majors by 25% each year of the Project. While ECSU experienced an overall decline of students, VESTEM experienced retention success in different majors through the use of several discipline-based interventions. Overall each of the major disciplines observed a slight increase in the students? overall GPA. Examples of successful interventions include the following:  a. Redesign/ develop a college course for STEM majors: The mathematics department revised several of the general education introductory mathematics courses with the inclusion of a new mathematics course specifically targeted to STEM majors. This new course includes critical thinking skills and problem solving techniques that are essential for STEM majors. Preliminary findings show an increase in the students? overall academic performance as evidenced in the overall GPA?s of the targeted HBCU-UP majors.  b. To improve the overall quality of instructional programs:  The university installed SMART board technology in several of the STEM classrooms. To complement the classroom instruction, Phase I supported the development of a suite of rooms to support tutorial activities for all of the STEM majors. Several rooms were modified to enhance and support individual/group student sessions that utilized SMART KAPP IQ technology. This modification allowed students to save tutorial notes to their Smartphones or other electronic devices. Further, students were able to share information with other classmates.  c. The project provided tutoring for all STEM majors to enhance retention. As a result of the positive findings, the mathematics and computer science faculty now devote some of their office hours in the tutorial labs. All STEM departments recently adopted a similar plan to assist with student retention by providing tutorial assistance for the students. Because of the success of this intervention, the university launched a partnership with the Education Advisory Board of Washington, D.C. to secure Electronic mentoring software (E4U) to further enhance retention efforts.  d.Viking Explorer Academy exposed STEM majors to a Career Entry Seminar class that provided students with critical thinking strategies, scientific writing and research methodology to include data analysis and basic research techniques.  Through the project, students gained a stronger understanding of basic concepts required for laboratory research that is often inadequate at addressing the student?s utilization of techniques required in a research laboratory environment.    Objective 3:  Increase Faculty use of technology by 75% by the end of the project.   a. Increase the effective use of technology in classroom and laboratory settings of the faculty by 75%. All   ECSU STEM faculty received training in critical thinking and the HBCU-UP targeted faculty included some "problem-based learning techniques in their course designs.  Over 50% of the STEM classrooms included in the targeted HBCU-UP disciplines have SMARTBOARD technology. The Faculty Learning community (FLC) targeted Research and Practice of Technology pedagogy with a focus on developing software applications to integrate this technology for use on several SMART devices.  b. The development of an interdisciplinary Bioinformatics course was introduced as a way to encourage faculty from several STEM departments to engage in the development of a Bioinformatics course, the HBCU-UP project, as indicated in the proposal, implemented a Bioinformatics research driven special topics course for selected students in the summers of 2015 and 2016.  Based on both student and faculty interest, the Mathematics department has proposed a minor in Bioinformatics.  Lessons Learned: The following discussion captures the general lessons learned from the VESTEM grant.  Participants (students, faculty and project team members) were surveyed and interviewed as part of the evaluation.  Specific questions within the interviews were targeted toward the interviewee's individual experiences, although the comments in this report are an assemblage and not attributed to any one individual.  The SI component in selected STEM disciplines enhanced retention of STEM majors. The Faculty Learning Community (FLC) increased faculty engagement with technology in the classroom and Labs Redesigned curriculum in selected STEM courses (Algebra and Calculus) enhanced faculty engagement in the disciplines  Summer Bridge program activities increased student?s awareness of STEM careers and  graduate opportunities for STEM majors        Last Modified: 11/29/2017       Submitted by: Harry S Bass]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
