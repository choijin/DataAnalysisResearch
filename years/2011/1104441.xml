<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project has the scientific objective of improving understanding of detailed physical processes associated with sprites as well as their potential impact on the mesosphere and the global electrostatic field.  This will be accomplished by optical observations (images and spectra) with high spatial and temporal resolution.  Summer field campaigns will be conducted on the NSF sponsored HIAPER aircraft to follow up a successful 2009 sprite observations campaign by the investigators.  The observations will be analyzed and compared with various sprite models.  Furthermore, collaboration with participants at Princeton University will involve laboratory streamer studies relevant to sprites.</AbstractNarration>
