<AbstractNarration>This project supports a collaboration between Dr. Douglas Taylor and his student, Mr. Peter Fields, in the Department of Biology at the University of Virginia, and Dr. Oscar Gaggiotti in the Laboratoire d?Ecologie Alpine at the University of Grenoble in France. This proposal will fund two long-term visits for Fields to the University of Grenoble in the Fall of 2011 and Summer of 2012. The collaboration will develop analytical and computational methods to analyze genetic data from natural populations. The proposed research leverages Gaggiotti?s expertise in population genetic analysis and software design and an unparalleled 24+ year metapopulation dataset of the angiosperm Silene latifolia. This collaboration is an exciting opportunity to refine statistical tools and ground truth population genetics methods with a long-term metapopulation dataset. The proposed research will allow for better understanding of the genetics of spatially distributed populations, or metapopulations. Additionally, the proposed research will parse out the relative roles of random and selective forces in shaping patterns of genetic diversity. Understanding evolutionary processes in metapopulations is of practical and applied importance for conservation biology, invasion biology, and for understanding potential responses to habitat fragmentation. In terms of deliverables, resulting software will be made freely available to researchers, being published under the GNU General Public License and distributed by the Free Software Foundation (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).</AbstractNarration>

This area of research uses the fact that historical processes such as change in population size, rates and pathways of migration, and natural selection, all leave distinct footprints in an organismÃ†s DNA. Modern population genetics involves an ever expanding arsenal of statistical tools that use DNA sequence data to make inferences about the evolutionary history of organisms and the genetic basis of their traits.   The research funded by this award improves and employs high throughput analytical methods in molecular population genetics, including those that identify genetic variants responsible for variation in traits (so called genome wide associations studies, or GWAS) and those that detect histories of population growth or patterns of mating (as in the quantification of the genetic mixing between Neanderthals and humans). Specifically, the funded research improved the methods of analyzing these genetic data, and similar datasets, by developing of a novel statistical genetic model and simulation framework.   The model, developed through our international collaboration with the Universit&eacute; de Grenoble, allows us to use data derived from multiple genomic regions, even if the different regions have very different evolutionary histories and rates of mutation. By utilizing this framework, we were able to show that selection in populations of the plant, Silene latifolia, will maintain higher genetic diversity in putatively functional genomic regions as compared to non-functional regions.
