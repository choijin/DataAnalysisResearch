<AbstractNarration>This award enables U.S. and Japanese researchers to collaborate on the design of smart base isolation experiments to be conducted using Japan's Earth Defense (E-Defense) shake table facility in Miki, Japan. This effort is time sensitive as Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention has recently committed the resources for these experiments, with high-level conceptual design to be completed during April through June 2011, followed with analysis and simulations completed by August 2011.  Further design and detailing will occur next fall and winter, construction in 2012, and testing in late 2012 or early 2013.  Japanese/E-Defense researchers plan to test the seismic performance of a three-to-four story, three-dimensional asymmetric reinforced concrete superstructure that incorporates different smart base isolation systems.   In addition to linear rubber bearings in the isolation layer, tests will incorporate semi-active controllable damping devices to explore their potential for improving seismic performance over a wider array of ground motions than is possible with conventional isolation (fixed systems), as well as consider other types of devices that U.S. researchers may propose.  This bilateral collaboration brings together expertise in controlled base isolation and semi-active devices, as well as experimental design and execution, so that both countries can maximize benefits from the experiments. The impetus for the experiments and the opportunities for this international collaboration were fostered in joint NEES/E-Defense planning meetings in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and is the outcome of the joint NEES/E-Defense Isolation and Control Working Group.   This award supports several U.S. researchers to travel to Japan to work directly with E-Defense researchers on the design of the smart base isolation experiments, including superstructure, isolation system strategies, instrumentation, and post-test analyses. This award also supports the necessary design analyses and simulations to make experimental design decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned E-Defense experiments of a base isolated structure with semi-active controllable damping devices are unique and provide a one-time opportunity for U.S. researchers to participate in full-scale experiments that currently cannot be conducted in the U.S.  These E-Defense experiments will enable researchers to investigate and calibrate the level of seismic performance achievable with controllable dampers by extending isolation effectiveness to a much broader array of ground motions than possible with current conventional isolation technology. The tests will be the first laboratory experiments of magnetorheological fluid dampers at this scale for base isolation.  This award will foster new research collaboration between NEES and E-Defense, as well as build new ties between U.S. and Japanese researchers.  The experimental designs and resulting data will be disseminated to the research community via an already-established NEEShub group (http://nees.org/groups/isolationcontrol).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objectives of this project were: (1) to foster collaboration between US researchers and counterparts at the Japanese "E-Defense" earthquake engineering shake table facility related to E-Defense's planned experiments of base isolation (supporting buildings on flexible bearings to "decouple" it from (most of) the damaging effects of an earthquake) augmented by semiactive "smart" controllable dampers; (2) for US researchers to study E-Defense's plans for the controllable base isolation experiments and provide input, feedback and advice for those experiments; (3) to create solid opportunities for US researchers to formulate and submit research proposals to collaborate with E-Defense through NSF's NEESR solicitation and related funding opportunities; and (4) study controllable damping strategies for base-isolated buildings and develop effective and convenient design tools for determining those strategies.  The Japanese E-Defense facility is one of a kind.  The largest shake table in the United States is roughly half the size and can move back and forth in one direction.  In contrast, the Hyogo Earthquake Engineering Research Center, commonly called E-Defense, operated by Japan's National Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED), has the largest shake table in the world and can replicate an earthquake's ground motion in all three spatial directions and three rotations.  Thus, collaborations between US researchers, and Japanese academics and E-Defense researchers provides unique opportunities for US researchers to test earthquake engineering concepts at full-scale.  This project sought to capitalize on the plans of Japan's NIED to construct and test a base-isolated building with controllable dampers embedded in the isolation layer beneath the building.  These dampers can use computer control, based on sensor measurements of building motion and internal forces, to optimally determine the best force for an isolation-layer device to exert to mitigate the damage effects of an earthquake.  This is technology that has never before been tested in full-scale.  This project enabled several US researchers from several US universities to meet with Japanese E-Defense researchers and collaborate on this pressing problem of evaluating the effectiveness of controllable damping in isolated buildings; the US researchers participated in August 2013 experiments in Japan, and have access to the ~40GB of data from those experiments for subsequent analysis.  Further, this was a small pilot project intended to provide opportunities to develop the necessary preliminary steps to enable a larger project; this indeed was accomplished in a project funded in 2013 will build on the efforts of this project.  Finally, this project provided opportunities for several doctoral students to work on advanced research, particularly aiding in the development of more effective strategies for commanding the forces of controllable dampers (reducing building motion by 30-50% relative to the previous methods used), as well as new methodologies for making that design process much less computationally intensive (reducing the computation time needed to design controllable dampers for a complex structure from a year to hours); the graduate research assistants were mentored in research techniques, developing models and computational codes, and writing results.  Solid international collaborations were developed that will last long into the future.       Last Modified: 07/16/2015       Submitted by: Erik A Johnson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
