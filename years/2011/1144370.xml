<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests   NSF support to broaden participation in the International Workshop on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing. This workshop covers all aspects of languages, compiler techniques, run-time environments, and architectures for parallel and high-performance computing.&lt;br/&gt;The organizers  asked  for financial support in the amount of $2,500 to offset the registration fees for US-based students.</AbstractNarration>
