<AbstractNarration>How various cell types migrate to the appropriate sites during embryonic development is a critical question for the field of developmental biology. The neural crest is a population of cells that is generated from the dorsal neural tube by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control cell behavior during the EMT.  The PI has developed novel technology that will allow visualization of cell behavior in the living embryo. As a result of live-cell imaging, it is now possible to analyze the cellular behavior that occurs during the EMT and more importantly to perturb the process molecularly using electroporation of expression plasmids. This approach will enable an understanding of the cell signaling events that control cellular events in the EMT.  The EMT is a remarkable example of an organized process whereby one tissue type, the epithelium, is transformed into a new tissue type,  the mesenchyme.  This process is a necessary step in the development of the vertebrate body plan, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study not only organ development, but also re-programming of cell types to allow them to take on novel roles in a highly coordinated fashion.  This EMT occurs throughout development in many species and is crucial for numerous processes. These studies are expected to elucidate the molecular basis for these cell behaviors, because for the first time they can be observed in real time.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students and graduate students from underserved minority populations will be primarily involved in doing this research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The early embryo is comprised of a single layer of epithelial cells, but the adult is a multilayered animal made up of epithelial and mesenchymal tissues that are completely reorganized. The rearrangement and movement of these tissues is known as morphogenesis. How these early epithelial tissues migrate in the embryo is almost totally unknown because until recently it was not possible to visualize the process in real time. Epithelial sheet spreading has previously been studied in tissue culture where it can be visualized at high magnification and resolution.  These in vitro studies reveal that an epithelial sheet spreads from its free margin, whereas the cells behind it are passively pulled along. This raises an interesting question: how do cell sheets spread in the embryo, especially those that must migrate a long distance over a tortuous topography where traction at the leading edge does not seem like a useful mechanism.  Research derived from this grant has made several major impacts beyond the initial aims of the grant:  1) We developed the technology to visualize embryonic epithelial sheets as they spread during embryogenesis in a living embryo.  We specifically examined the migration of the epicardium, which spreads over the heart tube to form the outer layer of the heart.  2) We discovered a completely novel means of epithelial sheet spreading.  The sheet does not spread only at its margins.  Rather every cell in the epicardium extends cell processes from its basal surface even though the cells are rigidly held together by cell-cell junctions at their apical margins. Our observations imply that many other epithelial sheets that form other tissues and organs may behave in the same way.  3) Many pathological conditions in the adult, such as fibrosis after cardiac infarction or spreading and invasion of carcinomas, appear to be caused by activation of the embryonic mechanism of epithelial cell spreading. This suggests that understanding the (now) easily accessible spreading of the epicardium, may allow us to prevent adult pathologies.  Broader impacts of this work include: 1) the participation of undergraduates in the research, and 2) the support of an underrepresented minority PhD student (Puerto Rican).
