These activities were carried out at Tuskegee University (TU, lead), Alabama A &amp; M University (AAMU), Auburn University (AU), University of Alabama (UA), University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH), and the University of South Alabama (USA). &nbsp;Five junior faculty members received program funds to kick-start their research activities, in addition to the numerous junior faculty members who worked directly in association with the thrust leads. The <strong>Nano and Biomaterials </strong>Research Thrust centered on development of new nanostructured materials with enhanced thermal, physical, mechanical, and biodegradable properties; synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials for drug delivery applications; and advanced green composites. The <strong>Biotechnology </strong>Research Thrust served as the life sciences discovery arm of the program, focused on developing and using organismal models to identify mechanisms of adaptation to natural and man-made environmental challenges that enabled development and testing of nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, such as exosomes for drug delivery and nanomaterial scaffolds for tissue regeneration. The <strong>Optics and Sensors </strong>Research Thrust was involved in research into a wide range of new spectroscopy-based tools for analysis of organic and inorganic materials. These activities included development of the necessary broadly tunable mid-infrared laser sources, development of the spectroscopy platforms that separate and analyze the spectral signatures, and nonlinear optical methods for protection of optical sensors.&nbsp; The <strong>Nanofabrication </strong>Research Thrust applied cutting-edge nanoengineering to develop molecular sensors, regimented nanomaterials and nanostructures with applications in chemical, biological, and thermo-electric devices.</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Broader Impact:&nbsp; </em></strong>RII activities involved over 70 faculty members, 15% of who were female and over 30% minority. They also involved eight post-doctoral fellow, two of who were female and one minority. We had an average of 300 participants each year, about 30% female, and about 25% minorities. Nearly 200 undergraduate and graduate students were supported through the EPSCoR program each year, during the regular funding period. Over 12,000 K-12 students, teachers and other stakeholders were impacted through year-round outreach programs.&nbsp; Researchers working for this award, about 11% of which were primarily RII supported, published in excess of thousand papers. There were 23 patents awarded leading to two commercialization. EPSCoR researchers started five startup companies. Xplendid Research, LLC (Hsia, USA), Innovative Composites Solutions Inc. (Vaidya, UAB), 525 Solutions, Inc. (Rogers, UA), PhageCon LLC (Auburn Univ.), Photonics Innovations, Inc (Mirov, UAB)</p> <p>&nbsp;There were four NSF-CAREER awardees: Dawen Li (UA), David Hilton (UAB), Elizabeth Lipke (AU), and Gregory Thomson (UA); one PECASE awardee (Virginia Davis (AU), and one faculty member who won a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring: Shaik Jeelani (TU).&nbsp; Additionally, Sergey Mirov was elected a Fellow of the Optical Society of America and the National Academy of Inventors, and Frank Bartol was appointed Program Manager for the Animal Reproduction Program by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Mahesh Hosur and Shaik Jeelani (TU) were elected as Fellow of American Society for Mechanical Engineers. <strong>Five junior level faculty members were supported through seed funding (Dawen Li, Nitin Chopra, UA; David Hilton, UAB; Allan David, AU; Haibin Ning, UAB). Some of the Education and outreach activities</strong> were Research Experience for High School Students, Research Experience for Teachers, Research Experience for Undergraduates, Teaching Enhancement Award (TEA) program, and Science and Technology Open House. These activities saw participation from all thrust areas where faculty members addressed an audience that included community leaders, K-PhD students, and elementary-through-high school teachers. Other extramurally funded programs were leveraged to carry out these activities. TU established a new Department in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE).</p> <p><strong><em>Commercialization:</em></strong> IPG Photonics Corporation, world leader in fiber laser technology, acquired Photonics Innovations, Inc. Currently, IPG Photonics, Mid-IR division operates locally at Birmingham and employs eight scientists and engineers. It was to be expanded to 35 scientists, engineers and technical specialists by 2016. The UAB Materials Processing and Applications Development (MPAD) center, a 27,000 sq. ft. industrial scale facility, includes a composites team that has ~40 active non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with industry in various aspects of materials, processing and product development.&nbsp; To date, 525 Solutions has won two Small Business and Innovation Research Phase I grants, one from the Department of Energy (to investigate methods for lignocellulosic biomass fractionation utilizing IL technology) and one from the NSF (a project focused on development of chitin/alginate biocomposites (using IL technology) for the wound care market). Based on intellectual property positions and patents related to application of landscape phage display technology to species-specific control of invasive species at AU, a new corporate entity was established (PhageCon, LLC).&nbsp; With capitalization, the new company will exploit safe technologies designed to control invasive vertebrate species.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/04/2017<br>      Modified by: &nbsp;</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1158862/1158862_10138822_1507151434909_UAB-Mirov-Laser--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1158862/1158862_10138822_1507151434909_UAB-Mirov-Laser--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cr:ZnS Mid-IR Laser for Noninvasive Glucose Monitoring"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1158862/1158862_10138822_1507151434909_UAB-Mirov-Laser--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cr:ZnS Mid-IR Laser for Noninvasive Glucose Monitoring"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">UAB graduate fellow Taylor Kesterson aligning Tunable Cr:ZnS laser for spectroscopic detection of glucose in solutions</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. Serge Mirov, University of Alabama at Birmingham</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">&nbsp;</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cr:ZnS Mid-IR Laser for Noninvasive Glucose Monitoring</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1158862/1158862_10138822_1507151698682_KT-SEM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1158862/1158862_10138822_1507151698682_KT-SEM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Carbon Nanofiber aligned in thickness direction bridging carbon layers in composites."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1158862/1158862_10138822_1507151698682_KT-SEM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Carbon Nanofiber aligned in thickness direction bridging carbon layers in composites."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SEM micrograph of 0.3wt% ZT-CFRP post-fracture delamination surface showing intact aligned CNFs.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dr. K.
