<AbstractNarration>The project aims to further develop the connection between the fast developing area of Borel equivalence relations and forcing theory within the broader context of set theory and mathematical analysis. The driving idea is contained in the book "Canonical Ramsey Theory on Polish Spaces", coauthored by the PI, to appear in 2013. Given a Borel or analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space, is it possible to find a large subset of the space on which the equivalence is as simple as possible? Here, the largeness is to be interpreted in the sense of some sigma-ideal on the space, and the simplicity in the sense of the Borel reducibility rating of complexity of equivalence relations. This question, stated in terms similar to canonical Ramsey theory, uncovers a broad landscape indexed by sigma-ideals and equivalence relations, generalizing such results as the Proemel-Voigt theorem on canonization of smooth equivalence relations on Ramsey cubes, or Blass theorem on canonization of analytic graphs on perfect sets. The overarching general theme is a correspondence between Borel equivalence relations and models of set theory. The applications include nonreducibility results with the strongest possible statements and Silver type theorems for various sigma-ideals encountered in mathematical analysis. The project offers numerous other offshoots as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project follows the general theme of classification of equivalence problems in mathematics. Most areas of mathematics start with a class of objects and a notion of similarity between them. It is often of paramount importance to that branch of mathematics to evaluate the complexity of that notion of similarity. It turns out that there is a natural rating of complexity of such similarity problems that ties together most branches of (infinitary) mathematics. In order to evaluate the complexity correctly within this rating, one needs, among other things, tools for showing that one such notion of similarity is not reducible to another. The project offers a novel way for doing that: certain notions of similarity greatly simplify when one is allowed to restrict attention to a smaller, but still significant, class of objects--while others do not. Results of this type may not have immediate practical applications, but they do help with the understanding of methodology of mathematics. As is typical for this field, they also tie the fabric of mathematics closer together, showing that concerns of one field may reduce to questions solved by another field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project set out to find a close connection between two sophisticated, and seemingly distant, areas of mathematics: the forcing theory and theory of analytic equivalence relations. Forcing was invented in the 60?s to provide machinery for proofs ascertaining that certain statements cannot be decided within the usual axiomatization of mathematics. The theory of analytic equivalence relations has developed a framework for comparing classification problems in mathematics and rating them by their intrinsic complexity; the field has experienced explosive growth in the last 20 years.     The project found a surprisingly extensive connection. It turns out that forcing arguments can be used to prove a whole class of critical results about analytic equivalence relations, the irreducibility results. In this way, the forcing expertise gained in the past 50 years can be brought to bear on the comparison of complexity of classification problems which reside right at the heart of modern mathematics. In a surprising development, somewhat exotic objects of abstract set theory such as uncountable cardinals can be used to characterize complexity of such classification problems. Over time, forcing practitioners have developed many sophisticated ways of manipulating these objects, and this manipulation is now reflected in new irreducibility results about analytic equivalence relations&mdash;an application very distant from the original goals of the forcing method.     The main results of the project are presented in two monographs authored by the principal investigator.          Last Modified: 11/22/2016       Submitted by: Jindrich Zapletal]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
