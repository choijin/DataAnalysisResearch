<AbstractNarration>This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at Texas Christian University in the summer of 2012 on the topic of Hodge theory, complex geometry, and representation theory. The principal speaker will be Professor Emeritus Phillip Griffiths from the Institute for Advanced Study. This award will support 30 participants at different stages of their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will describe recent progress on automorphic cohomology beyond the classical cases.  The material involved is at the confluence of several parts of mathematics:  Hodge theory, representation theory, and complex geometry.  The main lectures will describe new breakthroughs due to Carayol and others and will build upon the recent work of Griffiths and his collaborators on Mumford-Tate groups and domains.  The lectures will focus on two main examples and are intended to be accessible to a wide range of participants.</AbstractNarration>
