<AbstractNarration>This project centers on two questions: 1. What props up the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico ? is the surface elevation high because of extra-thick, buoyant crust underneath, or is the crust no thicker than in the surrounding areas and it is instead hotter than usual mantle sitting underneath that supports the unusually high elevations? To answer this question, we must map the crust-mantle boundary under the Rockies. Conventional methods to do this have so far left a fair amount of ambiguity regarding crustal thickness. We propose to solve this by investigating question 2: Can we use a recently developed method that has been successfully applied to shallow geophysical problems, such as hydrological imaging, to find the much deeper crust-mantle boundary?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will use already collected seismic data sets and apply new analysis techniques to provide constraints on the dynamics of a tectonically enigmatic area.  The Southern Rocky Mountain region has recorded a complex history of continental assembly, mountain building far from plate boundaries, and incipient continental rifting. Because the mechanism and timing of uplift of this large area are still under debate, the region has been the subject of intensive study with active and passive source seismic profiles and networks.  A recurrent theme from these studies is that the high surface elevations are not mirrored by a thick crustal root, however the most recent crustal thickness estimates still differ by ~10 km.  This difference has significant implications for mechanisms to explain the support of high topography in the region, specifically whether the surface elevation is isostatically balanced within the crust or support for the high elevations has to come from deeper in the Earth.  Our project is an interdisciplinary collaboration to apply techniques developed by the team for shallow high-frequency seismic applications to lithospheric scale seismology. Specifically, we plan to use diffracted seismic waves, from earthquakes and from ambient seismic noise, to image the Moho (the seismic velocity contrast that can be identified with the crust-mantle boundary). Detection of Moho diffractions is to date limited to earthquakes and explosion sources. Our approach is to perform interstation crosscorrelations of previously recorded explosions and earthquakes and of ocean-generated ambient seismic noise to simulate a signal source at each station location. This technique would allow detection of Moho diffractions and therefore Moho mapping in areas where conventional techniques are not applicable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Southern Rocky Mountain region of Colorado has recorded a complex history of continental assembly, mountain building far from tectonic plate boundaries, and partial continental rifting.  This large area contains some of the highest topography in the continental United States and the basic question of what holds up the mountains can be partially resolved by determining the depth to crust-mantle boundary.  This boundary is the first major density contrast with depth and occurs on average at about 40 km below the Earth's surface on continents.  Higher mountains require thicker crust to help support the overlying burden, and potentially less dense, more buoyant material in the upper mantle to balance the gravitational forces.  The research supported by this award was designed to study the depth to the crust-mantle boundary, and relate this observable to possible density structures using the speed at which seismic waves propagate as a proxy for density.       Receiver functions from individual earthquakes can contain information from 2D variations and crustal anisotropy.  These effects were eliminated by applying a harmonic stripping approach.  Ambient noise cross correlations contain the crustal and lithospheric response to propagating surface waves, which was extracted using our newly developed method that includes the cross components of the wavefield.  These were both incorporated in a joint inversion for shear velocity that included a determination of crustal thickness and its uncertainties.  We also used selected xenolith (rocks from deep in the Earth, found at the surface) studies to attempt to map the distribution of high-velocity lower crust across the continental U.S. and assess its relationship to proposed emplacement and destruction-related mechanisms such as under-and intraplating, collision, extension, heating, cooling, hydration, and delamination. Thin layers of high-velocity lower crust related to regional processes are found scattered throughout the continent. Thicker layers in large areas are found in the central and eastern U.S. in areas with thick crust, bounded roughly by the Rocky Mountain Front. Emplacement processes likely originally spanned this boundary, and the difference between the two domains may reflect garnet growth with cooling and aging of continental crust in much of the central and eastern U.S., while crustal thickness and lithospheric temperatures in the western U.S. are unfavorable for growth and maintenance of thick layers of high-velocity garnet-bearing lower crust.  The outreach portion of this award allowed middle and high school students to be exposed to research in seismology.  Through this effort, students have gained valuable knowledge in monitoring earthquakes and the significance of applying the scientific method.  The outreach project installed a seismometer in the Estes Park high school and is still being used as a demonstration for school projects and science fairs.  The Estes Park seismometer is also being contributed to the Seismographs in Schools network by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS).
