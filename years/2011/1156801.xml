<AbstractNarration>This three year award at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) Department of Electrical Engineering (EE) will engage twelve students per year for a nine-week summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in Sensors and Applications. The program will be implemented within EE to augment existing efforts to support undergraduate student involvement in research, but will include other components within the College of Engineering (COE), in particular the Nanotechnology Research and Teaching Facility (NanoFab). Some of the research projects to be included cut across departmental boundaries within COE, with Bioengineering and with the mathematics department, providing an additional component of interdisciplinary experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While students work on their particular research projects, they will participate in bi-weekly meetings within their research group to assess and facilitate progress. Bi-weekly general meetings with participating faculty members and their teams, REU management (including the REU assistants) and undergraduate students are designed to promote enhancements in the REU delivery phase, and are important for professional and technical development. Presentations by the REU participants will include: 1)a midterm oral presentation, to the management group and research teams, will provide updates on their project work, delineate their responsibilities, and present goals that the would like to achieve by the end of program,2) a final presentation focused on individual accomplishments as well as their role on the team and how their accomplishment fits within the larger scope of the research, and 3)a final technical report focused on the outcomes of the research and the process by which the overall research work was done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research, students will participate in educational workshops designed to take advantage of materials from the Environmental Health and Safety Office, Graduate School, Department of English, and University College Student Obtaining Readiness (SOAR) programs. The REU students will go on field trips that will help them see the outcome of sensor technology research in daily life. Sites are selected that will be of interest for students, and also to resonate with the general theme of this REU program. For example, the recently completed Dallas Cowboys stadium, located about one mile from the EE department, is a world of sensors. Thousands of sensors control movement of the dome and manage the air quality, light, sound, and the largest indoor LCDTV in the world. There will also be tours to one or more of the large local industries, such as Bell Helicopter, Lockheed Martin, Texas Instruments, and Ericsson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will experience the challenges and satisfaction of doing research, and will be encouraged to pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering. The program will increase the participation in research activities by women, underrepresented minorities and 9/11 GI-Bill veterans. The Principal Investigator will especially seek and encourage participation from two and four year institutions with limited research capabilities in Texas and its neighboring states. Diversity of the program strengthens research capability and increases competence across ethnic, gender and socioeconomic lines, and also helps to provide role models for talented students whose potentials may not be fully utilized.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was for the establishment of an REU Site "Sensors and Applications" at the University of Texas at Arlington hosted at the Department of electrical Engineering.  The goal of the project was to provide research opportunity for undergraduate participants for 3 summers with research opportunity and mentorship for 12 students over a 9 week period each summer (total of 36 undergraduate participants.  An important achievement of the program was to contribute to manpower development in STEM fields. The project was completed under-budget.   Participation was solicited nationwide and participants were selected and were provided with the opportunity to be exposed to and engage in research projects in a real research lab under mentorship of various Faculty, Postdoctoral Fellows, and graduate students in the Department of Electrical Engineering.  A website was created and maintained and updated regularly over the life of the project. http://www.uta.edu/ee/reu/  A significant number of the participants were from underrepresented groups (Female, Hispanic, African American, and Native American). Each participant chose a specific research project among a vast selection made available by various faculty in their labs, under supervision of the faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students as appropriate. Through work with specific research groups each participant was exposed to good practices for research in a given discipline under individual mentorship, in a real research setting. As importantly, participants learned about common themes in research methodology, good practices, and got a broader perspective through regular meetings (1-3 times a week) (seminars by faculty, report presentation, peer evaluation). Seminars were given by college of Engineering faculty on various aspects of Engineering  focused on sensors.  Presentations were also given about career paths, graduate school benefits and application process,  as well as best practices for oral and written presentation. In our follow up of the REU Site Alumni indicates that many of them found the REU experience had given them an advantage in securing professional positions. A significant number of participants were motivated to pursue graduate school as a result of their REU experience in this program.  Individuals or teams of 2 or 3 produced profession grade posters summarizing their research results.  These posters were produced after several iteration of reports and presentations in front of their peers.  The final products were displayed and reviewed and commented upon by various Faculty, Leadership, and graduate students from College of Engineering at UTA. Participants were exposed to many cultural activities and created professional and friendship bounds.   A manuscript was prepared for submission for publication. Results of our studies of the program were reported in Biennial Conference on Undergraduate Research," at University of South Florida June 26-28 2016.  "Preparing the Next Generation of Engineers through Undergraduate Research Experience: Visions and Methods". Presenters: Reza Matthew Moghadam, Kambiz Alavi , Jonathan W. Bredow.
