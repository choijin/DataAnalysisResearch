<AbstractNarration>Brains represent information in the patterns of electrical discharge that are distributed across vast networks of brain cells to signal what we are experiencing, planning and thinking. Traces of this activity are stored and reactivated during diverse mental phenomena including perception, learning, recollection, planning and thought. It is unknown how the brain encodes and reads the information out of this dynamic activity and how different streams of information are coordinated in the electrical discharge patterns. In the effort to understand the fundamental neural code, we will record electrical activity within two networks of brain cells from freely moving rats that are using two streams of information to locate themselves on a rotating carousel-like arena. The activity in one network of cells, the hippocampus, alternates between representing the rat's position in the stable room and the position on the rotating floor. Electrical activity in a second related network, the medial entorhinal cortex, may or may not fluctuate between representing the two spatial frameworks of position information. To identify the rules of how information is coded and exchanged between brain networks, we will investigate how the activity in the hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex is organized and coordinated to signal the rat's location. In additional to scientific training, student members of the laboratory will receive professional training in communicating science to a lay audience. Across the year, each lab member will pay several visits to a high school science class to communicate the merits and progress of their research effort. Thus, this project will train the next generation of scientists in cutting-edge research and how to be effective communicators and provide a rare opportunity for high school students to learn about scientific research as a process of enquiry and creative problem solving.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Neurons are the cells in the brain that discharge electrical impulses called action potentials to represent, compute and transmit information such as oneÆs perceptions, memories and thoughts but how to interpret and decode the information in the discharge of neurons is not fully understood. Even the fundamental nature of the "neural code" is debated.   According to the "dedicated coding" hypothesis, each neuron is dedicated to representing a single unit of knowledge such as a concept or place, such that whenever a neuron discharges, it signals that specific unit of knowledge. This is analogous to a traffic light, when a particular light is on, analogous to a particular neuron discharging, the light always signals æstop.Æ  According to the alternative "ensemble coding" hypothesis, units of knowledge are signaled by the pattern of discharge across many neurons, such that each neuron discharges in multiple representations and no neuron is essential to any representation because the across-neuron pattern of activity carries the information. This is analogous to a stadium jumbotron, where many lights are on and off to generate a message; no particular light is essential to the message because the over all pattern of lights that are on and off defines what is being represented.    The project results strongly indicate that although single neurons in the dorsal medial entorhinal cortex and hippocampus discharge to signal aspects of space such as direction, distance, and position, this system uses an ensemble code. Neurons in these brain regions were recorded while rats navigated on a circular arena that could be either stationary or rotating. The rotation dissociated space into two spatial frames, one stationary the other rotating.  When discharge from hippocampus, an area essential for spatial memory, was recorded while rats navigated on a 80 cm circular arena, the overall pattern of discharge across the neurons transiently switched to represent a distinct navigation task that had been performed with the arena stationary, several minutes prior to the current rotating task. This indicated that the rat was retrieving from memory, its internal representation of the prior (stationary) experience even though it was currently doing a different rotating task. The properties of this "cross-episode recollection" were similar to the properties of human episodic memory. The recollection was more likely when the current physical environment was most similar to the recollected situation, and that the recollections were more likely during a particular mindset, which in the case of the rats, was when the hippocampus preferentially represented the current location in the stationary spatial frame. These observations are amongst the first to decode the neural signatures of active episodic recollection. They are also difficult to explain within the dedicated-coding hypothesis and are straightforward within the ensemble-coding hypothesis.  When discharge from hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex was recorded while rats navigated on a larger, 120 cm circular arena, the spatial tuning of individual neurons that was observed when the arena was stable was lost during the rotation, although the rat was clearly oriented and navigation was excellent. This is also not compatible with a dedicated neural code. In contrast, the pattern of which neurons did and did not discharge together in time was maintained across the stable and rotating conditions, which is exactly predicted by an ensemble neural code. Furthermore, the overall temporal pattern of discharge alternated between representing stationary directions and places and rotating directions and places, providing strong additional evidence for ensemble coding.  The alternation between the two spatial frames was not synchronized between the entorhinal and hippocampal representations of space. This is remarkable and unexpected because these two brain regions are thought to function as a unified system...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
