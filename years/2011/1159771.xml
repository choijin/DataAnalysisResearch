<AbstractNarration>Despite considerable progress made in developing microfluidic&lt;br/&gt;technologies for biological analysis, including droplet microfluidics to enable scalable partitioning of fluid&lt;br/&gt;into tiny compartments for single cell analysis, transforming the technology into practical applications are&lt;br/&gt;still hindered by 1) inadequate macro-to-micro interface to cope with large volume biological samples&lt;br/&gt;containing complex matrix; 2) complicated post-PCR processing for multiplexed, broad-scale genotypic&lt;br/&gt;analysis; and 3) insufficient progress toward system integration.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we plan to develop a fully integrated micro total analysis system (&amp;#56256;&amp;#56861;TAS) for high&lt;br/&gt;throughput broad-scale microbial detection and genotypic identification from a mixed population at single&lt;br/&gt;cell resolution. Our novel platform will incorporate a microfluidic droplet generator to encapsulate single&lt;br/&gt;bacterial cells into a large quantity of pL-sized droplets where the cells are lysed and enzymatic reactions&lt;br/&gt;take place to facilitate high throughput single cell PCR amplification. For broad-scale bacterial detection&lt;br/&gt;and species identification, we will incorporate a previously validated 16S rRNA PCR assay coupled with&lt;br/&gt;high resolution melt analysis (HRMA) for amplicon sequence analysis. This platform will not only provide&lt;br/&gt;highly accurate quantification of bacterial load, but the incorporation of HRMA at the single cell level&lt;br/&gt;permits both broad-scale species identification, as well as unprecedented resolution in measuring relative&lt;br/&gt;abundance of bacterial species present in a mixed population.</AbstractNarration>
