<AbstractNarration>Nitrogen is a critical element on which all life depends. However, only certain microbial species are capable of converting ("fixing") elemental nitrogen into a biologically useable form; multicellular organisms can only utilize nitrogen that is already fixed. Legumes are able to obtain nitrogen by forming an intimate symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia. Because of this unique ability to acquire nitrogen symbiotically, legumes play a critical role in agriculture and in natural environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction between legumes and rhizobia is by far the best characterized model for studying symbiosis. It is also a highly complex system: the bacteria enter the host, differentiate inside the host cell, fix nitrogen, and exchange the reduced nitrogen for photosynthate provided by the host. The host provides a specialized host root organ, the nodule, in which physiological conditions are accurately controlled. Nodule formation, development, and function depend on a suite of cellular programs which are triggered by highly specific molecular dialogs between the two partners. Recent years have seen major advances in our understanding of the initial recognition between legumes and rhizobia. On the other hand, the genetic components and biochemical mechanisms further downstream remains to be elucidated.  This EaGER project will address this need and develop a novel genetic screen to identify legume genes required for host-bacterial signaling during the intermediate and late stages of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project may provide technical approaches for researchers in all legume symbiosis systems. Contributing to the field of host-microbe interactions, this body of information will be published and materials will be made available to interested groups from the scientific community. The project will provide research training for postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students. In addition, the project will provide research opportunities to undergraduates and local high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microbes including bacteria are prominent in the lives of all organisms, and indeed the microbiome is a dynamic component of human bodies.  But how do apparently simple cells such as bacteria recognize and interact with much larger, complex organisms?  One way to understand the basic rules of microbe-host interaction is to examine a model system such as the highly sophisticated interaction of nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria with roots of leguminous host plants.  This system of study gains its power because both the microbe and the host can be used in forward genetic screens and genomic analysis.  Such work is impossible, or is prohibitively expensive, in animal systems.      We investigate the plant and bacterial genes responsible for the beneficial N2-fixing symbiosis between Medicago and Sinorhizobium.  The bacteria interact with plant roots and the result is formation of a nitrogen fixing root nodule within which bacteria reside and carry out nitrogen fixation.  This process nourishes the plant, allowing it to grow without added nitrogen fertilizer.  How do the two organisms recognize each other, and what is the basis for signal and response?  Genetics is a powerful tool for answering these questions.  To find symbiosis genes, researchers need to test individual possibly-mutant plants for making nodules, then carry out microscopy and gene analysis to determine whether there is a problem in symbiosis, and where in the process the problem occurs.  We have now developed a bacterial strain that can be used in a single inoculation to reveal the success or failure of three different stages of symbiosis by expressing chromatic or fluorescent markers. Finding and analyzing plant mutants will help discover the genes that plants need to harbor these beneficial symbionts.  To facilitate high-throughput screening and genomic analysis, we developed a bacterial strain that simultaneously reports three distinct, sequential stages of symbiosis.  When infected into plants, the reporter bacteria produce fluorescent emissions at the 3 wavelengths as an indicator of plant function.  We used this to discover a set of plant mutants revealing novel genes.  Our new strain will be useful to many researchers.
