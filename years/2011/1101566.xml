<AbstractNarration>The technical goals of the project are (1) to classify the possible root systems for "interesting" Kac-Moody Lie algebras, where "interesting" has a specific technical meaning, (2) work out the basic properties of the corresponding Kac-Moody groups, especially over the ring of integers, especially in physically-important cases like the E10 and E11 algebras, (3) strengthen the currently-conjectural support for a role of the sporadic finite simple "Monster" group in complex hyperbolic geometry and algebraic geometry.  More specifically: to understand the fundamental group of a particular complex orbifold, already conjectured to be the Monster.  Computer calculation will play a large role in the first project, and the others are more theoretical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most immediate broader significance of this project is that of part (2): a large number of physicists are studying the conjectural role of a group called E11(Z) as the symmetry group of a physical theory called M-theory.  A useful-for-calculation description of this group is missing, and Lisa Carbone and I aim to provide one. (And many other things, including addressing questions more purely mathematical.)  Like any classification project, part (1) will turn up a few "jewels" and also some not-quite-so-interesting objects.  The jewels already known (like the monster Lie algebra) are very deep, with far-reaching influence in mathematics, so we naturally want to find the rest.  Part (3) is more speculative; many coincidences suggest it will work out, and if it does then it will build a bridge between two parts of mathematics that have been far apart.  The explicitly collaborative nature of part (2), and the suitability of problems related to these questions for graduate students, mean that the research fits well into a larger area of study by others in mathematics/physics community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Because this report on my research grant is for the general public, let me take the opportunity to say thank you to all Americans, for providing support for science and technology through the National Science Foundation.  The work supported by the NSF is important for our country's continued leadership in the world, and I am grateful for their support of my own work.  It is a privilege to receive it.  I and various couthors acheived the main scientific goals of the project. These represent progress in the study of infinite-dimensional symmetry (such as arises in theoretical physics), and in the study of the "monster" finite simple group.  This is one of the most remarkable mathematical objects ever discovered, and one can learn more about it from from a book by Mark Ronan, written for the general public.  It is called "Symmetry and the Monster".  The discovery and proof of these results relied on a combination of pure thought, computer experimentation, and collaboration with other mathematicians from the USA and abroad.  Specifically, Professors Lisa Carbone (Rutgers U.), Tathagata Basak (Iowa State U.) and Fumiharu Kato (now at Tokyo Inst. of Tech.), and two graduate students Alice Mark and Itamar Gal from my home university (U.T. Austin).  All the scientific results are freely available at arxiv.org, an government-supported repository where most mathematicians and physicists post preprint versions of their papers.  The arxiv is partly responsible for the "speeding up" of science, and I am also grateful for the NSF's support of this amazing tool for scientific communication and collaboration.  A specific web address for my work is "http://arxiv.org/a/allcock_d_1.html".  My project's results have also appeared in traditional scientific journals, or are in the process of being published there.    This grant provided 2 months of salary support in each of 3 summers, to work full-time on the project.  (My university does not pay me during summers.) It also funded some travel to work with other mathematicians and to travel to conferences to share my results and learn about others' work.  Finally, it provided some miscellaneous support like a laptop for my computer-based work.       Last Modified: 11/27/2015       Submitted by: Daniel J Allcock]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
