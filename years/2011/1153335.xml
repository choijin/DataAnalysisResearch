<AbstractNarration>AstroCom NYC is designed to improve access by urban minority students to opportunities in astrophysical research by greatly enhancing partnerships between research astronomers in New York City. The partners are minority serving institutions of the City University of New York (CUNY), and the astrophysics research departments of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and Columbia University. This award will create a substantive and sustainable partnership spanning New York City to provide centralized, personalized mentoring as well as financial and academic support to CUNY undergraduates throughout their studies, plus the resources and opportunities to further CUNY faculty research with students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partners of AstroCom NYC are uniquely qualified for the task of improving minority access to astrophysics research because of their strong working relationships, expertise in mentoring students with diverse backgrounds, and the ready pool of candidates from within the urban population of New York City. AstroCom NYC will also serve as a model to urban areas with large and diverse minority populations, and to this end the partners will widely publish results and present progress reports at national conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the students, AstroCom NYC will provide - and prepare them for - research opportunities with structured and centralized mentoring, personal attention, a rigorous Methods of Scientific Research course developed specifically to this purpose, a seminar course around the weekly Columbia colloquia, scholarships and stipends, and regular assessment for maximum effectiveness. Stipends will in part alleviate the burdens at home typical for CUNY students so they may concentrate on their academic success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various student research projects will form the backbone of AstroCom NYC. Students will participate in projects on galaxy properties and evolution, nearby and low mass stars, evolved stars, numerical simulations and modeling, and observational astronomy from the radio to gamma-rays. AstroCom NYC will facilitate further research by CUNY faculty, resulting in more contributions to their fields, and enhanced research collaborations among the program partners, while attracting more diverse students to astrophysics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>AstroCom NYC is the flagship undergraduate mentoring program in astronomy for underrepresented students in New York City. AstroCom NYC is an inclusive program promoting recruitment and retention in astrophysics by supporting students from the City University of New York throughout their studies, and providing research opportunities with structured mentoring, fellowships, and additional academic preparation for ? and personal acclimation to ? the research environment. Our aim is to improve student retention and graduation in STEM, particularly physics, and thus strengthen the pipeline to graduate school, especially for students from socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM. We have created an innovative community of diverse, urban astrophysicists in New York City to concentrate and support otherwise dispersed CUNY students and faculty. Our main purpose is to build students? sense of belonging in astrophysics by creating opportunities for them to work within this unique community of research institutions.</p> <p>The institutional connections we have formalized, combined with programs such as the Columbia Bridge to the PhD, are essential elements of a New York City-wide effort to maximize the capacity of our local astronomy pipeline, enhance collaborations including faculty from minority-serving institutions, and increase diversity in astrophysics. Well over 40 students from CUNY, the largest urban public university in the country, have engaged in authentic astrophysics research at the American Museum of Natural History since 2012. More than 20 AstroCom NYC scholars to date have completed their undergraduate degrees, and/or successfully transferred from community college to senior colleges in CUNY or elsewhere (e.g., NYU, Columbia). Ten AstroCom NYC scholars received external summer research internships, three entered post-baccalaureate bridge programs, and eleven have entered PhD programs at Yale, Harvard, Cornell, Berkeley, and others (some with multiple acceptances). Five graduates earned prestigious and competitive fellowships: a Fulbright, two Helen Fellowships at AMNH, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and a Smithsonian Internship to Fellowship (I2F) appointment. AstroCom NYC scholars have also been authors on several refereed publications, two before graduating, and even one as first author.</p> <p>The mentoring structure, and faculty mobilization and investment that resulted from AstroCom NYC has fostered a strong and continually burgeoning community of New York City researchers dedicated to improving equity and inclusion in our field. It was the foundation upon which we built a state-wide Community College Partnership program that engaged nearly 100 students throughout NY. Its central training platform, the Methods of Scientific Research course, which helps students prepare for summer research, spawned faculty training workshops around the country that have impacted dozens of STEM faculty. As New York City astronomy research expanded dramatically with the establishment of the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Astrophysics, AstroCom NYC again was the natural partner for engaging staff and postdocs in mentoring activities, training, and support. We also partner closely with parallel programs nation-wide to share resources, best practices, students and alumni.</p> <p>The growth of CUNY Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics has been profound during the time of this award, nearly doubling in size to 15 faculty. Were we at one institution, we would in fact constitute quite a sizeable department. Five grad students from the CUNY Graduate Center Physics Program earned their PhDs with us, and five more are in progress. Diversified support from NSF, NASA, the Sloan Foundation, the Simons Foundation, CUNY, and others continues to strengthen the work of AstroCom NYC. As faculty at public MSIs, our own research has benefited greatly from the strong partnerships this award initiated. As a result, we are able to contribute to frontier exploration in our field, as well as serve our community on advisory boards, review panels, national and local professional society leadership, and collaborative proposals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/23/2019<br>      Modified by: Timothy&nbsp;A&nbsp;Paglione</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1153335/1153335_10188678_1569249459943_AAS17--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1153335/1153335_10188678_1569249459943_AAS17--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AstroCom NYC @AAS229"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1153335/1153335_10188678_1569249459943_AAS17--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AstroCom NYC @AAS229"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">AstroCom NYC scholars at the Grapevine, TX AAS meeting in 2017.
