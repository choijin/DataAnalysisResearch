<AbstractNarration>The project, a collaborative effort among Smith College, Holyoke Community College and Mount Holyoke College, is building analytical competence in undergraduate geoscience students through use of Raman and FTIR spectrometers. Benchtop and portable spectrometers are being shared among the three colleges and others in the region, and are being used to develop, implement and assess innovative instructional modules through which students acquire mastery via hands-on, investigative learning. By analyzing unknown minerals and other materials, synthesizing data and predictions, and evaluating experimental results, students are learning not only geological content, but also how to use chemical analyses to solve relevant problems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The spectroscopic knowledge and analytical competencies that are targeted in the curriculum development are in increasing demand by the nation's geoscience workforce. The project is providing a direct benefit in broadening participation in the geosciences through its engagement with two women's colleges and a community college that serves a diverse population of non-traditional and first-generation college students. Project personnel are also disseminating their approach and curriculum modules beyond the region through a web portal, video postings, and hands-on workshops at national conferences.</AbstractNarration>

Often students at the community college level do not have the access to an advanced tool set to allow for this type of experience. The opportunity to use these tools in an introductory geosciences class gives the students an opportunity to hone their data collection and analytical skills using state of the art equipment. Recent advances in the development of commercially available Raman and FTIR spectrometers make this technology accessible to students and faculty in the geosciences for which spectroscopy has not traditionally been a focus.  These spectrometers are powerful tools that provide excellent opportunities to build analytical competence through their thoughtful use in geoscience curricula.

Results of this collaboration, including assessment, have been disseminated actively through presentations at national and regional meetings of the Geological Society of America, a Five Colleges summer spectroscopy course, and a workshop at the Earth Educators? Rendezvous of the National Association of Geology Teachers in Madison, WI.  We built lists of minerals that are easy to identify with FTIR or Raman, and created streamlined data libraries of common minerals using data collected with our instruments on minerals that are in the Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, and Holyoke Community College mineral collections.  Development of these libraries from the mineral collections at the three participating colleges and increasing ease of access to outside libraries has been crucial in the success of student learning, particularly at the community college. Introductory level students at community colleges often have extensive obligations outside of school, which limits extra time and collaborative work after class.  A website was created to consolidate and organize our own data as well as publicly-available spectroscopic data on minerals (http://nemo.cs.umass.edu:54321/). developed into a major resource for teaching spectroscopy, including data not only from Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, but also from many other sources (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, visible-near-infrared, etc.).
