<AbstractNarration>On the island of New Guinea, some extraordinary lizards have green blood, due to high levels of biliverdin, a bile pigment, which overwhelms the color of their red blood cells.  In humans and other vertebrates, biliverdin (and bilirubin) are toxic waste products that cause jaundice and are associated with pathology in newborns and diseases such as Gilbert's and Crigler-Najjar syndromes.  As the concentration of biliverdin in these lizards would cause jaundice and death in other animals, the adaptive significance of their high bile pigment levels is unknown.  One hypothesis is that it is an anti-parasitic strategy.  Lizards are hosts to malaria parasites but preliminary data collected by the PI's show a trend towards reduced levels of malaria infection in green-blooded lizards. The goals of this project are to conduct fieldwork at nine locales in Papua New Guinea and to use a large number of tissue and blood samples already in hand to obtain better estimates of the diversity and relationships of skinks and their malaria parasites, in order to more conclusively test this hypothesis. Thus, this project will make numerous novel contributions to systematics, biodiversity, and parasitology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project will include development of middle/high school curriculum materials, training of undergraduate and graduate students, and various international partnerships. As no other animals have ever been found that can survive this level of biliverdin in their blood, the study may ultimately provide some clues to better understand jaundice and in doing so contribute to biomedicine and economic development.</AbstractNarration>

Biliverdin is a natural waste product produced from the hemoglobin inside red blood cells when they are broken down and recycled. Previous research done by other scientists had found that bilirubin, a similar waste product compound, was capable of killing human malaria parasites when they were growing in culture, yet we knew of a species of malaria that infected green-blooded lizards based on earlier research that we had done.

From any lizard that was observed to be infected with malaria parasites, we sequenced six parasite genes. That information was then used to construct an evolutionary tree of the malaria parasites that showed us how similar these parasites were to one another and to other parasites in different hosts. Through this process, we observed ten new species of these parasites belonging to two different parasite genera and improved our knowledge of hosts that are used and where in the island they can be found.&nbsp; The evolutionary tree that we created of these species also showed that two of the species found in lizards on Caribbean islands as well as another species from Africa, were closely related to the New Guinea parasites, demonstrating that these parasites are capable of widespread colonization. We sequenced the RNA molecules of the species that is found in green-blooded skinks to see if they showed evidence of breaking down hemoglobin, even though there is biliverdin present in the blood. &nbsp;In fact, we did observe that these parasites are still processing hemoglobin quite normally, even though their hosts have a high level of this compound, suggesting that the presence of biliverdin is not functioning to protect the lizards from becoming infected.&nbsp; Collaborative work with the partners at Louisiana State University on the history of the lizards themselves revealed that this unusual blood pigmentation has had a complex pattern of evolution and has either been acquired several times or evolved once and then was subsequently lost several times.
