<AbstractNarration>Despite much research regarding how animals and humans solve social problems, few studies have utilized comparable procedures, outcomes, or measures, thus little is known about the evolution of decision-making behavior. In this project, the Principal Investigators will investigate how primates, including humans, deal with problems that arise in interactions with other group members. Understanding what outcomes are achieved, and how they vary across species, has implications for theories of the evolution of sociality and our understanding of social decision-making. The research will examine strategic decisions involving costly conflict and trust, varying the cooperativeness or competitiveness of the frame. The results will provide shed light on the evolution of human decision-making behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help to clarify the similarities and differences between nonhuman primates and humans with respect to social decision-making and will more properly place nonhuman behavior in context with human behavior and to understand the roots from which human economic decision making emerged. In addition to the theoretical merits, this interdisciplinary research will be integrated into summer workshops for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students at the Economic Science Institute at Chapman University and disseminated to the general public through partnerships with schools and Zoo Atlanta. It will also provide training for multiple postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Every day, people must decide whether and how to interact with others.  There are substantial costs to fighting with others and substantial benefits for finding ways to avoid such fights.  While many factors contribute to such decision-making, it is important to understand how humans? responses in such a social dilemma compare to those of other primates.  This is important for two reasons.  First, it provides a model system in which we can systematically vary features in order to test possible strategies for increasing coordinated outcomes among humans.  Second, we need to determine which features of such comparisons have been selected across species and which are due to humans? unique selective environment in order to better understand how humans make these decisions. Understanding which mechanisms are unique to humans, and how they allow humans to make better decisions and more often avoid fighting, will provide an understanding of how such decisions are made, which may then be used to address a variety of issues related to the breakdown of cooperation at all levels of society.  Our research has found that humans are not alone in being able to solve social dilemmas; what is distinct is that humans use different mechanisms.  Of course, humans have language, but beyond that, humans also tend to more closely match the choices of their partners.  In games of conflict, humans also are able to find more advantageous, but more challenging, solutions.  One such example is the "Chicken game," which is modeled after the car game popular with teenagers in the movie Grease, in which they drive at each other and the "loser" swerves (i.e., is a chicken) while the "winner" holds steady. In our version of the chicken game, humans often alternated such that each individual "won" half of the time.  In other words, humans turned a game of conflict into a game of cooperation.  Other species, however, settled on un-coordinated outcomes in which one routinely "won" and the other "lost". This research is important for helping us understand how humans avoid situations of potential conflict.  Our research has also provided many opportunities for training.  We have involved two postdoctoral fellows, seven graduate students, six undergraduate students, and three research assistants in this project.  These students are trained in how to do scientific research and participate in all levels of the work, from conception to dissemination. We also present these results at the annual Chapman University graduate student workshop in experimental economics.  This brings these results to students who might not otherwise be aware of them.  We have also used these results to improve our understanding of best husbandry practices for captive primates, and disseminated these findings and their implications through numerous workshops and publications on behavioral management. Finally, we have had the opportunity to present these findings to members of the public through participation in the Atlanta Science Festival, participation in Adventures in Science, an annual science day hosted by the Fernbank Museum of Natural History, Open Houses at MD Anderson Cancer Center, and talks at local K-12 schools.
