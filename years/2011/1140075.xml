<AbstractNarration>This project will use three imaging Doppler spectrometers to study wind and temperature in the Earth's thermosphere from about 120 to 240 km altitude over a grid spanning approximately 2000 x 1300 km in latitude and longitude respectively. Within the field of view some volumes will be observed tri-statically by all three instruments allowing for the first time unambiguous spatial mapping of the three vector components of the thermospheric wind field over an extended region. There will in addition be extended bi-static and mono-static coverage as well. This new Doppler imaging array will be applied to the following four science questions: &lt;br/&gt;1) Do thermospheric wind and temperature fields contain local structure arising because the wind field can become dynamically unstable? &lt;br/&gt;2) What is the spatial distribution of vertical wind disturbances in the auroral thermosphere? &lt;br/&gt;3) How do thermospheric gravity waves perturb thermospheric winds and temperatures? &lt;br/&gt;4) How do small-scale wind gradients affect dispersion of thermospheric air masses?</AbstractNarration>

Understanding thermsopheric weather is important, because it affects the orbits and operation of spacecraft in low-Erath-orbit, such as the International Space Station.</p> <p>The project used three all-sky imaging Fabry-Perot spectrometers located at Poker Flat, Toolik Lake, and Gakona in Alaska to measure thermospheric wind and temperature fields, along with a range of other auroral and ionspheric&nbsp; instruments to monitor space weather drivers that would act to perturb these winds and temperatures.The all-sky Fabry-Perot instruments operate by viewing faint airglow and auroral light originating in Earth's upper atmosphere. Spectral characterisitics of this light provide information on the line-of-sight component of the wind, along with a direct measure of temperature. One of the main reasons for using an array of multiple instruments is to allow accurate reconstructions of the complete vector wind field. (Doing so on the basis of data from a single site is less accurate, because it requires substantial assumptions. This is because only a single wind component can be measured from one site.)</p> <p>With this project, we have demonstrated that:</p> <p>1. Winds and temperatures above Alaska respond in as little as 10-15 minutes to changes in auroral and ionspheric conditions.</p> <p>2. Especially before midnight, there is a very tight coupling between ion and neutral motion. Ion motion drives the neutral wind, over spatial scales down to as little as 100 km or less.</p> <p>3.

Direct comparisons between winds measured using the all-sky instruments used here and more traditional narrow-field instruments show generally very good agreement between the techniques.
