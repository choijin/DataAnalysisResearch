<AbstractNarration>This project supports travel costs for students attending the American Geophysical Union Chapman Conference on "Modeling the Ionosphere/Thermosphere System".  The conference will address the current state of large-scale, complex computational models of the coupled upper atmosphere as well as future modeling needs of the ionosphere/thermosphere (IT) research community.   Specific objectives of the conference are to provide the IT community, including its student members, with the following:&lt;br/&gt; - an overview of existing IT models&lt;br/&gt; - examples of model applications&lt;br/&gt; - data/model comparisons&lt;br/&gt; - assessment of model strengths and weaknesses&lt;br/&gt; - identification of future efforts to improve IT modeling capabilities</AbstractNarration>
