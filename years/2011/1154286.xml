<AbstractNarration>This award funds workshops hosted by the University of Minnesota and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minnesota.  Topics of the workshops vary, but include macroeconomic consequences of contracting frictions, labor market behavior, financial market frictions, business cycle dynamics, heterogeneity and inequality, international trade and globalizations, housing markets, development and financial integration, monetary policy, fiscal policy, and long run growth.  The workshops feature both junior and senior researchers.  Research presented in this conference series focuses on fundamental science that is relevant to many questions facing policy makers, including the appropriate role of monetary policy, the benefits and costs of various financial market regulations, the design of unemployment insurance, and issues involving long run fiscal balance.</AbstractNarration>
