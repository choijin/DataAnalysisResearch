<AbstractNarration>This study investigates the molecular mechanisms by which critical genes are differentially regulated in the male and female brain.  The hormone, estrogen, is critical for establishing structural and functional aspects of the brain in both males and females.  Estrogen functions through intracellular receptors that mediate its action.  Estrogen receptor gene expression is regulated differently in the male and female brain after a neural injury, however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this expression are not known.  In this study, the effects of epigenetic modification of DNA on the expression of estrogen receptors after brain injury will be examined in a rat animal model.  Molecular biological and histological techniques will be used to identify these changes.  It is hypothesized that estrogen receptor gene expression is differentially activated by DNA demethylation after injury.  The results of this study will enhance the understanding of the inherent gender differences in the regulation of gene expression in the brain.  This project combines the fields of neuroendocrinology with the rapidly growing field of epigenetics.  In addition to the answering fundamental questions in the field of neuroscience, the impact of this study is enhanced by the involvement of multiple undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students over the course of the study that provides a fundamental scientific background to these students. The students are involved in all aspects of this project from performing experiments to presenting the findings. All students will be encouraged to present their data at University events as well as at other regional and national meetings.  Students also have the opportunity participate in community events such as those associated with Brain Awareness Week with the Society for Neuroscience.  These events allow students to interact with the public to educate children and parents alike to importance of understanding how their brains function.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dr. Melinda Wilson has completed the research as outlined in "Molecular regulation of estrogen receptor gene expression in the adult brain" supported by the National Science Foundation.  During the funding period she directed the research performed by five undergraduate students, two graduate students and two technical staff.  Together they made significant progress in understanding how gene expression is regulated in response to brain injury.  The major discoveries uncovered by Dr. WilsonÃ†s team included the observation that following a severe brain injury the cells of the brain react in a manner that directs gene expression in a way to promote cell survival. A critical gene in that role is the estrogen receptor.  The most facinating discovery of this project was that the mechanisms that regulate these potential survival genes are different in males and females.  This suggests that any potential therapies may need to be designed differently in males and females.  This funding resulted in the publication of two manuscripts.  The funding also supported significant outreach in the community.  Members of the Wilson laboratory made twelve oral presentations at various scientific meetings and universities and participated in numerous science fairs and exhibits to help educate students from the elementary school level to their scientific peers.
