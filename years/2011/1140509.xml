<AbstractNarration>The goals of this project include increased student knowledge of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) by adding hands-on laboratory experiences to chemistry courses and independent study projects at Grand Rapids Community College, development of GC-MS expertise for community college and high school faculty, and instrumentation experiences for high school students. Developed materials reflect workforce needs, delivered using a constructivist approach.  The intellectual merit is the development of broadly applicable processes for integrating GC-MS into community college laboratory course curricula to enhance learning and interest. Professional development and summer camp opportunities enhance high school faculty and students' understanding of GC-MS while demonstrating practical connections between science and technology, and serve as a model for high school-community college partnerships. Broader impacts include better prepared students through engaging hands-on science education, enhanced educational infrastructure, and a close partnership with local high schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The independent evaluation encompasses formative assessment of instructor content knowledge and engagement, coupled with assessment of student learning gains and attitudes toward science through review of course work, interviews and focus groups.</AbstractNarration>
