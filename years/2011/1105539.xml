<AbstractNarration>The goals of this NSF-NCI joint research grant are to establish the influence of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and microarchitecture on tumor cell invasion and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie this regulation.  While the strong influence of ECM stiffness in governing tumor cell migration has been well established in traditional two-dimensional culture paradigms, understanding this phenomenon in three-dimensional (3D) ECMs that more closely mimic tissue has proven considerably more challenging.  In part, this is because perturbations that change 3D ECM stiffness often concurrently change microscale matrix parameters that also critically regulate cell migration, such as pore size, fiber architecture, and local material deformability.  By combining a new microscale culture platform that enables orthogonal separation of ECM stiffness and pore geometry with gene targeting approaches and computational modeling, this project will explore the contributions of these two parameters to the invasion of tumor cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The studies will initially focus on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly malignant brain tumor that routinely kills patients within two years of diagnosis.  Successful completion of the work will provide new biophysical, mechanistic insight into the progression of GBM, and the resulting experimental and computational platforms may be readily applied to probe the invasion and metastasis of other tumor types.  The project will also feature an educational plan in which undergraduates will be mentored and actively included in research efforts.  Finally, a learning module for elementary school students on cell motility and the ECM will be created and taught through a local program that places practicing scientists and engineers in area public schools to enhance science education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this NSF/NCI PESO award was to apply novel microfluidic strategies to dissect contributions of extracellular matrix mechanics and microstructure to tumor cell migration, along with attendant molecular mechanisms.  This is a very important open question within cell biology generally and cancer biology more specifically, because the ability of cells to migrate through three-dimensional matrices is a fundamental feature of tumor invasion and metastasis.  A key challenge to understanding these regulatory relationships in three-dimensional matrices is that it is difficult to vary one parameter (e.g. stiffness) in isolation of others (e.g. microstructure).  While many excellent investigators have been studying this problem for a number of years, we proposed to take a new and unique approach by applying microfluidic devices that enable independent control of matrix stiffness and microstructure.  Intellectual Merit: This proposal resulted in &gt;12 journal papers.  To summarize some of these findings, we applied our microchannel device to dissect contributions of oncogenes and matrix parameters to breast cancer invasion (Integrative Biology, 2013).  We later applied some of the lessons we had learned from our platform to create a new, high-throughput matrix paradigm that enables investigation of contributions of matrix stiffness and adhesivity to cell behavior (Nature Communications, 2015). We also developed a new strategy to end-tether matrix proteins to hydrogel surfaces, thereby standardizing presentation and definitively uncoupling matrix stiffness from ligand tethering density (Biomaterials, 2016).  Finally, we created a new microfluidic strategy for measuring the viscoelastic properties of cells (Biophysical Journal, 2016).  Broader Impacts: This program also gave rise to a number of important broader impacts to society.  First, as mentioned earlier, the ability of cells to migrate within dense, confined environments plays important roles in development and disease, particularly cancer.  Thus, our studies may deepen the field?s biophysical understanding of many normal and disease processes, and suggest new ways of controlling cell behavior for regenerative medicine and therapeutic applications. Our program also provided research training opportunites to myriad undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows within my laboratory.
