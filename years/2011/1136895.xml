<AbstractNarration>This international dissertation enhancement grant supports the research of Jacob Lowenstein (Columbia University) under the supervision of Dr. Melanie Stiassy (American Museum of Natural History/ Columbia University). The research examines the evolutionary genetics of the blind cichlid, Lamprologus lethops found in the Congo River and will be carried out in collaboration with researchers at the University of Kinshasa and the Institut de Développement Rural, Université Marien Ngouabi, Brazzaville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cichlid fishes have fascinated biologists for years due to their unrivaled capacity to evolve into new species.  Many scientists believe their visual acuity underlies this propensity to speciate, and enables them to choose mates and habitats with great selectivity. The genetics underlying the evolution of the cichlid visual and pigment system is becoming documented in a number of cichlids.  The species studied in this research, which is also depigmented, provides many opportunities then to understand the genetics underlying speciation through comparative biology.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;The Mexican Tetra is an unrelated species used as a model for evolutionary development research.  Like this Congo River cichlid, blind individuals of this fish are depigmented and have enlarged jaws.  Thus, there is great future potential for L. lethops to lend insight into gene functioning bridging these two important study systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will further refine genetic techniques for species identification helping to test and build a gene library being developed for Lower Congo River fishes.  Once complete, this resource may assist non-specialists to monitor trade or conduct epidemiology studies on previously unknown samples.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This was a doctoral disertation enhancement project granted to Jacob Heen Lowenstein and Melanie Lisa Jane Stiassny.  The program has since been canceled.  This research fulfilled its objectives examining the opsin pallete of Lamprologus lethops.    This research achieved a better understanding of how the intrinsic genotype scales up to the phenotype and how, in concert with the extreme extrinsic hydrological conditions of the Congo River, these combined influences explain the origin of L. lethops. From the foundation of a well supported phylogenetic hypothesis for the lethops-flock, this research enhanced our efforts  to characterize the role of selection versus neutral drift on genes of known function involved with visual-tuning, melanogenesis, and cranial morphogenesis at the population level in L. lethops, and the sympatric sister species, L. tigripictilis. Funding from this grant was used to amass additional specimens of L. lethops and take advantage of newly accessible 454 sequencing.   This research adopted an integrative approach combining elements that scale up from evo-devo to ecology, and will contribute to a rapidly growing body of work that aims to achieve a more holistic evolutionary synthesis. The Congo species flock shares with Astyanax mexicanus and the Great Lakes cichlid model systems these ideal traits: (1) having undergone a rapid adaptive radiation; (2) possessing a wide divergence of phenotypes; (3) having a well documented evolutionary history; and (4) sharing convergent traits with other model organisms. Strikingly convergent troglomorphisms that manifest in Lamprologus lethops and Astyanax include depigmentation, blindness and enlarged cranial morphologies.
