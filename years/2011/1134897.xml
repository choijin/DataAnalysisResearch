<AbstractNarration>PI: Alain J. Kassab &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CBET - 1134897 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is on the topic of Inverse Problems that are typically ill-posed, and where the values of some model parameters is obtained from the observed data. Inverse problems are commonly encountered in transport processes, structural mechanics, and medicine. Inverse problem techniques find applications in boundary condition reconstruction in heat transfer, parameter identification, non-destructive testing and evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this award is to support the International Conference in Inverse Problems in Engineering (ICIPE) scheduled to be held at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida, on May 4-6, 2011. The conference will provide a forum for exchange of ideas between researchers from different countries. Funds are requested for a keynote lecture by an international authority and for several graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will highlight recent developments in the area of inverse problems in transport, and engage an open discussion on these topics with international participants to enhance dissemination of these results.  It is anticipated that the younger audience will be stimulated by the open discussions.</AbstractNarration>
