<AbstractNarration>A critical impediment to taking full advantage of electronic health record (EHR) systems is the human computer interface (HCI). The project's core aim is to design, implement, and evaluate several new HCI features for clinical decision support (CDS) systems that have the potential for directly impacting point-of-care treatment and improving care for patients suffering from long-term illness. Some of the primary HCI features proposed include: 1) Visually enhanced interactive functions for EHR systems such as treatment trend maps and data indicators, 2) Patient data summary of critical data elements in a dashboard format, 3) Access to evidence-based recommendations relevant to individual patients, and, 4) Display of co-morbid conditions explicitly to encourage review and analysis in the context of routine patient care.  The proposed work will explore the use of visual analytics to process patient and comparative population medical profile data to generate data summaries in the form of interactive visualizations (data views). The data views will be designed to provide physicians with the capability to filter patient data based on key data elements such as medications and co-morbid conditions, and to compare patient treatment trends with established evidence-based guidelines to identify treatment gaps and options. As part of the usability evaluation, the proposed work will engage end-users (i.e., care providers) directly in requirement generation, implementation, evaluation, and refinement of the CDS HCI.  The broad impact of the proposed work include disseminating the outcome and findings through the network of Clinical Translational Science Awardees (60 academic medical centers) that are involved in developing novel informatics solutions to accelerate the translation of medical treatments and prevention strategies.   Additionally, the MindsEye software will be distributed with appropriate documentation to contribute to health IT education and training and to spur practical IT engagements and new research activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project MindsEye, funded through a small NSF grant, was a multi-year effort with three key goals, namely: 1) Identify key challenges in developing interactive, visual-analytics driven clinical decision support (CDS) systems, 2) Evaluate the system in realistic patient care contexts, and 3) Recommend and establish design guidelines for interactive CDS systems.   The project involved a cross-university collaboration between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Duke University, based on a collaborative team which included a biomedical informatician, a human-computer interaction design specialist, two clinicians, and graduate student.    The project concluded successfully producing two types of outcomes.   First, it generated key design guidelines regarding visual-analytics driven CDS systems (see enclosed image) and it also provided new insights regarding the process of interactive system design for CDS.  A key publication, shown below, summarized the major findings of the project.  Iterative Design and Evaluation Methodology for Clinical Decision Support Systems. Yu, F., Carrasco, V., Mane, K., &amp; Mostafa, J. In the Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the American Medical Informatics Association, San Francisco, CA. 2015  Another thread which was an outcome of the project was an extension of the design methodology to incorporate new ways to measure interactions and challenges with decision making in the context of CDS systems, particularly cognitive load and associated errors.   The PI and the master?s student involved in the project were particularly active in the second phase of the project and some of the findings from the second thread of the research appear in the publication below.  Relating Task Demand, Mental Effort and Task Difficulty with Physicians? Performance during Interactions with Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Mosaly, R., Mazur, L., Yu, F., Guo, H., Derek, M., Laidlaw, D., Moore, C., Marks, L., Mostafa, J. the International Journal of Human Computer Interaction (in press).  Second, the general findings regarding the design of the interactive systems is likely to have a strong impact on next-generation interface designs for computer-aided patient care systems.   Additionally, the work on translation, i.e., development of a practical working visual-analytics driven system, is planned and it is likely to have a "real-world" impact on physicians? effectiveness in tracking patient progress and ultimately improved health outcomes.
