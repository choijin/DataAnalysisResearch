<AbstractNarration>This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center is to  develop methods in incorporation and patterning active, structured proteins in a three-dimensional scaffold, thus greatly extending the ability to manipulate cell behavior in cell biology and tissue engineering studies. Common approaches in generating or functionalizing materials can harm sensitive molecules. Cytokines, proteins that control growth, migration, apoptosis, and differentiation, are particularly vulnerable. With this award, functionalized materials will be prepared in a single step using the Drosophila protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx). Ubx rapidly self-assembles in mild buffers, allowing cytokines that have been genetically fused to Ubx to remain active. Cytokine-Ubx fusion materials will be used to direct and pattern angiogenesis within a three-dimensional scaffold. The properties of proteins will defined that permit incorporation, benchmark the activity of cytokines embedded in materials relative to soluble monomers, and assess the ability of uncharacterized cytokines to regulate angiogenesis. By collaborating with an undergraduate laboratory course, this project will enable 60-70 students per year to participate in cutting-edge research while learning basic biochemistry techniques. Outstanding students will be invited to continue their research during the school year and in summer internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building artificial tissues or organs requires a scaffold, which ideally would both support cells in three dimensions and instruct cell behavior. These "instructions" are often powerful proteins which interact with the cell to control cell attachment, identity, shape, movement, and growth. However, it is difficult to attach these proteins to a scaffold without damaging them. The investigator has developed a unique material that assembles itself quickly in gentle conditions, allowing one to attach a variety of proteins without harming them. This proposal will position these instructive proteins in a three dimensional scaffold to control and pattern cell behavior. The resulting materials will also allow in identifying new proteins with useful effects on cells. In the long term, the methods developed in this proposal could be adapted to pattern cells in the same scaffold (for instance, build blood vessels in a block of liver cells), a necessary step in producing artificial tissues and organs. As part of this research, graduate and undergraduate students will receive interdisciplinary training. Research is a critical component of STEM training, but the number of undergraduates exceeds the number of research opportunities. Collaboration with a class at University of Houston, which has a large minority student population, will allow 60-70 undergraduates per year to participate in this research as they learn laboratory skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The field of tissue engineering is working toward the creation of artificial tissues and organs to replace or repair organs that are losing function due to damage or aging.  Tissue engineering requires three key components: 1) live cells that enact the biological functions of the tissue, 2) a scaffold that binds the cells, provides support, and correctly positions the cells in three dimensions, and 3) proteins that control key cell behaviors, such as cell attachment, growth, migration, death, and development of a specific cell identity.  Common approaches used to generate scaffolds will either damage proteins, or loose the proteins over time.      The Bondos lab discovered new materials that provide a flexible platform for displaying active proteins.  These materials are also composed of protein, the Drosophila melanogaster protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx).  In bacteria, Ubx can be produced and chemically fused to proteins that control cell behavior.  As part of this award, the Bondos lab demonstrated that adding these other proteins did not hamper the ability of Ubx to form materials, even if the added protein was very large, unstable, charged, or capable of formed dimers or tetramers.  The proteins added to Ubx also remained active once incorporated into materials.  Several proteins that stimulate different aspects of blood vessel formation were incorporated into Ubx materials and tested.     These proteins can bind cells and initiate a cascade of cell signaling events that enables cells to change their behavior.  These experiments used proteins that stimulate endothelial cells to form blood vessels.  The Bondos lab collaborated with Dr. Kayla Bayless?s lab to demonstrate that functionalized Ubx materials, but not plain Ubx materials, can guide the direction of growth of pre-existing blood vessels, and can stimulate formation of new blood vessels in both chicken embryos.     Not only do the proteins that stimulate blood vessel formation continue to function in materials, but the proteins that are most effective at stimulating blood vessel formation as free proteins are also the most effective once embedded in the materials.  Only a small fraction of Ubx proteins had to carry a blood vessel-stimulating protein in order to achieve the standard cellular response.  Consequently, it is possible to include Ubx fused to different proteins to achieve a more complex and stable response.  We have optimized the relative concentration of several functional proteins on Ubx materials, and these "combo" materials stimulate formation of stable blood vessels in adult mice.     An important aspect of these studies was demonstrating that Ubx materials are safe for use in live animals.  We have cultured a variety of cell types on Ubx materials and did not observe any signs of toxicity.  We also implanted un-modified Ubx materials in mice, and did not observe any signs of an immune response, which could be harmful.       Finally, the strength and extensibility of Ubx materials are similar to that of normal extracellular matrix.  This important trait facilitates normal cell-material interactions.  We have identified the components of Ubx proteins that are responsible for their strength and extensibility, and demonstrated that we can tune these mechanical properties by altering the amino acid sequence of Ubx.     Collaboration with an undergraduate laboratory class at the University of Houston enabled &gt;400 undergraduate students to participate in research, an activity that is generally limited by the number of available positions.  The University of Houston has a large fraction of under-represented racial minority students.  This experience dramatically improved student enthusiasm and course outcomes for the students.  Some students from this class also completed summer internships in the Bondos lab, and become authors on research papers and patents as a result of their work.
