<AbstractNarration>Model-proxy comparison is a cornerstone of climate change science.  This project introduces a new, quantitative approach to model-proxy comparison for application to the new and rapidly developing field of transient climate modeling.  The approach expands applicability of model-proxy comparisons to a broader research community and the range of proxy records that can be used in comparison with model results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the work involves a collaborative effort between investigators at Brown University, the University of Wisconsin, and the Institute of Earth's Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Xian.  A fully-coupled climate model (Community Climate System Model-version 3; CCSM3) will be run in time-dependent mode using accelerated insolation forcing in order to simulate the evolution of climate during two key intervals in Earth history, the past 300,000 years (a time of high-amplitude climate variability related to changing greenhouse gases, polar ice sheets and sea level) and 3.142 to 2.842 million years ago (an interval of time with the same insolation forcing but much smaller amplitude changes in greenhouse gases, ice sheets, and sea level).  These two model experiments and their component forcings will be compared to one another to study the sensitivity of the model-produced climate to changing ice volume and greenhouse gases with an emphasis on tropical surface temperatures and monsoonal circulation.  The model results will also be compared to previously published records of surface temperature and monsoonal circulation from marine and terrestrial geological archives.  This comparison will focus specifically on the timing (phase) of changes in surface temperature and monsoonal circulation relative to changes in insolation (orbital), ice volume and greenhouse gases.  This focus on comparing the phase of the climate response in the model and proxy records leverages the fact that phase is a robust metric that can be quantified from a wide range of proxies.  Successful model-proxy comparisons serve to validate model reliability and promote confidence in the use of models for identifying the underlying physics of climate change. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Model results will be widely available and archived at the NOAA/NCDC World Data Center. Funding supports a full time graduate student at Brown University, who will work closely with a full time post-doctoral researcher at CAS (no cost to this project). This interaction will ensure an in-depth experience in climate modeling for the student and experience in geological proxy generation and analysis for the post-doctoral researcher.  Fostering this close collaborative approach, including oversight and scientific leadership by the senior researchers, is crucial to furthering the synergistic integration of researchers from these two fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nearly every nation on Earth is concerned about the extent of future climate change and is currently seeking means of slowing down and/or mitigating the effects of climate change.  A great deal of our knowledge about how much, how fast, and why Earth?s climate does change comes from analyzing records of past climates preserved in geological archives such as ice sheets, deep ocean sediments, lake sediments, and continental sediments.  Past changes in climate are reconstructed on the basis of physical, chemical, biological, and isotope analyses of materials recovered from these archives.  For example, reconstructed temperatures (from deep sea sediments) and atmospheric carbon dioxide (from ice cores) has documented the close relationships between greenhouse gasses and global warming.  These reconstructions of ancient climate change also provide a means of testing the numerical models used to predict future climate change, testing and improving our understanding of the physics responsible changing climate.  This research focused on comparing model simulations of surface temperature to proxy surface temperature reconstructions spanning the past 300,000 years, an interval of time characterized by very large changes in climate associated with changes in carbon dioxide and northern hemisphere ice volume (the Ice Ages).  Our goal was to determine if the numerical simulation results match the results from proxy reconstructions of surface temperature using the geological record.  In the case of positive results, we can place increased confidence in results of numerical models.  In the case of negative results, further research may be required to diagnose and understand the differences.  To accomplish these goals we gathered together all the existing temperature reconstructions from around the world (~50) that span the past 300,000 years from both land and ocean sites.  For the modeling component, we used version 3 of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM) in a unique and novel way to simulate Earth?s climate evolution over the past 300,000 years.  Because it is not possible, even with modern super computers, to do such a simulation in real time, we accelerated the model forcing by 100 times, advancing the solar, greenhouse gas, and global ice volume forcing by 100 years for each model year, turning a 3,000 year simulation into a 300,000 year simulation with realistic boundary conditions.  Knowing that the deep ocean, which has slow circulation times, could not achieve even quasi-equilibrium (could not keep up) under these conditions, we restricted our model-proxy comparison to surface temperature.  Our results were both encouraging and discouraging.  We were encouraged by the fact that the model produced surface temperature records that replicate all the features documented in reconstructions from geological archives on the land and ocean.  In particular, the model produced records with concentrations of variance at the primary earth-orbital bands known to influence changes in surface temperature, as well as variance associated with the non-linear interaction of variance at these orbital bands (heterodynes).  This heterodyne type of variance is well-known in nature and well-replicated in the model and in the proxy reconstructions.  These positive findings let us know that we are on the right track and that the proxy-model approach is valid and can be a powerful tool in better understanding how and why climate changes over time.   The negative component of the findings was that the proxy data provide a clear indication that changes in surface temperature on Earth are very sensitive to changes in greenhouse gasses (carbon dioxide and methane) and high-latitude ice volume over the past 300,000 years whereas the model results indicate a closer relationship to direct solar forcing.  This same CCSM3 model, and nearly all other models, show strong sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing when run to equilibrium.  It is unclear whether the disagreement results from the CCSM3 being too sensitive to insolation forcing/not sensitive enough greenhouse gas forcings during particular climate states (e.g. glacial versus interglacial) or from the fact that the climate model&ndash;particularly the intermediate ocean&ndash;doesn?t respond properly to the accelerated forcing, with consequent impact on the surface mixed layer.  Research to disentangle these possibilities will require simulations with shorter (20x) acceleration and an examination of the sensitivity to insolation and greenhouse gas forcing as a function of climate state.
