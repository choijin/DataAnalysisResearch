<AbstractNarration>The Ensuring Early Mathematics Success for STEM Majors (EEMS) initiative integrates academic support and intervention services to increase graduation rates among 1) STEM majors who transfer from other institutions, 2) incoming freshmen at risk of failing first-year mathematics courses, and 3) students in the general population who underperform in first-year and subsequent mathematics courses. In order to improve student performance and reduce the risk of course failure, attrition, or increased time to degree  the EEMS initiative includes summer bridge programs for transferring STEM majors and entering freshman STEM majors at risk of failing first-year mathematics courses  and Peer-led Team Learning (PLTL) for all STEM majors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EEMS Initiative seeks to increase persistence rates among the identified at-risk groups to match the current first-year STEM major persistence rate (80.9%), which will produce an increase of at least 66 STEM graduates per year. Underrepresented minority students are overrepresented among these at risk students, suggesting the program will have a proportionally larger impact on retention and graduation rates for this group. In addition to traditional journal and conference venues for dissemination, faculty from institutions in the Urban Massachusetts LSAMP and other interested institutions are invited to observe the program and participate in PLTL workshops.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

To check on student progress prior to graduation, this project tracked student grades and retention rates as well.  The project established the following two programs: 1)    Summer Bridge Program (SBP). Every summer since 2013, a pool of incoming STEM students were identified and invited to join our in-person Summer Bridge Program (SBP). The main points of this program were to prepare students for their first college math course and acclimate them to Wentworth.    We found that a majority of the SBP students are better prepared for their first year math courses. All SBP students had higher average Engineering Calculus I grades than the rest of the students taking this course who did not participate in SBP (3.1 vs. 2.8 for Fall 2013; 3.3 vs. 2.7 for Fall 2014; 2.8 vs 2.6 for Fall 2015; 3.1 vs. 2.5 for Fall 2016; 2.4 vs. 2.3 for Fall 2017). Similarly, all SBP students in years 2014&shy;-2016 had higher average Engineering Calculus II grades in the Spring of 2014, 2015, and 2016 than the rest of the students taking this course who did not participate in the SBP (2.8 vs. 2.4 for Spring 2014; 2.8 vs. 2.6 for Spring 2015; 3.0 vs 2.5 for Spring 2016; 3.0 vs 2.4 for Spring 2017).  Please note, however, that the first engineering group (Summer 2013) fared worse in Engineering Calculus 2 than their peers who did not participate in the Summer Program (with mean GPAs of 2.3 versus 2.5). The graduation rates of the SBP students may be higher than Wentworth as a whole. Wentworth's overall 6&shy; year graduation rate is 65% as of Fall 2016. Since this project?s earliest cohort is from 2013, there is only a 4 year graduation rate to consider and currently that is 16 out of 26 or 62% for the SBP. The PIs  expect that 4 other students who are still at Wentworth (as of Dec. 2017) will graduate no later than 2019 (or no later than 6 years after they started).  If they do then the six year graduation rate of the 2013 cohort will be 79% (higher than the overall school's graduation rate). 2)    Student-run "Learning Labs" during the fall and spring semesters:The PIs investigated various methods of supporting first year STEM students in their first year math courses with different forms of supplemental instruction with student tutors. As a result of this exploration, the PIs settled, in 2015, on creating "Learning Labs" for Engineering Calculus I (during the Fall semesters) and Engineering Calculus II (during the Spring semesters). These are weekly sessions held by student tutors outside of class that first year students taking calculus can voluntarily attend for extra math support.  Please note, in presenting our data below, we are comparing students who attended Learning Labs (LLs) with a control cohort of those students that did not attend LLs. Students in the LL group had better retention at WIT: students who attend LLs are more likely to stay at WIT through the end of their second year.  Also the average grade in Engineering Calculus II was 2.58 for LL cohort vs. 2.48 in the control cohort, despite no difference in Engineering Calculus I grades. Specifically,   -the Fall 2015 LL Engineering Calculus I average grade was 2.61 vs 2.65 for the control group. -the Spring 2016 LL Engineering Calculus II  average grade was 2.58 vs 2.48 for the control group. The PIs have convinced Wentworth to continue funding the Learning Lab initiative past the end of the grant.   Finally, this project has provided intensive tutor training for 60 undergraduate students, math preparation for 138 summer bridge students and more than 628 individual students who attended Learning Labs as well as 5 presentations and 3 poster presentations at national conferences by the PIs.
