<AbstractNarration>The objective of the REU Site at UNC Charlotte is to implement effective practices to engage a diverse&lt;br/&gt;group of undergraduate students in computing research. Undergraduate students will actively pursue&lt;br/&gt;research that applies human-computer interaction (HCI) concepts to advance the state of the art in a&lt;br/&gt;particular field, including pervasive computing, computer vision, data visualization, social networks, and&lt;br/&gt;serious games. Each research project has a socially relevant theme, providing students with the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to apply and extend their computing knowledge to address problems that have a real-world&lt;br/&gt;impact. The site emphasizes participation of promising students from underrepresented groups in&lt;br/&gt;computing and from institutions that have limited research programs. To help students become rapidly&lt;br/&gt;immersed in the culture of research and to prepare them for meaningful research experiences, the site&lt;br/&gt;cultivates an authentic community of practice that values the contributions of REU students as&lt;br/&gt;researchers, and provides REU participants with explicit, just-in-time training in research skills at a&lt;br/&gt;weekly workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the REU students? contributions to the discovery and&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of innovative, interactive computing solutions to address problems of interest in society;&lt;br/&gt;specific projects may address open problems in the fields of computer vision, pervasive computing, data&lt;br/&gt;visualization, social networks, and serious games. The broader impact of this project lies in the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to introduce talented students from underrepresented populations to computing research and&lt;br/&gt;in the potential to increase the enrollment of domestic students in doctoral computing programs.</AbstractNarration>
