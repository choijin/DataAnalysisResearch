<AbstractNarration>The Shippensburg University Scholarships for Educational Achievement in STEM (Ship-SEA-STEM) program recruits academically talented students from economically disadvantaged and under-represented populations, including first generation college students, students from rural populations, and minority populations and retains these students in STEM disciplines using evidence-based strategies to support and motivate the students. The Ship-SEA-STEM program is providing three cohorts of select scholars with a comprehensive suite of financial assistance, support services, internship placements, and research opportunities. Using a variety of directed team-building experiences, which include a scientific writing course, workshops, retreats, research, and internships, the Ship-SEA-STEM program strives to increase motivation, enhance self-esteem, encourage learning, teach students how to problem solve, collaborate, and develop professional relationships. The Ship-SEA-STEM  project seeks to build a culture of success among the target populations at Shippensburg University.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Ship-SEA-STEM program recruited 3 cohorts (a total of 47 students) throughout the granting period. Overall retention of scholars within the SEA-STEM program was 51% (24/47 students; all cohorts); with an additional 13% of scholars successfully being retained in their disciplines with academic success (but lost to the program due to financial aid changes).&nbsp; Another 15% of SEA-STEM scholars did not maintain the required GPA for the scholarship program, but still graduated in their chosen STEM field.&nbsp; While these numbers fall short of the goal to retain 90% of the students within our program, the retention rate within our disciplines represents a notable improvement compared with both national and Shippensburg University data. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES; <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014001rev.pdf">https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014001rev.pdf</a>) report published in 2014 indicates that STEM attrition rates for bachelor?s degree students entering a STEM program in 2003-2009 was 48% (indicating 52% were retained).&nbsp; During the grant period at Shippensburg University, retention within the disciplines was as high as 65% for students not in the program when allowing up to 6 years for graduation.&nbsp; Comparison of retention in the discipline for students that participated in the SEA-STEM program for at least some portion of their time at Shippensburg University (79%) demonstrated higher retention rates. Within our SEA-STEM program, implementation of additional supportive programs to help struggling students did have a positive effect on student performance in their respective disciplines, but it was generally not sufficient to allow them to meet the minimum requirements necessary to retain their scholarship. One requirement that stands out is the minimum required 3.2 GPA for scholars to retain their support. A small change in this requirement (to a minimum of 3.0) would have positively impacted our ability to retain scholars while still effectively preparing them for their respective fields of study. Throughout the grant period, numerous support programs&nbsp;and team building activities were developed and offered to SEA-STEM scholars. Programs offered included a STEM specific session during the University?s Academic Day, a meet and greet session for scholars, mentors and STEM department faculty, a variety of forums (focused on careers, development of successful time management and study skills and undergraduate research opportunities), a STEM specific Scientific Communication course and an annual retreat. Of the programming offered throughout the granting period, participation in student-faculty undergraduate research was the activity with the highest involvement with Twenty SEA-STEM scholars participating. Additionally, 9 previous SEA STEM scholars (who left the program for various reasons and at different times) also participated in faculty/student research projects. This significant degree of participation demonstrates the importance of this high impact activity on student success. Scholars presented their research at conferences (local, state and national meetings) and applied for and received support for their work through different programs (SU Undergraduate Research Program and the SU Summer Undergraduate Research experience program). When reviewing scholar?s participation in all offered programming, 58% of the scholars actively participated in the activities offered throughout each academic year. The remaining scholars declined to participate in SEA STEM specific programming citing additional commitments (personal, academic and athletic) that did not allow time to engage in these activities. Those scholars retained in the program (24) successfully graduated with a degree in a STEM discipline; with 17 either successfully employed in a STEM discipline or pursing post-graduate study in their STEM field of interest. The remaining 7 students are either currently still seeking employment, employed in another field (non-STEM related) or did not respond in reference to their post graduate plans. Three specific areas were chosen for program assessment: SEA-STEM specific scientific communication course, annual retreats, and senior exit interviews. Evaluation of the Scientific Communication course indicated the highest rated impact was learning standards and conventions of scientific writing while reading and analyzing primary literature, designing effective presentations, and adjusting writing style for different purposes/audiences also received positive feedback.&nbsp; Student comments pointed out the value of experience with different writing styles and increased confidence in writing skills, as well as the chance to create relationships with other SEA-STEM scholars. Retreat assessment indicated that retreats were an extremely positive experience, with scholars stating retreats provided activities designed to support academic success.&nbsp;Balancing this additional programming with other demands on the students? time did prove to be a challenge however. Finally, graduating scholars were requested to participate in a face to face exit survey with the grant PI (Lehman) with 15 (of the remaining 24) completing the request.
