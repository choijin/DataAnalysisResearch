<AbstractNarration>I/UCRC for Sustainably Integrated Buildings and Sites (SIBS) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1161031 University of North Carolina at Charlotte; Robert Cox &lt;br/&gt;1161017 Carnegie Mellon University; Volker Hartkopf &lt;br/&gt;1160872 CUNY City College; Robert Paaswell &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Sustainably Integrated Buildings and Sites (SIBS) would bring together a disparate set of stakeholders (i.e. building owners and operators, component manufacturers, designers, utility providers, etc.) to develop a research agenda focused on the interaction between buildings and their environment. This is an interaction that involves several resource flows (i.e. energy, water, materials, and air) and occurs at scales that affect individual buildings and the community at large. Carnegie Mellon University and the CUNY City College are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this planning project is to initiate formal partnership with various industry partners and government/non-governmental agencies that have an interest in creating a more sustainable built environment. The research themes at the proposed IUCRC are aimed at the industry need to respond to regulatory and public demands for minimizing virgin material use, water use, non-renewable energy use, and waste generation, and also at the societal need to protect the natural systems that support human life. The proposed Center will be multi-disciplinary in nature and independent of any one department, school or college. SIBS plans to leverage opportunities and funding from technology commercialization offices and business incubators in North Carolina, New York, and Pennsylvania. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impact includes the enhancement of R&amp;D and technology transfer infrastructure for the buildings industry, student training (including minority students) in an area that is likely to grow over the next several decades, and workforce training through an annual education and outreach programs for member company employees. Additionally, long term economic impact is expected through potential spin-off companies and increased revenue for existing companies. The proposed center has a broad and deep education and outreach program that includes graduate and undergraduate researchers on all projects. In addition, the PIs intend to use various mechanisms to disseminate SIBS research results to practitioners and students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for Sustainably Integrated Buildings and Sites (SIBS) was established in 2012 as Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC).  The Center was originally a partnership between UNC Charlotte, the City College of New York (CCNY), and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  Several companies and government agencies were engaged, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Ingersoll Rand, the City of Charlotte, Atrium Health, the New York Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS), Vornado Realty Trust, and Concept3D.   Buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of all primary energy consumption in the United States, and studies have shown that much of this energy is wasted due to poor design and operations.    The primary vision of the Center was to focus on research that minimized this waste and ultimately minimized the impact of the built environment on the natural environment.  Given that the primary industry partners owned and/or operated large real-estate portfolios, much of the research focused on activities that improved the energy performance and efficiency of real buildings.  Center researchers monitored the as-built performance of many buildings and used their results to show how measured data can improve the design and operation of real buildings.  The primary target facilities were commercial offices and acute-care hospitals.   Research results have been reported in over 40 peer-reviewed journal and conference publications.   The Center had a major impact on the development of future generations.  Over its lifetime, the Center supported more than two dozen undergraduate researchers and approximately one dozen graduate students.  Some of these students are now employed by major research and development firms.  A large contingent now work in architectural and engineering firms where they apply their knowledge to design buildings that support the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable world.  Many of these students identified as women or underrepresented minorities.   The Center had a unique impact on developing training programs for those individuals that operate the major systems in real buildings.  The Center has developed an effort that shows so-called building operators how data can reduce energy consumption.  Traditionally, such operators have received little or no training for such activities.  These programs have had a major impact.  A large health-care provider has achieved significant savings as a result, and Center researchers soon plan to develop the program into a new educational offering provided to the general public.   The Center continues to operate as a graduated I/UCRC, and the researchers continue to partner with companies and government agencies to improve the energy performance of real buildings.
