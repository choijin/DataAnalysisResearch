<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Amanda Haes of the University of Iowa will exploit the plasmonic properties of gold nanorods encapsulated in chromatographic-like silica membranes for selective transport and subsequent surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of small molecules and anti-cancer drugs without the use of traditional receptor based surface chemistry. Importantly, the diffusion and transport of the target molecules will be systematically investigated using principles that typically guide chromatographic separations. SERS detection will be dictated via molecular diffusion and transport through the chromatographic-like silica membrane to the metal core of the solution-phase nanostructures and is expected to be promoted by the double layer thickness and charge states of the molecules and silica membranes. Direct molecular detection with (1) identification, (2) quantification, and (3) signal amplification vs. normal Raman signals are expected thereby opening up possibilities of trace drug and biomolecule detection. The broader impacts include mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students. New hands-on scientific activities for elementary students will be developed, reinforcing the excitement of chemistry in these young, impressionable students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work would advance general nanomaterials surface chemistry design strategies for understanding the transport and direct small molecule detection in complex sample matrices. The unique tunability of this surface chemistry modification approach could have significant impacts on applications of these materials in the fields of biomedical and environmental sensing as well as forensics.</AbstractNarration>
