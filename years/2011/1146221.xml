<AbstractNarration>Malaria kills nearly a million people a year, mostly young children. There is no vaccine against malaria and currently used anti-malarial drugs face several challenges. Malaria is caused by parasites called Plasmodium, which are transmitted to humans via mosquito bites. Inside the human body, Plasmodium's first act is to infect the liver. Inside the liver cells, each parasite divides to form tens of thousands of more parasites in just 2-3 weeks, which are eventually released into the blood.  How does the parasite control this remarkable process? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator has previously discovered an enzyme that is essential for Plasmodium's development in the liver. Without it, parasites are "arrested" within the liver cell. In this project, the investigator will use molecular biology, genetics and advanced microscopy to reveal the exact function of the enzyme. The investigator will determine the genes that are turned on or off in response to the enzyme, and identify the proteins that partner with this enzyme to enable the parasite's development in the liver. This knowledge gained by this project will, in the future, help scientists design new ways to block the parasite's infection of the liver and treat malaria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carrying out this work at the New Jersey Medical School will introduce underrepresented undergraduate, graduate and medical students from the Newark area to biomedical research.  The project will include local undergraduate and high schools students recruited through summer internship programs, with a view towards developing a life-long interest in the scientific enterprise.</AbstractNarration>
