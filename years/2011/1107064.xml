There is great evidence to suggest that worldwide dependence on nonrenewable, carbon based resources (oil, gas and coal) has had negative environmental effects. This is compounded with economic instability, as new deposits of these resources must continuously be located and mined- a task that grows in difficulty as current reserves are depleted. The science of water splitting offers appealing attributes as an alternative fuel source. The supply is the most abundant resource on the planet, the product (H2) is environmentally friendly and already widely used in industrial processes; hence, cost of infrastructure adjustment to a hydrogen economy is minimal. However, the energy required to split water is large- more than that obtained from product hydrogen. Large scale electrolysis of water is thus not cost-friendly.  Yet every day, plants split water as part of photosynthesis, at only the cost of sunlight.  My research is dedicated to implementing the chemistry of plants in order to create practical, low cost devices which split water spontaneously. In all plant life, the same small cluster of metals (calcium and manganese- highly abundant) serves as the catalytic site to convert water to oxygen. This cluster has a geometry which resembles a cube- hence, we focus on making molecules with cubic topologies.  To study how to apply our catalysts in real life: on electrodes, fuel cells, and solar cells, we collaborate extensively with Dr. Gerhard Swiegers at the Intelligent Polymer Research Institute in the Australian Institute for Innovative Materials at UOW, headed by Dr. Gordon Wallace.
