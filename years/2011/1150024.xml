<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to recreate the functionality of a natural ion channel using a solid-state nanopore. Natural ion channels are limited to narrow ranges of temperature and pH, limiting their usability for biosensing applications which are now emerging. Replacing natural ion channels with electrostatically controllable solid-state nanopores enables operation of biosensors in a wide range of environmental conditions. The transformative aspect of the project is the ability to create a channel that is reconfigurable via electric fields generated through an arrangement of embedded electrodes in a particular geometry at the nanoscale level. Combined with the use of electroactive polymers which enable the amplification of the nanopore on/off ratio, the proposed platform will be universal and not limited to one particular application.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the ability to perform fundamental studies of ionic and molecular translocation through a nanopore, helping to gain insight into how permeation can be controlled on the nanoscale. Using electrostatic fields inside the nanopore, molecules can be temporarily docked and released, allowing reconfigurable and reusable sensors.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are on molecular filtration, biosensing, and localized drug release and thus potentially improve society at large. The proposed transdisciplinary research will be integrated as an emerging technology into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum. The proposed middle and high school outreach program modules will expose students to critical physical concepts underlying the proposed research, including electric fields, surface tension and low noise electronics.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project started out to answer the following question: Is it possible to construct a device that behaves like a natural ion channel, which opens and closes based on an electrical potential difference.&nbsp; Natural ion channels are complex protein with sizes of only a few nanometers and sophisticated mechanisms providing the gating functionality. In this project, we aimed to re-build such a natural ion channel using silicon technology,&nbsp; the same technology that is behind the chips that provide the processing power for computers and smartphones or harvest sunlight. Silicon is an abundant material and the technology is well established. However, this project has been pushing the frontiers of miniaturization. We developed a technology that allows very thin aluminum oxide layers to act as etch masks for our nanopores, allowing us more flexibility to create pores of different length. Reaching down to the single nanometer sizes of natural nanopores with what we call Solid State Nanopores is still challenging, but we were able to solve this problem by using polymers that grow inside the nanopores. These polymers have the particular feature that they expand and contract depending on the pH of the solution that surrounds them. In the project, we were able to replicate the action of a change in pH by applying a voltage bias to a thin silicon layer that sits on top of a glass insulator. This causes the polymer to block the nanopore partially, changing its resistance, which is what a natural ion channel does as well. Thus, we were able to realize what can be called a "Nanofluidic Transistor". Besides controlling an ion current, this device can be used to trap and study molecules, for example new pharmaceutical compounds. Just change the size and makeup of the polymer and the nanopore can act as a customizable, electrically controllable nano-tweezer.</p> <p>However, during the project we also learned about the limitations of the currently available silicon technology. One issue is the leakage current from the silicon into our fluidic channel. While the absolute value is very small, on the order of one nano-ampere, it is of the same size as the ion current through the nanopore. In order to study the behavior of the polymer inside the nanopore, which cannot easily be investigated using a microscope, we used Electrochemical&nbsp;Impedance&nbsp;Spectroscopy. That enabled us to come up with an equivalent electrical circuit schematic, assigning capacitances and resistances to specific parts of the nanopore and polymer layer. This model allowed us to study the properties of the polymer layer without being affected by other effects like the substrate leakage current. Based on our impedance spectroscopy studies and our collaboration with Chemical Engineers on the polymers, we were able to launch a study into the energy storage properties of biocompatible Hydrogel layers. These findings could have a potential impact on implantable diagnostic and therapeutic devices that need small power sources.</p> <p>With us making use of impedance spectroscopy up to a frequency of 1MHz, we realized that there is no amplifier on the market that can measure very small currents at high frequencies. The Impedance spectroscopy unit solves this problem by applying a large AC signal that can potentially destroy polymers and molecules held inside the nanopore. Thus, we designed a broadband amplifier that has a very low noise level and measures current in the pico-ampere range up to a frequency of 20 MHz. The amplifier uses common radio-frequency components and can be built very compact. This technology has the potential to make a significant impact in the Electrophysiology community, allowing researchers to study fast effects that were not visible before.
