<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit.  &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction constitutes an important research goal for biological scientists.  Work with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has revealed that a given signaling molecule has the potential to process information in response to a wide range of different stimuli.  For example, the MAP kinase protein MPK6 from Arabidopsis is known to be involved in signaling pathways related to biotic stress, abiotic stress, cell fate determination, and cell division.  This observation raises the important experimental question of how one protein can properly interpret and process information from a variety of different inputs.  One proposed mechanism for achieving this type of pathway specificity invokes the concept of spatial compartmentalization.  In this model, molecules of the MPK6 kinase that are activated by a biotic stressor would be restricted to one subcellular location, while MPK6 molecules responding to cell division cues would be located in another.  To directly test the role that spatial regulation plays in MAP kinase signaling, it is necessary to have some type of tool for visualizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of MAP kinase activity within living cells.  Fluorescent biosensor molecules that monitor MAP kinase activity provide one solution to this challenge, and they have recently been developed for monitoring human MAP kinases.  For this project a fluorescent biosensor that will be able to measure the activity of the Arabidopsis MAP kinase MPK6 will be developed.  With Arabidopsis, it is possible to observe with a confocal microscope an intact, living organism.  In addition, with Arabidopsis the full power of genetic analysis can brought to bear on future experiments involving the type of kinase activity sensor that will be developed.  An MPK6 biosensor will, for the first time, provide researchers with a tool for monitoring at the subcellular level the spatial and temporal dynamics of protein kinase activity in a living Arabidopsis plant. Because MPK6 plays a role in a large number of signaling pathways, such a tool would be of wide interest to the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. &lt;br/&gt;The MPK6 biosensor that it is planned to produce has the potential to be widely used by members of the plant signal transduction community. In addition, this project will provide training opportunities for two post-doctoral fellows, one PhD student, and one undergraduate. The postdocs hired to work on this project will serve as the mentors for the undergraduate student, which will provide the postdocs with valuable mentoring experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to develop a genetically-encoded sensor that would allow us to study MAP kinase signal transduction in living plants using live-cell imaging methods.  The reason for pursing this project is that current methods for studying the activation of proein kinases in plants all involve grinding up the plant tissue, extracting proteins, and testing the kinases in vitro.  Although a wealth of valuable information has been obtained using these methods, it is clear that significant new advances in our understanding could be achieved if we were able to study protein kinase activation in living cells in real-time.  In order to accomplish this we develop a type of biosensor that uses Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to report whether or not a substrate region of the sensor has been phosphorylated by a protein kinase.  In our case, we designed a biosensor that reports on the activity of the Arabidopsis protein kinase MPK6.  To achieve this accomplishment, we first developed an in vitro system that allowed us to screen through a number of candidate biosensor constructs in order to obtain one that performed the best.  We then went on to create transgenic plants expressing this biosensor and were able to demonstrate that it was indeed able to report changes in MAP kinase activity in living plants when obserbed using a confocal microscope.  The novel tool that we have developed will now allow us to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of MAP kinase activation in living plants in response to a number of different stimuli.  This information will in turn improve our understranding of how plants sense and respond to their environment.       Last Modified: 08/28/2015       Submitted by: Patrick J Krysan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
