<AbstractNarration>Animals at high altitudes use a variety of mechanisms to acquire sufficient oxygen despite low atmospheric pressure. Individual animals can shift their respiratory strategies in real time, just as humans increase the concentration and size of red blood cells during high-altitude training. Alternatively, high-altitude populations can genetically adapt by natural selection over generations, effectively optimizing their respiratory systems for low ambient oxygen pressure. This project will characterize the high-altitude respiratory strategies of dozens of wild bird species. Study taxa comprise pairs of related high-altitude and low-altitude populations at different levels of evolutionary divergence. International teams will sample birds along elevational gradients in the Andes to evaluate the structure and performance of critical respiratory system components, including heart, lungs, blood, hemoglobin, and the hypoxia-induced gene-expression cascade. With these data, this project will (1) develop a model of the time-course of high-altitude adaptation and (2) describe the diversity of solutions to this common physiological challenge. This new model and comparative data will facilitate inference of biogeographic history through integration of physiological and phylogenetic information. The results will reveal the contribution of respiratory specialization to the uniqueness and diversity of the Andean avifauna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American and Peruvian students will develop international partnerships during the project's research expeditions. Specimens and linked data will be archived in museum collections and online databases. Andean bird lineages provide analogues to high-altitude human populations and their hypoxia defense mechanisms are of broad interest due to the profound role of hypoxia in human pathology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project made several discoveries about how birds adapt to their environments, particularly in the high mountains of South America. These discoveries were detailed in 28 peer-reviewed articles that have been published to date, with several more in the late stages of completion. Several of these articles have been published in general-topic journals such as PNAS or Science, which is indicative of broad implications for our understanding of evolution. The project helped to forge novel links between DNA and the geographic ranges of species. Ultimately, these discoveries will help us to understand what evolved characteristics cause a species to live where it lives.</p> <p>This project contributed several thousand high-quality, data-rich specimens of birds and their frozen tissues to museum collections at the University of New Mexico and in Peru. These museum collections have already been subject to 64 tissue loans to researchers around the world, which suggests that they will have a strong and long-lasting positive impact on science. Subcomponents of this project encompassed theses and dissertations of several graduate students who completed their degrees, as well as undergraduate and postbaccalaureate students who gained research experience and went to graduate school; these students included Native American and Hispanic students. Several Peruvian students partnered with American students on international collaborative field expeditions to remote parts of Peru. In addition to the open-access specimens and student training, this project contribued several other broader impacts related to teaching and outreach. The PI development of an interdisciplinary course, High Altitude Biology, that was taught to 108 undergraduate students at the University of New Mexico.
