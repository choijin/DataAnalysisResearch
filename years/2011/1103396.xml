<AbstractNarration>This project will continue and augment US representation to the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) through some salary support to the US VP, Jackie Grebmeier, and travel support for both Jackie and US working group members to attend IASC and related meetings.  The proposal will also allow Sara Bowden to provide full time support to three of the five IASC working groups.  IASC is currently undergoing internal restructuring and revitalizing in response to a recent external review.  The 10 US working group members ? two per disciplinary area of Marine, Atmosphere, Terrestrial, Cryosphere, and Social Science ? have recently attended their first IASC meeting in Potsdam and join an international team purposed with the task of synthesizing, coordinating, and, to a small extent, supporting broadly interdisciplinary, international research in the Arctic.  The proposal requests travel funds for the working groups members to allow them to meet biannually and advance the IASC scientific agenda.</AbstractNarration>
