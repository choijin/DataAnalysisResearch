<AbstractNarration>The shift to an ever-increasing number of processing cores--within a&lt;br/&gt;single socket in consumer devices and across multiple sockets in&lt;br/&gt;servers--has brought interconnects to the forefront of the challenges&lt;br/&gt;facing the computing industry. While evidence suggests that&lt;br/&gt;alternatives to conventional metal interconnects will be needed to&lt;br/&gt;meet future performance demands and power constraints, research in&lt;br/&gt;these areas has been largely limited in scope to specific areas of the&lt;br/&gt;computing stack, and little progress has been made across problem&lt;br/&gt;sub-domains.  Thus, there is a dire need for holistic research efforts&lt;br/&gt;spanning the stack from physics to systems, and that produce&lt;br/&gt;prototypes and development tools that are of much greater&lt;br/&gt;sophistication than exist today in order to enable commercial&lt;br/&gt;adoption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Emerging Technologies for Interconnects will bring&lt;br/&gt;together key researchers, industry developers, and program managers in&lt;br/&gt;order to define an agenda for the research and commercial adoption of&lt;br/&gt;emerging interconnect technologies.  Presentations and discussions on&lt;br/&gt;the "state of the state-of-the-art" of emerging technologies for&lt;br/&gt;interconnects will be followed by break-out sessions and discussions.&lt;br/&gt;These sessions will identify and articulate the key research&lt;br/&gt;challenges, and potentially most promising solutions/directions, and&lt;br/&gt;chart the recommended larger-scale national strategy and research&lt;br/&gt;agenda.  The broader impact will be the elimination of the key</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microprocessor chips consist of a number of processing cores.  With each new generation of process technology, more cores can be put on the chip, and the number of cores is increasing exponentially over time.  These cores need to communicate among themselves and with memory and do so through interconnects on the chip and between chips. The progression to hundreds to thousands of cores on a single chip is leading to a communications wall, where computer systems can no longer scale in performance, cost, energy efficiency, and programmability to support future applications due to discrepancies between computation (cores) and communication (their interconnects among themselves and with memory).    The Workshop on Emerging Technologies for Interconnects (WETI) brought together leaders from academia, industry, and government to define an agenda for the research and commercial adoption of emerging interconnect technologies that hold the promise of much greater power-performance efficiency than conventional metal interconnects.   Significant exchange of ideas occurred and collaborations were fostered among academic and industry researchers.    The workshop report presents a research agenda for addressing the communications wall problem.  The following summarizes the findings of the workshop:  1. There is no "magic bullet" at any one layer of the communication stack that will solve the communications bottleneck.  Rather, a holistic research approach should be supported that spans the entire stack from devices to algorithms/applications.  2. Research is needed in NoC architectures for many-core systems, including work in hierarchical, heterogeneous systems employing mixed technologies, network switching approaches, and 3D integration.  3. The memory sub-system bottleneck must be addressed through improving the efficiency of memory data movement throughout the system, from the source (memory cells) to the destination (registers) and at every step along the way.   4. Interconnect network resilience is a significant pending concern, and requires efforts in understanding the defect and failure modes of the components of emerging interconnect technologies, and the development of cross-layer mitigation approaches that are cost effective and energy efficient.  5. Significant work is needed in developing new electrical solutions in the areas of novel circuits, new materials, devices/circuits/architecture co-design, packaging, and power delivery and management.     6. Nanophotonic networks hold great potential and research is required at multiple levels, including novel devices and circuits, network topologies, easing parallel system programmability, power management, and improving resiliency.  7. Significant work on crosscutting modeling tools should be supported, including cost-performance modeling tools and behavioral/cross-domain simulation tools that accelerate design and integration.  8. The creation of industry-relevant photonic technology should be supported by strengthening device and platform fabrication opportunities and forming a national center for nanophotonic platform fabrication.  9. Joint programs should be created with industry (perhaps with SRC mediation) to explore photonic integration opportunities in the definition of processes beyond 22 nm and special customizations at older generations.
