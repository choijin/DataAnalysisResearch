<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports the renewal of an International Research Experiences for Undergraduates (iREU) site between the University of Florida and France for the summers of 2012-2014. This renewal involves Morehouse College, a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI). The U.S. program will be under the overall direction of Professors Adrian E. Roitberg, Valeria D. Kleiman, and Daniel Talham of UF and Professor James P. Brown, of Morehouse College. The focus of the program provides an extended international summer research project in materials chemistry. It starts each year with a spring pre-departure meeting in the US in order to prepare participants for their extended stay abroad. The length of the program allows for meaningful contributions to research projects that will lead to peer review publications with undergraduate co-authorship. US faculty will also be in France each summer to provide on-site mentoring. This is made possible through invited professor positions contributed by French partners. Students are distributed in groups of at least 2 per research site spread over 3 different sites (Paris, Toulouse and Strasbourg) and assigned to research groups according to their previous experience and application statements. The students will have the opportunity to disseminate their research results to a broad audience at the undergraduate poster session at the American Chemical Society National Spring meeting following the summer research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed i-REU Site will provide a high-level research experience, allow the participants a deep cultural immersion with an opportunity to learn another culture, and prepare for the increasing impact of European unification on US science. The very successful partnership with Morehouse College in the US is continuing, which has provided access to a large pool of talented underrepresented minority undergraduates. The impact of this program is measured by the increased number of underrepresented STEM groups participating in the program who are from diverse communities. The majority of the students going to France will not be from the University of Florida. Participants will have previous research experiences with backgrounds in chemistry, biochemistty or physics. As a true exchange program and through a collection of French and UF funding, a similar number of French students will be brought to the US to perform research at UF's chemistry department, increasing the internationalization of the undergraduate and PhD programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The UF/France exchange promotes the progress of science supporting the international education of undergraduate students from everywhere in the US with 12 weeks of research experience in exceptional chemistry laboratories in France. From 2012 to 2016, the international REU program provided 35 US undergraduate students with the opportunity to perform advanced research in three sites in France. Each year between 5-8 US undergraduates were selected, among an applicant pool of 130 students. In addition, (University of Florida/French funding), 38 French students spent 16 weeks in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida contributing to the enhanced internationalization of our domestic programs.</p> <p>The commitment of the PIs, and the objective of this program is to offer that opportunity to enthusiastic and superb undergraduate students coming from racial/ethnically, academically and socially diverse communities.&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact of this program can be gauged by the continuously increasing number of underrepresented chemistry/chemical sciences students applying and participating in the exchange.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;A new holistic approach to the evaluation of applicants allowed us to achieve a high level of participation from URG, with 80% of the cohorts belonging to one of the 3 categories considered (52% from under-represented minority groups, 44% of students are first generation attending college, and 54% of the participants are from institutions without an intensive research level). &nbsp;</p> <p>The exchange program exposed undergraduate students high-level research experiences, allowed its participants a profound cultural immersion with an opportunity to learn another cultures and prepared for the increasing global and diverse scientific community. &nbsp;As one participant described it &ldquo;<em>I learned so many research methods in the program and the REU changed the trajectory of my academic career, since I plan to work again in an international lab in the future and form new relationships/collaborations between domestic and international researchers. Not only was it one of the greatest experiences in my academic career, but it was one of the best in my life</em>."</p> <p>&nbsp;The intellectual merit of this proposal is based in the world-class host laboratories that provide chemistry projects of outstanding quality. After 12 weeks in the laboratory, students have the potential to make important scientific discoveries. One measurable outcome is the number of publications and presentations with undergraduate student participant authorship. The time between the hands-on experience and presentation of their results at the ACS National meeting provides a venue to intellectually mature the learned concepts, to finish loose ends and to gain an overall perspective in the science performed.&nbsp; As expected, time from lab-to-peer reviewed publication is not immediate (about 12-20 months). Between 2012 and 2016 there were many peer-reviewed papers published with i-REU student authorship showing a very healthy rate of publication for the program and indicating the high level of research undertaken by the students as well as the thoughtful projects chosen by the French advisors. In addition to these publications, all students have presented posters at the National meeting of the ACS, in divisions as varied as PMSE, PHYS, CHEM, ORG and CHEMED.</p> <p>An important goal of REU programs is to continue student training in the sciences; an equally important goal is fostering interest in the pursuit of science degrees and career pathways. Overall, 90% of the students are attending or plan to attend graduate school in STEM areas (most in chemistry, but also in biomedical engineering, material science, experimental and molecular medicine).&nbsp; &nbsp;Of those surveyed, 13 had applied for NSF Graduate fellowship and 4 obtained it.&nbsp; These outstanding group of students have a common attribute: they all appreciate the opportunity provided by the i-REU program and acknowledge NSF for helping them become more competitive when applying for fellowships and acceptance in prestigious graduate schools.&nbsp; Some of that appreciation can be read in the following remarks by a participant:</p> <p>"<em>It inspired me to pursue graduate studies. Working in a lab in France reassured my interest in analytical chemistry and provided me with the necessary skills and experience to apply for graduate studies</em>." And <em>"It also opened up many opportunities for me. I disseminated my poster from this REU at different conferences.

The impact of this program can be gauged by the continuously increasing number of underrepresented chemistry/chemical sciences students applying and participating in the exchange.    A new holistic approach to the evaluation of applicants allowed us to achieve a high level of participation from URG, with 80% of the cohorts belonging to one of the 3 categories considered (52% from under-represented minority groups, 44% of students are first generation attending college, and 54% of the participants are from institutions without an intensive research level).
