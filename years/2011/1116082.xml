<AbstractNarration>Data is at the heart of the digital revolution. Changing work habits, increasingly stringent electronic record-keeping mandates, and developments in the health care, energy, and retail sectors all suggest a growing demand for data storage and memories for the foreseeable future. Fast, low-power, ultra-high density, and non-volatile magnetic storage and memory systems are projected to accommodate the bulk of the global data storage needs for decades to come and spawn revolutionary data-intensive computing modalities along the way. Their timely development, however, critically depends on the availability of fast and accurate computational tools capable of simulating electromagnetic field and magnetization dynamics in complete magnetic data storage and memory systems. Unfortunately, current simulators are not up to this task. &lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on the development of high-performance hybrid micro magnetic-electromagnetic simulators for modeling next-generation magnetic memory and data storage systems. The simulators leverage analytically preconditioned time-domain integral equation methods to solve the Maxwell and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equations, which govern coupled electromagnetic field and magnetization phenomena. To facilitate the analysis of such phenomena in complex systems involving billions of degrees of freedom, the simulators are implemented on massively parallel Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computers. These simulators are used for the design of next generation magnetic random memory devices as well as bit patterned media and heat-assisted magnetic recording storage systems. Such advanced memory and storage systems are to be essential to future high-performance computing systems.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, they govern the behavior of many storage devices.  Our ability to engineer storage media with increased capacity/density, mean time between failure, and lifetime is key to sustaining the big data revolution that is upon us.  Prior to the start of this project, existing computational techniques for modeling storage media either solved Maxwell?s equations (MEs) by accounting for magnetization through idealized constitutive relationships, or solved the non-linear Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLGE) cast in terms of (quasi-) static magnetic fields. These solvers? failure to accurately account for the complexity of the magnetization?s temporal dynamics and field coupling effects constituted a major obstacle in advancing magnetic material and device technology.  To address deficiencies in computational methods for simulating nonlinear magnetization and electromagnetic field dynamics in complex systems containing magnetic materials, we took a two-prong approach.  First, we developed new full-wave time-domain ME solvers that incorporate dynamic LLGE magnetization models in a self-consistent manner.
