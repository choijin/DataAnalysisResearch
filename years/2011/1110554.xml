<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Murray V. Johnston of the University of Delaware. Prof. Johnston and his research group will develop and employ laser-based mass spectrometry methods to study the role of amines in the nucleation and growth of atmospheric aerosols. The study will elucidate reaction mechanisms and yield fundamental rate parameters necessary to accurately represent new aerosol particle formation and growth in atmospheric models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New particle formation events in the atmosphere is a global phenomenon that is thought to contribute substantially to the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei, thereby influencing precipitation patterns and Earth's energy balance. Prof. Johnston's study to elucidate the impact of amines on aerosol particle formation could lead to significant changes in atmospheric models that currently may underestimate the concentration and composition of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in an area of research of great societal importance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved a combination of laboratory and computational work to study the mechanism by which particles are formed and subsequently transformed in the atmosphere.  Because airborne particles exert substantial influences on human health and climate, it is important to understand the chemical processes that control their number, size and composition.  The focus of this particular study was the role of amines along with ammonia, sulfuric acid and water in altering the chemical composition of airborne nanoparticles as they grow.  Amines can have a disproportionate affect on nanoparticle composition because of their ability to displace ammonia in particles containing sulfuric acid.      Intellectual Merit.  In this project, new measurement technologies were developed and then used to study how nanoparticles grow under atmospherically relevant conditions by taking up gas phase molecules.  Four specific molecules were considered: sulfuric acid, ammonia, amine (dimethylamine) and water.  This work showed that when a sulfuric acid molecule strikes the surface of a nanoparticle, it is taken into the particle with nearly 100% probability.  When an ammonia molecule strikes the surface, the probability of being taken into the particle can be much less than 100%.  When an amine molecule strikes the surface of a particle containing ammonia and sulfuric acid, the outcome depends on particle size.  For the smallest particles (molecular clusters), amine substitution for ammonia in the particle (i.e. amine goes into the particle and ammonia comes out) occurs with nearly 100% probability.  For larger particles, the probability of substitution becomes much less and the presence of water in the particle appears to inhibit substitution.      Broader Impacts.  The formation of new particles in the atmosphere represents one of the key uncertainties associated with estimating the number and size of particles in the atmosphere, and hence how airborne particles impact precipitation patterns and EarthÃ†s energy balance.  The results of this study advance our understanding the rate at which particles grow by taking up gases such as ammonia, amines and sulfuric acid.  The results should find use in helping to refine models that are used to predict future changes in climate.  Four of the graduate students working on this project have received Ph.D. degrees: one is employed in industry, one is employed in government and two are employed as postdoctoral fellows performing research in related areas.
