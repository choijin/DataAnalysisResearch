<AbstractNarration>The family Tachinidae contains nearly 10,000 described species of beneficial parasitic flies. As enemies of other insects, particularly herbivores, tachinids are important regulators of host populations in natural and agricultural ecosystems. They help in the natural control of numerous pest insects and have been effectively used in biological control of invasive pests. Despite their diversity and ecological importance, we know little about their interactions with hosts and how these have developed over time. The taxonomic difficulty and lack of a robust classification of tachinids has hindered both basic and applied research. The goals of this project are to reconstruct relationships among groups of tachinid flies using molecular and traditional methods and then use these results to produce a stable classification and to understand patterns of host-use and other life history traits. Another key goal is to broadly distribute taxonomic and biological information on tachinids to researchers and practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tachinidae are the most important group of insect parasitoids outside of the wasps. A sound grasp of their history and a reliable taxonomic infrastructure are necessary to understand their roles as enemies, the evolution of their diverse attack strategies, and the causes of their rapid and rampant diversification. Such an understanding can guide the selection of the most effective tachinid biological control agents in agricultural and forest systems and limit the potential negative impacts upon non-targets. It will also inform broad issues in biology such as biogeography, ecological specialization, and the causes of adaptive diversification.</AbstractNarration>

Evolutionary relationships among lineages are obscure and the family is among the most taxonomically difficult of insects. The lack of a stable classification of Tachinidae has hindered research on the family.  Our goals include:  (1)  To reconstruct the evolutionary history and relationships of tachinid flies and create a stable and predictive taxonomic classification.  (2) To understand the evolution of tachinid morphological, ecological, and behavioral traits important to basic and applied fields of biology.  (3) To develop internet resources on Tachinidae that will educate professionals and laypeople.  (4) To train new researchers in the taxonomy, evolution, and ecology of this important group.  Outcomes  This is an ongoing project and the most important fruits of our research are still being developed. However, we have aaccomplished many of our goals and are nearing completion of several large products associated with the grant.  Even at this early point, this award has contributed to 13 peer-reviewed scientific publications, at least ten presentations at national/international conferences, the development or enhancement of three websites and numerous articles, reports and other products. Some of our accomplishments and findings thus far include:  We have collected, sorted, and identified thousands of tachinid flies and obtained tissue samples from &gt; 2500 individuals from around the world. Of this, we have extracted DNA from almost 1000 specimens.  We analyzed the evolutionary history of tachinids based on a data set of over 135 morphological characters from 492 species in180 tachinid genera and developed novel hypotheses about their evolution and relationships.  We evaluated the utility of nine genes to infer evolutionary relationships and assess the origins of Tachinidae (Figure 1) , including the development of several new developed genes for evolutionary analysis. Our molecular analyses confirmed recent hypotheses about relationships among tachinids and provided insight into the origins of parasitic habits in these flies. Morphological and molecular analyses suggest that transitions to larval insect hosts were associated with dramatic increases in diversification.  We obtained sequences from four genes for more than 350 genera of tachinids from around the world. A number of preliminary analyses of these data (e.g., Figure 2) have been conducted and preliminary results reported in scientific presentations.  We have conducted thorough taxonomic and evolutionary analyses of focal tachinid groups including the Afrotropical tachinid genus Gaedioxenis, the widespread tribe Winthemiini (in press), and the enigmatic tribe Glaurocarini (in review).  We have developed species pages for &gt;200 tachinid taxa (see www. tachinids.org) in addition to hundreds of species pages Co-PI OÆHara has developed as part of the Homepage for Tachinid Resources (see http://www.nadsdiptera.org/Tach/WorldTachs/Tachgallery/Tachgalleryhom.html). We continue to develop traditional and interactive keys to Afrotropical genera of Tachinidae and an interactive key to North American genera of Tachinidae.  We organized a symposium on parasitic flies at the International Congress of Dipterology in Germany with 14 speakers representing 9 countries.   We published a 350 page catalog of the Tachinidae of the Afrotropical region, including the description of seven new genera.  Understanding the biology and evolution of the myriad species that co-inhabit our planet has far reaching effects on our global society....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
