<AbstractNarration>The oceans cover 71% of the earth's surface and represent one of the least explored frontiers, yet the oceans are integral to climate regulation, nutrient production, oil retrieval, and transportation. Future scientific and technological efforts to achieve better understanding of oceans and water-related applications will rely heavily on our ability to communicate reliably between instruments, vehicles (manned and unmanned), human operators, platforms, and sensors of all types. The glue of such underwater networks will be the underwater acoustic communication link.  Despite recent activity on acoustic physical layer single-links, digital acoustic communication is in its infancy in comparison to comparable efforts for radio-based terrestrial wireless communication.  This project exploits the unique features of the underwater acoustic channel to significantly improve performance of underwater networks. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research focus is on design for the inherently multi-scale, multipath channels in this wideband environment. Surprisingly, transceiver design for the coupled efforts of wideband channels and distinct Doppler scales for practical underwater communication systems does not appear to have been thoroughly investigated.  The network is examined from the perspective of individual links up to entire networks of multiple nodes, encompassing novel multi-scale, multi-lag channel modeling, waveform design, equalizer designs, channel estimation, single-link and network capacity evaluation, novel coding to achieve capacity, as well as signaling and routing over large-scale networks. In a principled manner, the fundamental properties of multi-scale, multipath channels are explored in order to design and analyze high performance underwater acoustic networks. Implementable algorithms are designed which endeavor to achieve the fundamental limits. The research outcomes will also impact ultrasound, ultrawideband, wideband radar, sonar, acoustic signal processing, and moderate to high speed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and possibly understanding of biosonar.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The need to for high performance underwater acoustic (UWA) communication is motivated by both commercial and military applications. If we wish to build environmental monitoring systems for protected oceans,  deploy surveillance in harbors and ports, or develop fast acting tsunami detection systems, we need high performance UWA communication.  UWA communication  channels have features that are different from typical terrestrial radio communications as used by cellular systems or WiFi.  In particular,  there is the low speed of propagation of sound in water, as well as the relatively high Doppler induced by mobility.   Due to the fact that acoustic signals experience many ``echoes?? due to bouncing off the water surface and the ocean floor, UWA communications also experience severe multipath propagation.  An innovative aspect of the project was the consideration of more accurate models for the distortion experienced by acoustic signals transmitted over water.  We call this model, the multi-lag, multi-scale channel model.  The outcomes of the project include waveform designs (how to shape the signals that are transmitted), statistical models of UWA channels and methods for estimating the channel at a receiver.  With these channel estimates in hand, novel methods for removing the channel distortion were also proposed.  We also examined the fundamental limits of how much information could be transmitted over these channels.  Given our underwater acoustic communication system designs and analysis of underwater acoustic communication (UWA) systems, we were able to adapt our methods to other  communication channels such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channels, etc. To this end, we developed novel channel models and new optimization techniques for V2V channels.  We were able to validate our channel models using experimental data and were also able to show that our methods perform well beyond the current state of the art on this real data.  Underwater acoustic communication channels experience significant attenuation as a function of the transmission range.  While most radio channels experience a so-called power-law,  underwater channels can experience an exponential reduction in power as a function of distance.  Thus, having networks where communication nodes act as relays between a transmitter and a receiver are a necessity to ensure high performance, long distance underwater communication.  In these mulithopped communication systems, the overall channel is a function of many parameters including the topology of the network as well as the propagation characteristics.  Channel estimation can be posed as a deconvolution problem.  Convolution is a well-understood function of two input signals and occurs in a large number of engineering applications.  For example, de-convolution arises ubiquitously in many applications like image de-blurring, channel equalization, system identification, etc.  In this project, we characterized the fundamental limits of deconvolution when you have very little side information about the problem, our particular problem is called blind deconvolution.  These results use novel functions of the problem that had not been previously used to analyze whether blind deconvolution could be achieved or not.  The set of inputs that cannot be blindly deconvolved is called the ambiguity space.  In particular, we showed that even if the problem had significant structure (sparsity, low-rank, etc.), the ambiguity space was almost as large as the input space.  Characterization of ambiguity space and impossibility results sparsity should lead to design insights and system architecture changes in many of the applications noted above. Target detection is an equally ubiquitous high-level approximation to many problems in imaging protocol design and low-rank structures arise naturally from structured fields. For example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging systems try to use as few samples as possible, so that imaging can be done quickly, while maintaining physical constraints related to the imaging hardware, akin to navigational constraints for active target detection as quickly as possible.
