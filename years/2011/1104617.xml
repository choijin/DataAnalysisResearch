<AbstractNarration>This award funds the continued operations and further development of Einstein@Home and its software infrastructure, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC).  Einstein@Home is one of the largest and most powerful computers on the planet. It searches astrophysical data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars. Unlike a normal supercomputer, the computing power of Einstein@Home comes from ordinary home computers and laptops that have been "signed up" by about 300,000 members of the general public.  When otherwise idle, these computers automatically download observational data over the Internet from Einstein@Home servers, search the data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars, and return the results of the analysis to the servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutron stars are exotic objects: they represent the most compact form that a star can take before it collapses into a black hole.  Since they were discovered in 1967, about two thousand neutron stars have been found (including several discovered in 2010 and 2011 by Einstein@Home).  Neutron star observations provide a unique view into the behavior of matter at extreme pressures and densities, and into the nature of gravitation when gravity is very strong.  Under certain circumstances, neutron stars can be emitters of pulsing radio waves (pulsars). Einstein@home exploits the unique capabilities of the Arecibo Radio Observatory, the largest and most sensitive single-dish radio telescope in the world, to search for these signals. It is possible that neutron stars can also emit gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were first predicted by Einstein in 1917 but have never been directly detected. Einstein@home can search the data from gravitational wave detectors such as those of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) for these signals. Einstein@home also supports the BOINC software infrastructure to benefit dozens of computationally intensive projects in other areas of science, that also exploit volunteer distributed computing. And it is a remarkable tool for scientific outreach: Einstein@Home allows hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens from around the world to participate in and make meaningful contribution to cutting-edge scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Einstein@Home project enabled citizen volunteers to take part in an exciting discovery project using data obtained from the world's largest radio telescope, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.    Data were acquired as part of a large-scale, many-year survey to discover neutron stars, the compact remnants left behind after a massive star explodes as a supernova. The objects that can be found in radio astronomy data are pulsars: rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of radiation. Rotation of these beams through our line of sight cause bursts of radio emission once per rotation period.   Among the pulsars we know about, these periods range from about one one-thousandth of a second to ten seconds.  Through suitable computer analysis, these periodic signals can be revealed.   The project was especially oriented to finding pulsars orbiting other objects, including other neutron stars, white dwarf stars, and especially black holes.    This is because a pulsar can orbit another star with an orbital period as short as about 10 minutes.  To detect the pulsar, its orbital motion has to be removed in order to reveal the periodicity due to the pulsar's spin.    The search analysis for pulsars in the most extreme orbits  was beyond the capabilities of a typical university computing system.  Employing the public therefore greatly benefited the survey project  by providing computing resources for doing more sophisticated analyses than otherwise would have been possible.    The Einstein@Home project required an intricate system for transport of data from the telescope in Puerto Rico to volunteers.    First, data were shipped on standard computer disk drives to Cornell University, where the data were archived onto a large-volume storage system and where a web-based system cataloged the data and their associated meta-data.   Data were then transported by high-speed network to the Albert Einstein Institute in Hannover, Germany where they were preprocessed into data units suitable for analysis by volunteers. A database system then handled the transport of the data units to volunteers' computers and the delivery of analysis results from volunteers.    Those results were then statistically analyzed to identify real pulsar signals by avoiding the human-generated radio frequency interference that can mimic astronomical signals.   Volunteers used downloadable software that requested data from a central repository, processed it, and uploaded results back to the repository.    Over the five years of the project, volunteers discovered 31 new pulsars.   Some of these have been especially interesting and useful to the astrophysical community.
