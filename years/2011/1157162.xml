<AbstractNarration>Studying some of the most fundamental scientific problems requires the development of novel computational methods and their application to very large datasets. The computing facility is a significant addition to the current computing resources of the Computer Science program at Lawrence Technological University, and supports interdisciplinary computer science research in a fashion that allows to practically apply the computational methods developed at Lawrence Technological University to scientific questions in various disciplines such as Astronomy, Biology, Medical and clinical research, Scientific Computing, Biometrics, Remote sensing, Robotics, Fine Art, and more.&lt;br/&gt;The computing facility also allows involving more Computer Science undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary Computer Science research. The ability of Computer Scientists to work in collaboration with other scientists in an interdisciplinary environment and understand problems in other disciplines is crucial for the development of the computational methods that can effectively solve problems in science and engineering. Therefore, interdisciplinary research experience provides undergraduate and graduate students with the training they need for effective real-life industry or academic research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
