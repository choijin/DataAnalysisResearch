<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program that is co-funded by Chemistry, Professor Jeffrey Evanseck from Duquesne University and colleagues Ralph Wheeler, Jeffry Madura, Ellen Gawalt and Tomislav Pintauer will acquire a large memory computer cluster. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) subphthalocyanine macrocycles, (b) synthesis and characterization of spin-crossover complexes, (c) structure property relationships in transition metal oxysterols complexes, (d) determination of structures of binary and ternary combinations of cholesteryl esters and oxysterols, (e) synthesis and properties of tris(pyrazolyl)ethane complexes, (f) enantioselective transformations mediated by chiral sulfur ylides, and (g) macrobicyclic ligands and their copper(II) complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer systems and clusters of computers are used by chemists and biochemists to investigate reactions and the properties of chemicals and materials using theoretical models and programs. The computer calculations are used, often along with experimental data, to model and better understand many types of complex chemical and biological phenomena. They are also used to predict results and guide experiments. This resource will be used in research and in course work by undergraduate students and faculty at several institutions training them in computational chemistry methodology with a modern computer system. Besides the home institution there will be participation of students and faculty from Lincoln, Chatham, Slippery Rock, St. Francis, SUNY New Platz, Cabrini, Florida Memorial, Prairie View A&amp;M, and Jackson State University.</AbstractNarration>
