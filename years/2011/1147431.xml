<AbstractNarration>This project examines the fundamental dynamics of persistent low-level atmospheric flows which are found along the slopes of mountain ranges and other topographic features.  Important examples include the Great Plains low-level jet, the South American low-level jet on the east side of the Andes, and the low-level jet found along the coast of Chile and Peru.  The central hypothesis of the project is that topographic low-level jets form due to the elevated solar heating that occurs along the topographic features.  More specifically, an inversion technique will be developed to determine the wind and atmospheric mass fields in the vicinity of topography through inversion of the potential vorticity anomalies generated by solar heating.  The technique is developed in isentropic coordinates and accounts for the intersection of the topography and the isentropic surfaces, which bend downward toward the topography due to solar heating.  The method will be used to understand features of the low-level jets including speed and elevation, and to provide a dynamical framework for interpreting the results of complex state-of-the-art numerical simulations.  The analysis will be applied to a number of low-level topographic jets, and to other problems including the onset of the Asian monsoon and its relationship to elevated heating on the Tibetan plateau, the Caribbean low-level jet, and flows near ice sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has societal relevance due to the importance of low-level jets for regional climate.  For example, the Great Plains low-level jet is responsible for a substantial portion of the moisture transport into the eastern half United States which sustains agriculture.  In addition, the project will support and train two graduate students, thereby developing the future scientific workforce in this research area.  Finally, the inversion methods developed in this project will be made available to researchers in atmospheric dynamics through software codes, so that they can be applied to a wide array of scientific problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Topographically bound balanced motions are those persistent atmospheric flows, known as low-level jets, which are associated with mountain ranges and other topographic features.  Our primary effort in this collaborative project was to develop and apply the theory of such flows based on potential vorticity invertibility principles.  This work involved theoretical and computational aspects. First, we formulated mathematical models which describe such flows. Expressed in isentropic coordinates, these models consist of partial differential equations which describe the balanced flow, with input values specified from the temperature distribution in the atmosphere and the topography of the lower boundary. Second, we explored and extended the new analytical approach introduced by A. S. Fokas.  We used this method to derive new analytical solutions to simplified forms of the models, and to analyze the connection between transform methods routinely used in studying atmospheric dynamics. Third, we developed computer programs for solving these models.  Based on multigrid methods, these programs compute the solutions several orders of magnitude faster than the single-grid methods commonly used for similar problems. Fourth, we applied these programs to analyze the persistent topographically-bound easterly low-level jet around Antarctica. We showed this jet to be the balanced flow associated with the topography of the Antarctic plateau, moderated by a shallow potential vorticity anomaly atop the plateau produced by radiative cooling. Comparison with high-resolution data shows that the mathematical model accurately simulates the observed flow. This work was done in two spatial dimensions (latitude and height) with the assumption of symmetry in the longitudinal direction; the extension to the full three-dimensional flow around Antarctica is being explored in our subsequent research project. This research has a broader impacts in both education and science. The educational impact includes the involvement of two students (graduate and undergraduate) in the theoretical development and computer programming work of this project. The scientific impact includes better understanding of the role of low-level Antarctic flow in the annual variation of sea ice and in the production of dense ocean water just under the sea ice.  It is this dense water that flows downward and outward from Antarctica and becomes the ocean's dense bottom water, a slowly varying part of earth's climate system.
