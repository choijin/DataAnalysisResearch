<AbstractNarration>The National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) will organize and host a 1.5-day workshop at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va., to expand dialogue in the postdoctoral community towards: (1) learning more about the postdoctoral experience in fields of study where postdoctorate study is not very common and (2) providing professional development opportunities for the postdoctoral participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NPA will invite postdoctoral scholars (postdocs) in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, in computational science/cyber-infrastructure, and in other related fields of study to attend. Postdocs have not been a tradition in these sciences as in the life sciences, where completing a postdoc has become a requisite to career success. The NPA will also invite other relevant parties to participate, including representatives from appropriate professional societies. The NPA is called upon by Federal agencies and institutions across the country to provide a national voice for postdocs. It is crucial that the NPA learn more about the challenges faced by postdocs in fields of study where postdoctorate training is not common in order to better represent them and to make informed recommendations for best practices to improve retention of these postdocs in academic research. Some of the expected outcomes of this workshop are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. That a written report of the proceedings of the workshop will be widely disseminated to the postdoctoral community and other relevant parties through the NPA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. That the participants will build or strengthen their network of support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. That lessons learned from this workshop will have a broader impact and provide insights as well as concrete recommendations for supporting new scientists across all disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is little data/information available regarding the experiences of postdocs from these fields of study. Learning more about the social, behavioral, and economic sciences postdoctoral community is essential, as this population has been steadily increasing. Learning more about the postdocs in the computational sciences/cyber-infrastructure is also essential. The field of cyberinfrastructure is a relatively new cross-disciplinary field that provides sophisticated tools for all disciplines and so has the potential to involve postdocs from many and varied fields of study. Any information that can be gained from this workshop will be valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NPA leadership engages on a regular basis with the most recent scholarship on postdoctoral scholars' experiences. The NPA will be able to create an informed and understanding platform for the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will result in a written report of the proceedings that will be widely disseminated by the NPA, on its Web site, at its meetings, and through its contacts. The information gained from this workshop will have a broader impact and provide insights for the national postdoctoral community across all fields of research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) serves new researchers within three to five years of receiving the doctorate degree, or "postdocs."  Certainly, these researchers are experts in their fields, but the NPA has found that there is little understanding of and experience with cross-disciplinary collaborative research and the issues surrounding that collaboration. Increasing such understanding and knowledge specifically addresses both the intellectual merit and broader impact criteria, including the advancement of knowledge and the potential to benefit society, by providing information that would help these researchers to explore new avenues of research, innovation, and discovery.  Accordingly, the NPA desired to expand dialogue in the postdoctoral community towards providing professional development opportunities in regard to cross-disciplinary research for the postdoc participants. As a secondary goal, the NPA also hoped to learn more about the postdoc experience in fields of study where postdoctorate study is not common.  The workshop "Expanding Cross-Disciplinary Dialogue in the Postdoctoral Community" was held April 23-24, 2012, at the NSF in Arlington, VA.  The fields of study represented, as reported by the 29 fellows in attendance, included: adult learning and leadership; biomedical informatics; clinical psychology; cognitive science; computer science; computer simulation; cyberinfrastructure (OCI); economics; molecular and structural biology; psychology; social, behavioral, and economic sciences (SBES); social psychology; sociology/anthropology/education; and sociology/human services.  The workshop provided significant opportunities for professional development in the area of cross-disciplinary collaborative research. In addition to the networking and interaction among the fellows, the sessions provided information on the ethical concerns of collaborative research; a philosophical approach to improving cross-disciplinary communication; and an opportunity to visit with the NSF program officers, as well as an introduction to four professional societies/associations.  The fellows had ample opportunity to network and learn more about each otherÆs postdoc experiences. Based on feedback, both verbal and through the evaluation survey, several connections were made. For example, more than 64% of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed that they had made connections that would help them move forward in their careers.  Through the small and large group discussions, the NPA learned much more about the postdoctoral experience in disciplines where the postdoc has not been an experience.  One issue expressed by these postdocs was the fear that engaging in collaborative research would hinder their careers: There are few journals that publish the results of multi-disciplinary research, and publications are crucial to acquiring many positions.  The majority of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed that the workshop was very useful, and nearly all of them strongly agreed or agreed with the statement "I have a better understanding of the way in which research philosophies impact cross-disciplinary collaboration."
