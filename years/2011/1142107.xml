<AbstractNarration>Krill, Euphausia superba, is a keystone species in the Antarctic ecosystem and provides the trophic link between microscopic plankton and charismatic megafauna such as penguins and whales. Recent evidence suggests krill may not be exclusively planktonivorous, which introduces the potential of new pathways of carbon flux through krill based ecosystems.  A change in our view of krill from one of being herbivores to omnivores opens up several questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate induced change in the extent, thickness and duration of overlying sea ice coverage is expected to change the prey fields available to krill, and to have subsequent effects on the suite of predators supported by krill. The nature of this benthic prey?krill link, which may be crucial in those parts of the seasonal cycle other than the well studied spring bloom, is yet to be determined.  DNA techniques will be used to identify and quantify the prey organisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will measure the in situ feeding ecology and behavior of krill and, ultimately, the success of this key species. An overall goal is&lt;br/&gt;to investigate seasonal changes in Euphausia superba in-situ feeding and swimming behavior in the Wilhelmina Bay region of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) area,  known to be a region of changing climate. Understanding the biological impacts of climate change is important to societal and economic goals. The project scientists will additionally team with a marine and environmental reporting group to design presentations for an annual journalist meeting.</AbstractNarration>

Our projects showed that krill respond to chemical and environmental cues and that they can be observed to be quite active in the winter time. Even in winter krill were seen to move up and down in the water column, whereas we suspected they might have been hibernating. Such winter time activity in the krill has important ramifications for how we study them and how we assess their role in food webs.
