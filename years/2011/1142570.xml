<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of using radio-frequencies to provide a real-time measurement of black carbon emissions. There is a growing demand for black carbon measurement systems in response to increasingly stringent emissions regulations.  Accurate measurement and characterization of ambient and source black carbon emissions are hampered by the lack of low-cost and portable measurement systems suitable for use in the field.  This information is critical to assess black carbon levels, identify sources, and ultimately reduce emissions.  Filter Sensing Technologies plans to utilize radio frequencies to provide a direct, real-time measurement of black carbon.  The research will investigate using inexpensive components, similar to those used in cellular phones, ideally suited for use in a portable measurement system. &lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are that currently the market for particulate matter and black carbon measurement systems is rapidly outpacing the markets for other types of emissions analyzers.  There is a significant unmet need to provide portable, real-time, low-cost measurement systems to monitor these emissions. Recent studies indicate a significant warming potential for black carbon, and have also linked the pollutant to a range of adverse health effects.  Regulators and source operators alike require tools to monitor black carbon emissions, ensure in-use compliance, and improve process efficiencies.  Currently, few technologies can distinguish black carbon from other types of particulate matter.   The proposed technology is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth, providing a robust, portable, and much lower-cost alternative to currently available instruments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SBIR Phase I: Portable, Low-Cost, and Robust Black Carbon Measurement Instrument using Radio Frequency Sensing     Intellectual Merits  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigated the feasibility of using radio-frequencies (RF) to provide a real-time measurement of black carbon particulate matter (PM) emissions.  There is a growing demand for real-time black carbon measurement systems in response to increasingly stringent regulations limiting black carbon emissions to reduce negative impacts on human health and the environment.  Accurate measurement and characterization of ambient and source black carbon emissions are hampered by the lack of low-cost and portable measurement systems suitable for use in the field.  This information is critical to assess ambient black carbon levels, identify sources, and ultimately reduce emissions.  Currently there exist two broad classes of instruments used for monitoring black carbon emissions: (1) expensive laboratory instruments, and (2) low-cost, portable devices with limited utility.  FST plans to bridge this gap, by utilizing radio frequencies to provide a direct, real-time measurement distinguishing black carbon from other types of particles.  The research investigated using inexpensive RF technologies, similar to those used in cellular phones to generate and receive RF signals, ideally- suited for use in a portable measurement system.  The Phase I work resulted in a prototype to undergo additional field testing and development in Phase II.      Broader Impacts/Commercial Potential  There is a significant unmet need to provide portable, real-time, low-cost measurement systems to monitor black carbon emissions.  Recent studies indicate a warming potential for black carbon 2,000 times greater than the equivalent amount of CO2, and have also linked the pollutant to a range of adverse health effects.  Regulators and source operators alike require tools to monitor black carbon emissions, formulate emission control strategies, ensure in-use compliance, and improve process efficiencies.  Currently, few technologies can distinguish black carbon from other types of particulate matter.  Accurate PM measurement systems generally range in price from $15,000 to $60,000, with systems capable of directly monitoring black carbon content being considerably more expensive.  Further, these systems are ill-suited for portable use in the field.  Currently the market for PM and black carbon measurement systems is rapidly outpacing the markets for other types of emissions analyzers with a CAGR of 9.7% from 2009-2016. FSTÆs technology is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth, providing a robust, portable, and much lower-cost alternative to currently available high-end instruments. This technology is not limited to black carbon emissions measurements, but a wide range of applications where particle speciation is required including pharmaceutical, biotech, and chemicals industries.
