<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is supporting the research of Professor Michael Harris of the RNA Center at Case Western Reserve University to develop isotope-edited Raman spectroscopy as a new biophysical tool for the study of metal ions associated with backbone phosphate oxygens of RNA.  Metal ion binding necessarily changes the chemical environment of neighboring phosphoryl oxygens, resulting in changes in the Raman spectrum.  Signature signals in the Raman spectrum can in turn provide valuable information on the nature and position of the metal association.  With isotope editing, these studies should allow for the experimental interrogation of specific metal-RNA interactions in solution, at the level of individual phosphates.  The quantitative nature of the information gained makes it directly applicable to computational models being developed to describe the structure and energetics of RNA-metal ion binding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the project will include the development of new tools for chemical biology based upon a combination of isotope-labeling (bioorganic chemistry) and Raman spectroscopy (biophysical chemistry).   Success here may  translate to broader applications of the technique in biophysical chemistry.  The PI will incorporate advanced undergraduates into the research team, with a special emphasis on members of traditionally underrepresented groups in science.  Student will have hands-on experience with state of the art instrumentation and participate in data analysis facilitated through small group learning exercises. Thus, an important component of the project is the integration of the research goals into education, providing a training opportunity for the next generation of scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is being co-funded by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function Cluster within the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) Division of the BIO Directorate at NSF.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) play central roles in cellular processes that are essential to all life.  The structure of RNA is a polymer composed of ribonucleotide monomers linked together to form a phosphodiester backbone.  Each phosphodiester linkage along the backbone imparts a negative charge that repels the other negatively charged linkage in the chain.  Therefore, in order to fold into structures that are required for its function, RNA must interact with a large number of positive ions such as magnesium, sodium and potassium.  Although these interactions with ions are crucial to RNA function, they are difficult to study since there are few experimental tools available for this purpose.  The major goal of this project was to add a powerful new tool to the repertoire of methods for investigating the chemical interactions between solution cations and the RNA phosphodiester backbone.  First, the research showed that ion interactions alter ths bond vibrational modes of the phosphate groups in the RNA phosphodiester backbone.  These changes in bond vibrational modes can in turn be detected by Raman spectroscopy, thus providing a novel window into RNA-ion interactions.  Importantly, the research revealed that the change in vibrational energy and functional group polarizability that is induced by metal ion coordination is directly related to the inorganic chemistry of the associated ion. (FIGURE 1).  This discovery allows the Raman spectra to be interpreted in terms of both the number as well as the identity of the interacting ions.  Metal ions can interact with RNA in a site specific manner by occupying defined geometries relative to the RNA structure by making specific chemical interactions with RNA functional groups.  A large number of ions are also associated weakly with the negatively charged phosphodiester backbone.  An important unresolved question in the field of RNA biophysics has been the extent to which inner sphere coordination interactions occur within this weakly associating class of ions.  Second, the results from this project demonstrated that inner sphere coordination interactions occurring withing the "ion cloud" associated with the negative electrostatic field associated with the phosphodiester backbone of several unstructured that lack defined, site-specific metal ion binding sites.  The general results are illustrated by the effects observed for poly A RNA (FIGURE 2).  The unexpected finding that such unstructured RNAs nonetheless maintain very complex metal ion interactions similar to those RNAs that form stable structures represents and important step in understanding this aspect of RNA physical chemistry.  It was established previously that substitution of one of the phosphoryl oxygens with a sulfur atom alters its vibrational modes as well as its metal ion coordination properties.  To extend these studies to structured RNAs we tested whether thio modifications at positions in an RNA known to bind metal ions will perturb the Raman signals associated with metal ion coordination.  Using a well studied RNA structure, the GAAA tetraloop, we tested the current model in which a single inner sphere coordination interaction occurs at A7.  As shown in FIGURE 3 the greatest effect of thio modification was indeed at the predicted position which validates the method as an important new tool to probe RNA-metal ion interactions in solution.   A major activity was research training of undegraduate community colleege STEM students as part of their transition to four year institutions.  In addition summer research experiences by high school students were also integrated into the research activities.  Both community college and high school trainees were exposed to basic concepts of nucleic acid structure and biophysics, as well as recieving hands on laboratory trianing, and counceling on professionalism and career planning.
