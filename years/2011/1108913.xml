<AbstractNarration>This project aims to determine the relationship between galaxies and the hot gas surrounding them. The portion of the intergalactic medium (IGM) that is photo-ionized and heated to temperatures of order 10,000 K outweighs the baryonic (i.e., ordinary) matter inside galaxies by roughly a factor of 4. This gas can be studied in relatively nearby galaxies by observing the hydrogen Lyman-alpha absorption line in the spectra of more distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) near the same line of sight. The Principal Investigator and collaborators have shown that about half of the Lyman-alpha absorbers at redshifts less than 0.017 are located within about 400 kiloparsecs of a moderate-sized or larger galaxy. The team will continue and expand upon this work, in four parts: (1) improve the statistics by a factor of order 10 using archival AGN spectra obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope; (2) identify all bright galaxies near all observed AGN lines of sight, using public archival data and new observations with ground-based telescopes; (3) improve the quality of the existing estimates of galaxy distances, luminosities, classifications, and orientations, using published data and new data when appropriate; and (4) perform an in-depth analysis of the physical conditions in individual absorbers. The goal is to determine the properties of the absorbers as a function of distance from the galaxy, separately for galaxies of different types, sizes, luminosities and environments. This project will train a graduate student to make use of space-based ultraviolet and ground-based optical and radio observational facilities, some involving international collaborations. Some parts of the project will be made appropriate for research projects for undergraduate students, including those participating in the formal Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the performing institution. An exhibit illustrating the existence of matter outside galaxies will be created for the Space Place museum at the University of Wisconsin.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>It is well established that the universe is expanding. In combination with other evidence, the observed rate of expansion implies that ~70% of the energey content of the universe is in the form of a mysterious "dark energy" ~25% is in the form of an unknown "dark matter" particle, and only 4% is in the form of "normal" matter - mostly protons and electrons. We now have evidence that of this 4% only 1/10th has condensed into the familiar galaxies, which are the most easily observable part of the universe, as they emit light. The remaining 90% of normal matter is in the intergalactic medium, tens to hundreds of kpc away from galaxies. About half of this is very hot (10^5-10^7) K, while about 30% is at temperatures ~10^4 K, heated by photoionization due to light that permeates the universe and that originates in QSOs and regions of star formation. This 30% of matter can be observed through absorption in the Lyman alpha line that has a wavelengh of 1215 A. We used the NED (NASA Extragalactic Database) archive to extract the parameters (angular diameter, type, redshift, inclination, position angle etc) of all ~100,000 galaxies at redshift below 10,000 km/s. Using this we created a new catalogue of nearby galaxies, deriving intrinsic properties, such as linear diameter and luminosity, in a homogenous manner. Next, we used archival spectra of background QSOs from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope to find the Lyman alpha absorption at redshifts below about 10,000 km/s. We developed a code to mostly automatically identify the absorption lines in the spectrum, in order to be able to separate the 850 Lyman alpha lines from the 1600 absorption features between 1215 and 1255 A. To correlate the galaxy locations with Lyman alpha absorption lines we developed a new method to assign a numerical value to the probability of an association with one or more galaxies, rather than the previously used approximate or hand-waving methods used. Correlating the galaxy locations with the occurence and properties of the Lyman alpha reveals that about half of the Lyman alpha lines are associated with the circumgalactic medium of galaxies (out to about 1 virial radius (~100-200 kpc), while the other half originates in filaments of the Cosmic Web - structures that are 1-10 Mpc in size. We also studied the location and occurence of absorption relative to 33 large galaxies. This provides evidence that the circumgalactic medium of these galaxies is slightly flattened, as absorption is more frequently seen around highly inclined galaxies.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Bastiaan&nbsp;Wakker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
