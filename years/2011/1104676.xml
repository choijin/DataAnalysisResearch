<AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) Program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: This research project is on electromagnetic metamaterials and transformation optics, and aims at achieving broadband, high-performance metamaterials-based devices in the visible spectrum. The research is designed to use the conventional photolithography techniques to fabricate broadband, transformation optical devices at relatively low costs. The project studies the ultimate resolution limit of Maxwell fisheye and Eaton microlenses and investigates how the resolution limit relates to device magnification. In addition, the project explores recently developed broadband "trapped rainbow" geometry in novel multichannel sensing for possible "spectroscopy on a chip" architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic and applied research issues in an interdisciplinary area that combines materials science and device engineering, with high technological relevance. The research may open new ways of direct high-resolution visualization of small objects such as viruses and biomolecules using "regular" optical microscopes. This project also advances education and training of undergraduate and graduate students. It provides students opportunities to participate in a newly developed Professional Science Masters Program in Applied Physics at Towson University and to learn unique technological skills in the areas of electromagnetic metamaterials and transformation optics.</AbstractNarration>

Unfortunately, typical TO designs require metamaterials with low-loss, broadband performance, which appear difficult to develop. These difficulties are especially severe in the visible frequency range. On the other hand, in the course of this project, we have demonstrated that many transformation optics and metamaterial-based devices requiring anisotropic dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability may be emulated by specially designed tapered waveguides. This approach leads to low-loss, broadband performance in the visible frequency range, which is difficult to achieve by other means. We have applied this technique to broadband electromagnetic cloaking in the visible range, successfully extended it to birefringent TO devices, which perform useful and different functions for mutually orthogonal polarization states of light, Luneburg lens waveguides, magnifying Maxwell fisheye lenses, etc.</p> <p><strong>Experimental demonstration of a broadband array of invisibility cloaks in the visible frequency range</strong></p> <p>Our experiment is based on the recent demonstration of broadband invisibility cloak, which relies on a curved waveguide mimicking the metamaterial properties necessary for cloaking.&nbsp; Since a gap between a gold-coated spherical lens touching a gold-coated planar glass slide provides a good approximation of the required waveguide shape, such geometry can be easily transformed into a large array of broadband invisibility cloaks using commercially available microlens arrays.
