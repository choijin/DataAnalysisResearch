<AbstractNarration>The goal of the present research project is to uncover how the astonishingly complex structure of human and animal brains emerges during development and how it becomes well-suited to perform highly sophisticated behaviors.  The PIs will use the latest multi-electrode, imaging and opto-genetic  methods of electrophysiology to measure the functional development of neural circuits in the visual cortex from eye opening until the full maturity of the visual system.  If successful, this project will reveal how incoming visual stimuli are combined with previous visual memories stored in the brain to interpret the visual environment. This work will illuminate how experience influences the development of the circuitry in the visual cortex.  The potential scientific impact of this research is extremely high because it can, through using the visual system as a model example, clarify of how the brain adapts to the environment to perform its function. This work will have a broader impact on the advancement of science, as students and postdoctoral fellows will be trained to integrate the study of behaving animals with advanced neural recording and stimulation technologies.  Further, the computer code for performing recordings and analysis will be published on the authors? websites, and the authors will provide instructional tutorials so that others can build upon the methods developed here. The resulting data will be published on the authors? websites so other scientists can examine and extend the results. Finally, insights gained about how the environment influences the development of neural circuitry are likely to have implications that could reach as far as designing more effective educational tools and creating more supportive work environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant focused on understanding how early sensory experience and activity within the brain influences the development of stimulus selectivity in visual cortex. Previous research indicated that the pattern of spontaneous activity in the developing visual cortex becomes progressively more matched to the responses to natural scenes as the animal matures. This is consistent with the idea that cortex is developing an internal representation of the stimuli that are present in the world. A different line of previous research indicated that experience with a moving visual stimulus drives the rapid emergence of motion selectivity in immature visual cortical neurons. We sought to understand how early sensory experience and early neural activity impacts the formation of these internal representations and receptive field properties. Intellectual outcomes: In a first set of experiments, we examined how experience with a moving visual stimulus influences the spontaneous dynamics of visual cortex in order to see if the dynamics resemble the response to motion stimulus. That is, are these dynamics influenced by the specific experience of an individual animal? At the conclusion of the grant, the data were collected and are awaiting the results of ongoing analysis. In a related set of experiments, we examined the influence of patterned visual experience on the development of several receptive field properties. While the influence of experience on several receptive field properties such as orientation and direction selectivity was known, very little was known about whether the emergence of contextual receptive field properties depended on experience. We found that several contextual receptive field properties &mdash; cross-orientation suppression, surround suppression, and length summation &mdash; were present without visual experience, and visual experience only slightly modified the parameters of this tuning.  In a final set of experiments, we directly manipulated cortical activity with optogenetic techniques to see if activity within the cortex itself could alter stimulus selectivity in young animals. We developed a new device for providing "movies" of activity directly to the cortical surface, and verified that we could use this system to provide spatial and temporal control of neural circuits that expressed the light-activated channel channelrhodopsin2. We found that activating the cortex without regard to spatial patterns it could alter stimulus selectivity in visually-naive animals by causing the emergence of direction selectivity, but could not alter the parameters of the direction selectivity that did emerge. Broader outcomes: This grant supported the creation of training materials to teach students to perform advanced data analysis and programming in the Matlab computing environment. We have made this material available to the public at large in the form of a website (http://go.brandeis.edu/dataanalysis) so that anyone in the world can go through the same tutorials.
