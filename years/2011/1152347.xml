<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Mahesh Mahanthappa of the University of Wisconsin-Madison will study the delicate balance of forces underpinning the self-assembly of gemini ("twin tail") amphiphiles in water to form nanostructured soft materials known as lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs).  By chemically synthesizing and characterizing the LLC phase behavior of a variety of structurally diverse gemini surfactants, Mahanthappa and co-workers will identify specific amphiphile structural motifs that direct gemini surfactants to spontaneously form aqueous bicontinuous LLCs.  Bicontinuous LLCs are useful materials comprised of interpenetrating aqueous and hydrophobic domains that percolate in three-dimensions over macroscopic length scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will enhance our understanding of the forces governing molecular self-assembly in water, which is of significant fundamental and practical importance.  Discovery of new molecular design criteria favoring bicontinuous liquid crystal formation may have important implications in the design of new drug delivery materials and next generation membranes for water purification, fuel cells, and batteries. The broader impacts of this project will include training undergraduate and graduate students in the interdisciplinary area of organic materials chemistry, disseminating research results through scholarly publications and national conference presentations, and developing laboratory modules/demonstrations for high school seniors and college freshman to illustrate surfactant self-assembly in water toward the design of technologically useful, nanostructured materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Surfactants ("surface active agents" or "soaps") are molecules comprising a water-soluble headgroup and a hydrocarbon ("oily") tail. Upon dispersion of surfactant molecules in water, they self-assemble into aggregates that hide the hydrocarbon tails from water to form a variety of structures that depend on their exact concentration in solution. In dilute solutions, surfactants form micelle structures that find applications ranging from cleaning agents to viscosity control agents used in formulating personal care products and fluids for hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas recovery.
