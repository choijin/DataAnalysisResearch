<AbstractNarration>Research in the life sciences is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. More biological and biomedical scientists are using new tools and techniques that have been developed by physical scientists, mathematicians, and engineers.  At the same time, growing numbers of physicists and engineers are seeking careers in biological and biomedical fields.  Recognizing these trends, national panels have urged that the training of the next generation of life scientists should much more closely integrate the biological sciences with the physical sciences and mathematics.  This project directly serves to enhance the integration of physics and biology in undergraduate education by developing and testing advanced physics laboratory experiments involving biological physics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Four new student experiments that explore biological applications of experimental physics are being designed and implemented.  These labs train undergraduate students in the use of state-of-the-art physics techniques to measure and probe the properties of individual biological molecules and individual living cells.  Experiments include measuring the size of individual DNA molecules by observing Brownian motion, probing the elasticity of DNA molecules through gel electrophoresis, using fluorescence correlations to measure the strength of interactions between biomolecules, and building "laser tweezers" to gauge the forces generated by a swimming bacterium. The project envisions a wide range of institutions (from research universities to small colleges) being able to provide similar training experiences to their students, and instructional materials are being written that can be shared with physics faculty and staff at other institutions.  Such materials enhance the dissemination of these experimental experiences to the broader physics teaching community through the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) and the National Science Digital Library (NSDL), and through presentations at national and regional professional meetings.  The broader impact of this work is also enhanced by the training of faculty members from other institutions through open-house laboratory immersions, coordinated through the national Advanced Laboratory Physics Association (ALPhA). The educational impact of the experiments is being determined by a formal evaluation program using both a Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) instrument and student interviews.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was aimed at improving the interdisciplinary training of physics students at the undergraduate level. To an increasing extent, many advances in biology and medicine are facilitated by tools and expertise that originate in the physical sciences:  many advanced methods of imaging and microscopy, as well as new techniques for studying individual cells and/or individual molecules in living systems, were developed by scientists whose original training was in physics and mathematics. This project aims at encouraging such cross-fertilization between physics and biology/medicine. The goal was to give physics undergraduate students the opportunity to explore biological applications of physics in an advanced laboratory course. We developed three new biological physics experiments that could be incorporated into the traditional advanced physics laboratories taught at University of Florida and at other undergraduate institutions.   Our approach was to develop the apparatus, procedures and teaching materials for several experiments in biological physics and incorporate them into the existing advanced undergraduate physics teaching laboratory at the University of Florida. Major elements of our project included developing the experimental apparatus, methodology and teaching materials (laboratory manuals etc.) for the experiments, testing these experiments and materials in practice with undergraduate students who enrolled in the laboratory course, and disseminating the experiments and materials to other college/university physics faculty through various channels. In this way the project enhanced the physics teaching infrastructure at the University of Florida, broadened the training of undergraduate science students, and added to the nationÆs resources for advanced, interdisciplinary science education.  We developed the following three experiments for the advanced lab:  (1) The optical tweezer. The optical tweezer is an enhanced form of microscope that incorporates an infrared laser. The energy of the laser is used to capture, trap and manipulate tiny objects such as cells or particles within cells.  Students performing this experiment learn the physics of the optical tweezer and use it to explore the force that drives the swimming of a bacterium and the forces that transport vesicles inside a living plant cell.  (2) Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). FCS is a powerful physics tool that allows biological scientists to count individual molecules inside a living cell without injuring the cell, to measure the speed at which certain molecules move through their surroundings, and to study chemical and physical changes and interactions among very small numbers of molecules. Students performing the FCS experiment learn the basic physics of FCS and use the method to study the motion of tiny particles in a fluid. They also learn how FCS can be used to study the motions and interactions of DNA molecules.  (3) Brownian motion.  Brownian motion is a type of motion of very small (cellular and molecular size) particles that originates in the molecular nature of matter.  It is the basis of diffusion, which is the primary mechanism that transports key molecules like oxygen and nutrients into, out of, and throughout the living cell.  Students who perform the Brownian motion experiment learn to observe and track particles undergoing Brownian motion and they analyze this motion mathematically. They also observe the Brownian motion of biological molecules like DNA.   An important component of this project was the dissemination of the new laboratory experiments to other institutions.  For three consecutive summers we conducted training sessions in which physics instructors from other colleges and universities traveled to our department to learn the new experiments. These visitors spent 2-3 days learning the apparatus, procedures and teaching materials.  This training enabled them to bring these methods to their home institutions and teach ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
