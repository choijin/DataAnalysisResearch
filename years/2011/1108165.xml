<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Crowdsourced Experiments on the Internal Structure of Coordinating Groups  I use methods from experimental   economics to explore questions of interest in social psychology,   organizational behavior, and complex systems.    I collect groups of subjects to play simple games for money.  Between experiment and individual-level   cognitive modeling, I try to understand collective outcomes in terms of   individual behavior, with a special focus on the emergence of group structure   (how groups adapt to the problem they are solving) and dynamics (describing   the time course of individual and group behavior, and its evolution).  Previous work in multi-player economic games   has shown that large groups (established exogenously by the experimenter) can   work together better if they grew incrementally from small groups.  My goal was to examine this   finding in endogenous groups---subgroups that emerge as a result of   individual interactions in the task.   The results suggest that subjects   transferred their experience in a very different game to their new   environment, and groups with this theoretically irrelevant experience   actually performed better than groups who had only experienced the test   environment.  Learning transfer in   groups is a new field with implications for interaction design.  This work can inform organizational design.  When should there be a boss?  When should a problem be split between groups?           Last Modified: 01/02/2012       Submitted by: Seth Frey]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
