<AbstractNarration>Web Search engines have become indispensible for people from all walks of life for locating information on  a broad range of topics.  Data from user's interactions with the search engines, web pages, and among each other  provide a rich source of information for understanding and profiling users. This project develops a novel probabilistic framework and the associated machine learning algorithms for modeling users and their behavior on the web to improve the ranking of results returned in response to user queries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses three closely related technical topics in behavioral and social data modeling, covering the underlying theory, algorithm development and evaluation on real-world data: 1) Developing rich  models of user interactions with search engines, information sources,  with each other that can handle multiple types of relationships among the entities; 2) Exploiting the resulting models of user behavior to improve the ranking of web pages returned in response to a user query; 3) Modeling the temporal dynamics of user behavior to detect and respond tp changes in the social environment of the user or context-dependent changes in the user's behavior. The resulting algorithms will be evaluated using (i) real-world data available in the public domain (ii) real-world data sets from industrial collaborators and (iii) simulated data that preserve the relevant statistical properties of their real-world counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project advances the current state of the art in information retrieval, with potentially large impact on web search and related applications. Collaborations with industry leaders in Web search and e-commerce such as Yahoo!, Microsoft, Tencent and Alibaba can potentially lead to significant impact on information retrieval, web search and ranking, recommender systems, and related areas. The project offers enhanced research-based training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at Georgia Tech.

This influence estimation problem is very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the task and the requirement of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. The specific goal of our research is the development of a randomized algorithm for influence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. Social network structure plays an important role in determining the dynamics of the information diffusion over the network. We consider the problem of using the observed dynamics to identify the underlying social network structures: we can even simutaneously do diffusion network inference and meme tracking. 2) We emphasize leveraing user interactions to improve search engien performance. We develop algorithms for inferring user search goals for broad-topic and ambiguous queries by analyzing search engine query logs. Two innovations: i) discovering different user search goals for a query by clustering the user feedback sessions that are constructed from user click-through logs; ii) a novel notion of 'pseudo-documents' to better represent the feedback sessions for clustering; 3)We tackle the efficiency problem of making recommendations in the context of large user and item spaces. In particular, we address the problem of learning binary codes for collaborative filtering. Our main approach is to construct binary codes for users and items such that the preference of users over items can be accurately preserved by the Hamming distance between their respective binary codes. We also develop cold-start collaborative filtering by developing a novel algorithm that learns to conduct the interview process guided by a decision tree in order to learn the user preference in an interactive way.      The project advances the current state of the art in information retrieval, with potentially large impact on web search and related applications. Collaborations with industry leaders in Web search such as Yahoo! lead to significant impact on information retrieval, web search and ranking, recommender systems, and related areas. The project offers enhanced research-based training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at Georgia Tech.
