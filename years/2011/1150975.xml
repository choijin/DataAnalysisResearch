<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program award are to characterize tornadic wind loads on a residential building and to compare the resultant structural response of traditional construction against a structurally enhanced one.  Study variables include both tornado parameters (vortex size, forward speed, pressure profile and swirl ratio), and the building parameters (building location relative to the tornado core, structural connections, and the main wind force resisting system). A 3-dimensional Finite Element Analysis model of a light-framed residential structural system will be used as the prototype to establish structural response. A database-assisted design (DAD) methodology will be used to analyze tornadic wind load time-histories from a model building shape and determine critical design loads and reactions for the structural system. Full-scale tests will be conducted on corner substructures of the prototype building for validating the numerical model and also to evaluate the structural and economic benefits of enhanced structural systems in houses. The effort will provide the basis for a tornado-resilient design methodology for houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award facilitates knowledge generation that provides a better understanding of the structural behaviors and vulnerability of existing wood-framed houses, while identifying benefits to a community that incorporate tornado-resilient building structural systems. A&lt;br/&gt;new graduate-level course, Engineered Design of Sustainable Residential Structures will provide knowledge to civil engineering graduate students, and enable them to interact with residential building contractors, and structural engineers. Information on tornadic loads and structural enhancement of houses will be made available to builders via webbased portals. A Wind Hazard Damage Assessment Group will be formed to conduct post-storm assessments and to disseminate research findings on advanced residential construction practices. Through research immersion, K-12 science teachers will develop high-school teaching modules on tornado damage to houses for inclusion in high-school science curricula. Training and mentorship of a PhD student will be provided in experimental and analytical studies. This award will provide resources that will be used to develop technologies to improve performance of low-rise buildings affected by tornadoes.</AbstractNarration>
