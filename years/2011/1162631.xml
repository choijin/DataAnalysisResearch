<AbstractNarration>The Hawaii Conference on Algebraic Number Theory, Arithmetic Geometry, and Modular Forms (HCANTAGMF) will be held on March 6-8, 2012 at the East-West Center in Honolulu, adjacent to the University of Hawaii campus. As it is occurring on the heels of the AMS Western Section meeting (Honolulu) and just before a memorial conference for Alf van der Poorten (Newcastle, Australia), a critical mass of prominent number theorists will be in attendance. Talks will occur in three parallel sessions on the topics in the conference title, with breaks for plenary lectures by five distinguished speakers. There will also be opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to present their results. Further details and a list of participants can be found at the conference URL&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.hawaii.edu/numbertheory2012/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HCANTAGMF will be a major vehicle for discussing the latest advances in our subject and laying the ground work for future ones. It will be an unparalleled opportunity for the graduate students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, for the faculty at the nearby community colleges in the UH system, and for the faculty and students of the universities on the West Coast with smaller number theory programs. Approximately 100 number theorists will be in attendance, representing a diverse collection of sub-disciplines, and ample time will be allotted for conversation with and among them. The organizers also hope to improve the visibility of the number theory group at the University of Hawaii. By introducing so many researchers to our local number theory group, the organizers hope to increase the visibility of our activities and the profile of the graduate program at the University of Hawaii.</AbstractNarration>
