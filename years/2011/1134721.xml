<AbstractNarration>IIP 1134684 &lt;br/&gt;University of Cincinnati; Lee &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1134676 &lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan; Ni &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1134721 &lt;br/&gt;Missouri University of Science and Technology; Sarangapani &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on Intelligent &lt;br/&gt;Maintenance Systems (IMS) was established in 2001. This proposal builds upon the accomplishments of the previous ten years and seeks funding to continue supporting a three campus operation among the University of Cincinnati (leading institution), the University of Michigan, and Missouri Univ. of S&amp;T. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center addresses the underlying issues in machine degradation modeling and prediction as well as develops the transformational technology in advanced prognostics. Over the past 10 years, the Center has developed systematic methodology and tools that made evident impacts to a number of member companies including Toyota, G.M., Boeing, P&amp;G, and National Instruments, amongst others. Over the next five years, the Center intends to advance the scientific base as well as to validate the developed tools to further accelerate the deployment and commercialization of the developed technologies. The center also plans to have international sites in Singapore, Brazil and Spain. In addition, the Center plans to develop spin-off companies with a compelling Marketing Plan in order to commercialize its tools through its member company, National Instruments, in 2011. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMS IUCRC fills an important niche to maintain industry global competiveness by continuous improvement of manufacturing effectiveness and efficiency. The center educates students and its membership through an extensive system of internship and scholar exchanges as well as international workshops and courses. IMS has developed and continues to execute an effective system for innovation and IP generation. The Center plans to develop spin-off companies with a compelling Marketing Plan in order to commercialize its tools through its member company, National Instruments, in 2011.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the support from National Science Foundation (NSF), a multi-campus Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) was established in 2001 at the University of Cincinnati, and University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. The Univ. of Missouri-Rolla (now Missouri University of Science and Technology or Missouri S&amp;T) has received NSF?s I/UCRC Planning Grant (EEC-  EEC-0531580) in order to establish the IMS Center Site at UMR in 2006 and to join with the other two already established sites with a vision to achieve near-zero breakdown of products and systems through advancement in wireless-enabled and embedded predictive intelligence as well as through strategic partnerships with highly diversified industries.  The University of Texas at Austin joined the other three sites later.  There is a critical need for monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics (M/D/P) research activities in universities to advance the fundamental understanding of the component degradation and failure process, prediction algorithms for failures by monitoring the component in real-time and including this exciting development in the curriculum.  A major goal of this proposed Center Site at Missouri S&amp;T was to find effective ways to investigate relevant M/D/P tools and technologies for solving important industrial problems by bringing together faculty with domain-specific knowledge expertise in M/D/P. In contrast with traditional M/D/P research using sensor-based approach, here, the component behavior, using certain input and output variables, is monitored on-line and any deviations from the normal behavior are considered as failures/faults.  Despite considerable research the M/D/P understanding is quite premature due to the complexity of the today?s industrial components, proprietary nature of the component degradation behaviors and the discovery of new materials that results in new component degradation profiles.  The NSF Site at Missouri S&amp;T has developed novel M/D/P methods by using a model-based approach which describes healthy behavior.  Any deviation from the healthy behavior is monitored and if this deviation exceeds a predefined threshold, a fault is considered to have occurred.  Upon detecting the fault, a novel prediction methodology is derived to obtain the time to failure or remaining useful life.  A suite of novel schemes is developed for predicting failures before they happen so that unscheduled downtime can be prevented. More recently, the effort is focused around cyber physical systems and big data that are being generated from such systems. Both electronic and mechanical component fault prediction was carried out by the Center Site.  This NSF grant was renewed in 2011 for five more years.  Missouri S&amp;T partnered with 7 companies to supplement the funds from the (NSF), and continued to pursue research on monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics and finally to transfer the technology to company members. Member companies supporting the research include Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, Chevron, Festo, and small companies such as 21st Century, Technical Data Analysis, and a few others.   Once in six months, industrial advisory board (IAB) meeting was scheduled with the most recent one being held in Cincinnati during May 24-25, 2017. During the IAB meetings, projects supported using the membership funds are presented for feedback and evaluation.  Each year, the Missouri S&amp;T Center Site has shown that for every dollar in company member investment, on an average a 25 dollar cost match was seen through other memberships and federal grants.  During the past 5 years, over five doctoral level graduate students and several master level students supported, and successfully completed their dissertation and two more doctoral students are pursuing their degree. Over the 6 year duration including the no cost extension period (2011-2017), 18 journal papers, 26 conference papers, have been published and many journals are under review.  Of the many NSF supported I/UCRCs, the IMS Center has been ranked the best Center in terms of return of investment a study conducted under the direction of NSF. Many company members reported a significant savings due to the technology developed by the Center faculty and students. Most of the students graduated were recruited by the company members.   The novel methods and associated technology developed has been applied to a variety of industrial applications which include aerospace, earthmoving, automotive, civil and construction, space, energy and others.  Many of the developed technologies have a significant impact to health care.  Out of many technology transfer activities, two are notable and listed in the annual reports.  Most recent project include bigdata analytics for M/D/P.       Last Modified: 09/10/2017       Submitted by: Jagannathan Sarangapani]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
