<AbstractNarration>People can perform with ease many tasks that remain difficult or impossible for computers, including vision, motion planning, and natural language understanding. New "crowdsourcing" platforms like Amazon's Mechanical Turk make it easier than ever to harness human computational power by streamlining job posting, tracking, and payment for workers. However, the lack of automation means that crowdsourcing currently does not scale up. Low quality results must be filtered out, but checking human computations can be difficult. Economic incentives and anonymity expose crowdsourcing to fraud. Deciding how much to pay workers for particular tasks and how many workers to hire remains an art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project introduces crowdprogramming, an approach that fully integrates human and digital computation. In crowdprogramming, humans are modeled as function calls in a standard programming language. This approach lets programmers focus on programming logic, while the crowdprogramming runtime system manages the critical tradeoffs between cost, time, and data quality. Crowdprogramming will dramatically lower the barriers to harnessing human computational power. It will enable a rich new class of applications that divide labor between digital and human computations, where computers and humans do the work each does best. It will enable complex orchestration of human computations, automatically control quality to maintain high accuracy and avoid fraud, and schedule tasks and adjust payments to maximize speed while staying within budget. By streamlining the incorporation of human labor into computation, crowdprogramming has the potential to add an entirely new job sector to the economy.</AbstractNarration>

For example, humans are far better than computers at performing tasks like vision, motion planning, and natural language understanding. Most researchers expect these tasks to remain beyond the reach of computers for the foreseeable future.  This research explores an approach called crowdprogramming that makes it possible to write computer programs that integrate digital and human-based computation. In effect, crowdprogramming makes it possible to "program with people." Crowdprogramming opens up the possibility for an entirely new class of computer applications, where computers and humans perform the work each does best.

AutoMan leverages crowdsourcing systems that streamline the process of hiring humans to perform computational tasks. AutoMan uses the most popular of these systems, AmazonÆs Mechanical Turk, a web-based platform that matches employers with employees who perform "human intelligence tasks."  A programmer using AutoMan simply describes the task to be performed, which can be a multiple-choice question or a fill-in-the-blank form. Behind the scenes, AutoMan handles all of the details of performing human computation automatically.  First, AutoMan posts tasks and manages workers by communicating with Mechanical Turk.

Success also depends on the programmer writing clear instructions in English, which can be surprisingly tricky.  To assist software developers using AutoMan, we have developed two tools: a debugger and a simulator. The AutoMan Interactive Debugger lets programmers visually monitor the performance of running tasks and understand how a taskÆs structure affects its performance. This debugger can greatly simplify the task of writing and debugging AutoMan programs. For example, the debugger can automatically reveal when a question is ambiguously worded by tracking when workers tend to disagree about responses. The de...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
