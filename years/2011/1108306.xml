<AbstractNarration>The aim of this collaborative project between investigators at three universities is to develop records of past climate in northwest (NW) Greenland and synthesize them with records of the position of ice margin to evaluate the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to past warm periods, such as the Holocene Climatic Optimum (approximately 5 to 9 thousand years ago). Recent studies suggest that rapid ice loss is expanding northwards into NW Greenland, as demonstrated by the dramatic August, 2010 calving event from Petermann Glacier. However, little paleoclimate and ice sheet research has been conducted in NW Greenland, despite the proximity to a logistics center at Thule Air Base. The proposed research integrates multiple climate proxies and glaciological modeling experiments in the Thule region with the following research objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1) Reconstruct Holocene climate in NW Greenland via inferences from reconstructed local ice cap extents (North Ice Cap, Tuto Ice Cap), ice core stable isotope and precipitation records, and data from nearby lake sediments. &lt;br/&gt; 2) Examine the sensitivity of the NW Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) to Holocene climate changes by developing the history of the areal extent of the GIS and synthesizing proxy data with glaciological modeling experiments to examine past GIS changes and predict future GIS retreat.&lt;br/&gt;Results from the proposed research will enable a more accurate prediction of the NW Greenland cryospheric response to a future warmer world and provide information directly relevant to predictions of future sea-足level rise. The investigators propose to enhance public outreach and K-足12 science education through development of educational modules using simplified, web-足based, climate and glaciological models. They would involve graduate and undergraduate students in field and lab research, participate in the Dartmouth Women足 In Science Project, and partner with the Dartmouth polar IGERT program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research was part of a collaborative project integrating glaciochemistry, glacial geology, and paleolimnology to resolve how climate and the local cryosphere changed through the Holocene in northwest Greenland near Thule.  By characterizing past climate change in high-latitude Greenland, this study provided information about the sensitivity of the arctic system to climate forcings.  In particular, this work described the impacts of past climate change on the Greenland Ice Sheet, which will be a major contributor to future sea level rise.  The Northwestern team focused on analysis of lake sediment records.  Holocene sediment cores were obtained from eight previously unstudied lakes in the two study sectors, remote Nunatarssuaq and the area adjacent to Thule Air Base.  Holocene paleoclimate reconstructions were generated from non-glacial lakes using chironomid species assemblages, oxygen isotopes in chironomid remains, and sedimentary lipids.  In addition, two lakes receiving meltwater from modern ice were studied for paleolimnological reconstructions of local ice cap and Greenland Ice Sheet history, to complement glacial geologic reconstructions of nearby ice margin fluctuations.  The final phase of this project is integrating paleotemperature reconstructions with glacial geologic data, to understand how the Greenland Ice Sheet and a local ice cap have responded to past climate change in the high-latitude study area.  This project found consistent evidence for strong insolation-driven warmth and its impacts in the early to middle Holocene, and thus provided data on an important period of past warmth that is partly analogous to future conditions in the Arctic.   In addition to developing paleoenvironmental reconstructions, this project advanced understanding of two potentially important and widely applicable paleolimnological proxy methods: the use of oxygen isotopes in subfossil aquatic organic remains to reconstruct past lakewater isotopes (and in hydrologically appropriate settings, air temperatures), and the use of sedimentary lipids and their hydrogen isotopes to reconstruct aspects of hydroclimate.  This work also demonstrated the potential for extant lakes formerly covered by cold-based sectors of the Greenland Ice Sheet to preserve stratigraphically intact pre-Last Glacial Maximum (probably Last Interglacial, i.e. Eemian) sediments.  This opens up the possibility of recovering Last Interglacial sedimentary records in numerous parts of Greenland, which could improve our understanding of Last Interglacial warmth and its impacts in the Arctic.  Three Northwestern Ph.D. students and nine Northwestern undergraduates participated in this research.  Of the three students who had graduated at the time of this report, two had entered graduate programs in geosciences.  This project also fostered a new collaboration between early-career PIs from three subdisciplines &ndash; glaciochemistry, paleolimnology and glacial geology &ndash; and contributed to Axford developing a longer-term research program on Greenland.  Twenty-two conference presentations and three published journal articles had resulted from this research at the time this report was filed.  Axford also shared results with colleagues at community paleoclimate synthesis workshops and in ten invited lectures at U.S. universities.  This research was shared with non-technical audiences in ten public lectures and panel appearances by the PI, thirteen guest lectures in science, law and journalism classes at Northwestern, creation of an outreach video featuring field work footage and interviews with project scientists, and a public talk by project graduate students at the Thule Air Base community center.
