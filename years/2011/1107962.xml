<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  This  East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute (EAPSI) in Japan for FY 2011  award provided Amalie Donius of Drexel University the opportunity to  take part in an orientation for EAPSI fellows.  Full support of A. Donius' proposed research project at Kyoto University in Japan was recieved in FY 2012.  The graduate student,  A. Donius, was hosted by Professor Hiroyuki Yano and his laboratory in the summer of 2012. The research findings, intellectual merit, and broader impacts of this research experience follow.     Research Findings  The  overall goal of this research was to test the hypothesis that the  functionality of highly porous biomaterials with fully dense cell walls  could be enhanced by creating porous cell walls with additional  nanoporosity. The second level of porosity and greater functionality in  the porous material was created through the use of cellulose or chitin  nanofibers, in which the surface can be functionalized. Objectives  culminating in this goal were investigated.  The first objective was to  successfully separate nanofibers from wood pulp and chitin.  Series of  mechanical and chemical treatments of cellulose wood pulp and chitin  resulted in the extrusion of cellulose and chitin nanofibers,  respectively.  Additionally, chitin nanofibers were further treated to  functionalize the surface.  These nanofibers were imaged with scanning  electron microscopy and analyzed with Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.  The second objective was to  fabricate films of several chosen compositions of these nanofibers.  The  third objective of this research was to analyze and characterize these  films mechanically and structurally.  This enables for the selection of  the optimal material, which composes the cell walls of highly porous  biomaterials.     Intellectual Merit  The  Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the fabrication of  porous degradable and resorbable biomaterials from environmentally  benign and biocompatible materials. In addition to the macroporosity of  the porous material, the cell wall composition and arrangement plays a  large role in the mechanical performance and functionality of the  material.  This was therefore investigated in an attempt to determine  optimal biopolymer nanofiber-reinforced wall materials.     Broader Impacts  Through  the EAPSI fellowship, an international collaboration between Professor  Dr. Hiroyuki Yano at Kyoto University, Japan, and graduate student  Amalie Donius at Drexel University, USA was forged.  Interactions within  Prof. YanoÃ†s laboratory at Kyoto University with scientists at all  levels served as an unparalleled experience in which the fellow gained a  better appreciation of the research environment, research community,  and scientific policies of Japan.  The fellow experienced the research  culture and the spirit of innovation and precision in science, for which  the Japanese are known.  The introduction to the Japanese society,  culture, and language through cultural activities proved to be  unforgettable; old traditions going back to long before our country was  founded, harmoniously present in the modern society.  This research  on cellulose and chitin nanofiber-reinforced materials contributes to  an understanding of biopolymer reinforcement and the design of new  hierarchically-structured materials from biopolymers. The results are  furthermore expected to contribute to structure-property correlations  for the design of porous materials with a hierarchical structure, such  as those used in filtration, catalytic, energy storage, and tissue  engineering applications.
