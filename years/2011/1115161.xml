<AbstractNarration>Lichens and bryophytes share biological traits that make them some of the most sensitive indicators of environmental change. The goal of this project is to provide high quality data to address how species distributions change as a result of major environmental events across time and space. Specifically, this project will digitize the label information (the what, when, where and by whom collected) and images for approximately 2.3 million biological specimens curated in North American lichen and bryophyte herbaria. These collections represent well over 90% of all specimens collected in Canada, the United States and Mexico and held by over 60 US non-governmental institutions. New, on-line digitization techniques will be made publically available at at http://symbiota.org/nalichens/ and http://symbiota.org/bryophytes/, and will allow interested members of the public to be involved and learn about biodiversity alongside the professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Availability of nearly the entire North American bryophyte and lichen collections on-line will greatly accelerate knowledge and evaluation of the biodiversity of these organisms by fostering collaborations between professionals and the general public. Additionally, models developed from these digitized data will aid future mapping projections of large scale species distributions and identification of biodiversity hotspots as prime candidates for protection. These endeavors will help to elucidate regions where changes are imminent and likely to have substantial impact, as well as to facilitate proactive initiatives to alleviate such changes. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding for this project resulted in the digitization (databasing, imaging and georeferencing) of over 100,000 North American lichen and bryophyte specimens held in permanent collections at the University of Washington, Western Washington University, Boise State University, and Oregon State University.  All of these specimen records are freely available to the public online at the following resources: Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria (http://www.pnwherbaria.org/data/search.php), Consortium of North American Lichen Herbaria (http://lichenportal.org/portal/), Consortium of North American Bryophyte Herbaria (http://bryophyteportal.org/portal/).  Participating staff in the digitization efforts included undergraduate and graduate students, women, and minorities from across the institutions listed.  Staff gained experience in a range of technical skills including relational database operation, digital photography, data management, image processing software operation, and georeferencing software operation.  Digitization of these specimens now provides the basis for exploring a number of questions relating to the diversity of lichen and bryophyte species and the distribution of that diversity.  Specimens digitized in this project date back to the late 19th century, and the georeferencing (assigning latitude and longitude values) of these specimens allows for the mapping of species distributions past and present.  For example, it is possible to explore the potential impacts of urbanization on lichen or bryophyte diversity here in the Pacific Northwest due to the size of the dataset now available.   The free, public availability of the data online truly democratizes access to these publicly supported collections and creates rich opportunities for structured or unstructred, self-directed or class-oriented, formal or informal learning opportunities.
