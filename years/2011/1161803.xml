<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how the genomic material of viruses enters the cells they are infecting.  Cells across all domains of life are subjected to infection by viruses.   These viruses have a multitude of different lifestyles which often involve different ways of introducing their genes into the infected host.   For some of these viruses, it has been hypothesized that mechanical forces resulting from the tightly-packaged DNA within the virus creates a pressure which injects the DNA into the host?s interior.    Studies conducted under this award will test this hypothesis by using fluorescence microscopy to watch individual viruses inject their DNA into individual bacteria and to measure the rate of ejection.   By using different drug treatments, the mechanics of the ejection process will be perturbed providing a picture of the molecular processes that drive DNA translocation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, these studies will serve as a powerful example of the interplay between the physical processes that govern the lifestyles of viruses and their biological functions.   Further, since the approach merges single-molecule experiments with mechanical models, it will help settle a long standing controversy about how viral infections occur.   The research is tightly integrated with an educational plan that focuses on summer time courses in which undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs come to the awardee?s institution for an intensive fortnight of experiments using the study of viral ejection as a paradigm for single-molecule studies of biological processes which represent one of the biological frontiers of mechanics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes or findings that address the intellectual merit and broader of impacts of your work:  Our work developed a biophysical description of the bacteriophage infection and growth dynamics, exploring the interplay between quantitative models and experimental results. Besides providing a better understanding of the viral life cycle, more broadly, we identified several relevant mechanical principles that govern and constrain the information processing abilities of cells.  Indeed, this work has served as a jumping off point for a much broader set of investigations on the mechanics of gene transfer, a process relevant at scales ranging from the emergence of antibiotic resistance to the acquisition of new genes as microbial species evolve.        Briefly summarize the outcomes of your award (200 &ndash; 800 words) covering the entire life of the award:  This award provided critical support for an exciting joint theoretical and experimental investigation of the important subject of how bacterial viruses work.   These viruses have long served as a key model system in biology and the advent of modern single-molecule techniques has led to a resurgence of interest in them.  Besides our theoretical analysis of the free energy of viral packing, we have also developed both in vitro and in vivo experiments that permit us to watch individual viruses as part of their infectitious life style.   We have confirmed that in the early ejection phase, the "pressurized DNA" driving force combined with a friction model derived from hydrodynamic interactions of the closely packed phage DNA in the capsid, together give rise to the correct behavior of the measured ejection dynamics. We have also identified that in the phage ejection process, the effect of bacterial cytoplasm exerting mechanical feedbacks to the macromolecules and their associated reactions is important. In our analysis of in vivo phage ejection, we model the viral DNA ejected into the cytoplasm as anomalous diffusion, which agrees with the scaling of ejection speed in the long-time limit we observed.     This work has emboldened a new attack on the full life cycle of the  viruses once they are within the host.  To that end, we  have adopted  the FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization) technique to the  bacteriophage system as a potential scheme for dissecting different  phage ejection driving forces (pressurized DNA, osmotic pressure,  transcription).  We also use FISH to quantify the bacteriophage DNA copy number as a function of time, in the lytic production phase. It was unclear how the growth curves of the viral products can be explained by using simple master equations describing the replication/transcription/translation of phage Lambda, despite the well-characterized Lambda genetic regulatory circuit, or how wasteful the viral production is compared to the burst size (the average number of viral particles released per cell as measured in titer experiments).  In work that will now build upon that started under the auspices of this award, we will continue to investigage the mechanics of DNA transfer across cell membranes and simultaneously continue to develop rigorous measurements for taking the census of viral proteins after infection.
