<AbstractNarration>Over the course of its five years, this Phase I project is providing 30 scholarships to junior and senior mathematics majors preparing to become grades 6-12 mathematics teachers. This proposal is a joint venture among a variety of interested parties, including the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at UHD, the Department of Urban Education (UE) at UHD, Aldine Independent School District, Alief Independent School District, and the Houston Community College Central Campus.  Given the nature of the student population at the university and the population in the geographic area the university serves, the project is making strong efforts to recruit minority students.</AbstractNarration>
