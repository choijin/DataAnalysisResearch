<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports Professor Malcolm D. E. Forbes at the University of North Carolina- Chapel Hill who seeks to continue his exploration of radical chemistry and dynamics in confined environments. Using time-resolved and steady-state magnetic resonance techniques, he will carry out spectroscopy on free radicals, extracting g-factors, hyperfine coupling constants, and fine structure splittings. From line shape analyses and modeling of time-dependent spectra he will obtain dynamic information such as diffusion coefficients, rotational correlation times, and spin relaxation rates. His interests are broadly based in polymers and in nano-environments such as micelles and reverse micelles. In this work, activities are expanded to the study of nano- and microbubbles, nanocrystals, and polymer nanoparticles. The underlying theme is the control of radical reactions, not just in terms of reaction rates but also the control of radical location in organized assemblies. The results of this study will have potential utility for nanomedicine (photodynamic therapy), polymer synthesis (adhesion and coatings), polymer degradation (light pipes) and the development of new catalytic reactions (glycolization, water splitting, and CO2 reduction).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor Malcolm D. E. Forbes will pursue a strategy of maintaining core competencies in spectroscopy and physical organic methodology as applied to kinetics, structure and mechanism. Professor Forbes' laboratory  trains researchers in small molecule and polymer synthesis, structural analysis, photochemistry and laser spectroscopy, magnetic resonance (including microwave engineering), molecular and macromolecular dynamics, surface and colloid chemistry, and catalysis.  The broader impacts of the proposed work are exemplified by continuing efforts in community outreach for science education, scientific interactions with the general public, international collaborations, and by addressing diversity in the field of chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Our laboratory is interested in how molecules move and react when they are in confined spaces.  Examples of such spaces include nanocrsytals, micelles (droplets of oil in water created by dissolving soap), and vesicles (cell mimics).  The types of molecules we study are called free radicals, because they have unpaired electron spins in their structure.  The unpaired spin has magnetic properties that allow us to investigate them by a technique called electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.   When free radicals are created with a flash of laser light, they are created in pairs, either by an electron transfer even from one molecule (a donor) to another molecule (an acceptor), or through a bond-breaking reaction, with each fragment of the original molecule leaving with one unpaired electron.  When this so-called "radical pair" is created in a confined space, the unpaired electrons still interact through a process called spin exchange, which is detectable by EPR.  We use the fact that spin exchange is distance dependent to tell us, over the first 10-200 nanoseconds of the radical pair's lifetime, how the radicals are diffusing, i.e., moving translationally relative to each other, over distances of several nanometers. Examples of how the EPR spectra change depending on confinement or lack thereof, are shown in Figure 1.  We also apply our technique to the investigation of polymers (macromolecules) as they move in solvents. This is accomplished by tagging the polymer chain with a stable free radical and then photoexciting a different section of the polymer chain.  The interaction of the photoexcited state in one part of the chain with the free radical in another section provides information about how often the two segments are making contact.  Recently, we have been using EPR spectroscopy to develop a quantitative methodology for tracking a molecule called singlet oxygen in nanostructures. Singlet oxygen is produced by the interaction of ground state oxygen with the excited states of other molecules such as porphyrins found in nature (chlorophyll is an example).  Singlet oxygen is highly reactive and can be used to kill cancer cells through a process called photodynamic therapy (PDT).    We are trying to put photodynamic therapy on a more quantitative footing by reacting singlet oxygen in a way that stable free radicals are produced in high yield.  By measuring the number of these stable free radicals using EPR, we can use our model for the kinetics of the reaction to "backtrack" to the original yield of singlet oxygen in the system of interest. We have accomplished rigorous kinetic measurements of this process in liquid solution for the first time, and we currently seek to expand our methodology to heterogeneous structures such as vesicles and even cells.    Broader Impacts:  Information about molecular mobility is important as it helps us understand the nature of the confined space (size, electronic properties), as well as the moving molecules themselves. When nanostructures are used, for example, in druge delivery systems, it is important to understand the nature of the boundary that keeps the drugs inside the container, so that it is not released too early or too late.  Our data can assist other researchers in the development and optimization of such biocompatible carriers.  Our PDT results are of significant interest to researchers developing new cancer treatments using light, for example, in understanding the depth of penetration of light in animal tissue, or the relationship between the efficacy of the therapy with regard to blood flow in or around a tumor.  Understanding polymer chain dynamics is important as it can help develop new polymers with specific rheological (flow) properties, for example for the coatings industry in aerospace or in the deveopment of new automobile paints.  Through this work, our laboratory provides a rich training ground for the next generation of scientists at all career stages (high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral reseasrchers).  We also have significant interaction with the general public through the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science, with an exhibit on the photochemistry of beer that has appeared each year from 2011-2015.
