<AbstractNarration>This project is creating a set of virtual reality experiments that will expose K-12 and college students as well as the public to laboratory equipment used in the study of materials. Some laboratory equipment can be quite expensive or cumbersome, and certain experiments are time-consuming.  This virtual reality approach is making technical equipment accessible at little or no cost to many more people around the world to learn about engineering and materials science, including visitors to museums and students at schools that do not own this equipment. The modules are 3-D and fully interactive to help attract more students to engineering careers. Researchers are studying how students learn from using these virtual reality modules, which will help others develop better virtual reality educational tools for other subjects in the future. Collaboration with a university in Brazil, funded through NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering, is allowing the modules to be translated and developed based on topics that will help broaden participation in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The purpose of this collaborative project is to create a unique set of VR experiments related to teaching of civil and construction materials to be used in undergraduate STEM fields, construction, civil, and material science, community college instructions and public demonstrations and hands on recruiting events for middle and high school students.    Based on the results of this project, the following outcomes are reported:  Two VR Simulation modules were developed; one for measuring asphalt viscosity and one for testing concrete compressive strength.  Multiple models of each experiment were developed.  The modules were created, and were then given to the instructors of record in the Department of Civil Engineering and Construction Management at LSU to evaluate and give comments for improvements.  Based on the instructorÃ†s feedback and comments, the modules were modified.  The final versions of the modules were used for assessment. Four instructors were trained on the use of the simulation modules at LSU. Two from the Civil Engineering department and two from the Construction Management department.  The instructors integrated the modules in two courses at LSU CM 3400 construction materials and CE 3700 Civil Engineering Materials. The modules were evaluated as a teaching tool in two classes CM 3400 and CE 3700.  The classes were divided into two groups, Group 1 were given the modules and group 2 were taught the experimental traditionally using a lab setup in the case of CE 3700 or a classroom setup in the case of CM 3400.  Assessment      results showed that there is no statistically significant difference      between the assessment of the students that were taught using the VR      modules and those that used traditional methods of teaching including      using Lab facilities as in the case of CE 3700 or being taught in a      classroom setup as in the case of CM 3400.       In fact, the lab reports submitted by the VR group in CM 3400 showed      better comprehension of the subject matter.   Both CE 3700 groups showed similar      performance in their quizzes and lab reports. The project team will keep      utilizing the developed VR modules in Civil Engineering and Construction      classes at LSU.  The research team published one      conference paper as a result of this project.   Evaluation showed that the VR lab      methodology and technology is easy to use and can be disseminated to many      institutions. Evaluation showed that the developed      modules are interactive, which helped with student engagement and learning      experience.
