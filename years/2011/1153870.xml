<AbstractNarration>Tectonic plate boundaries where ocean crust subducts beneath continental crust are associated not only in the Earth's most active earthquake zones, but also with the largest concentration of land volcanoes.  Our understanding of these areas (also called subduction zones) and the processes that cause associated seismic and volcanic hazards is therefore needed for us to be able to better protect coastal communities and prepare effective land use and hazard mitigation strategies.   Because both volcanism and earthquakes are affected by, and many times triggered by, fluids and the dehydration of minerals exposed to increasing temperatures and pressures as subduction occurs, our knowledge of how subduction zone fluids change with space, time, and composition across and between subduction zones is critical to our understanding of how these important areas behave and evolve over time.  This research completes the geochemical data sets of subduction zones off the northwestern US, Japan, South and Central America, and the Caribbean.  It also compiles all relevant laboratory experimental data, pore fluid, and deep sea bore hole fluid data with a focus on synthesizing this voluminous dataset and seeking new insights into how the geochemistry of fluids can reveal processes occurring at depth in the subduction process.  Where identified, gaps in the geochemical record of these fluids will be completed, including creating an isotopic dataset for oxygen, deuterium, strontium, lithium, boron.  The collective data will be used to examine mass balances of elements, the contribution of subduction fluids to the make-up of present day seawater, the role of compaction and dehydration/hydration reaction on fluid chemistry, and insights on the evolution of pore fluid pressures.  Broader impacts of the work include support of a more than 15 year NSF investment in subduction zone characterization and dynamics and support of a PI whose gender is under-represented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Elevated fluid pressure, and fluid flow have profound implications for the evolution of forearc physical, chemical, and thermal properties. Accordingly, the major goals of the project were:  To quantify the fluid budgets in subduction zone forearcs,  To understand the role of subduction zone forearc fluids in the long-term oceanic cycles of solutes and volatiles,  To gain key insights role on the role of fluids in mega-earthquakes at this dynamic tectonic setting, specifically to understand the subsurface hydrogeology  To evaluate the significance of fluid cycling and fluxes into the ocean from subduction zones, and  To identify the nature of fluid-rock reactions at the seismogenic zone. Fluid generation,           To achieve these goals the objective was to conduct a comprehensive in-depth analysis and synthesis of the chemical and isotopic data of the pore fluids in subduction zone (SZ) forearcs, acquired through scientific ocean drilling and long-range monitoring of borehole observatories, at representative and most extensively studied accretionary and erosional subduction zone forearcs.          Regarding the role of SZ forearc fluids in the long-term oceanic cycles of solutes and volatiles, at the forearc, the fluids that return to the ocean originate from various depths and therefore influenced by different fluid-rock reactions. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the fluids that return to the ocean differ significantly from seawater composition and help to delineate the temperature and the nature of the fluid-rock reactions at the source. The expelled pore waters by compaction are less altered than the fluids from mineral dehydration/hydration reactions. Therefore, the ratio of expelled pore fluids by compaction/expelled fluid from dehydration reactions must be determined.         The main pathways of the fluids from both sources to the ocean are faults, including the d&eacute;collement. The importance of the porous upper oceanic basement in the hydrology at subduction zones, as-yet unknown may be important; so far it was only determined at very few locations, e.g. at IODP Hole 1253A (9o38.858' N   86o11.434' W, water depth 4376 m)on the incoming subducting plate, adjacent to the trench offshore Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. The objective was to monitor the fluids and associated pressure and temperature in the high porosity upper oceanic basement (e.g. Davis et al., 2011).   What has been accomplished under these goals  Major activities:  Five representative SZs were selected for the project, they are: offshoreBarbados, Peru,CostaRica&ndash;attwolocations,Cascadia&ndash;atthreelocations,andat NankaiTrough,Japan&ndash;attwolocations. An inventory and compilation of all the existing and missing porefluidchemical components and/or isotopic ratio data fromeach site drilled and monitored at these five selected SZ was conducted. An important objective was to have the same data-base of pore fluid chemistry and isotope ratios from each site selected for the project.          Upon the completion of the major analytical phase of the project, for the first time it was possible to conduct a global synthesis of pore fluid chemical and isotope ratio data in forearcs, and view their geochemical evolution, how burial, heating, and lithology modify the chemistry of the pore fluids, originally seawater. Furthermore, the role of compaction and dehydration/hydration reactions on the fluid geochemistry and fluxes in both erosional and accretionary subduction zones could be evaluated.   Significant results:         The most significant chemical and isotopic characteristics of the expelled fluids relative to seawater are: Cl dilution, sulfate, Ca and Mg depletions, and enrichments in Li, B, Si, Sr, alkalinity, and hydrocarbon concentrations; they also often have distinctive &delta;18O,&delta;D, &delta;7Li, &delta;11B, and &delta;37Cl values, and variable Sr isotope ratios. These characteristics provide key insights on the source of the fluid and the temperature at the source. Based on fluid chemistry, the most often reported source temperatures reported are 120-150 &deg;C, the modeled temperature at the up-dip.   Using our best fluid output flux estimate, the global ocean residence time in SZ is ~100 Myr. This value is about x5 faster than previous estimates for SZs and is more similar to the estimates of the residence time in the global ridge crest that range from 20-90 Myr.   Key outcomes and achievements:  The new results and synthesis provide a new understanding of the hydrogeology of SZs, for the first time the solute fluxes into the ocean from forearcs have been determined, and because the chemistry of the fluids that exit the forearc into the ocean are distinct from seawater chemistry, these fluids must impact the global cycles of these elements; the magnitude of the impacts are still being evaluated.          Also, because the measured fluid output fluxes at forearc seeps are high, ~15-40 times the amount of water that can be produced through local steady-state compaction and dehydration reactions, additional fluid sources, possibly recirculation of seawater, or non-steady-state fluid flow must be involved, the source(s) have not been identified yet.
