<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Engineering Division of the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) will hold its 15th Chemical Engineering Summer School on July 21-26, 2012 at the University of Maine. The Summer School, initiated in 1931 and currently offered every five years, is the premier teaching training workshop for new chemical engineering faculty.&lt;br/&gt;The Summer School is unique in its emphasis on the development of new chemical engineering educators. There is no other educational forum which is comparable in scope - targeted specifically toward training new chemical engineering faculty. And no other engineering discipline has a comparable forum offered on a consistent basis. By targeting faculty at the beginning of their careers, professors can become more effective educators ? more capable of producing better qualified undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering professionals. In the Summer School, new faculty learn how to integrate the latest developments in the field effectively and seamlessly into the chemical engineering curriculum. The Summer School also aids in the career development of new faculty by providing them extensive resources and network opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;Historically, around 200 new chemical engineering educators attend the Summer School each time it is offered. Thus, the Summer School has enormous broad impact, as new faculty become much more effective at educating the next generation of chemical engineers. And, the Summer School has a proven track record of effectiveness with testimonials from previous attendees confirming its value. The teaching abilities of new chemical engineering faculty are improved significantly, and the breath and timeliness of new topics incorporated by these faculty into courses taught at their home institutions is enhanced. Student evaluations of the teaching capabilities of new faculty who attend the Summer School increase significantly.&lt;br/&gt;The 2012 Summer School will both capitalize on the many successful aspects of the previous Summer Schools and include several novel aspects. Innovations include the addition of international faculty participation (both faculty presenters and early-career faculty), collaboration between industry and academic representatives in the workshop presentations, and the industrial Q &amp; A panel session. The 2012 Summer School will also emphasize the linkage between research/teaching and engagement with external constituent groups, including industry, K-12, and other stakeholders. This linkage will be emphasized via an NSF session, a day-long Teaching Institute, and through workshops in career development, K-12 engineering education, and combining research and educational scholarship. Finally, an additional assessment instrument will be introduced which gathers input from faculty participants approximately one year after their attendance at the Summer School. This instrument will both help confirm the longer- term impact the Summer School has on participants and provide useful feedback for improving the School even more in the future.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The Summer School, initiated in 1931 and offered every five years, is the premier U.S. teaching training workshop for new chemical engineering faculty. The Summer School is unique in its emphasis on the development of new chemical engineering educators. There is no other educational forum which is comparable in scope - targeted specifically toward training new chemical engineering faculty. And no other engineering discipline has a comparable forum offered on a consistent basis. By focusing this effort at the beginning of professorsÆ careers, the Summer School helps faculty become more effective educators - capable of producing better qualified undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering professionals.  Due to the impact on chemical engineering graduates, industry also provided support (over 50% of the total project cost) for the 2012 Summer School. The field of chemical engineering is advancing rapidly and the Summer School is an essential step in apprising new faculty of the latest developments.  At the 2012 Summer School, faculty learned how to effectively and seamlessly incorporate topics like sustainability, safety, communication skills, leadership, computational fluid dynamics, software packages, etc. into the chemical engineering curriculum.  New faculty also learned the latest in educational teaching strategies by master, internationally-recognized teaching faculty. The networking that occurred between faculty attendees while living together in a university residence hall during the program was also a key benefit for attendees. One key activity was a poster session in which participants shared posters on various topics - including learning styles, outreach activities, strategies for lecture courses, new laboratory and demonstration experiments, and computer-based problems and analysis. Over 150 chemical engineering educators attended the 2012 Summer School, so the impact these faculty have on the education of the next generation of chemical engineers is enormous.  The Summer School has a strong proven track record of effectiveness; the 2012 Summer School was no exception as evidenced by the faculty input received through post Summer School surveys.  Two surveys were conducted &ndash; one immediately after the conclusion of the Summer School and one six months later to assess how faculty implemented the educational strategies and materials they learned at the Summer School.  The response from the faculty was extremely positive with over 80% of the faculty attendees implementing materials in the first course they taught the semester immediately following the Summer School and over 90% of the faculty attendees sharing information they learned with other faculty colleagues.  The educational materials presented at the Summer School were disseminated to all faculty attendees and are also available from the website  http://www.engr.uky.edu/~aseeched/.
