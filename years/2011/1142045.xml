<AbstractNarration>With this award, researchers from three U.S. institutions will focus on exploring and understanding near-Earth?s space environment (geospace) through the coordinated use of multiple data sets, including both a variety of individual spacecraft and strategically located ground observatories. Because those parts of the Earth?s magnetic field that reach farthest out into geospace intersect the ground at high latitudes, arrays of ground magnetometers and auroral imagers have long been a valued means of monitoring processes in remote parts of the magnetosphere. The ground stations used in this project are key links in arrays of ground-based ionospheric and magnetospheric observations in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. In conjunction with data from other instruments located at these sites, with other Antarctic arrays of automated instruments, and with both low-altitude and high-altitude satellites, these instruments have played and will continue to play a significant role in the studies of geospace phenomena including solar wind?magnetosphere interactions and geomagnetic storms and substorms. Taken together, search coil instruments at these stations make it possible to study the entire range of ultra-low frequency (ULF) variations, from Pc 1 and Pi 1 pulsations down to Pc 5 pulsations, magnetic impulse events, sudden impulses, and substorm bays, with high sensitivity. The analysis efforts associated with this project will involve, and are highly suitable for, research training of both undergraduate and graduate students, and build on currently strong programs of faculty and student research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Grant ANT-1142045 to Augsburg College, together with collaborative grants to the University of New Hampshire and the University of California-Berkeley, supported the continued operation of, and analysis of data from, five induction (search coil) magnetometers at high latitude sites.  The scientific focus of the Augsburg College portion of this work fell into two areas:  a) studies of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves observed at high and very high latitudes in regions of both closed and open field lines, and b) studies of ULF waves associated with geomagnetic storms and radiation belt dynamics as ground-based and space-based diagnostics of storm-related loss, injection, and energization processes of ring current protons and relativistic radiation belt electrons, their generation via instabilities in energetic ion distributions, and their ionospheric propagation.  In both areas data from these instruments were used in combination with data from various research satellites.   During the period of this grant (2012-2015) members of the Augsburg team were first authors of four published refereed research papers, and were co-authors of six more.  Highlights include:  -- Engebretson et al. [2012] used coordinated ground and satellite data to characterize the source region of the "mantle waves" that we first identified in Arctic and Antarctic ground data in 1997 and used a theoretical instability analysis to confirm that these waves are generated by the electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) instability.  -- Bier et al. [2014], in a study of the control of Pc3-4 waves by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), documented for the first time some of the limitations of data obtained in the solar wind at the upstream L1 Langrangian point for the study of magnetospheric processes during times of radial IMF.  The use of spacecraft data much closer to Earth is much to be preferred when they are available.   -- Engebretson et al. [2015] found that current qualitative models of the location and types of EMIC waves that deplete radiation belt electrons are substantially inadequate, as is the theoretical body of knowledge on which these are based.  In conjunction with other recent theoretical work, this study provides impetus for a much better understanding of the nature and distribution of these waves and of their impact on the radiation belts.  This grant has also provided research training to twelve undergraduate physics majors at Augsburg College.  Of the five who have now graduated, two are employed in STEM fields in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and two are in graduate programs in STEM fields.
