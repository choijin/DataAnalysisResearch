<AbstractNarration>The objective of the Merit Fellows project is to focus on academically talented, financially disadvantaged STEM students participating in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Merit Program for Emerging Scholars. The Merit Program, established in 1989 at UIUC, is proving to be successful in recruiting and graduating students in the STEM disciplines. Nineteen (19) full time majors in Chemistry, Integrative Biology (IB), and Mathematics (recruited in cohorts) are to be provided with scholarships for their entire undergraduate experience. The university is committed to financially supporting all students through graduation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in the project design that is based on strong evidence that enhanced support services provided through additional advising, a wide variety of cohort-building activities, and a mentoring program (peer and faculty) are highly successful in retaining students in STEM majors. Scholarships for the maximum amount possible reduce the need for students to work part-time during the academic year. Multiple evaluation efforts are to be implemented to assess the impact of the extra funds and services on the students' performance and persistence in STEM majors. The project is to be directed by expert and experienced PIs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the program are in its efforts to retain students from small rural high schools, females, and underrepresented minorities at higher rates than has been possible in the past. The evaluation of this project is to be used to request institutionalization of the Faculty and Peer mentoring program.  Additionally the results of the project are to be incorporated into the development strategy of each department with the specific goal of securing corporate and private funding to support continuation and expansion of the scholarship program. The Merit Fellows Scholarship Program is potentially a model for dissemination to other institutions to adopt and adapt to their own context. A website is to be used as a recruitment tool and to record success stories and quotes from Merit Fellows. A description of the Merit Fellow Program including evaluation results will be made available in future publications and presentations by Merit Directors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Merit Fellows Scholarship Program (NSF Scholarships in STEM project #1154189) has provided significant support for four cohorts of undergraduate Merit students majoring in chemistry, integrative biology, or mathematics since 2012.  The main goal of the program was to provide scholarship funds and enhanced student support services to a select group of students with high financial need who were also participants in our Merit Program for Emerging Scholars.  As of summer 2019, 76% of the Merit Fellows will have graduated in their original major in under 5 years.  A large portion of the graduates are either pursuing continued education in a STEM field or successfully employed in a STEM-related field.   After an application and interview process, Merit Fellows received substantial scholarship support throughout their time at Illinois (typically $2500 or $5000 per semester depending on their level of financial need) as well as the guidance of a graduate student mentor.  They also participated in multiple cohort-building or professional development activities each semester.  Merit Fellows were also encouraged to pursue undergraduate research and internship opportunities in their fields of study.    A total of 29 Merit Fellows were chosen during the project over four incoming cohorts (2012-2015).  As of summer 2019:   22 graduated in original major of chemistry, integrative biology, or mathematics 4 graduated in another STEM discipline 1 graduated in a non-STEM discipline   All of these graduates will have finished their studies in 4.5 years or less.  Thus, of the 29 students chosen as Merit Fellows, 27 (~93%) will have graduated from Illinois with 26 (~90%) of them in STEM majors and 22 (~76%) of them in their original major.  By comparison, the campus-wide 6-year graduation rate is currently 84%.  The percentage of students who begin in our College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and graduate with a degree in that same college within six years is 67%.  Within our Merit Fellows group, 17 were underrepresented minority (URM) students. Fourteen of them (~82%) will have graduated as of this year.  By comparison, the 6-year graduation rate for URM students campus-wide is 76% and the percentage who begin in LAS and graduate with an LAS degree within 6 years is 57%.    Among the Merit Fellow alumni:  4 are pursuing a PhD in chemistry or biology; 3 of those have received an NSF fellowship 1 is pursuing an MS in biology 2 are enrolled in medical school 1 is a registered nurse 3 are working as chemists for different companies 4 are employed in a STEM related field    Through the project?s evaluation efforts, Merit Fellows reported that participation in the program had a positive impact on their decision to remain in their major, noting the benefits of a support system that fosters empowerment, confidence, and a network of people to which students can relate.  Merit Fellows also stated that the mentoring and advising provided through the program was highly beneficial.  As two Merit Fellows noted:  "The Merit Fellows program has provided me with an additional network of support which I did not realize I was lacking until needing to take advantage of it. I no longer feel lost in the sea of other students on campus, I know that I have genuine people with similar experiences to turn to in times when I need guidance, support, or a push in the right direction."   "I am still very grateful for the scholarship that the merit program awarded to me. Coming from a family of 6 kids and a single mom and being a first generation student, whatever wasn't provided in scholarships I had to take out in loans. Moreover, the support that the Merit program offered me was incredible. Thanks to the Merit program I was able to participate in paid research instead of having to take extra time away from my studies to work in an area that wouldn?t have pertained to my future career. Finally, the mentors that I made through the Merit program were vital to my success at UIUC."  Graduate Mentors described the benefits of getting to know undergraduate students better which not only helped them improve their own mentoring skills but also informed their practice as educators. Furthermore, many felt that participating as mentors in this program helped them develop professionally overall, improving their prospects for employment after graduate school and providing skills they can use and build upon throughout their career.  As one mentor stated:   "I thought that I had a pretty good handle on what it is like to be a freshman/sophomore math major?but after talking to my mentees one-on one I was reminded of many of my own smaller, day-to-day struggles which I had forgotten. I think that this has helped me to understand my students better and it has made me a better instructor."          Last Modified: 04/30/2019       Submitted by: Jennifer Mcneilly]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
