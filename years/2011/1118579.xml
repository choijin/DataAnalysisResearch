<AbstractNarration>This CRPA award addresses the exciting contemporary chemical science that occurs in interstellar space. The new interferometers coming online this year will enhance this new area of science and further intrigue those who engage. The plan in this award is to build an exhibit that will interest the audience with the space-based aspects, but will also engage them in understanding the chemistry that occurs in space. This is a collaborative effort between the University of Virginia and the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exhibit is relatively small facilitating its mobility. Thus, the authors will travel the exhibit to smaller venues in rural areas and embrace citizens who are typically under-served by educational opportunities of ISE venues. The target audience is 12-15 year old youths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clearly, this project is meant to engage the public in both Space science and Chemistry with the ultimate hope that some individuals will even think about careers in the joint science field that is emerging from these types of behaviors.</AbstractNarration>

The exhibit is designed for middle school students and addresses basic concepts in chemistry, molecular structure, and chemical analysis. The exhibit consists of 8 main components built into 6 freestanding exhibits: EXA Orientation Exhibit, EX1 Touch a Molecule, EX2 The Stinking Universe, EX3 Signal Signatures, EX4 What's My Line, EX5 Chemical Detective, EX6 Astrochemistry Tools, and EXB Cosmic Recycling.</p> <p>The EXA Orientation Exhibit is built on a model of a propyne molecule. It serves to attract visitors to the exhibit, and to introduce four main concepts: 1. Molecules have shapes; 2. The shape of a molecule can be used to detect the presence of the molecule; 3. Many common molecules are found in space; 4. Astronomers use large radio telescopes to identify molecules in space.</p> <p>The first exhibit component, EX1 Touch a Molecule, is an interactive activity in which students identify an unseen molecule based on its shape. Students reach into a drawer where they can feel a small model of a molecule. They then compare the shape to drawings of common molecules to infer the identity of the hidden molecule. The correct answer can then be revealed by the students. The activity shows students that molecules have unique shapes and that these shapes can be used to identify molecules.</p> <p>The second exhibit component, EX2 The Stinking Universe, allows students to identify molecules by their smell. A few small containers hold artificial smells (for safety, the smells are artificial scents designed to closely resemble those of actual chemicals) representing molecules commonly found in space and on Earth. Students will be invited to smell the molecules and will learn that their nose detects different scents due to the different shapes of the molecules. Students will also learn that many molecules found in space are also found on Earth.</p> <p>The third module, EX3 Signal Signatures, allows students to explore the concept of molecular rotation. The exhibit will contain a spinning molecules. Students will be allowed to add energy to the molecule by pushing a button. The molecule will spin faster, and then spontaneously slow down as it emits a "radio wave." Graphics panels will explain that molecules rotate, that how a molecule rotates depends on its structure, and that molecules can speed up and slow down by absorbing or emitting radio waves.</p> <p>In the fourth exhibit module, EX4 What's My Line, students identify molecules based on their rotational spectrum determined from an actual microwave spectrometer. The exhibit contains a sealed cylinder filled with a variety of gasses. Students can use a button to activate the microwave spectrometer, which will present them with a graphical display of emission lines from the gas. Students can compare the emission lines to a catalog of known gasses to determine the contents in the tube.</p> <p>The 5th module, Chemical Detective, shows students how astronomers find chemicals in space using radio telescopes.
