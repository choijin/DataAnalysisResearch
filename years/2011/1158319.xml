<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  &lt;br/&gt;Two-component signal transduction pathways and expanded multi-step His-Asp phosphorelay signaling pathways control how bacteria and fungal organisms respond and adapt to environmental stress.  The His-Asp phosphorelay pathways found in eukaryotes frequently feature multiple upstream sensor kinases (HKs) and downstream response regulator (RR) proteins, yet nearly all depend on a single intermediate histidine phosphotransfer (HPt) protein for phosphoryl group transfer.  Although several thousands of HK-RR cognate pairs have been identified in bacteria and fungi, very little is understood about protein-protein interactions that govern specificity within a particular pathway and prevent cross-talk within a single organism.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relative simplicity of the signal transduction pathway (one HK, one HPt and two RRs) in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, together with recent X-ray crystallographic studies of the Ypd1 HPt protein in complex with the Sln1 receiver domain, provides an excellent foundation for the investigation of molecular interactions within a phosphorelay signaling system.  The long-term goal of this research is to understand regulation of phosphate flow from Ypd1 to the downstream response regulators, Ssk1 and Skn7, as a function of environmental stress.  The main objective of this project is to achieve a detailed understanding of the structural, biochemical and functional implications of Ypd1 interactions with the three homologous response regulator domains associated with Sln1, Ssk1 and Skn7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims are designed to test the hypothesis that molecular interactions within the yeast phosphorelay signaling pathway are influenced by external environmental signals and the phosphorylation state of the interacting signaling partners.  A multidisciplinary approach using structural, biochemical and genetic approaches will be taken.  Specific Aim 1 is structural characterization of Ypd1 (HPt) protein complexes with cognate RR domains.  Specific Aim 2 is to determine the effect of site-specific mutations in Ypd1 and/or RR domains on protein binding affinity, phosphotransfer and specificity of interaction.  Specific Aim 3 is to determine the in vivo consequences of mutations that affect Ypd1-RR interactions in the SLN1 pathway.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has broad significance with respect to how signaling partners interact with each other and influence fidelity of signal transduction.  The results are expected to reveal, for the first time, key structural features that contribute to HPt-RR interactions and signaling specificity within multistep phosphorelay systems from all three domains of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  &lt;br/&gt;Results from this project are expected to provide significant new insight into the principles that govern signal transduction pathways, specifically, the role of protein phosphorylation and its impact on regulating protein-protein interactions.  The integration of research and student training is an important aspect of this proposal.  A summer exchange program for undergraduate students at the University of Oklahoma and the University of Iowa will provide cross-disciplinary training in structural, biochemical and in vivo genetic approaches.  In addition, a hands-on laboratory-based X-ray crystallography course will be developed and offered at the graduate-level or senior undergraduate capstone level at University of Oklahoma.  Students will have the opportunity to access state-of-the-art (NSF-funded) crystallization robotics instrumentation and apply X-ray diffraction techniques to solve the three-dimensional structure of biomacromolecules.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cells have the remarkable ability to sense and respond to changes in their environment.  This is achieved through signal transduction pathways that typically involve a receptor-like protein at the cell surface that in turn signals to an intracellular set of proteins to effect a change in gene expression that ultimately allows the cell to adapt appropriately.  The chemical "signal" that proteins communicate with each other is often phosphorylation, the addition or removal of a phosphate group.  The goal of this NSF-funded project was to achieve a detailed understanding of the structural, biochemical and functional implications of how a signaling protein Ypd1 from a model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker?s yeast), interacted with three of its signaling partner proteins (phosphoreceiver domains associated with Sln1, Ssk1 and Skn7).  Intellectual merit:  One of the major outcomes of this project is the three-dimensional structure determination, (using X-ray crystallography) of a signaling complex between Ypd1 and its downstream signaling partner Ssk1.  The structure revealed atomic level details about how macromolecules recognize and bind to one another.  In addition, computational modeling provided unique information regarding the influence of phosphorylation on complex formation and the phosphoryl transfer reaction.   We also engineered variants (mutants) of these signaling proteins and characterized their activities with respect to protein binding and phosphotransfer.  These studies were important for identifying and assigning functional roles to key amino acid residues in these signaling partners.   In addition, we studied a similar Ypd1 protein from a fungal human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans and discovered interesting differences in structure and function of this protein in comparison to the one in Baker?s yeast.   The results from this project have helped to elucidate the manner in which protein molecules bind to each other in order to maintain signaling fidelity.  The far-reaching implications of this study lie in possible structure-based drug development for improved treatment of human fungal infections.     Broader impacts:  The project provided ample opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student training in a STEM discipline.  A postdoc mentoring plan was carried out and career development for that individual was emphasized.  The PI was also involved in mentoring of junior faculty and core facility enhancements that will benefit the broader scientific community in the region.  The PI helped develop and implement a new structural biology graduate program in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of Oklahoma.
