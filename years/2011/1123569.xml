<AbstractNarration>The PIs are aiming to investigate how virtual world 3D technology can be used to address the limited opportunities adult immigrants and refugees have for exploring and practicing their English in authentic settings without the risk of seeming inarticulate. In partnership with WonderBuilders, Inc., Springfield Technical Community College is creating the 3D virtual environment to integrated into ELS (English as a Second Language) classes at the College. Using Open Wonderland, the PIs are creating a complete virtual campus in which students learning English can interact in virtual campus settings without being embarassed about their language capabilities. College students and personnel are also participating in the on-line community along with the English-language learners. Research is investigating development of confidence and improved competencies and experiences of engagement when the opportunity is given to practice and apply newly-learned grammar and vocabulary in real-world contexts. In addition to hypotheses about language learning, the PIs hypothesize that if engagement is in the context of campus activities, these students, who often hold full-time jobs and have families to take care of, will have more opportunities to engage in the life of the college community, therefore feeling and being more connected, and therefore being more apt to continue with their language learning and then to successfully matriculate and graduate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses two educational challenges. First, helping adult immigrants and refugees learn English, prepare for, and matriculate in higher education is a national challenge. This project is creating a model for such learning and advancement. Second, there is much hype about the use of games and 3D virtual environments for promoting learning but not much research on the real possibilities of doing this and how to use such software effectively for education. This project is contributing to understanding of how to use 3D virtual technology effectively to promote learning.</AbstractNarration>

The metric for success was initially defined by student learning gains. The project's greater impact revealed probative data on requisite faculty strengths and departmental structure that are critical to integrating technology.  FACULTY SKILLS:  Perseverance  Resourcefulness  High Tolerance for Failure  Improvisation  Flexibility  Resilience  DEPARTMENTAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:  Teaching Innovation Must be Encouraged and Regarded as a Vital SKill  Effort Celebrated, not just Results  Innovation Inculcated as Cultural Ethos for Department and Institution     The incorporation of new technology allows faculty to highlight previously unexpressed strengths. Skills in 3D modeling, artistic design and new curriculum design were previously unexpressed talents the project fostered resulting in revitalized professional commitment and engagement.  Understanding faculty receptivity and roots of resistance to new technology (lack of background knowledge, confidence, control, confusion, threatened status) is critical. Provide evidence of student success to persuade adoption. Devise strategic supports and continually discuss frustrations as a regular faculty discipline.  Integrating new technology can disrupt curricular focus and undermine confidence.  Educational leaders need to understand faculty comfort from deeply resistant to bold visionaries. Supported integration that maintains teacher professionalism is key. A culture of applauding attempts to pioneer new technology should be fostered. A mindset of scaffolded mistakes as learning opportunities is necessary.  The extent the department holds a shared commitment to technology as a valued tool for imparting curriculum is significant.

Realistically assessing faculty capacity to engage in risk taking in the classroom is critical. There is an inherent risk of technology failure that should be explicitly discussed.

Other departments have acknowledged the learning potential of the medium. The Health and Patient Simulation Dean created a virtual patient examining room to practice patient interview skills. Academic Support Services expressed interest to better connect with students.   C. Curriculum  The process of collaborative curriculum creation developed by the grant is  finding new utility. Skills honed observing student learning styles, fostered discussion about areas of curricular improvement and skills developed researching educational trends and local employment needs have all contributed to the restructuring process.
