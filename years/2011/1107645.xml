<AbstractNarration>Predicting future conditions of the Arctic Ocean system requires scientific knowledge of its present status as well as a process-based understanding of the mechanisms of change. This research effort will synthesize a number of recent, upcoming, and historical datasets to create three regional carbon budgets for the Chukchi/western Beaufort Sea, the Bering Sea, and the northern Gulf of Alaska. As waters from the North Pacific make their way through these regions a number of transformations occur that modify them before they enter the central Arctic Ocean. In general, the waters exiting these shelf seas are fresher, colder, and have lower pH due to the uptake of CO2 and the remineralization of organic matter. Because of the importance that biogeochemical transformations have in preconditioning the waters of the central Arctic and ultimately parts of the North Atlantic it is important to gain a better understanding of how these processes impact the carbon biogeochemistry of the region. The investigators propose to address this issue by better constraining the carbon budgets for three zones in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean including coastal fluxes, rates of primary production and air-sea exchange of CO2 as well as developing algorithms with predictive capabilities for carbonate mineral saturation states. The aim of this effort is to determine how physical forcing and biological responses control the marine carbon cycle including the rates of air-sea CO2 exchange and net community production as well as ocean acidification effects in the contrasting shelf environments, and to better constrain the present stocks and fluxes of carbon and determine how climate change will affect the regional carbon cycle. The project will support four early career investigators, a postdoctoral scientist, and a Ph.D. student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Climate is warming rapidly in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions surrounding Alaska.  Much of this warming has occurred because of the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, some of which can subsequently be taken up by the oceans.  This so-called ocean carbon cycle can further be impacted by sea ice, sea surface temperatures, and primary productivity in the ocean water column.  The research supported here specifically investigated recent variability in sea ice, chlorophyll concentrations (as a proxy for primary productivity), and sea surface temperatures in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas surrounding Alaska to further understand the ocean carbon cycle in this region.  Using the satellite record over the past several decades, we found that patterns in sea ice cover have been variable, with significant declines in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, yet more complex multi-year variability in the Bering Sea south of St. Lawrence Island.  These patterns in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas have intensified since 2000, indicating a regime shift in sea ice cover across this area of the Pacific Arctic Region.  Observed increases in sea ice cover since 2000 in the southern Bering Sea shelf region are observed in wintertime, whereas sea ice losses in the Canada Basin and Beaufort Sea have occurred during summer.  We further compared sea ice variability across the region with wind and air temperatures to find that shifts in sea ice in the Beaufort Sea are primarily wind driven, those offshore in the Canada Basin are related to air temperatures, and those in the Bering Sea are influenced by elements of both.  Sea ice variability across this region provides critical insight into the impacts of recent shifts in climate and its profound impacts on carbon cycling and ecosystems.  This project additionally supported undergraduate and graduate students, enabling research experiences that contributed towards their thesis and dissertation research.
