<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided for a numerical modeling study of ocean circulation and ocean-ice interaction in Nares Strait, a 500-km long channel that separates northwest Greenland from Ellesmere Island at the northern end of Baffin Bay. The research addresses both Arctic/sub-Arctic sea-ice and freshwater exchange through Nares Strait. The project is motivated by the observation that Nares Strait is a major conduit of freshwater and sea-ice exchange between the Arctic and sub-Arctic oceans. The PIs will combine a high-resolution regional numerical ocean circulation and sea-ice model, forced by output from a high-resolution regional atmospheric model, to study the ocean and sea-ice dynamics and circulation in Nares Strait. A key element of this study is the availability of a high-quality, multi-year observational data set for model evaluation and for inverse modeling that will allow development of an optimized circulation estimate for the entire strait. With this model they will test the sensitivity of Nares Strait throughflow (freshwater, sea ice, and Atlantic Intermediate Water) to projected changes in larger-scale climate factors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Fram Strait, the opening between Greenland and Svalbard, is often assumed to provide the dominant exchange pathway between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, the narrower passages through the Canadian Archipelago provide a second pathway for flow from the Arctic to the Atlantic Ocean.  This study will provide insight on the processes controlling the magnitude of these exchanges, which are believed to influence the formation of dense water in the Labrador Sea that then enters the Atlantic Ocean, contributes to the large scale circulation, and modulates climate.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research was conducted with the objective of improving scientific understanding of the ocean circulation in Nares Strait, the narrow passage between northwest Greenland and Ellesmere Island, and its coupling to sea-ice, wind, and other factors, as well as its potential influence on the floating ice shelf of Petermann Glacier, which experienced dramatic and widely publicized calving events in 2010 and 2012. The Arctic region appears to be especially sensitive to climate change, with observations showing systematic decline in Arctic sea-cover over the past three decades, and warming signals much larger than the global mean. Nares Strait is both an important conduit of freshwater from the Arctic to lower latitudes, and a mediator of the ocean's influence on Petermann Glacier and other west Greenland glacial discharge. Freshwater transport from the Arctic is an especially important component of the Arctic climate system, because the shallow freshwater layer is necessary to insulate Arctic sea-ice cover, which in turn has an important effect on the regional and global radiation balance through its ability to reflect solar radiation much more efficiently than open water.
