<AbstractNarration>Over the past three decades, the geometry of Calabi-Yau varieties has been a central topic in mathematics and physics. The workshop ``Arithmetic and Geometry of Calabi-Yau varieties'' to be held at the Fields Institute (Aug 16-25, 2011)  aims to survey the recent developments of the subject with a focus on the interplay of techniques coming from arithmetic and algebraic geometry in the study of Calabi-Yau varieties  (esp. Calabi-Yau threefolds and K3 surfaces).  Moreover, as a long-term impact, the workshop will explore new directions in the field of Calabi-Yau varieties and related areas (such as hyperkahler varieties).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ten day workshop will be both research and training oriented. Specifically, the first three days will be devoted to introductory lectures for graduate students and postdocs. The second part of the workshop will consist of research talks given by experts in the field.  Additionally, the workshop will encourage research activities in small working groups, as well as the mentoring of the graduate students and postdocs by the senior participants.  The NSF funding will be used to facilitate the participation of US based mathematicians and physicists to this workshop.  Most of the funds will be used for the support of junior participants.</AbstractNarration>
