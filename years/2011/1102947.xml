<AbstractNarration>The researchers aim to construct a high resolution sea level curve for the western Mediterranean Basin as part of an effort to better understand global sea level variations. The island of Mallorca contains coastal caves that capture present and past sea level through the deposition of unique carbonate encrustations that form precisely at the sea level position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coastal caves of Mallorca were chosen for this study because of their demonstrated ability to obtain a high resolution sea-level history and the importance of the locality for addressing the issue of eustatic sea level change due to its unique tectonic and isostatic setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study will be of broad interest to a wide range of scientists interested in sea level variability and the vulnerability of ice sheets under a range of boundary conditions. The project will also foster strong collaborations among American and Spanish scientists and will support graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In collaboration with PI Bogdan Onac (USF) and others, we have generated a remarkable data set that bears directly on the issue of sea level stability during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e, which represents an important paleoclimatic benchmark.  Some of this data was presented at the 2014 American Geophysical Union fall meeting, and a manuscript entitled Last Interglacial Sea-Level Record from Mallorca, Spain is in the process of review.  Our results are consistent with the original goal of the project, which was to reconstruct past changes in sea level in the western Mediterranean region using phreatic overgrowths on speleothems. The technique holds a number of advantages over more traditional techniques of sea level construction and is potentially very precise.  Our results show incredibly stable sea level for approximately 11,000 years in the western Mediterranean during MIS 5e, as measured sea-level values (uncorrected for glacial isostatic adjustment) all fall within a range of 2.25 &plusmn; 0.75 meters above present sea level (mapsl) for the period starting by 127,400 &plusmn; 500 and abruptly ending no earlier than 116,300 &plusmn; 1,300 years before present.  We also found a MIS 9 high stand datum of 1.1 mapsl at 328,700 &plusmn; 2,000 years before present that support Mallorca's long-term tectonic stability and deep paleoclimatic record.
