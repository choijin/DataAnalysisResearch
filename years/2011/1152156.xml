<AbstractNarration>This research on adaptation to rapid climate change in Peru will be a case study of how polar processes affect regions far from the poles but are strongly influenced by polar events. The research team will use their established research collaborations with interdisciplinary organizations such as the Global Human Ecodynamics Alliance (GHEA) and the Climate Change Institute to link these tropical changes to the Antarctic and Arctic. The project goal is to understand the impact of climate change on human social systems by addressing long-standing questions on human-environmental interactions over long periods of time. This will be done by combining cutting-edge technology in the form of multi-spectral, photographic and other forms of imagery on a GIS platform that will allow for modeling of how the environment changed through time. This laboratory-based research will be linked in a feed-back loop with on-the-ground investigation of evidence of such changes. Changes include both short, punctuated, and long-term events and cycles of change, as well as unique events. The project will marry culture-historical and particularist research on ancient, historic, and contemporary human actions with generalizing, scientific research. The research will investigate how societies in specific times and places were aware of such events and how they may or may not have prepared for them.  In addition, the research will chronicle the degree to which these societies were resilient or not in reaction to these varying environmental and climatic changes. There has not previously been an attempt to document these changes at this scale from earliest times through to the current era.  We believe that only by studying the full range of human habitation and responses to environmental change will we be able to successfully understand how these two forces interacted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is potentially transformative research.  It will be a complete re-synthesis of archival data; fieldwork data; and modeling of polar-tropical human ecodynamic systems.  This project may be the first major reassessment of such a large collection of interdisciplinary legacy materials.  As such, it has the potential to make major theoretical and methodological contributions to a number of diverse scientific disciplines, but more importantly will underscore the need for thinking in new ways about geographic boundaries when assessing human ecodynamic processes.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The <em>Long-Term Human Ecodynamics in Coastal Peru: A Case Study of Polar-Tropical Teleconnections</em> project was developed to contribute to scientific knowledge of climate change, generally and how changes in climate in one part of the globe are linked to changes elsewhere. The research was based on the fact that the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is strongly manifested in the offshore waters and coast of Peru. Normally cold Humboldt Current waters are overridden by warm water, causing dramatic changes in sea life and commonly producing intense rains and catastrophic floods on the normally dry Peruvian desert coast. ENSOs have impacts of warmer/cooler and wetter/drier conditions than the norm in other parts of the world, as well. Thus, better knowledge of the frequencies, intensities, and other aspects ENSOs on the coast of Peru in the past could help U.S. (and other) forecasters to prepare for future events.</p> <p>The desert coast of Peru also has preserved a record of human habitation there for over 10,000 years in one of the few &ldquo;cradles of civilization&rdquo; where complex societies developed independent of outside influences, with vast urban complexes and tall painted temples (Figure 1). Archaeologists who have investigated those ancient societies believe that many of them collapsed partly (or perhaps primarily) due to severe ENSO events that damaged irrigation agricultural infrastructure and undermined rulers&rsquo; authority.</p> <p>Despite the apparent importance of ENSO in the past, however, very few specific cases of the event are known and chronicled for ancient Peru; we mostly only know of historic occurrences from the mid-1500s until today. Identifying prehistoric ENSOs would not only contribute to understanding the rise and fall of ancient civilizations in Peru and possibly elsewhere, but also allow us to see patterns of their frequency that could be extremely valuable in helping to predict future ENSOs. In other words archaeological investigations of the prehistory of ancient Peru could potentially directly contribute to understanding patterning of ENSO events perhaps even leading to being able to forecast them. If such were possible it could make extensive contributions to saving hundreds of millions of dollars in the United States and many other countries, especially in Latin America, the South Pacific, and parts of Southeastern Asia where ENSOs have their strongest effects.</p> <p>Our project was designed to try and advance understanding past ENSOs in the hope of contributing to helping to solve contemporary problems. The challenges we faced were to identify ENSO events in the archaeological record, date those events as accurately as possible, and also to assess the political and social conditions of the times during or immediately after the events (Figure 2). Finding ENSO events in the archaeological record and dating them, alone, would help to start to establish patterns in the past. Assessing political and social conditions immediately after the event would help us learn the kinds of impacts these weather events had on ancient societies.</p> <p>We assembled a team of scientists, professors, and graduate students from six US and two Peruvian universities. We dated sites with ENSO evidence using standard procedures such as radiocarbon assays. We tried a new procedure &ndash; optically stimulated luminescence &ndash; to date sites and flood events but the results were not detailed enough to be useful to us. We also attempted to advance the use of tree-ring dating in Peru but encountered problems with this project.</p> <p>Although we explored many different avenues in our research we did not achieve the level of success that we had hoped for (Figures 3-5). We were able to identify and tentatively date an ENSO that took place between AD 1000 and 1350, one previously suggested by other scholars to have occurred. We also refined methods to identify ENSO events such as the sediments built up behind segments of ancient canals that crossed the mouths of canyons (Figure 6).</p> <p>We believe that we have pushed the science of studying ancient ENSOs &nbsp;in Peru to its farthest limits given current technology and that we must wait for improved dating methods before this kind of research can be advanced further. For while we could identify the presence of ENSO events in the archaeological record, the chief impediment to our work was our inability to obtain dates with narrow ranges for ENSO events. Radiocarbon remains the chief dating method for archaeology but it presently can only provide dates with ranges of a decade or two, in most cases. In order to be able to meaningfully discuss patterns of ENSO events and their correlations with cultural events we must have dates that are sub-decadal. When such methods are available it will be well worth the trouble to renew interest in correlating climate change and culture change in the past for lessons as to how we may cope with similar changes in the present and future.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/26/2016<br>      Modified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;Quilter</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152156/1152156_10131697_1474922833829_Fig_1_Students-Huacas_Moche--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152156/1152156_10131697_1474922833829_Fig_1_Students-Huacas_Moche--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1: Huaca del Sol &amp; Urban Sector, Huacas de Moche."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152156/1152156_10131697_1474922833829_Fig_1_Students-Huacas_Moche--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Huaca del Sol &amp; Urban Sector, Huacas de Moche."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Moche culture, as seen at the Huacas de Moche site, shown here, may have been severely impacted by ENSO events.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jeffrey Quilter</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeffrey&nbsp;Quilter</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1: Huaca del Sol & Urban Sector, Huacas de Moche.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152156/1152156_10131697_1474923409057_Fig_2_Strata_SJM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152156/1152156_10131697_1474923409057_Fig_2_Strata_SJM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2: Strata at San Jose de Moro"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152156/1152156_10131697_1474923409057_Fig_2_Strata_SJM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Strata at San Jose de Moro"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The outstanding preservative qualities of the Peruvian desert make searching for ancient climate events and their relations to culture change feasible as seen in these strata at San Jose de Moro in the Jequetepeque Valley.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jeffrey Quilter</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeffrey&nbsp;Quilter</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2: Strata at San Jose de Moro</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152156/1152156_10131697_1474923553375_Fig_3_Alice_Kelley_Banderas_Sampling--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152156/1152156_10131697_1474923553375_Fig_3_Alice_Kelley_Banderas_Sampling--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dr Alice Kelley, U Maine, sampling a sand dune."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152156/1152156_10131697_1474923553375_Fig_3_Alice_Kelley_Banderas_Sampling--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dr Alice Kelley, U Maine, sampling a sand dune."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sand dunes inundated the site of La Bandera in the Lambayeque Valley as a consequence of ENSO events.
