<AbstractNarration>Post-mating selection has recently become recognized as a potentially powerful and general evolutionary force.  The overall goal of the research is to understand the role of post-mating selection, which occurs when gametes from multiple males co-occur within the female reproductive tract, in the evolution of the striking diversity of male reproductive traits observed in the Animal Kingdom. The results will represent one of the first tests of the importance of this selection for morphological evolution, and should help define a novel route for trait diversification among species. Using Drosophila bipectinata (Diptera: Drosophilidae) as a model, the proposed research tests the fundamental hypothesis of the existence of a genetic correlation between a male-specific trait and fertilization efficiency. A second major goal is to uncover the physiological and genetic mechanisms, and their environmental sensitivity, that contribute to the maintenance of the remarkable evolutionarily potential of such secondary traits in animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will contribute to the resolution of long-standing problems in evolutionary biology: it will advance our understanding of the full scope of selection in evolution, and of the mechanisms contributing to the formation of reproductive barriers between populations and ultimately of new species. The results should inform applied disciplines such as agriculture where an understanding of how new species arise often can help predict and control the emergence of pest organisms. Because the research will examine the effects of ecologically relevant levels of environmental (thermal) stress on fitness functions, the results should also help predict the consequences of climate change. The effort will promote teaching, learning and training by involving undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher, in the research and educational activities. There will be a substantive outreach effort in collaboration with the Cincinnati Nature Center where the PI will train and teach volunteer educators and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ever since Darwin's elucidation of sexual selection theory nearly 150 years ago, scientists have made enormous strides toward understanding the mechanisms and scope of this powerful and pervasive selective force. Sexual selection favors traits that confer an advantage in mate competition, and is responsible for the diversification of a wide variety of traits, including male ornamental traits such elaborate plumage and other remarkable displays.  The present research tested for the role of post-mating sexual selection (PMSS) in the evolution of male ornamental traits. Although scientists for nearly 50 years have been studying and debating the full evolutionary implications of PMSS, essentially all of the empirical research on the topic to date has focused on traits closely tied to reproduction, such as genital morphology, sperm traits, and seminal fluid products. The hypothesis that post-mating sexual selection can drive the evolution of male ornamental traits more broadly has remained virtually untested.  The present research tested this hypothesis focusing on the male sex comb in Drosophila bipectinata (Diptera: Drosophilidae), an ornamental sexual trait that represents an excellent model for studying sexual trait diversification in animals.  At the core of the research was to evaluate the central prediction of this hypothesis, namely, the existence of a genetic association between ornament size and competitive fertilization success, the key mechanism known to drive PMSS.  The accomplishments of the research can be summarize as follows:  1) We successfully applied artificial selection in the laboratory for increasing and degreasing comb size on a population of D. bipectinata recently derived from nature. This bidirectional selection was conducted for 12 generations, and generated three "high lines" and three "low lines", which differed strongly in body-size specific sex comb size, as desired.  2) We contrasted these genetic lines in terms of competitive fertilization success, among other traits expected to be involved in trade-offs. We used male competitive fertilization success in a standard assay of an individual's effectiveness in PMSS. We demonstrated that high lines consistently exhibited higher fertilization success compared to low lines.  3) Using our state-of-the-art laser microsurgical system to experimentally reduce sex comb size, we showed that high line males exhibited enhanced fertilization success despite having their sex combs surgically reduced in size to the level of low line males. This is perhaps the most significant discovery of the research as it unambiguously demonstrates a positive genetic correlation between male ornament size and a male's intrinsic ability to succeed in PMSS -- a key prediction of the hypothesis that PMSS drives ornament evolution.  4) We conducted a battery of tests to identify the proximate bases of the enhanced fertilization success of the high line males. Among many traits examined, including sperm length and viability, we discovered with next-generation genomics techniques, that a known seminal fluid protein may be responsible for the enhanced fertilization success of the high lines.  5) Finally, we verified the assumption that variation in male quality can affect post-mating fitness outcomes. Using a geometric nutritional approach, we demonstrated the role of male diet on body condition and sex comb size, and in the same experiment showed that male condition, in turn, affected a key post-mating fitness component, embryo survival.  The results are significant and exciting because they identify previously unrecognized relationships between male sexual trait expression and critical determinants of male reproductive potential measured in terms of advantages gained in PMSS and other fitness outcomes. The research uncovered novel and general mechanisms contributing to the explosive diversification of ornamental traits of animals, furthering our understanding of how new animal species may come to be.  In addition to evolutionary biology and sexual selection, the research likely will inform a variety of other fields and disciplines, including speciation research, agriculture and fertility medicine.  The research produced 13 publications in peer-reviewed journals, and the PI and members of the PI's laboratory disseminated the results broadly through oral and poster presentations at regional, national and international conferences.
