<AbstractNarration>This project continues the Bio-Grid REU Site offering undergraduate students to participate in the research activities associated with the Bio-Grid initiatives conducted at the University of Connecticut. The initiative will advance the application of modern computing infrastructures and information technology to research and practice in various life-science disciplines. Specific research activities include several collaborative projects led by researchers at UConn. A campus-wide computational and data Grid is configured to support the collaborative projects and is available for use by summer students. Training seminars by the project staff will introduce to students concepts about modern grid computing infrastructure and related information technology, as well as some ongoing life-science research projects currently being grid-enabled. Joint seminars with all UConn REU Sites on research ethics and research diversity are designed for students. Participants will have the opportunity to participate in the International Bio-Grid Workshop, hosted annually by the PI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU work, as part of a collaborative action with REU site 1156859, will recruit a diverse group of undergraduate students to engage in research that will broaden their interest in academic careers and professions and help develop a globally competitive engineering workforce equipped with innovative cyber-aquatic technologies. Through integrated research, education and outreach programs, this REU site will better prepare these undergraduate participants for future careers in academia or industry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Research projects for summer students were designed from ongoing research projects by faculty members. Summer students worked closely with their faculty, graduate students and other mentors.

Ae per survey conducted in May 2017, the following students are currently pursuing a graduate degree: Briere, Emily (Stanford, MS); Deluccia, Luke (UPenn, MSE); Espinoza, Max (RPI, PhD); Knowlton, Stephanie (UConn, PhD);  and Petersen, Andrew (USC, PhD).   Stephanie Knowlton won an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in 2016.  Luke, Andrew and Sominder have had their summer research work successfully published in the following journal articles:  * NT Tran, L DeLuccia, A McDonald and C-H Huang, "Cross-Disciplinary Detection and Analysis of Network Motifs", Bioinformatics and Biology Insights, 2015:9, pp. 49-60.
