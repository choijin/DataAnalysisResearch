<AbstractNarration>Boston's Museum of Science (MOS), with Harvard as its university research partner, is extending, disseminating, and further evaluating their NSF/ISE-funded (DRL-0714706) Living Laboratory model of informal cognitive science education.  In this model, early-childhood researchers over the past three years have both conducted research in the MOS Discovery Center for young children and interacted with visitors during the museum's operating hours about what their research is finding about child development and cognition.  Several methods of interacting with adult visitors were designed and evaluated, including the use of "research toys" as exhibits.  Summative evaluation of the original work indicated positive outcomes on all targeted audiences - adults with young children, museum educators, and researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is now broadening the implementation of the model by establishing three additional museum Hub Sites, each with university partners - Maryland Science Center (with Johns Hopkins), Madison Children's Museum (with University of Wisconsin, Madison), and Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (with Lewis &amp; Clark College). The audiences continue to include researchers (along with graduate and undergraduate students); museum educators; and adults with children visiting the museums.   Deliverables consist of: (1) establishment of and activities at the Hub sites and continued improvement of the MOS site, (2) a virtual Hub portal for the four sites and others around the country, (3) tool-kit resources for both museums and scientists, and (4) professional symposia at all sites.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended outcomes are: (1) improve museum educators' and museum visiting adults' understanding of cognitive/developmental psychology and research and its application to raising their children, (2) improve researchers' ability to communicate with the public and to conduct their research at the museums, and (3) increase interest in, knowledge about, and application of this model throughout the museum community and grow a network of such collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broad implementation of the Museum of Science?s Living Laboratory&reg; (LL) model has transformed the way child development researchers and museum staff approach partnership development, providing a framework for cross-sector collaborative efforts through which museum visitors participate in research studies and learn about emerging science.  The project has: - increased application of the model among informal learning and research institutions, and created a network of organizations working in the model; - increased public exposure to cognitive/developmental psychology and related disciplines, by increasing the presence of these content areas in science centers and children's museums; - increased opportunities for museums to support learning about child development topics among adult visitors, and among staff/volunteers; - increased opportunities for pre- and early-career scientists, particularly undergraduate students, to engage in research activities and science communication training.  Living Laboratory?s Essential Elements were refined through this project, ensuring a flexible collaborative model in which informal education and research professionals share their respective expertise in order to increase public knowledge of child development, psychological sciences, and the process of scientific research. LL studies take place in plain-view of the public - some sites designate space on their exhibit floor, while others offer pop-up spaces (using portable furniture and/or customized mobile cabinetry) that transform exhibit or program space to support recruitment, data collection, and education with the public.  Professional Impacts This project established new LL sites at Maryland Science Center, Oregon Museum of Science &amp; Industry, and Madison Children's Museum. These "hub sites" then joined Museum of Science in assisting other organizations to adopt the model. As of October 2017, LL programs had been implemented at 39 US museums, with additional organizations using the LL Toolkit to create or enhance partnerships between informal education and research institutions. The Toolkit includes ~100 unique resources to support partnership building, collaborative professional learning, and communication with public audiences about children's development, as well as evaluation resources for improving experiences in which caregivers observe children participate in studies and/or discuss research with scientists or educators, and for examining the development of researchers? science communication skills. As the model continues to spread, and newer sites encounter novel opportunities/challenges, additional resources are developed and shared by adopters on www.livinglab.org.  ~800 museum and academic professionals - representing 350 science centers, children?s museums, libraries, colleges, universities and other informal science or research organizations in 48 states and 29 countries - have directly participated in the project. Hundreds of others have accessed the project through sessions or workshops at national, regional and local museum academic professional conferences.  PIs at undergraduate-only academic organizations, and those leading small labs, note increased undergraduate research opportunities as a significant project outcome. Annually, hundreds of undergraduates conduct research and engage with public audiences at LL sites, and summative evaluation indicates that LL participation impacts undergraduates? science communication skills.  The project team is aware of 80 peer-reviewed publications resulting from NSF investment in LL. While LL facilitates the generation of new knowledge, resulting in peer-reviewed publications, researchers secure independent funding to support studies they conduct in the museum setting.  The project?s evaluation contributed to the field's understanding of the development of professional networks, and the spread of professional practices across communities of learners.  Opportunities for participants to receive in-person training from project team members, as well as to network and engage in peer mentoring at LL events, have been integral to the spread of the model.  These interactions generate collaborative infrastructure that can be leveraged to expand local partnerships beyond the initial scope of the model.  For example, the Museum of Science is pursuing opportunities for high school students to conduct research and communicate science through LL, and the Ann Arbor LL collaborative is working to provide undergraduate research opportunities at University of Michigan campuses that have not traditionally focused on research.  Broad implementation of LL has increased opportunities for researchers to design and conduct studies that take advantage of the naturalistic environment of a museum, and the potential for studies that recruit participants across multiple museum sites - expanding the geographic range and other characteristics of participant samples. While the model initially attracted researchers from child development, psychology, and associated fields, the project has also fostered collaborations with museums among researchers who study non-child humans &ndash; with studies of adult and adolescent cognition, memory, neuroscience, circadian patterns, vestibular responses and impulse control. Research in occupational therapy, molecular biology, and physical anthropology have been conducted in museum-based "research spaces" under the LL umbrella.  Public Impacts 64,600+ children have participated in LL studies, while their parents/guardians discussed the research with scientists.  66,100+ additional adults, with non-participant children, have learned about child development through study demonstrations and conversations with researchers.  Many sites also utilize "research toys" (hands-on activities developed from peer-reviewed publications) &ndash; these educator-led activities have engaged 25,600+ additional families with child development content.
