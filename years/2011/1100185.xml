<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;1100185&lt;br/&gt;Jun Fan &amp; Hai Xiao&lt;br/&gt;Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to carry out investigation for a tangible breakthrough in sensing technology for large strain measurement with high resolution for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications, based on the feasibility-proven, novel concept of coaxial cable Bragg grating (CCBG).   The CCBG sensor inherits many advantages from its optical counterpart, such as high resolution, remote operation and multiplexing capability, but has much improved robustness, reliability and survivability for SHM.  &lt;br/&gt;Two innovative approaches, the segmented transmission-line approach and the coupled mode theory for coaxial cable, will be investigated to understand device physics and to guide device design and fabrication.  In addition, both the low-cost, controlled deformation method and the high-precision, laser hole-drilling method will be studied to fabricate high-quality CCBG devices. The strain-induced frequency shifts of multiplexed CCBG sensors will be  processed using the cross-correlation method.  These innovations will be well integrated leading to the development and demonstration of the new, robust CCBG sensor platform for large-strain measurements.&lt;br/&gt;The research will be effectively integrated into education through carefully planned educational and outreach activities, including course enhancement, involvement of undergraduate and graduate students into research, recruitment of women and minority students, and outreach to middle/high school students through hands-on workshops and science projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The direct outcome of the proposed research is the fundamental knowledge on the design, fabrication, implementation and demonstration of the novel CCBG sensor technology for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications.  Through our innovative research planned in this project, the novel concept of CCBG will be fully developed into a breakthrough sensor technology that may provide revolutionary solutions for various sensing applications.  For the first time, the Bragg grating concept that has been well demonstrated in fiber optics will be implemented on a coaxial cable.  The CCBG sensor inherits many advantages from its optical counterpart (fiber Bragg grating) such as high resolution, remote operation and multiplexing capability, but has much improved robustness and survivability for SHM.    It has been demonstrated that the proposed CCBG sensor can be used as a large strain sensor with minimized temperature cross-talk which is highly desired but currently not avaiable in SHM. In addition, a cheap, rapid, and reliable CCBG automated manufacturing system has been developed so that many sensors could be potentially fabricated and used without calibration.  Other outcomes include the development of a CCBG demodulation method,  CCBG assisted microwave coupler, coiled coaxial cable resonator, coaxial cable Fabry-Perot interferometer, and coaxial cable ring resonator, etc. Most of the aforementioned coaxial cable devices are tranformed from their optical counterparts, which have many unique features that optics does not have, such as easy to install and embed, reduced requirements on fabrication tolerance (very high fabrication precision is needed in optics), robust, and distributed sensing capability (phase information are easy to obtained in comparison to optics), etc.  A concept of spatially continuous distributed sensing has been studied and developed which is long desired in SHM. Comprehensive evaluation of the health status of the structure as a whole prefers distributed sensing to provide spatially-uninterrupted information (i.e., no dark zones) along the entire span of the structure. In a sense, it is critial to have sensors that could provide spatially continuous information to monitor and evaluate the structural health. By reconstructing the interferogram in spectral doamin for any two reflectors along a coaxial cable (defining a Fabry-Perot interferometer), a fully distributed sensing concept has been successfully demonstrated. In addition, the gauge length can be flexibly reconfigured by selecting two arbitrary reflectors using a time-gating function to reconstruct their corresponding interferogram.    The proposed research will have broad impacts on the societal safety and human welfare of citizens as it represents a leap in SHM technology to ensure the safe operation of the nationÆs deteriorating infrastructures.  The successful completion of the project will result in a brandnew sensing technology and a revolutionary tool to address a number of insufficiently-studied areas in SHM, such as post seismic and disaster monitoring of critical civil infrastructures and study of the progressive structural failures/collapses under extreme loads to ensure mission-critical services in disaster response and emergency evacuation.  Although in this particular project our efforts are focused on the design and demonstration of the new CCBG concept for large strain measurement in SHM, the fundamental knowledge of CCBG and the modeling/manufacturing/interrogation methodologies developed in this research are transferrable to many other extended applications in SHM such as distributed monitoring of force, bending, fatigue and corrosion.  In addition, the new spatially continuous distributed sensing concept could be modified to measure chemical and biological species, which may have numerous applications beyond SHM, such as pollution monitoring, environmental management and detection of chemical/biological warfare agents.
