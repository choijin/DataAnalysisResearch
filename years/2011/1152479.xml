<AbstractNarration>Inaccuracy in computation has usually been considered with a negative connotation and, therefore,&lt;br/&gt;conventional computing systems have been designed with a strict notion of correctness.&lt;br/&gt;However, inaccuracy or approximation is not always bad since several application domains&lt;br/&gt;are intrinsically tolerant to varying degrees of relaxation in accuracy,&lt;br/&gt;and thus, such a property can be exploited for significant gain in application performance or fault-tolerance.&lt;br/&gt;The motivation of this EAGER project is to investigate the feasibility of utilizing such approximation,&lt;br/&gt;also known as "soft computing", for data-intensive applications for predicting the performance-power-accuracy&lt;br/&gt;trade-offs. The research consists of three intertwined tasks. The first task would examine a variety of&lt;br/&gt;high performance computing (HPC) and MapReduce style data analytic applications, and determine&lt;br/&gt;which classes of applications are suitable for soft computing.&lt;br/&gt;The second component of the research is aimed at developing appropriate techniques for facilitating&lt;br/&gt;soft computing, while the last task focuses on examining the possibility of developing a control theoretic&lt;br/&gt;model for formalizing the various tradeoff analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at demonstrating that it is possible to achieve significant power and performance&lt;br/&gt;gain for a wide variety of data intensive applications through soft computing. &lt;br/&gt;The approach adopted in this research has the potential to influence the programming paradigm for many&lt;br/&gt;classes of scientific and business applications for optimizing the power-performance behavior.&lt;br/&gt;The cross-cutting nature of this research has potential to foster new research directions in several areas,&lt;br/&gt;spanning high performance computing, computer architecture, compilers, and system/application software.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and graduate students involved in this research will get versatile training in several areas.&lt;br/&gt;The software tools developed in this research will be used in teaching&lt;br/&gt;existing and new courses, and will be made publicly available.</AbstractNarration>
