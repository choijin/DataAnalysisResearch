<AbstractNarration>Oceanus (working title) is a multi-platform media project designed to increase ocean literacy and communicate the latest oceanographic research and exploration.  Produced by National Geographic Television, the project will focus on the complex science behind the global ocean systems and the many challenges involved in deep-ocean exploration.   Oceanus is designed to reach a broad public audience across both genders and all demographics.  The project also includes links to formal education, with special outreach efforts to Spanish-speaking students.  The project goals are to increase viewer literacy about 1) the essential principles and fundamental concepts underlying ocean systems and functions, and 2) the impact of the ocean on humanity and our influence on it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables include a 5-part "landmark" television series featuring Dr. Robert Ballard and a host of international scientists, which will premiere on the National Geographic Channel in 2012.  The series will employ a new generation of underwater exploration technology which allows for an unprecedented view of the ocean floor. The project also includes digital and online content, a companion book, coverage in National Geographic magazine and National Geographic Kids magazine, formal and informal materials for teachers and students and an outreach program for underserved youth.  Multimedia Research will conduct formative evaluation in two phases, and Knight Williams Inc. will conduct summative evaluation in three separate studies to assess the project's learning impacts with respect to the television series, web and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanus will showcase technical innovations which advance deep-sea film making.  The project aims to engage a broad audience with compelling stories about a critical area of science and related cutting-edge engineering.  The television series is expected to reach 25 million viewers in the U.S., and the outreach material millions more.  The summative evaluation will add to the body of research on the impact of science educational television on adults, and the impact of outreach to underserved audiences with respect to ocean-related topics.</AbstractNarration>
