<AbstractNarration>Most scientific and engineering disciplines today have enormous opportunities for creation of knowledge from massive quantities of data available to them.  But the lack of appropriate algorithms and analysis tools for processing, organizing, and querying this data deluge makes this task extremely challenging.  A large portion of the data being acquired today has a geometric character, and even non-geometric data are often best analyzed by embedding them in a multi-dimensional feature space and exploiting the geometry of that space.  This data is invariably full of noise, inaccuracies, outliers, is often incomplete and approximate, yet most of the existing geometric algorithms are unable to cope with any data uncertainty in relating their output to their input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to fill this void by investigating uncertainty-aware geometric computing, with an express goal of designing algorithmic techniques and foundations that will help extract ``knowledge'' from large quantities of geometric data in the presence of various non-idealities and uncertainties.  It focuses on a number of fundamental geometric problems, all dealing with uncertain data.  A unified set of models will be developed for modeling uncertainty that can deal with multiple uncertainty types, and attention will be paid to handling noise/outliers in heterogeneous and dynamic data.  Algorithms will be investigated for understanding how input uncertainty carries over to output uncertainty (e.g. by associating a confidence level or likelihood with each output, or computing certain statistics of the output) and how the input uncertainty impacts the quality of the output (e.g. by defining and computing the stability of the output in terms of the input uncertainty).  Since exact solutions are likely to be computationally infeasible, the emphasis will be on simple, efficient approximation techniques (e.g. computing a compact, approximate distribution of geometric/topological structures such as Delaunay triangulations and their subcomplexes of uncertain data).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key ingredient of the award is to address a variety of computational issues that arise in the presence of uncertainty using a few key problems, and to develop a core set of techniques that illuminate algorithmic design under uncertainty not only on these key problems but that can also be transferred to other geometric problems, as needed.  This research touches upon many topics in theoretical computer science and applied mathematics including discrete and computational geometry, discrete and continuous optimization, estimation theory, and machine learning.  This study will strengthen connections of computational geometry with a variety of disciplines, including machine learning, probabilistic databases, statistics, and GIS.  Since so many problems require geometric data analysis, the project has the potential of enhancing the capability of various government, commercial, and civic units to make informed decisions that impact the society at large.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of the project was to develop theoretical foundations and algorithmic techniques for extracting "knowledge" from large quantities of geometric data in the presence of inevitable noise, errors, and uncertainty&mdash;what we called uncertainty-aware geometric computing.  Algorithms were developed for: propagating input uncertainty to output uncertainty (e.g. by associating a confidence level or likelihood with each output, or computing certain statistics of the output), analyzing the quality of the output in the presence of uncertainty (e.g. by defining and computing the stability of the output in terms of the input uncertainty), for analyzing geometric and topological structures in the presence of data uncertainty. Even basic geometric problems turn out to be intractable if input data is uncertain, so the emphasis has been on developing fast, approximation algorithms.  Many graduate and undergraduate students as well as three postdoctoral fellows were partially supported by this project. The PIs organized a workshop dedicated to Geometric Computing on Uncertain Data in 2016, as well as several workshops in which the topics of this project were extensively covered.  The main technical contributions include the following:  Geometric structures: In the presence of uncertainty in data, basic geometric and topological structures such as convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulations, contour trees are not well defined. A stochastic model of uncertainty in data immediately leads to a distribution over these structures, which in turn poses algorithmic problems of computing meaningful statistics of these distributions. For example, what is the most likely convex hull of a set of uncertain points, what is the probability of a point lying inside the convex hull, which edges of contour tree appear with large probability? New models and algorithms were developed to answer such questions.  Query processing: Range-aggregation and nearest-neighbor queries are two of the most basic geometric queries, which are well understood when the input data is precise. However, in the presence of uncertainty no data structures with nontrivial upper bounds on their performance were known. This project developed first such data structures for these queries.  Shape analysis: This project led to new efficient algorithms for matching many kinds of geometric objects: 3D models to 3D models or 3D scans, images to images, and geometric graphs to geometric graphs. Especially important has been the ability to take objects connected by multiple uncertain or noisy maps and clean the maps up using cycle consistency criteria, including a theoretic understanding of how much noise can be tolerated. The work has also extended traditional algorithms for transportation problems in Euclidean spaces to the much more challenging setting of doing so on discretized manifolds (like 2D meshes in 3D) and graphs with many applications to machine learning problems involving uncertain distributions on such geometric data.  Trajectory data analysis:  The project showed how noisy GPS trajectory data can still be used in large collections to construct pathlet dictionaries for trajectory compression and planning, how to exploit the wisdom of the collection to map individual GPS trajectories to an underlying map, and ultimately to how to reconstruct such a map directly from the trajectories.
