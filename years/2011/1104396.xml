<AbstractNarration>The PI continues to study when derived equivalences can be realized by underlying richly structured equivalences. Examples of this arise in the PI's long term project with John Greenlees of constructing algebraic models for rational G-equivariant spectra for compact Lie groups G. The PI and Greenlees plan to extend their model for connected groups in the free case to non-connected groups.   The PI and Greenlees also plan to extend their model for tori to provide an algebraic model for rational G-equivariant commutative and associative ring spectra.  As a step towards the general case, the specific case of SO(3) is also being considered. The PI  and Kathryn Hess propose to develop model categories for coalgebras over various comonads in various settings. The main motivation here is to provide a homotopical setting for studying Hopf-Galois extensions of ring spectra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research projects involve the interplay between the study of algebraic structures and topology, the study of shapes or spaces. Algebraic topologists use algebraic structures to describe and simplify topological phenomena.  Spectra, which represent cohomology theories, are algebraic structures built out of topological spaces and hence are useful for translating from one field to the other. In one project, the PI and Greenlees develop algebraic models for certain types of spectra which allow complete calculations.   The PI also continues to train graduate students and disseminate research results.  In addition, the PI is involved with several organizations which promote the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[My research is in the field of algebraic topology.  Although my focus is on topics that are internal to the field, applications of algebraic topology to other fields are growing, especially through the use of topological data analysis. Equivariant stable homotopy theory has become a very active topic in algebraic topology since the announcement of the solution to the Kervaire invariant problem by Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel.   During this project, I have completed five papers with John Greenlees that are likely to contribute to the further development of this field.  In particular our papers on the Cellularization Principle and on Fixed Points are likely to have many other applications. Homotopical models of algebras are well-understood, so I have been working on studying the dual construction of coalgebras. In my on-going projects on coalgebras with Kathryn Hess and coauthors, we are further developing connections with the algebraic K-theory of retractive spaces first considered by Waldhausen.  In addition to my mathematical research, my work contributes to the professional development of many junior mathematicians.  I currently have three PhD students working with me and I mentor many graduate students, post-docs, and other junior faculty in less formal ways. Broadening the participation of women in mathematics has been a long-term project of mine.  I believe that the August, 2013 BIRS (Banff) Women in Topology conference (and its repeat in April, 2016) and associated research groups, will have a very strong positive impact on keeping more women active in research. Two papers have appeared based on the work by my research group begun at the August, 2013 meeting. Three other conferences IÃ†ve helped to co-organize recently will also help to support and foster networks for women: the April, 2013 Midwest Women in Math Symposium held at UIC; the January, 2014 MSRI Connections for Women in Algebraic Topology; and the January, 2015 AWM Workshop in Homotopy Theory.
