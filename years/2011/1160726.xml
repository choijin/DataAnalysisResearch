<AbstractNarration>The proposed project studies combinatorial problems arising from representation theory and algebraic geometry.  A particular focus is on problems arising from the study of loop groups, or affine Lie algebras.  The PI with collaborators will study the Schubert calculus of flag varieties of affine Lie groups, and the relations to quantum cohomology. This includes understanding the geometry of Schubert varieties and the combinatorics of the polynomials representing Schubert varieties in (co)homology.  Together with collaborators, the PI also plans to develop a theory of total positivity for loop groups, aiming to extend work of Lusztig for finite-dimensional reductive groups.  Connections with the theory of electrical networks, and to graphs embedded in surfaces will be investigated.  Another direction of research is the study of infinite reduced words in infinite Coxeter groups.  The PI will study partial orders on infinite reduced words, and explore probabilistic aspects of random infinite reduced words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures.  Such structures come up in varied contexts throughout science.  One such structure that arises in the proposed work is an electrical network consisting of resistors.  A basic problem is to understand the relationship between the electrical properties of the network and the connectivity properties of the network.  These problems have applications to electrical impedance tomography, a technique in medical imaging.  Another type of discrete structure studied in the proposed work are structures with a large number of symmetries, including for example tilings of high-dimensional space in a regular pattern.  A basic problem with these structures is to classify them and analyze the large scale behavior.  Such structures are important for example in coding theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involves combinatorial research arising at the interface of algebra, geometry, and physics.  Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures, including but not limited to counting the number of elements in such a structure.  The discrete structures in this project arise from many different places: sometimes they come from symmetries of algebraic objects, sometimes from the study of geometric objects such as "Grassmannians", sometimes from dynamical systems where either time or space is discrete, sometimes from studying the properties of electricity as axiomatized by Kirchhoff and Ohm, and sometimes from trying to understand probabilities arising from particle accelerator experiments.  Some of the discrete objects studied in this project include affine Coxeter groups (an infinite but discrete symmetry group), graphs modeling electrical networks consisting of resistors, arrangements of edges in a planar graph called "dimers", certain planar graphs called "webs", polytopes in higher-dimensional space or in Grassmannians (generalizing cubes and tetrahedra), networks embedded into tori and other two-dimensional surfaces, and certain integer fillings called "tableaux".    The main intellectual aim and outcome of this project are precise relationships between the combinatorics of these structures and questions naturally arising in algebra, geometry, or physics.  A significant broader impact of this project is the involvement and training of five undergraduate and three graduate students in various aspects of this project.
