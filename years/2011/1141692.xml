<AbstractNarration>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH:&lt;br/&gt;ARE BURIED PALEOCHANNELS EFFECTIVE REACTORS FOR WATER AND &lt;br/&gt;SOLUTE TRANSPORT IN THE DELTAIC SUBTERRANEAN ESTUARY?&lt;br/&gt;Alexander Kolker, Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium&lt;br/&gt;Karen Johannesson, Tulane University&lt;br/&gt;Jaye Cable, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rivers deltas are one of the largest stores of minerals and organic-rich sediments on earth.  Their low relief and close proximity to the ocean also make them one of the best systems to study how coastal ecosystems will respond to climate change and sea-level rise in the coming decades.  A wealth of previous studies focused on the role deltas play in cycling carbon, nutrients, metals and other elements.  However, very little of this research has investigated the subsurface connections between the main river and adjacent bays and wetlands.  Hydrological models of coastal bays associated with river deltas suggest more freshwater is entering these systems than expected.  This study will investigate whether this missing component is groundwater discharge through buried ancient channels in these deltas.  Modern deltas consist of bays and bayous, sedimentary deposits, and marshes formed and abandoned as the river changed course throughout the Holocene.  Over time, sandy-bottom bayous are buried and may leave only a trace of their former existence at the surface.  These buried channels commonly retain a hydraulic connection to the main river, thus acting as a conduit for discharge to adjacent bays during the annual spring/summer high river stage.  Within the Mississippi River Delta (MRD) system, this hydraulic connection may be enhanced by 20 to 40 ft as a consequence of flood control levees which may produce a river stage (i.e. head) as much as 15 to 22 ft above the adjacent bay water levels.  The central hypothesis of this research is that buried ancient channels in deltas act as a vast network of subterranean estuaries, which play a critical role in the transport of groundwater, nutrients, and some metals to deltaic bays and ultimately the ocean.  The research addresses several major questions:  Is deltaic submarine groundwater discharge sufficient to satisfy current deltaic hydrologic and biogeochemical budgets?  How effective are paleochannel networks in the delivery of water and elemental mass fluxes to the coastal ocean?  These questions will be addressed using geophysical surveys that can produce images of the structure of the delta sediments and their salinity, as determined through sonars and electrical conductivity.  These studies will be conducted in concert with studies of geochemical tracers (e.g. salt, radioactive and stable isotopes) and detailed a study of hydraulic gradients between the river and a paleochannel system (e.g. piezometers, pressure loggers, flow nets).  Using the assembled understanding of hydrogeologic flow patterns and rates, we will estimate the biogeochemical mass fluxes associated with seasonal groundwater flow through this paleochannel/subterranean estuary network (e.g. N, C, P, Si, Fe).  Results should improve the understanding of the role that the delta?s geology plays in its hydrology and chemistry and how fluxes of water, nutrients and metals vary over space and time.  This work will then add to the understanding of how deltas and other coastal ecosystems function, particularly in light of sea-level rise predictions for the next 50 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rivers have long been recognized a playing an important role global chemical cycles. Despite this recognition, relatively little is know about how these chemical cycles function below the sea floor, and the implications this has for the chemistry of the coastal zone.  The proposed study will examine these processes in the Mississippi River Delta.  This delta sits at the mouth of the largest river in North America, and is the entry point to one of the most important economic pathways in the United States.  The Mississippi River Delta also has a long history of scientific research, government water quality monitoring, and stakeholder involvement.  This provides the team with excellent baseline information and opportunities to link findings to the needs of society.  The work will contribute to the education of three graduate students and several undergraduate students.  These students will study at leading research universities and have the opportunity to work at a marine laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Civilizations have coalesced around river deltas for thousands of years to take advantage of the vast store of minerals and organic-rich sediments, some of the largest stores on earth, which provide fertile landscapes for food production. River deltasÆ low relief and close proximity to the ocean also make them readily accessible and excellent ports for shipping materials and goods.  Deltas are well known for their groundwater aquifers, which may serve as important sources of water for irrigation of agricultural fields, yet until recently it was not evident how deltaic aquifers are connected to other water bodies, e.g. rivers, lakes, ocean, or where groundwater may discharge over time.  For these reasons, river deltas are indicator areas for the study of how coastal ecosystems will respond to climate change and sea-level rise in the coming decades.  These reasons also make the study of groundwater flow in deltaic systems of particular interest to society as it understands the effects of a changing world on our water resources.  We completed research for the project entitled "Are Buried Paleochannels Effective Reactors for Water and Solute Transport in a Deltaic Subterranean Estuary?" supported by NSF Hydrological Sciences Program.  During our funding period, over 25 field trips were made to the deltaic wetlands and water bodies of the Mississippi River to capture spatial and seasonal variations in groundwater discharge and associated biogeochemical fluxes.  Two masterÆs theses and one Ph.D. dissertation were successfully written and defended during the four year funding period (4th year was a no-cost extension year).  The masterÆs students are seeking employment and one is also applying to graduate schools for a Ph.D. as well.  The Ph.D. student began a post-doctoral fellowship at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico on 1 June 2016.  We have published two peer-reviewed journal article (Journal of Hydrology and Chemical Geology) so far, another is in review at Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, and a third paper is almost ready for submission to Marine Chemistry.  At least three other papers will be published from the masterÆs and dissertation research.  We have also presented our research from this project in least seven different presentations at three different meetings over the project period.  Numerous invited talks regarding this research were also presented to colleagues around the country through departmental seminar series.  We observed groundwater connections between the main branch of the Mississippi river and adjacent bays and wetlands occurring along several pathways.  One pathway occurs as the main river continually leaks river water into the nearby aquifer during high river discharge periods, while during lower periods of river flow the aquifer was either static or it leaked groundwater back into the river to maintain a quasi state of equilibrium between the river and the aquifer.  Another critical pathway for leaking groundwater into the delta is through old buried channels left behind when the delta was still forming.  These buried river beds were formerly the main river flow and when this main river changed directions, the old river channel remained and became a subsurface connection to the new channel.  Both of these pathways were observed in our project to be critical to groundwater discharge in the Mississippi River Delta.  These old river beds are visible on historical maps and showed a clear connection to the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge in Barataria Basin.  In a basin-wide study of groundwater discharge in Barataria Basin, we found that groundwater discharge was highest along the region of the delta where bottomland swamps were present, and also along old river beds and buried distributary channels.  Additionally, in a region where buried paleochannels (river beds) were not visible on historical maps, we also found significant groundwater input to bottomland hardwood swamps.
