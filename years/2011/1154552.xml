<AbstractNarration>West Los Angeles College's "Riding the Road Map to Transfer" (RRMT) program is providing approximately 78 S-STEM scholarships over five years to students in biology, chemistry, geology/earth sciences, and physics/astronomy. The goal of RRMT is to use high impact activities to engage, graduate, and transfer highly motivated, predominately African American and Latino STEM students. RRMT student scholars are (1) receiving financial aid, transfer and career counseling, faculty mentoring, and presentations by invited scientists; (2) participating in internships; (3) developing e-portfolios; and (4) building their knowledge of research techniques, methodologies, and the application of science through undergraduate research projects and targeted field experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RRMT's intellectual merit includes: (a) drawing students from and exploring the relationships between the four basic broad disciplines while reinforcing fundamental scientific principles and (b) engaging with a diverse faculty from different disciplines through laboratory exercises, outside-of-class experimental and research investigations, mentoring, exposure to scientific meetings, and interactions with science in the workplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of RRMT is the direct enhancement of the diversity of the STEM student body at regional universities and the larger STEM workforce in Los Angeles. RRMT leverages the college's TRIO SSS, EOC, and UB programs to recruit and support talented, motivated, and financially needy minority students into STEM fields. Project findings are being used to expand the college's understanding of how to support low-income underrepresented STEM students and are made available to the larger STEM academic community through the project website and presentations at regional and national meetings.</AbstractNarration>

One of my students, who is now in the nanotech class expressed his appreciation that a community college can offer such a class and stated "being able to see electron microscopes and using them remotely has been really awesome and motivating".

Speakers have been researchers at major institutions (UCLA, USC, CalTech, CSULA) and practitioners in industry (Southern California Edison, Los Angeles County Agricultural Commission).  An indicator of the success of the program is that the Friday STEM Symposia have been well attended, with extra chairs needed, by students who are not part of the STEM cohort of students.  Student-scholars have obtained summer internships at JPL and CalTech.  At least nine participants have transferred from West to UC in a STEM major.  This is a significant achievement and is another indicator of the success of the program.  RRMT Outcomes &amp; Evaluation  Through spring 2017, 79 students have been enrolled in RRMT.  After the slow beginning startup phase, and student interest increased, the program has attracted more students who now come asking about the program.   Information about RRMT is available (1) on the Science Division?s web page and (2) the program is promoted through separate targeted announcements on the college?s home page during registration periods, (3) in each semester?s schedule of course offerings, and (4) through announcements of project activities in the college?s weekly all-campus newsletter and through email blasts to faculty, staff, administrators, and students in the Science Division.   Applicants submitted an application including an essay and letters of recommendation and were reviewed by the program faculty.  The project eventually have progressed beyond its slow enrollment start and became fully (20) enrolled; the last years of the project we had enrolled 24 students/year!
