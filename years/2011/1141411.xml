<AbstractNarration>Baker/1141411 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to undertake a systematic examination of the effects of soluble impurities, particularly sulfuric acid, on the creep of polycrystalline ice as function of temperature, strain rate and impurity concentration. The working hypothesis is that soluble impurities will increase the flow rate of polycrystalline ice compared to high-purity ice, that this effect will be temperature dependent and that the impurities by affecting the re-crystallization and grain growth will change the fabric of the ice. Both H2SO4-doped and high-purity poly-crystalline ice will be produced by freezing sheets of ice, breaking them up, sieving the ice particles and then sintering them in a mold into fine-grained cylindrical specimens with at least ten grains across their diameter. The resulting microstructures (dislocation structure, grain size and shape, grain boundary character and micro-structural location of the acid) will be characterized using a variety of techniques including: optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, including secondary electron imaging, electron backscattered patterns, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron channeling contrast imaging, and X-ray topography. The creep of both the H2SO4-doped and the high-purity polycrystalline ice will be undertaken at a range of temperatures and stresses. The ice?s response to the creep deformation (grain boundary sliding, dislocation motion, re-crystallization, grain boundary migration, impurity redistribution) will be studied using a combination of methods. The creep behavior will be modeled and related to the microstructure. Of particular interest is how impurities affect the activation energy for creep. The intellectual merit of the work is that it will lead to a better understanding of glacier ice and will enable glaciologists to model the influence of impurities on the flow and fabric development in polycrystalline ice. The broader impacts of the project include the knowledge that will be gained of the effects of impurities on the flow of ice which will allow paleoclimatologists to better interpret ice core data and will allow scientists developing predictive models to better address the flow of ice sheets under various climate change scenarios. The project will also lead to the education and training of a Ph.D. student, several undergraduates and some high school students. Results from the research will be published in refereed journals. Several undergraduates, typically two per year, will also perform the work. Dartmouth aggressively courts minority students at all degree levels, and we will seek women or minority group undergraduates for this project. The undergraduates will be supported by Dartmouth?s nationally-honored Women In Science Project or by REU funding. The undergraduates? research will integrate closely with the Ph.D. student?s studies. Hanover High School students will also be involved in the project and develop an educational kit to introduce students to the properties of ice. Results from the research will be published in refereed journals and presented at conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ice sheets in Antartica and Greenland contain various impurities.  While these impurities are at quite low concentrations they can still affect the deformation behavior of the ice and its microstructural evolution.  The intellectual merit and aim of this project was to undertake a systematic examination of  the effects of soluble impurities, particularly sulfuric acid, on the  creep (time depenedent deformation) of polycrystalline ice as function of both temperature, strain  rate and impurity concentration.  Our working hypothesis was that  soluble impurities will increase the flow rate of polycrystalline ice  compared to high-purity ice, that this effect will be temperature  dependent and that the impurities by affecting the recrystallization and  grain growth will change the fabric of the ice.  To this end, we produced sulfuric acid-doped, calcium sulfate-doped, and high-purity  polycrystalline ice by freezing sheets of ice, breaking them up, sieving  the ice particles and then sintering them in a mold into fine-grained  cylindrical specimens with at least ten grains across their diameter.  The resulting microstructures were characterized using a variety of techniques. The creep testing of both the sulfuric acid-doped and calcium sulfate-doped and the high-purity polycrystalline ice was undertaken at a range  of temperatures and stresses. The ice?s response to the creep  deformation was studied using a combination of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques.  Testing showed that sulfuric acid-doped  polycrystalline ice specimens exhibited faster creep rates than undoped  ice, while the compression tests demonstrated that sulfuric acid-doped  specimens exhibit a significantly lower strength than undoped ice.  It was also shown that  crept sulfuric acid-doped  specimens had a much larger grain size at strains &le;15%, and an earlier  onset of micro-cracking at lower strain rates than the undoped ice.  The  effects of the sulfuric acid were greater at lower termperatures.The results have implications for modeling the flow of ice sheets, which contain impurities such as sulfuric acid at low levels.  In contrast is was shown that calcium sulfate increases the strength of  polycrystalline ice at higher strain rates and lower temperatures, an  effect that decreases with decreasing strain rate and higher  temperatures. The observations indicate that suggestions by others that the presence of calcium ions can aid the densification of multi-year snow is unlikely.  In addition, we created an idealized laboratory set up in which we were able to  study how an artificially created ice lens may affect the thermophysical  and microstructural state of the interface between the ice lens and  adjacent layers of snow while under a controlled temperature gradient.  Utilizing in situ micro-thermocouple  measurements, our findings showed that a super-temperature gradient  exists within only a millimeter of the ice lens surface that is many  times greater than the imposed bulk temperature gradient.  Additionally,  we have been able to identify distinct regions of simultaneous ice  crystal growth, sublimation, and kinetic snow metamorphism. The results have implications for the formation of weak layers in snowpacks that can lead to avalanches.  In addition to understanding the effects of impurities on the flow of ice, the broader impacts included the education of a Pd.D. student and five undergraduate students.
