<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Jodie O'Gorman, Jeff Chivis will examine the varying types of interactions and the sharing of sociopolitical and technological ideas that were associated with the introduction of Hopewellian beliefs into west Michigan during the early Middle Woodland period (~50 B.C. - A.D. 250). During this time interval a new prehistoric society emerged in the US Midwest. Characterized by a more complex religions system and form of social organization it is responsible for monumental sites which included mounded "pyramids" and populations numbered in the thousands. While much is understood about development in the core area, how Hopewellian influence spread is much less clear. Some archaeologists believe that it was ideas rather than people which moved outwards from the core while others argue that it was primarily indirect influence which spread. Through study in one outlying region Mr. Chivis will address this question directly. The research is important because it provides insight into how in traditional societies people and ideas can spread and interact in complex fashion and over extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In west Michigan, this Hopewellian transition is evidenced by the implementation of a distinct mortuary program involving the construction of burial mounds, the utilization of grave inclusions, and the application of characteristic design elements on pottery vessels.  Mr. Chivis' research will examine Middle Woodland pottery from west Michigan and northwest Indiana to record the different types of communities and interactions involved in the initial spread of Hopewellian information into west Michigan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ceramics are abundant and well preserved in archaeological contexts and have the potential to provide insight into the behaviors and cultural affiliations of their producers. Mr. Chivis' research employs a comprehensive methodology by uniting stylistic pottery analysis with compositional analysis.  Utilizing ceramic petrography as the primary method of compositional analysis, this research design will explore new ways to discover markers of identity in the archaeological record and will permit one to distinguish between the spread of ideas vs. the actual movement of people. This methodology will provide a significantly more comprehensive identification of identity, communities, and interaction networks than has previously been possible within the study region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research rests on the fact that, as a member of a federally recognized tribe in Michigan, Mr. Chivis will be enhancing the involvement of underrepresented/minority individuals within archaeology.  Mr. Chivis will make the resulting data available to his tribe and the larger anthropological community through potential peer-reviewed publications and presentations at various national conferences.  Dissemination of this information to local tribal entities will provide them with a supplementary perspective of their past and could promote more frequent and worthwhile communication between academia and Native American tribal governments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research has examined the different types of interactions that were associated with the introduction of Hopewellian beliefs into west Michigan during the Middle Woodland period (~150 B.C. &ndash; A.D. 400).  This time period is characterized by widespread circulation of diagnostic artifact styles, exotic raw materials, and shared burial practices throughout the Eastern United States.  In west Michigan, this Hopewellian transition is evidenced by the implementation of a distinct mortuary program involving the construction of burial mounds, the utilization of grave inclusions, and the adopted use of characteristic design elements on pottery vessels.  This project has examined Middle Woodland pottery from west Michigan and northwest Indiana to identify the different types of communities in each region and the types of interactions responsible for the initial spread of Hopewellian information into west Michigan.  The major river valleys of interest included the Muskegon, Grand, Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, and Kankakee valleys.  This research has addressed problems in modern archaeological theory and method.  First, Middle Woodland research has relied almost exclusively on highly visible artifact types and pottery decorations to explain interregional interaction networks. As a result, there is a dire need to more thoroughly examine local contexts, especially within the study region.  This project shifted the frame of analysis to the social, political, and ideological processes operating within each community by initially identifying intraregional communities based upon stylistic, morphological, and compositional pottery analyses.  Once these communities were identified, their involvement in regional and interregional interaction networks was examined.  As a result, this project provided a more comprehensive multiscalar identification of communities that considered the varying roles of individual communities in the adoption of a foreign belief system (i.e., Hopewell).  Secondly, this project employed a comprehensive methodology by uniting stylistic pottery analysis with compositional analysis.  Utilizing ceramic petrography as the primary method of compositional analysis, this research design allowed exploration of new ways to discover markers of identity in the archaeological record and changes in identity that accompany the adoption of a foreign belief system.  This methodology yielded a significantly more comprehensive identification of identity, communities/social boundaries, and interaction networks than has previously been possible within the study region.  The final results indicated that the adoption of Hopewell into west Michigan occurred in different stages.  It was found that the first stage consisted of five communities in the study region who initially adopted this ideology.  Evidence of occasional interactions between all four of these communities was discovered.  The second stage of Hopewell development included the rise of one additional community in west Michigan which budded off from an earlier community, as well as the use of the lower Kankakee valley by two middle-upper Kankakee River valley communities.  The last, or terminal, stage included the likely migration of one final community into the lower Kankakee River valley and the eventual dissolution of all Hopewell communities in the study region.  Overall, the degree of contacts with other communities appears to have been rather extensive and involved the sharing of ideology and technology in both daily life and mortuary activity (i.e., simultaneous burial of their dead in burial mounds).  There are several broader impacts of this research.  First, this projectÆs approach is applicable to understanding the spread of Hopewell into other areas of the Eastern United States and, generally, to understanding the spread of information in other regions and time periods as well.  Second, as a member of a federally recognized tribe in Michigan, Mr. Chivis enhanced the i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
