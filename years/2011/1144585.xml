<AbstractNarration>Explosive volcanic eruptions are some of the most energetic granular flows on the planet, the largest of which can have global impact. Even the more common, smaller, events encompass scales of several kilometers. However, mass and energy transfer in these flows are fundamentally controlled by processes at much smaller spatial and temporal scales, where individual particles interact with each other, with gas, or with the surface over which the flows travel. Our past work on steam explosions, ash production, and heat transfer have shown that subgrid models developed from experiments can be coupled to large-scale numerical simulations. More importantly, these subgrid relations are critical for predicting the dynamics reflected in volcanic deposits and in ash dispersal patterns; models that neglect subgrid processes can fail to produce the energy transfer manifest in volcanic deposits by several orders of magnitude. Our ability to predict large-scale behavior of volcanic flows can ultimately be limited by our understanding of very small-scale, or microphysical, processes. In this study, the investigators will examine a suite of particle-scale mass and energy transfer mechanisms in the laboratory with the aim of understanding the physics of these processes and to incorporate them into large-scale simulations of explosive volcanic eruptions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will support an ongoing effort in predictive computational volcanology. Specifically they team will focus on 1) heat transfer between particles and gas at high Reynolds numbers and using clast cooling proxies to examine entrainment in pyroclastic density currents, 2) particle deposition and resuspension, including the role of particle impacts in generating depositional features, 3) large-scale experiments of gas-particle density driven flows, and 4) and the production of fine ash particles in the conduit and in pyroclastic density currents. All these processes contribute to production and dispersal of ash and larger pyroclasts to the immediate environment of the volcanic edifice and also to the wider dispersal of ash in the atmosphere. Understanding the physics of these processes is crucial in determining the potential aviation, climactic, and local hazards of eruptions.  All of the proposed experiments will be conducted with materials and at conditions similar to those in natural flows, minimizing the potential difficulties with scaling to large-scale multiphase flows. In the methodology proposed, the numerical models are integrally connected to the experimental data. The strength of numerical models is the ability to solve non-linear, complexly coupled equations and determine emergent behavior, and the strength of the experiments is to understand in detail the physical processes operating at small scales.</AbstractNarration>
