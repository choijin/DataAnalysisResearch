<AbstractNarration>The theme of the Northwestern University CEMRI* is Multifunctional Nanoscale Materials Structures.  The main emphasis of the Center is to train visionary and globally competitive U.S. materials researchers to significantly impact the U.S. economy and solve global challenges, to innovate in an atmosphere of cooperation and healthy competition among national and international partners in both public and private sectors, and to integrate efforts in research, education, knowledge/technology transfer and networking.  The Center manages and maintains shared experimental facilities accessed by both Northwestern and external researchers, fosters interactions with National Labs (especially with nearby Argonne National Lab), other universities, industry (including both MRSEC-initiated start-up companies and large corporations) as well as other institutions (including The Art Institute of Chicago), and develops innovative educational programs including the science-themed performances hosted by the MRSEC-sponsored Educational Transdisciplinary Outreach Program in the Arts (ETOPiA).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goals of the center consist of understanding the fundamental principles and behaviors of complex nanomaterials systems, transferring results into the development of new functional devices and systems leading to new technologies and industries, and initiating close cooperation among national and international partners to improve research capabilities and infrastructure.  Researchers are organized into Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs) investigating: "Controlling Fluxes of Charge and Energy at Hybrid Interfaces", "Fundamentals of Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors" and "Plasmonically-Encoded Materials for Amplified Sensing and Information Manipulation", as well as seed programs. The research strategy is to investigate novel phenomena through the interactions of charges, photons, plasmons and excitons in nanostructured materials, including discrete and collective effects in model materials using theory, simulation, modeling and detailed measurements.  An understanding of the underlying science will provide a basis for the design of new and extended classes of functional nanostructures for potential applications in sensing and communication, energy and environmental uses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational goals of the Center are to develop and disseminate instructional materials for pre-college Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) classrooms based on Center research, to offer opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to develop skills in innovation and entrepreneurship, to work with international partners and programs to equip U.S. students with global leadership capabilities and a global research perspective, and to provide national leadership in vertically-integrated STEM learning and teaching from middle-school to graduate school in order to improve quality and reduce the cost of education.  The Center has a long history of developing Materials World Modules for implementation into STEM classrooms and providing summer research training for teachers and undergraduates in Research Experience for Teachers (RET) and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs.  Partnerships with the International Materials Institute at Northwestern and with industrial partners are providing new opportunities to develop international programs and opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship-based research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*a NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)</AbstractNarration>

By addressing fundamental nanoscale materials science and engineering issues, the NU-MRSEC benefited society and the global community by providing a synergistic infrastructure in which to design, synthesize, and characterize transformative new materials and to explore new device concepts.

For example, IRG-1 spearheaded the development of self-assembled nanodielectrics (SANDs) that improve the performance of unconventional thin-film transistors in a nearly universal fashion. Enabled by advances in carbon nanotube (CNT) sorting, IRG-1 also delineated the influence of CNT purity on the optical and electrical properties of CNT thin-films and devices, and integrated sorted CNTs with SANDs to produce record-setting performance in thin-film transistors.

IRG-2 also pioneered a low-temperature, thickness-controlled coating process (i.e., spray-combustion synthesis (SCS)) that enabled high-performance, solution-processed AOS electronics. Specifically, SCS facilitated the fabrication of indium-gallium-zinc oxide transistors with film morphology, electron mobility, trap densities, bias stability, and transport properties approaching that of sputtered films.&nbsp;In addition to thin-film electronics, AOS materials have been applied to complementary technologies including photovoltaics, photonics, thermal management, and rectifiers.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>IRG-3: Plasmonically Encoded Materials for Amplified Sensing and Information Manipulation.&nbsp;</strong>IRG-3 developed an integrated experiment-theory approach that produced key advances in the synthesis and sorting of anisotropic plasmonic nanoparticles, elucidated new mechanisms based on hybrid nanoparticle arrays, and demonstrated tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) and microscopy with single-molecule resolution. In addition to achieving greater control over the solution-based synthesis of anisotropic plasmonic particles, IRG-3 achieved major advances in the fabrication of large-area arrays of nanoparticles that revealed extraordinary nonlinear and strong coupling effects, plasmon-exciton interactions that resulted in nanoscale lasing, and robust hydrogen gas sensing with facile detection at low and high doses. Another significant IRG-3 achievement was the development of TERS combined with single-molecule resolution and picosecond excitation in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). When combined with theoretical modeling, UHV TERS provided insight into intramolecular interactions, identified subtle changes in molecular orientation, and revealed plasmon-mediated electron transport.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:&nbsp;</strong>The NU-MRSEC promoted broader impacts through comprehensive commercialization, shared facilities, education, and outreach programs that are coupled to an extensive network of academic, national laboratory, and industrial partners, both domestically and abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to collaborations and licensed technology to major corporations, the NU-MRSEC transitioned its fundamental materials discoveries to successful commercial outcomes via 7 startup companies with a total of ~300 employees. The NU-MRSEC also administered 18 shared facilities and laboratories on campus that are used not only by NU researchers but are also open to the broader materials community. The proximity of the NU-MRSEC to Argonne National Laboratory further resulted in several substantive interactions, most prominently the Dow-Northwestern-DuPont Collaborative Access Team (DND-CAT) beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. From the perspective of education and outreach, the NU-MRSEC maintained a diversified portfolio of programs that impacted all levels ranging from the general public to K-12 students to undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs. Highlights include: (1) Materials science exhibits and collaborations with the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry, Art Institute of Chicago, and Chicago Children's Museum; (2) Engineering Transdisciplinary Outreach Project in the Arts (ETOPiA), which presented science-themed plays to the general public including matinees for students from the Chicago Public Schools; (3) Materials iLab, which enabled remote access to materials science instrumentation for K-12 students; (4) Research Experience of Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Teachers (RET), which provided summer research opportunities on campus. In all NU-MRSEC programs, diversity was promoted and enhanced through a partnership with the University of Texas at San Antonio that was initiated via the NSF Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program.
