<AbstractNarration>During the FY11-12 academic year, various directorates/offices across the National Science Foundation (NSF) host nineteen (19) K-12 science and mathematics teachers as Fellows of the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship (AEDEF) program.  The AEDEF program is a congressionally-mandated program under the auspices of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE).  NSF participates in AEDEF through a grant to the Triangle Coalition (TC) that manages the program for DOE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the program are to: (1) provide outstanding STEM teachers the opportunity to bring to Congress, and appropriate branches of the Federal government the insights, extensive knowledge, and practical experience of classroom teachers; (2)  increase the understanding, communication, and cooperation between Congress and Federal agencies; (3) increase the understanding, communication and cooperation between the Federal government and the science, technology and mathematics education community; and (4) gain insights and an understanding of national educational issues which can then be transferred back to the classroom.  While at NSF, each Fellow gains general as well as discipline-specific knowledge based on their placement within Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During FY11-12, Fellows engage in a wide range of STEM activities both internal and external to NSF.  These activities offer a wealth of experiences likely to advance the STEM knowledge base of participating teachers.   Representing 11 states (California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and Virginia), Fellows serve their 11-month fellowship under a specific sponsor who oversees the day-to-day activities of the individual Fellow.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other agencies participating in the program include NASA, NOAA, and DOE.</AbstractNarration>

The 2011-2012 AEF cohort was comprised of 30 teachers from 16 states and the District of Columbia. Nineteen of those fellows were placed at NSF. Triangle Coalition, founder of the AEF program, provided program and administrative services to Fellows on behalf of NSF, working in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy.
