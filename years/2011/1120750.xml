<AbstractNarration>Over 10,000 species of grasses are known to science.  Grasses proliferated rapidly, obscuring their historical relationships.  This project integrates three broad approaches in a study of grass diversification using contemporary methods to reconstruct the genealogy of the grasses.  Next generation DNA sequencing methods will be used to determine complete chloroplast genomes and subregions of the nuclear genome from at least 100 species.  Bioinformatics analyses will explore patterns and rates of DNA sequence evolution.  Studies of development, especially in leaves, will be used to test whether particular adaptations are correlated with historical migrations into new habitats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grasses are of fundamental economic and ecological importance.  Rice, wheat, maize and other cereals supply half of human dietary calories.  Wild grasses predominate over 25% of Earth's terrestrial landscape.  A better understanding of their relationships is fundamental to predicting the response of grasslands and cereal crops to environmental change.  Analyses of sequence data will clarify relationships and have broad application in evolutionary studies.  Ecological adaptations will be better understood when viewed in a developmental context.  An image-rich web site will be established, with content in English and Spanish, with information on grass structure, classification, and evolution.  The new framework of grass relationships and accompanying web resources will appeal to a broad range of users and promote international collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grass family (Poaceae), with over 11,000 species, is one of the most diverse groups of flowering plants.  The grasses are also the most important plant family to humankind due to its agricultural and ecological significance.  Grasses cover close to 30% of the Earth?s land surface and are often the major component of the habitats they occupy.  The major grass crops (rice, corn, wheat) directly provide people with more than 50% of their daily caloric intake, or also indirectly provide calories in the form of meat.  Studying the evolutionary history and important structural or physiological traits of grasses allows us to understand their ecological success.  This in turn allows us to better predict and manage the response of grasses, including crops, to climate change.               In this collaborative project, we investigated the vegetative traits of grasses to determine which ones contribute the most to the ecological success of the family.  We constructed an evolutionary tree for the grass family using complete DNA sequences of the chromosome found in the chloroplast, the plant organelle largely responsible for photosynthesis, for 160 species representing the diversity of the grasses.  We then examined changes in leaf shape and 3-dimensional internal leaf and root structure throughout the history of the grass family and correlated these with a set of environmental variables (temperature, light, moisture, seasonality).  The evolutionary tree based on DNA sequences confirmed that the earliest grasses were broad-leaved, herbaceous, perennial plants and that they evolved about 110 million years ago (mya) in the Cretaceous.  Toward the end of the Cretaceous (80-65 mya), grasses split into two main lineages and began to diversify relatively rapidly, producing the main lineages of modern grasses by about 50 million years ago.  Relationships among the major grass lineages as determined by previous work were confirmed, with the significant exception that the panic grasses (Panicoideae) diverged earliest from the remainder of their major lineage after the initial split into the two main lineages.              Leaf shape is strongly correlated with light regime (and therefore habitat) and annual rainfall.  Grasses growing in shaded forest habitats have ovate leaves, whereas those in open habitats, especially where there is limited rainfall, have strongly linear leaves.  However, an intermediate leaf shape is observed in grasses growing in partial shade along forest edges or in open woodlands.  The evolution of linear leaves in grasses was associated with the radiation of grasses into open habitats and the split into two major lineages 80-65 mya, but transitions to open habitats from forests or subsequent reversion to a forest habitat virtually always occurred through partial shade and intermediate leaf shapes.  In modern grasses, only linear leaves are found in habitats with less than 1,000 mm of annual rainfall, and these leaves are also the thickest.  With regard to internal leaf structure, grasses exhibit much smaller cells and the cells are highly lobed relative to related families and indeed all other monocots.  These cells are also elongated parallel to the long axis of the leaf.  Remarkably, most of the C4 grasses converged on a single cell shape, but we do not yet understand the functional implications of this change.  The special leaf anatomy found in the earliest grasses persists only in the few surviving representatives of the earliest grasses plus the bamboos (Bambusoideae).  Analyses of cell shapes and root anatomy are continuing, as this project is closely tied to an on-going one focused on the evolution of drought tolerance in grasses.  These results represent a new perspective on the evolution of the grass family that will affect the interpretation of paleoclimatic data (e.g., phytoliths) and functional traits for ecological or agronomic purposes (e.g., the engineering of C4 rice) as well responses to climate change.  The permanent slide collection developed through this project consists of approximately 4,500 slides representing transverse, longitudinal and paradermal sections of ca. 30 non-grass monocots and ca. 300 grass species. The associated images will also be made available as a resource, although not all taxa have the same sets of images available, and not all images will necessarily show all characters of interest for other potential studies (e.g., phytoliths).  An additional set of permanent slides of leaf clearings for approximately 220 grass species is also part of the slide collection and images of these will also be made available in the near future.  During the project, 1 high school student, 7 undergraduate students, 4 graduate students (2 M.S., 2 Ph.D.) and 1 postdoctoral scholar received training through their participation in the project.  The high school student, four of the undergraduates, and three of the graduate students are female.  To date, seven scientific journal publications, 13 national and international talks, and two posters have resulted from this support.  A grass leaf animation and 3D printing protocols for leaf cells are in development as educational resources.       Last Modified: 09/29/2016       Submitted by: Lynn G Clark]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
