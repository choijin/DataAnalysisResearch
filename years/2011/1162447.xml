<AbstractNarration>Smartphones are increasingly ubiquitous. Many users are forced to carry multiple smartphones for work, personal, and geographic mobility needs. This research is developing Cells, a lightweight virtualization architecture for enabling multiple virtual smartphones to run simultaneously on the same physical device in a securely isolated manner. Cells introduces a new device namespace mechanism and novel device proxies that multiplex phone hardware devices efficiently and securely across multiple virtual phones while providing native hardware device performance to all applications. Virtual phone features include fully accelerated graphics for gaming, complete power management features, easy-to-use security and safety mechanisms that can control the availability of phone features transparently and dynamically, and full telephony functionality with separately assignable telephone numbers and caller ID support. Cells is implemented in Android, the most widely used smartphone platform, to transparently support multiple Android virtual phones on the same phone hardware. While the primary focus of this research is smartphone devices, the development of these ideas is also explored in the context of tablet devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research provide a foundation for future innovations in smartphone computing, enabling new uses and applications and transforming the way the devices can be used. This research promises to improve not just system security, but also user safety; especially for young people. Integrating this research with the CS curriculum provides students with hands-on learning through programming projects on smartphone devices, enabling them to become contributors to the workforce as smartphones become an increasingly dominant computing platform.</AbstractNarration>

Millions of applications for these devices are available for users to download through various online application stores.

Application developers also carry additional phones for development to avoid having a misbehaving application prototype corrupt their primary phone. Parents sometimes wish they had additional phones with safety constraints when their children use the parent?s smartphone for entertainment and end up with unexpected charges due to accidental phone calls or unintended in-app purchases, or worse yet when their older children are distracted by phone usage when they should not be, such as when driving.  We have investigated, developed, implemented, and evaluated a new lightweight virtualization architecture to enable multiple virtual phones/tablets (VPs) to run simultaneously on the same physical smartphone/tablet hardware with high performance and securely isolated from one another. Instead of requiring traditional virtual machines running multiple OS instances, we use lightweight OS virtualization with a novel device namespace mechanism to provide virtual namespaces that can run and securely isolate multiple VPs on a single OS instance.

We further improve the performance of these systems by optimizing resource sharing in a secure manner, including file system and memory management mechanisms to maximize sharing of common code and data across VPs, reducing memory consumption and enabling additional VPs to be instantiated without much overhead.    Both open-source and commercial implementations of this architecture have been made available for Android.  The results of this research provide a foundation for both commercial deployment and future computer systems innovations to provide improved system security and management for mobile computing infrastructure.
