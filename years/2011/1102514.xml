<AbstractNarration>Thin current sheets are a ubiquitous phenomena in a wide variety of plasma environments.  This project will examine processes which drive the dynamic evolution of thin current sheets in the region where the auroras are generated.  The dynamic evolution of auroral arcs is responsible for the rapid kinking, curling and folding of auroral forms that make watching the aurora so compelling. These motions are the consequence of the interaction of plasma instabilities in thin current sheets operating on scale sizes from small-scale kinetics up to the size of the full auroral acceleration region. This project will exploit observations from the Reimei spacecraft which provides the first dedicated imaging of auroral forms with magnetically conjugate high time resolution measurements of the particles which drive them. These observations provide the unprecedented opportunity for quantitative analysis of auroral motions and structuring to be performed while simultaneously providing details of the particle distributions driving the optical emissions. The project will implement a new wavelet-based technique for the analysis of sequences of auroral imagery from the Reimei spacecraft to ascertain the vorticity of plasma flows as a function of scale. The distribution of vorticity with current or energy flux (luminosity) will provide the means to identify which processes dominant in the evolution of the auroral structures. The satellite observations will be aided by the use and further development of a 3-D, reduced MHD numerical simulation that includes electron inertia and ionospheric resistivity. Existing statistical field measurements from the FAST spacecraft will be used to augment the Reimei imager and particle observations to provide a more complete characterization electrodynamics of the auroral forms and for comparison with simulation results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will help improve our understanding of a very well known and commonly observed phenomenon of public interest. It involves a collaboration with the Center for Science Education at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory.  The results from this research will be incorporated into a series of workshops for teachers who are primarily involved in teaching African-American and Latino students. The project also promotes teaching, training and learning by providing support for a postdoctoral scholar and graduate student researcher.</AbstractNarration>

These observations were interpreted through the use of a numerical simulation describing the interaction of electromagnetic fields and particles that drive aurorae  It was discovered that the complex multi-scale structuring and motion of aurora could be described by a simple relationship between the size of the features and the speed with which these features move. This relationship is defined by the nature of the matter (plasma) above aurora and the electromagnetic fields with which this matter is permeated.  It turns out that the interaction between the plasma and the electromagnetic field is wave-like. These electromagnetic waves are known as Alfven waves. It was found that the properties of these waves defined the relationship between the size of an auroral feature and the speed with which it moves.  A property of Alfven waves is their tendency to break-up into smaller scales. This cascade leads to variations in luminosity over a broad range of scale sizes which move with a speed that is dependent on the scale-size. This research demonstrated how the action of processes related to the size and intensity of features drive this cascade toward smaller scales.  These processes included the release of magnetic field energy density for particle acceleration via a process known as magnetic reconnection as well as ?wind-over-water? like unstable interactions due to very large shears in the flow of plasmas above aurora.  The reduction of the complex structuring and motion in auroral forms to that of a single wave mode defined by the properties of the matter above aurora is an appealing result with appreciable intellectual merit. The action of Alfven wave cascades, magnetic reconnection and plasma instabilities identified through this research are common to various astrophysical environments and magnetically confined plasmas in laboratories. This research therefore has a broad impact.       Last Modified: 08/30/2016       Submitted by: Christopher Chaston]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
