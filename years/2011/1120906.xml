<AbstractNarration>Land snails help maintain healthy ecosystems, act as indicators of environmental integrity, and have distinctive evolutionary, ecological and cultural legacies that are important in understanding biodiversity. The Hawaiian Islands support a spectacular diversity of land snails (&gt;750 species), comparable to the continental USA and Canada combined. Unfortunately they have not been comprehensively studied this century, and are vanishing fast; 90% may already be extinct. By documenting and identifying the remaining species, assessing their diversity and clarifying their taxonomy and relationships through phylogenetic analysis, this project will provide the basis for further study of their biology and conservation in a manner not possible before. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two postdoctoral researchers, two graduate, five undergraduate, and multiple high school students will be trained in techniques ranging from systematics to field surveys and museum curation. Broad multidisciplinary research training will foster the next generation of conservation biologists and systematists while providing the means to conserve a vanishing fauna. Results will be widely available through peer-reviewed publications, public workshops, and electronic resources, providing data for a more profound understanding of evolution and biodiversity and giving conservationists the tools to develop appropriate management strategies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hawaii supports one of the world&rsquo;s most spectacular radiations of land snails. Of the approximately 90 families of land snails found globally, Hawaii has representatives from only 10 (Figure 1).The real number of species is difficult to ascertain, because prior to this project, most have not been studied in a comprehensive systematic manner for almost a century. In 1990, after examining extensive museum material and published records Alan Solem, a snail researcher at the Field Museum Chicago estimated that Hawaii had at least 1461 species of land snails found nowhere else in the world. This estimate was more recently revised, and it was determined that only about 750 of those were valid, meaning that they had been properly described. However, the true number of species remains unknown, and is probably somewhere between these two estimates. For example, the family Endodontidae has 33 recognized species found in Hawaii, but Solem thought that at least an additional 290 awaited description in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum (BPBM), Honolulu. Despite such discrepancies even the most conservative estimates indicate that Hawaii is an incontrovertible snail diversity hotspot.
