<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Sindee L. Simon and Gregory B. McKenna of Texas Tech University will investigate the relaxation dynamics in selenide-based chalcogenide glasses using calorimetry, dynamic heat spectroscopy, shear and bulk rheology, and nanorheology.  Three important scientific issues are addressed: the stability of the glasses with respect to aging near and in the intermediate phase region, the effects of nanoconfinement and pressure on the dynamics, and the origin of the unusual mechanical stiffening of ultrathin films.  Of particular interest is the measurement of enthalpy recovery and creep during aging as a function of composition, temperature, and aging time aimed at a more complete understanding of the composition dependence of the stability of these glasses.  Broader impacts include training of two graduate students, incorporation of new material into courses taught by the PIs, and outreach to young students, from fifth through eleventh grades, through a "Super Saturdays" enrichment program for grade-school children and a summer "Science - It's a Girl Thing" program for junior-high and high-school girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physical and chemical stability of chalcogenide glasses are important in many of their potential applications, including as memory devices, optical waveguides, and solar cells.  By increasing understanding the Boolchand intermediate phase, which has enhanced stability, the results are anticipated to facilitate synthesis of stable chalcogenide glasses for such applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intermediate phase proposed by Thorpe [1] and Boolchand [2,3] had been said to exhibit physical stability and a lack of physical aging. However, one of the main outcomes of the project is the finding that enthalpy changes are observed upon aging a fixed distance from Tg for all Gex&shy;&shy;Se100-x compositions studied.  In fact the time required to reach equilibrium is found to monotonically decrease with increasing germanium content.  This observation can be explained by the change in fragility, in the Angell sense [5], of the chalcogenide glasses with composition.  However, in spite of differences in the temperature dependences of the timescales to reach equilibrium, we find no evidence for a Boolchand intermediate phase characterized by high stability and absence of physical aging. Rather, our results indicate that the lack of aging observed by other researchers is due to performing aging at room temperature for samples with widely differing Tgs.  In addition to the work on structural recovery, we also performed the first measurements of the absolute heat capacity versus temperature behavior for the germanium selenide glasses.  The glass transition shifts to higher temperatures as the germanium content increases, consistent with the increase in branchpoint density and network structure as the mean coordination number (r&shy;c&shy;) increases.  Both glass and liquid lines change approximately linearly with temperature, with the glass heat capacity increasing with increasing temperature and the liquid heat capacity decreasing with increasing temperature.  It had been suggested that the ring/chain equilibrium in selenium plays a role in the decrease in Cp with increasing temperature in the liquid state [6]. However, this scenario is not tenable since selenium rings are not expected in germanium selenides as germanium content increases.  We performed experiments on physical vapor deposited Se ultrathin films to establish the glass transition behavior and film stiffening responses using the TTU nanobubble inflation method [7]. The results show that Se, in a fashion similar to organic polymer films that have been spin cast, shows extreme stiffening in a "rubbery-plateau" regime.  However, unlike most polymers, the glass transition temperature of the Se seems independent of the film thickness, at least from 60 nm to the macroscopic condition.  We also, as part of the graduate studentÆs qualifying exam, carried out measurements of the viscoelastic response of layered polymer thin films by using a particle embedment method that is being exploited in our labs [8]. The surface viscoelasticity results [9], contrary to literature reports based on pseudo-thermodynamic determinations [10], suggest that the underlayer film thickness or polymer chemical composition do not change the Tg more than a few degrees.
