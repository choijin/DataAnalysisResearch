<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of South Alabama that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012-2014. The program focuses on integrative sciences at the junction of engineering, biology and chemistry, with links to understanding protein structure and function. Undergraduates participating in the program will conduct independent research under the mentorship of faculty, explore the implications of their research with peers and mentors through formal and informal discussion groups, develop an understanding of the ethical implications of the research process and professionalism, and present their research at an end of program symposium. Research projects will relate to the central theme of protein structure and function and be collaborative in nature with pairs of students working on different aspects of a specific project guided by faculty from the three disciplines. The program's recruitment effort consists of traditional mailings, digital-based advertising, and campus visits. Preference will be given to students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher and who have completed either an organic chemistry or biochemistry course.  Students are selected based on academic record, research interest, and potential for outstanding research in the biosciences. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://www.southalabama.edu/alliedhealth/biomedical/ucur/index.htm, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Anne Boettcher at ucur@southalabama.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Julio Turrens at jturrens@southalabama.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF-REU on "Structure and Function of Proteins" is a program designed to expose undergraduate students to different interedisciplinary scientific projects in biochemistry, organic chemistry and engineering. The program runs for 10 weeks, and participants receive a stipend, food supplement, housing and travel allowance.   One of the goals of this site is to recruit minority and female students from the Southeastern US, since these are groups underrepresented in science.   The site was run for 3 summers, from 2012 to 2014.  73% of the students were female and 30% of all participants belonged to underrepresented minorities (African American, Hispanic and Native American).  The actual number of minority students accepted to participate in the program was even higher, but some of the students decided to attend a different REU.  56% of the participants came from schools in the Southeastern US.  Every summer the program started with a short course on protein biochemistry so all participants (particularly those without background in biochemistry) have the foundational knowledge to understand the techniques to be used in their projects.  In addition, the group met every week for discussions on "Responsible Conduct of Research" (Research Ethics).  The research component of the program involved teams of two students working under the direction of two faculty members, approaching specific biological questions from two different disciplines (for example, Engineering and Biology, Synthetic Chemistry and Biochemistry, etc.).   The program has been a success from many standpoints.  Not only we were successful in bringing underrepresented groups into basic research, but also the experience contributed to several students pursuing careers in research.  Indeed, although most of the participants are still in college, already 3 of them are in PhD programs, one in a MD/PhD program and two others are applying to MS programs in Engineering after graduation with the goal of continuing into doctoral programs.  Furthermore, during this period the participants have co-authored four publications, and several presentations by students at local, state and national meetings.
