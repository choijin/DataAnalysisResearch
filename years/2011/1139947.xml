<AbstractNarration>The award is to support the series of workshops on security in emerging areas that are affiliated with the 2011 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), and will be held on October 17-21st, 2011 in Chicago, IL. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference is a leading international forum for information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools and experiences. Since year 2001, CCS started accommodating series of workshops to explore security issues in a variety of emerging areas. CCS workshops quickly become active forums for researchers to form focus groups, discuss and collaborate on emerging and critical security problems, and disseminate fresh, revolutionary (and sometimes even controversial) ideas. These workshops also serve as natural venues to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines to address security issues in specific domains, such as smartphone technology, cloud computing and national critical infrastructures.</AbstractNarration>

Among the students that received support, at  least eight of them were women, who are under-represented in computer science.       All the above workshops were peer-reviewed, open to public research community  submissions, and especially encouraged novel paradigms and controversial ideas. They  acted as fertile grounds for creative debate and interaction amongst participants in  security issues in a variety of critical and emerging applications and computing  environments that are likely to deeply influence the future of computation and  communications.     Besides research papers, special research panels also took place in some of the  workshops. These panels identified key challenges in their focus areas.     Several students (whose travel was supported by this project) attended these workshops,  and some of them presented their papers and were able to interact with other  participants.     A website for the workshops was set up. The workshop website provided details on the  program such as paper titles, panels and keynote talks.
