<AbstractNarration>This award will allow the University of Missouri to organize a workshop in May 2011 that focuses on increasing the effectiveness of undergraduate student training that will prepare students for a career in science, particularly those from underrepresented groups. The workshop will allow Principal Investigators (PIs) involved in the NSF-funded Undergraduate Research and Mentoring in Biological Sciences (URM) program to discuss important issues associated with undergraduate student training. The main goals of the workshop are (1) to share ideas for improving individual program implementation including ethics training, methods for student recruitment and retention, student development activities, preparation for graduate study, and mentor training; and (2) to discuss and identify best practices for assessing program success. These goals will be accomplished through presentations and panel discussions by experts and through opportunities for group discussion and networking among site directors. A final report will be submitted to NSF summarizing the workshop findings, which will also be disseminated to workshop participants. At the end of this project, it is expected that PIs of the URM program will be better equipped with knowledge on successful implementation of their program and best practices. This will have a direct impact on the quality of training that students will receive and a better way for PIs to measure program success.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }  The 2011 Principal Investigators' Workshop for the Undergraduate Research and Mentoring in the Biological Sciences (URM) program was held June 1 to June 3, 2011 in Arlington, VA. The workshop brought together the principal investigator community to discuss best practices that have been developed by URM projects in assessment and evaluation, recruitment and retention, training in ethical conduct of research, and mentoring undergraduate students for graduate study and careers in the biological sciences.    The participants identified the following best practices in recruitment of students who are underrepresented in the biological sciences, mentoring, undergraduate research, and preparation for graduate study:    Student pool:  students from groups  underrepresented in the biological sciences and high risk students  who are not likely to complete a PhD.     Younger students who start their  research as freshman and sophomores      Mentoring model:  long-term, intensive  mentoring, multiple mentors, peer and near-peer mentors      Research projects: one year and longer with an  emphasis on the entire research process from proposal writing to  manuscript submission and presentations at national meetings      Emphasis on student development: leadership  skills, outreach skills, community involvement are emphasized      Family mentoring model: projects often engage  students' families; some students develop a lab family; many  students view their URM cohort as a family      Preparation for graduate school: URM projects  mentor through entire research process and continues through  graduation     The workshop participants identified several ways that these best practices change the culture of institutions hosting URM projects:     Graduate students and post-doctoral researchers:  gain experience in mentoring and experience  in working with  diverse groups of undergraduate students      Non-URM Faculty gain an increased awareness of  the value of undergraduate research and training      Non-URM Faculty gain a new perspective on how  students from groups that are underrepresented in the biological  sciences and of students that they perceive has at high risk for  obtaining a graduate degree can be successful in completing research  projects and enrolling in graduate programs       Non-URM Faculty gain an increased awareness of  approaches to mentoring students and engaging them in research      P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }       Last Modified: 12/26/2013       Submitted by: Charles H Nilon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
