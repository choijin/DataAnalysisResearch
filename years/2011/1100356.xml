<AbstractNarration>This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project aims to advance the current state of material characterization via a comprehensive experimental approach that is based on biaxial loading.  Metallic materials undergo biaxial stretching during sheet metal forming operations, yet efforts on biaxial testing are overshadowed by those based on the uniaxial loading case.  A customized apparatus capable of deforming test specimens at controlled biaxial stretching ratios will be constructed. It will incorporate a heating system to facilitate testing at high temperatures, and an optical strain measurement system for the accurate evaluation of biaxial strains.  Detailed biaxial stretching tests will then be carried out on multiple materials, covering a wide range of testing conditions.  The collected data is essential to produce mathematical equations that can accurately describe the behavior of the investigated materials.  The research will focus on lightweight alloys (Magnesium, Aluminum, and Titanium) because their weight-saving properties make them increasingly critical to the automotive and aerospace industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be executed at an institution of primary undergraduate education; it will therefore offer a unique opportunity for promoting students involvement in state-of-the-art research.  The testing apparatus will support and enrich several courses and laboratories, in multiple engineering programs.  It will also promote collaborative research activities within the college, especially within the newly-established "Energy" and "Medical Plastics Research" Centers.  Aided by the current ties with General Motors, this research will serve the needs of the automotive sheet metal forming industry, and contribute to the development of a much-needed biaxial testing standard.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Researchers at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College have completed the construction of a full-scale non-equi biaxial sheet metal testing platform.  The machine is capable of producing loads of up to 50kN and independent biaxial displacement of up to 550 mm at rates up to 230 mm/min.  The biaxial testing platform is equipped with an environmental chamber that fully encloses the testing space and provides a controlled atmospheric condition with temperatures up to 500 degrees C.  The testing platform as incorporates 3D digital imaging technology, thereby allowing for the accurate measurement of in-situ deformation strains during testing in all three dimensions.

The non-equibiaxial testing platform is housed within the Burke Research and Development Center on the campus of Penn State Behrend in Erie, Pennsylvania.  The platform is included as a part of Penn State Behrend?s Open Lab policy; thereby making the machine available for material testing research to external industrial and academic researchers.  The machine also features safety glass covered ports over featured aspects of the machine?s drive systems, allowing students and visitors to examine the operation of the components safely during testing.  Use of these viewing ports has been integrated within several courses with the Mechanical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering Technology degrees at Penn State Behrend.  These ports are also utilized during STEM orientated tours and workshops hosted by the University.   More information regarding this testing platform, including how to access the machine, can be obtained by contacting the School of Engineering at Penn State Behrend.  The design and development of this unique testing capability was made possible through the generous support of the National Science Foundation.
