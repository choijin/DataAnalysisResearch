<AbstractNarration>Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems, layers of low-ionization gas with neutral hydrogen column densities characteristic of modern, gas-rich galaxies, are frequently detected in spectra of background quasars. DLA systems are important probes of the history of galaxy formation and heavy-element enrichment in the universe. The proposing team plans to continue their ongoing work on DLA systems in this project, which has three major components: (1) A survey for DLAs at redshifts near 5. The team will measure ionic column densities, in order to track the build-up of metals in these first galaxies and the evolution of the neutral gas, and will search for a decrease in ionization level close to the re-ionization epoch. (2) A search for 158-micron emission from singly-ionized carbon in galaxies at redshifts near 2, using the ALMA observatory. The targeted galaxies are already known to have [CII] absorption; ALMA observations will connect properties of the gas detected in emission and in absorption to constrain their sizes, dynamics, and star formation rates. Numerical simulations will also be used to predict the [CII] emission properties of galaxies at higher redshift. (3) Imaging far ultraviolet (FUV) light from DLAs. The team will use stacked images of Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts between 1 and 5 identified in the Hubble ultra-deep field to search for low surface-brightness emission. They plan also to exploit the chance alignment of a DLA with a higher redshift, optically-thick absorber to obtain imaging and spectroscopy of the star-forming regions in the FUV and estimate the star formation rate, size and morphology of the galaxy. The project will support the work and training of two graduate students, and the collaborating Principal Investigators will participate in outreach talks in various venues, including a charter minority-serving high school and a science festival for middle school girls. They maintain a public website dedicated to DLA science targeted to both the general public and the research community. The team intends to release all of the high-resolution spectra obtained in this program through the website within 2 years of the first observations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The goal of this project was to study the gas responsible for the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Such a study is possible by looking for gas in absorption in the light of bright background light sources. The largest of these absorbers, known as Damped Lyman-alpha Systems (DLAs), are intimately linked to galaxies and star-formation as they contain the bulk of the neutral gas in our Universe which ultimately fuels the formation of stars. The research focused on three main areas.   1) Extending our knowledge of DLAs out to redshifts near 5.  Previous work have shown a decrease in the metallicity, i.e. the fraction of heavy elements produced in stars such as carbon, silicon and iron per hydrogen atom, over cosmic time. This decrease indicates that as our universe ages, stars inject their fusion products into the surrounding gas. Research funded by this grant has shown that the observed scatter in the redshift-metallicity is due to the varying mass of the galaxy that host the DLA, strengthening the link between galaxies and the gas studied in absorption. Furthermore, a second research project funded by this grant has shown that the metallicity evolution is starting to accelerate at redshifts near 5. This acceleration could indicate that stars were better able to enrich their surrounding gas at these redshifts.   2) Emission from DLA galaxies The goal of this project was to observe several DLAs to search for the light from the associated galaxy. This research has resulted in several publications searching for this emission. Related to this research goal, several ancillary projects to understand the physical conditions (i.e. temperature and density) of the gas, were carried out to better understand what makes a galaxy a suitable target for emission line studies.    3) Imaging far ultraviolet (FUV) light from DLAs.

This worked showed that the star formation rate of this gas is about 10% of the total star formation rate of the inner regions of the Lyman-break galaxy, and could account for the observed metallicity seen in DLAs.   These three main areas of research have provided a deeper knowledge of our understanding of  how gas interacts with the galaxies they surround, and provide a meaningful constraint on galaxy formation, in general.The results are disseminated in published work and on our public website dedicated to DLAs.
