<AbstractNarration>The researcher aims to develop millennial-length (1,000-2,000), absolute dated, and high resolution (inter-annual to sub-decadal) oxygen isotope records of speleothems from caves located in western, southern, and northern India.   The goal of the research is to provide Indian summer monsoon (ISM) histories at the regional level that are analogous to the instrumental records from distinct macro-meteorological units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator notes that seasonal precipitation associated with the ISM tends to be dominated by two time scales of variability: (1) interannual variations which are attributed to slowly evolving external boundary conditions (e.g., tropical Pacific SST), and (2) intraseasonal oscillations (e.g., 10-20 and 30-60 day active-break cycles) which are driven by internal dynamics that modulate convection and propagation of embedded synoptic systems. There is no conclusive evidence to indicate which one of these two forcings is the dominant pacemaker of ISM variability on interannual and longer timescales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the research is that existing instrumentally-calibrated and inter-annually resolved oxygen isotope speleothem records from central and northeast India supports the hypothesis that the internal forcing, which manifests in the form of chaotic rainfall variability during the monsoon season, is the dominant pacemaker of ISM variability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the basis of the current data, the research will test the working hypothesis that, on decadal and centennial timescale, systematic changes in the frequency characteristics of active-break cycles serve as a medium by which ISM responds to changes in the external boundary forcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve a better understanding of Indian Monsoon dynamics and the support of undergraduates in the research effort from currently under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

We      hypothesize that through sustained changes in the frequency      characteristics of the active-break cycle, ISM responds to large-scale      changes in the external boundary condition. Importantly, we find that      transitions between the æactive-dominatedÆ and æbreak-dominatedÆ states      can occur rapidly (&lt;10 years), which imply presence of threshold      behaviors in ISM - an observation that may prove significant in      considering how ISM will respond to a warming global climate     We provide a classic example of threshold type behavior in ISM by      documenting ISM variability across the 4.2 ka event.

The teleconnection between ISM precipitation and ENSO has undergone      a protracted weakening since the late 1980s, prompting questions as to      whether this shift represents a natural mode of climate variability or a      fundamental change in ENSO and/or ISM dynamics due to anthropogenic      warming or aerosol impacts on the ISM.

Our records      suggest that the 20th century breakdown in ENSO-ISM      relationship is not anomalous in the long-term context of our record. Our      finding implies that the prominent multidecadal variability that      characterizes the last 2000 yr. of the ISM is not likely attributable to      multidecadal shifts in ENSO.
