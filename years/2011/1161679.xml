<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PIs propose just the first-year study of a program of research for "Hybrid Aerial Vehicles" that routinely execute dynamic maneuvers to land on, move along, and take off from sites such as walls, roofs, trees and power lines. These platforms combine the best attributes of unmanned aircraft and climbing robots. They can reach remote sites rapidly, flying directly to them. After landing, they can move along surfaces to strategic locations and provide stable inspection platforms while consuming little power for hours or days. If they cling tenaciously, they can also ride out weather that is too rough for flight. When conditions improve, or the mission changes, they can jump off and become airborne, flying to a new site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Although this is only an initial investigation, the PIs suggest, in addition to the usual publication and web-based dissemination, the long-term impact of the larger project will be enhanced with workshops organized to bring together academic and industry experts in the emerging topic of perching aircraft. The proposal also includes a new course to be offered during MIT?s Independent Activities Period that will introduce undergraduates to interesting problems that arise at the intersection of aerodyamics, robotics and bio-inspired mechanisms. The course takes advantage of the low cost of small RC planes to provide hands-on testing and prototyping. Based on the experience gained in running the course, the same material will be adapted to a short course for high school students, organized in collaboration with the Stanford School of Education. Both laboratories have a strong track record of involving undergraduates and under-represented minorities in research and in outreach to local high schools. To help disseminate the educational material, all software and hardware will be open source.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF-supported project on Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicles that Interact with Surfaces has lead to the first known instances of small, unmanned air vehicles that fly, perch on vertical surfaces, climb, and then take off again. This capability greatly extends the types of missions that small fliers, such as quadrotors, can undertake.   While perched, they can remain onsite for hours without consuming much power, and performing surveillance, inspection or communications tasks. While perched, they are also unaffected by gusty weather that would preclude flight. When their task is complete, they detach from the wall and resume flight.  In the process of creating and controlling these new hybrid flying/climbing robots, we have increased our understanding of the basic scaling laws and dynamics that affect perching and takeoff. These results will pave the way for future generations of hybrid air vehicles -- perhaps larger or smaller than the ones we have tested -- to operate at the interface of aerial and terrestrial environments.   The results of this project are published in several journal and conference papers, a PhD thesis, YouTube videos, a writeup in IEEE Spectrum/Robotics (Stanford SCAMP), and a Best Paper award at an international robotics conference.  This work has supported several graduate and undergraduate students at Stanford and has benefited from collaboration with researchers at MIT, U. Penn and U. Maryland.
