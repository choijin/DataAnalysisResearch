<AbstractNarration>The proposed research focuses on cluster algebras, a class of commutative rings discovered by the PI in collaboration with S. Fomin. This theory arose as an attempt to create an algebraic framework for the study of two classical fields: theory of total positivity, and representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. Since its inception, the theory of cluster algebras found a number of exciting connections and applications: quiver representations, non-commutative geometry, Seiberg dualities, discrete integrable systems, Teichmuller theory, etc. The PI explores the structural properties of cluster algebras, and their connections and applications. He also develops the theory of quivers with potentials and their representations, motivated among other things, by the theory of superpotentials in theoretical physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has roots in two classical areas of mathematics: representation theory and the theory of total positivity. Representation theory provides mathematical tools for studying symmetry, while total positivity is a remarkable property of matrices (square arrays of numbers) that generalizes the familiar notion of positive numbers. Both theories find numerous applications in physics, chemistry and other sciences, as well as numerous connections with other mathematical disciplines. In fact, representation theory serves as the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics, while total positivity is a major tool for explaining oscillations in mechanical systems. The cluster algebras lying in the heart of this project provide a new algebraic framework for the study of these disciplines, making their formalism more explicit and understandable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main topic of the research of the original PI is the theory of cluster algebras.  In the part of project regarding quivers with relations, the PI worked with Derksen and Weyman on quivers with potential and their applications to the theory of cluster algebras. They developed a general theory and applied it to prove several conjectures of Fomin and the PI on cluster algebras. Two papers on this subject are widely cited, they already have over hundred citations each.  The PI together with Daniel Labardini Fragoso in their paper on strongly primitive species with potentials extended the mutation theory of quivers with potentials to the valued quivers, i.e. species that arise from skew-symmetrizable matrices.   The PI with Kyungyong Lee and Li Li - investigating atomic bases and positivity for rank 2 cluster algebras; they show that a rank 2 cluster algebra has a basis of indecomposable positive elements if and only if it is of finite or affine type.  The PI and Arkadiy Berenstein introduced and investigated triangular bases in quantum cluster algebras.  The PI and Tomoki Nakanishi in the paper on tropical dualities in cluster algebras study two families of integer vectors which play a crucial part in the structural theory of cluster algebras: the g-vectors parameterizing cluster variables, and the c-vectors parameterizing the coefficients. they prove two identities relating these vectors to each other.  The last Ph.D. student of the PI was Salvatore Stella who defended his thesis with the title Discrete Structures in Finite Type Cluster Algebras where description of the c-vectors and the d-vectors (the denominator vectors) of any cluster algebra of finite type with principal coefficients and any initial exchange matrix is given.  Graduate student Emre Sen came to study with the PI and was supported by this grant.  The PI gave numerous invited lectures, colloquia, seminars. One of the latest being: the PI was one of the main participants at the MSRI Cluster Algebras Workshop.   The second PI continued work on cluster theory, with empasis on the relations between cluster algebras, cluster categories, semi-invariants on presentation spaces, associated picture groups. The results are obtained for finite dimensional herediatary algebras which include modulated quivers as well. Furthermore, the precise relation between domains of semi-invariants and c-vectors is given. This was done in the joint work with Igusa, Orr and Weyman.   The second PI, in a joint work with Brustle, Hermes and igusa used the above relation between domains of semi-invariants the c-vectors in order to prove two conjectures about maximal green sequences, mathematical notion related to BPS-states of certain particles in physics.  The second PI together with Igusa introduced the notion of continuous cluster categories, which are noncountable generalizations of the cluster categories of finite or countable quivers of type A and D.   The second PI investigated functorialy finite torsion classes for herediatary algebras in the joint work with Iyama, Reiten, Thomas and showed that such classes form lattice exactly for Dynkin quivers of finite type or quivers with two vertices.
