<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop arrays of nanoparticle-coated microfabricated opto-fluidic ring resonator sensors with unprecedented capabilities to discriminate among different volatile organic compounds, to use such an array as the detector in a gas chromatographic microsystem, and to demonstrate the quantitative analysis of targeted compounds in arbitrarily complex mixtures.  The approach entails micromachining high-aspect-ratio resonators with wave confinement contours, demonstrating enhanced vapor discrimination by use of vapor-sorptive interface layers comprising thiolate-monolayer-protected gold nanoparticles, and integrating arrays of such micro-resonators into the microsystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This research entails a new approach to vapor sensor array design, which will lead to the first microfabricated optofluidic ring resonator detectors made using scalable, precision microfabrication techniques. The proposed device structures promise inherently greater vapor sensitivity.  Since vapor induced changes in refractive index will vary with the nanoparticle size, thiolate-ligand functionality, and probing wavelength, arrays of such devices promise response diversity inherently greater than that produced by current sensor arrays, which will enhance vapor discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The successful project will fill a need for small, inexpensive, turn-key instrumentation for the determination of multiple vapors at trace levels in complex mixtures, with direct application to the detection of disease biomarkers, explosives, and airborne toxicants.  Dissemination of project results to representatives of technology-oriented companies and leading microsystem research centers throughout the world will be facilitated through extant affiliations of the investigators.  This will promote the commercialization of the developed technologies and expand the scope of training provided to the students on the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report Tunable Micro-Optofluidic Ring Resonator Arrays as Micro Gas Chromatograph Detectors PI: E. T. Zellers, University of Michigan  This project was highly successful and the broad goals set forth at the outset were met: we have developed a new microsensor, the micro-optofluidic ring resonator (&micro;OFRR), and demonstrated its capabilities; we have shown that multi-wavelength optical vapor sensing with certain plasmonic-nanoparticle films provides a greater degree of response diversity than is possible with arrays of current microsensors employing the same nanoparticles; and we have integrated polymer-coated and nanoparticle-coated &micro;OFRRs into single- and two-dimensional micro-scale gas chromatographic (&micro;GC) systems and shown that, when included in such microsystems, this sensing technology is capable of quantitatively analyzing the components of volatile organic compound (VOC) mixtures.   The specific aims were to 1) microfabricate rugged, high-aspect-ratio &micro;OFRRs with wave confinement contours and high Q factors; 2) demonstrate that using plasmonic thiolate-monolayer-protected Au nanoparticles (MPNs) having different core sizes and ligand functionalities as vapor-sorptive OFRR interface layers that are probed at multiple wavelengths can enhance vapor discrimination; 3) assemble arrays of &micro;OFRRs with optimized subsets of MPN interface layers, and assess their performance in analyzing simple mixtures of VOCs; and 4) integrate them into a &micro;GC-&micro;OFRR prototype instrument capable of rapid in-situ analysis of targeted VOCs in complex mixtures in air or breath.  Most of the specific aims were met.  Intellectual Merit: Current stand-alone microsensor arrays (aka "electronic noses") are not capable of quantitatively analyzing mixtures of more than two or three VOCs due to the limited diversity in the composite response patterns generated, regardless of the transducer or interface layers employed. The use of &micro;OFRRs with plasmonic MPN interface layers represents a new approach to vapor sensor array design that should overcome this limitation, while also being suitable for integration into &micro;GC platforms. The use of individual, polymer-coated (non-microfabricated) OFRRs as sensitive GC detectors had been demonstrated through prior NSF support. However, such devices are made by cumbersome drawn-capillary techniques that are not amenable to mass production or to arrayed integration with upstream &micro;GC components.  The research performed in this project yielded the first &micro;OFRR vapor sensors ever made, using precise, scalable, batch microfabrication techniques. The thinner, more uniform walls of the &micro;OFRR afford inherently greater sensitivity than in non-microfabricated predecessor devices because a greater fraction of the evanescent wave energy resides in the polymeric or MPN sensing layer.  The &micro;OFRRs developed here were wall-coated with isotropic polymers and plasmonic MPNs.

Several new MPN materials with different core sizes and ligand functionalities were designed/synthesized. We proved the principle that the diversity of responses afforded by an optimized &micro;OFRR array would enhance analyte recognition/discrimination. Although we fell short of creating an integrated array of &micro;OFRRs, we succeeded in integrating both a polymer-coated &micro;OFRR and a MPN-coated &micro;OFRR into a &micro;GC system and a more sophisticated 2-dimensional (&micro;GC&times;&micro;GC) system, and demonstrating their performance. Supporting hardware and control software required to create working prototypes were also developed.  As the very first examples of such microsystems, these represent a sign...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
