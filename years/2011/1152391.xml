<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates a low cost, high efficiency&lt;br/&gt;portable power system called the QM Power ?PoD?? (Power on Demand). The PoD will power handheld&lt;br/&gt;consumer electronic devices (cell phones, tablets, laptops etc) utilizing a rechargeable battery and an&lt;br/&gt;advanced, mechanical energy generator system. QM Power, in conjunction with development partner&lt;br/&gt;Dell Engineering Services, will complete the design, analysis, prototyping and system integration of its&lt;br/&gt;generator technology into the PoD and will evaluate various accessories which allow the user to input&lt;br/&gt;mechanical energy via a crank, gravity assist mechanism or other methods. Research results from the&lt;br/&gt;Phase I effort indicate that utilizing QM Power generator technology in an auxiliary power/recharging&lt;br/&gt;system has the potential to reduce human input requirements by over 30% compared to state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;product offering now available.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that the PoD will enable users to obtain critical power on&lt;br/&gt;demand and provide substantial environmental and public benefits (reducing grid dependence,&lt;br/&gt;disposable battery issues and providing power to emerging markets that lack access). Mobile devices&lt;br/&gt;have become increasingly power hungry while advances in battery energy density have not kept pace.&lt;br/&gt;As a result, the length of use, mobility, and ease use of these devices have been hampered. The QM&lt;br/&gt;Power PoD is designed as a hybrid, auxiliary power pack solution that combines a longer life&lt;br/&gt;rechargeable battery solution with a supplementary source of renewable, on-demand power that does not&lt;br/&gt;require access to the grid.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project QM Power investigated integrating itÃ†s patented, Parallel Path Magnetic Technolog (PPMT) generator into a multi-purpose portable auxiliary power system dubbed the PoD (Power-on-Demand).  The purpose of the PoD is to provide an additional and flexible, non-grid dependent source of portable back-up battery power for high power mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets and laptops used in business, leisure and outdoor/recreational settings and for emergency situations.  The PoD incorporates a manual hand cranked generator, a rechargeable lithium ion battery pack, a USB port, an AC power adapter and an LED flashlight.  QM Power worked with L&amp;T Technology Services (L&amp;T), formerly Dell Product &amp; Process Innovation Services, to design, build, optimize, integrate and test a PoD recharging unit.  QM Power also developed a separate, gravity-driven device called the G-PoD which utilizes gravity as a source of energy to power the PoD.  The G-PoD is essentially a gearbox that is attached to the PoD and utilizes weights and gravity to turn the generator.   QM Power achieved breakthrough test results with our testing partner, L&amp;T, reporting that the generator prototype achieved significant efficiency gains in excess of 30% over a comparably-sized competing solution.  All of the Phase II objectives were met.  QM PowerÃ†s commercialization activities primarily focused on delivering a finished commercial product for Dell to market alongside their tablet and other electronic offerings.  The company also evaluated and contacted other interested OEMs and is exploring the use of the generator technology in additional applications, including a small wind device used for remote GPS systems.
