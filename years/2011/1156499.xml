<AbstractNarration>The MSRI Undergraduate Program (MSRI-UP) is designed to provide the opportunity as well as the long-term support and mentorship that talented undergraduate students need in order to have access to research careers in science and mathematics.  Each year, 18 students will participate in an intense six-week summer research experience where they will work in teams to complete a research project.  The students will be led by a research director, a post-doc and two graduate student assistants.  Students will also make a final presentation at MSRI.  The topics for the summer program are of current mathematical interest and importance, and represent part of faculty research leader's research program. These include areas of combinatorics, finite geometry and computational algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSRI-UP aims to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences Ph.D. programs.  The primary objective is to identify students with an interest in mathematics, and provide necessary experiences, tools, information and long-term support for them to have a viable option to pursue a graduate education in the mathematical sciences.  In addition to the research component, the students will attend a series of professional development workshops and colloquia, including graduate school program information. After the summer, students will present their work in poster sessions at national conferences such as the Joint Mathematics Meetings and the annual meeting of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute Undergraduate Program (MSRI-UP) is a comprehensive undergraduate research and training program that aims to have a large impact in the U.S. mathematical society by increasing the number of graduate degrees earned by U.S. citizens and residents. A strength of MSRI-UP is its focus on cultivating the underutilized mathematical talent within the Black, Hispanic, Native American, and other underrepresented populations.  MSRI-UP identifies talented students and offers them the research experience, the training and resources, and the long-term mentorship and support necessary to pursue a graduate degree and a career in the mathematical sciences.  The program provides: (1) an intense six-week summer research experience, (2) colloquia and professional development workshops, (3) the opportunity to present at national conferences, (4) the introduction to a wide community of peers and mentors; and (5) long-term follow-up and mentorship.  MSRI-UP runs under the direction of a team of five program directors with support from the staff of MSRI.  Each year, one of the co-directors took the role of lead director with the specific task of managing the activities of the year?s cohort of students and continuing and maintaining the relationship and connection with the students through their completion of graduate school.  Each year, MSRI-UP ran with a different research theme with the mathematical activities directed by a research leader who is an expert in the area of research and an established mentor and with the support of one post-doctoral scholar and two graduate student assistants.  The research themes in 2012 until 2017 were respectively Enumerative Combinatorics, Algebraic Combinatorics, Arithmetic Aspects of Elementary Functions, Geometric Combinatorics in Social Sciences, Sandpile Groups, and Algorithmic Algebraic Geometry.  During each six-week residential program in Berkeley, California, career development activities included four to five colloquia from professional mathematicians; graduate school preparation presentations, discussions, and panels; oral presentations workshops; and career panels.  MSRI-UP PhD-holding alumni were especially sought as visitors.  In the 2012 &ndash; 2017 MSRI-UP programs, 107 students from eighty universities worked in teams to complete 36 research projects.  Forty-four percent of these students are women and 85% are from ethnic groups underrepresented in mathematics.  Of the 81 students who have completed their undergraduate degrees, 64 continued on to graduate programs with 48 of them in PhD programs; 11 of the students having already received their master?s degrees and 22 are currently pursuing their master?s.    Several of the students? research projects have been submitted to peer-reviewed journals.   Nine of them have already been published and others are under review. Students gave oral presentations during the summer research program and each team wrote final research reports and also created posters of their work.  The MSRI-UP student teams presented their work at the annual national conferences of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science and at the Joint Mathematics Meetings where students have won research poster awards. Many students also presented their work at other conferences.  The MSRI-UP students reported significant gains in their attitudes and behaviors as researchers and personal gains as a consequence of their summer research experiences. Below are a few survey statements and the percentage of students who report good to great gains (as opposed to only moderate, a little or no gains):      Comfort in discussing mathematical concepts with others - 83% Comfort in working collaboratively with others - 83% Confidence in my ability to contribute to mathematics - 85% Confidence in my ability to do research - 86% Confidence in my ability to do well in future math courses - 79% Engage in real-world mathematics research - 93% Feel a part of a mathematics community - 93% Feel like a mathematician - 82% Making oral presentations - 90% Problem-solving in general - 86% Understanding the connections among mathematical disciplines - 82% Understanding what everyday research work is like - 93% Writing mathematical reports or papers - 90%        Last Modified: 02/15/2018       Submitted by: David Eisenbud]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
