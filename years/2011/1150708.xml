<AbstractNarration>Performance-based feedback is widely used to aid learning by providing information about response accuracy. In addition to this informational role, feedback also plays an important motivational role. Earning the reward of positive feedback and avoiding the punishment of negative feedback can become salient goals to motivated learning. With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Elizabeth Tricomi of Rutgers University is investigating how the motivational significance of feedback influences neural processing and consequent learning. She is conducting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of learning from positive and negative feedback. One set of experiments is investigating how the amount of cognitive effort expended on a learning task influences feedback-related brain signals.  A second set of experiments is investigating how motivational factors may differentially affect positive and negative feedback signals in the brain, and how this affects the relative contributions of learning from errors and from positive reinforcement. Changes in motivation to learn or to perform well may change the value that learners place on the feedback they receive. Therefore, the results of these studies will provide insight into how motivation influences value-related neural activity in the brain's "reward circuit," and how this brain activity may in turn influence the amount learned from the feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In trying to understand how to best tailor educational practices to the needs of the individual, a variety of influences on learning and performance other than ability need to be considered. Because motivation is one key factor in determining how successfully information will be acquired and used, understanding the neural mechanisms by which motivation influences learning processes is important. This project is providing a significant advance in our current understanding of how the motivational and informational components of feedback combine to facilitate learning. The results are expected to have implications for educational practices, in the classroom and beyond. In addition to the research component of the project, an educational component incorporates effective teaching and learning strategies, such as student-centered learning, into the classroom at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. Furthermore, a monthly professional development workshop for graduate students is promoting the retention of women in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The research funded by this grant investigated how the motivational significance of feedback influences neural processing and consequent learning.  Typically, feedback is treated as having a fixed reward value.  The value of feedback to an individual, however, can vary depending on how motivated that individual is to earn positive feedback or avoid negative feedback. The experiments funded by this grant tested the hypothesis that feedback signals in the brain should reflect the value of the feedback to the individual.  Our results demonstrated that feedback signals in the brain depend not only on whether the response was correct or incorrect, but also on how much an individual values the feedback (Tricomi &amp; DePasque, 2016).  For example, we published a study in which a brief motivational interview was used to influence the value learners placed on the goal of doing well on learning task (DePasque &amp; Tricomi, 2015).  We found that individual differences in motivation levels during the task were associated with sensitivity to feedback in the striatum.  We have also found that increased cognitive effort on a feedback-based learning task produces corresponding increases in reward-related activity in the ventral striatum, providing support for Contrast Theory, which posits that the contrast between costly effort and a reward makes the reward seem more valuable (Dobryakova, Jessup, &amp; Tricomi, 2017).  Furthermore, we found that in a task requiring physical effort, the experience of actual control, but not illusory control, elevated performance (Sullivan-Toole, Richey, &amp; Tricomi, 2017).   A second set of studies has focused on how the neural response to negative feedback is modulated by motivational context.  Whereas positive feedback is typically both rewarding and informative, negative feedback is typically punishing, but still informative.  When learners are oriented to the informative, rather than evaluative, aspect of negative feedback, the "punishment" response in the striatum to negative feedback is attenuated (Lempert &amp; Tricomi, 2016).  On the other hand, the negative feedback response is exacerbated for those high in avoidance goals following a competence threat, in the form of a low score on a purported IQ test (DePasque, et al., submitted).   Additionally, we have probed the role of social motivation on feedback-based learning.  Relative to a no-competition condition, we have observed that competition reduces accuracy on a memory task (DiMenichi &amp; Tricomi, 2015), and recruits brain regions involved in social cognition (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex).  Interestingly, as performance declined, regions in the brain?s "default mode network" that have been associated with task distraction were recruited (e.g., precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex), suggesting that the engagement of these regions during competition may actually distract from accomplishing the goal of high performance (DiMenichi &amp; Tricomi, 2017).  Finally, a study on vicarious reward activity during a learning task when performance was tied to bonuses earned for oneself or another person found that participants naturally fell into two groups: those who reported being most engaged when playing on behalf of others and those who were most engaged when playing on behalf of themselves.  The Self-Engaged subjects showed more "self-centered" responses to positive versus negative feedback, relative to the Other-Engaged subjects, who showed responses to positive and negative feedback that were of a similar magnitude whether they were playing on behalf of themselves or others (Sullivan-Toole, et al., submitted).  Taken together, our results demonstrate that the brain does not simply code feedback as positive or negative, but that it responds flexibly to feedback, based on the learner?s motivational state and current goals.   Broader Impacts  Integration of Research and Education:  I designed and offered a new graduate seminar on Achievement and Motivation, a topic related to the funded research. This cross-disciplinary course focused on student-center learning, and used a discussion format and a peer review of students? term papers.   Training:  During the course of the award, I have trained 5 graduate students, 5 post-bac research assistants, and 14 undergraduate students in my lab. These trainees reflect the diversity of the students at Rutgers-Newark, and have included many women and students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Dissemination:  In addition to dissemination through scientific manuscripts, the award has led to eleven presentations of the results at national conferences. The lab also maintains a website describing our research and providing links to our publications.  Finally, our work has been disseminated to nonscientific audiences through high school presentations, interactive lab workshops, panel presentations and press coverage.   Promoting the Participation of Women in the Sciences:  In my Education Plan of my CAREER proposal, I proposed running a "book club"/mentoring workshop for graduate students and other trainees.  Each month, we discussed books related to the professional development of women.  Topics have included graduate school success, leadership, negotiation, mentoring and diversity, and balancing work and family life. Additionally, the award provided funds for a special annual colloquium, in which a speaker presented research related to the professional development of women.
