<AbstractNarration>Galaxies are not spread uniformly through space, but are highly clustered in a network of super-clusters separated by voids, now called the Cosmic Web. The galaxies contain only about 10% of the mass in the Web; the remainder of the baryonic (ordinary) matter is in the highly-ionized intergalactic medium (IGM). The proposing team will conduct observational studies of the IGM, using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope to probe the gas in absorption in the spectra of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), and large ground-based telescopes to study the galaxies near those lines of sight with the intent of determining the connection between the galaxies and the absorption lines. They will exploit a database of ~140 QSO sight lines with high-quality COS spectra, and obtain spectra of the galaxies nearby with a combination of archival data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), new observations with the HYDRA spectrographs at the WIYN and CTIO 4-meter telescope, and a new redshift survey conducted with the Gemini telescopes. The goal of these combined observations is to produce (1) the most complete census of baryons in the Cosmic Web to date, including the hotter gas currently regarded as "missing"; (2) a potential solution to the baryon deficiency problem in spiral galaxies; and (3) a mapping of circumgalactic gas, representing a largely undetected phase of the cycle of infall and outflow that regulates star formation in galaxies. The team will disseminate images, spectra, and higher-level data products via the National Virtual Observatory; train a postdoc and graduate students in optical and UV spectroscopy techniques; adapt these techniques to undergraduate-level exercises; and develop a public planetarium show.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program is designed to map the 'Cosmic Web' of baryons in both  gas and galaxies.  Information about the gaseous content of the Web  comes from quasar absorption line systems detected at low redshift by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope.   The distribution of galaxies near the quasar sight lines is determined  from galaxy redshift surveys at optical wavelengths.  Together, our  sensitive gas and galaxy distributions provide: (1) the most  complete baryon census to date; (2) a potential solution to the  so-called 'baryon deficiency' in spiral galaxies; and (3) an initial  mapping of the circumgalactic medium for low-redshift galaxies of  different sizes.   Gas expelled by galaxies enriches  initially pristine gas with heavy elements (all elements heavier than  hydrogen and helium) created in stars. By characterizing the amount and  physical conditions in this gas, we have laid the groundwork for a consistent  model of the continuing star formation in galaxies, as well as the  build-up of heavy elements in newly forming stars. These heavy elements  eventually make their way into new generations of stars and planets like  Earth; thus, understanding how gas cycles in and out of these galaxies gives  us insight into the evolution of spiral galaxies like our own Milky Way.  Our first attempt at making this characterization using the gas  cloud sample  discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope found a significant new reservoir of gas. Further physical modeling  of these clouds associated with spiral galaxies finds they contain nearly 50% of the mass in the galaxy's stars.  The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph has also  discovered very broad, shallow absorption in neutral hydrogen and  five-times ionized oxygen, which may contain even more mass. We examined the environments of these broad, shallow  absorbers and suggest that they are associated with galaxy groups rather than  individual galaxies. If the associations are indeed with galaxy groups,  the observed frequency of these absorbers requires them to be very extended on the sky.. We concude that these absorbers are  most likely interface gas clouds whose presence implies the existence of  a hotter, more diffuse, and probably very massive intra-group medium that has yet to be detected directly.
