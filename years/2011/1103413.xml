<AbstractNarration>This award helps develop a record of tropical cyclone activity from speleothems recovered from the Kimberley region of tropical Western Australia and dated to the late Holocene (~4,000 yr B.P.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous research by the researcher demonstrated that aragonite stalagmites are abundant in caves in the Kimberley through the late Holocene and up to the present time, are characterized by extremely high growth rates, and the caves trap clays deposited on stalagmite surfaces only during tropical cyclone-induced flooding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because these stalagmites contain elevated Uranium abundances, high delta 234-Uranium values, and are largely devoid of detritus (other than in flood deposits), they can be dated with extremely high precision using Uranium-Thorium mass spectrometry (Â±1 year within the last century). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to constrain the cyclone distance/intensity threshold required to flood the caves, the researcher will combine the stalagmite sedimentological flood records with stable isotopic analyses over the last 100 years of growth; an interval for which historical records of tropical cyclone intensity and storm track are available. This analysis will help establish a baseline for estimating the intensity-distance ratio of past storms recorded as clay layers in individual caves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve the potential for greater understanding of the history of cyclonic activity and the developement of a new climate proxy.  The research also involves substantive undergraduate student participation in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  A pressing question facing climate scientists is how tropical cyclones (atmospheric phenomena also known as hurricanes, typhoons, tropical storms, and tropical depressions) will respond to a warmer atmosphere and ocean. Tropical cyclones can cause enormous economic loss, but also play important roles in providing annual rainfall to many parts of the tropics. Some changes are already being observed. On average, over the last few decades, tropical cyclones are releasing more energy and moving to higher latitudes than in the earlier part of the 20th century.  The goal of this research was to investigate how tropical cyclones behaved in the past by examining mud layers trapped within stalagmites from north-central Australia. These mud layers, which are up to one centimeter thick, form when the cave is flooded by extreme rainfall events (Fig1).  As the flood waters recede and the stalagmite is again exposed to the cave air, dripwater deposits additional minerals on to of the mud layers that are coating the stalagmites, and as growth continues, encapsulates them.  The ages of the flood layers can be precisely determined by dating the stalagmite material above and below through U-Th methods. Analysis of modern rainfall and weather data revealed that most extreme rainfall events in this area are related to passing tropical cyclones, and thus the stalagmite mud layers are, in turn, interpreted as primarily a tropical cyclone record.  Through funding from the P2C2 program, the principal investigator, in conjunction with two Cornell College undergraduates and several Australian collaborators, collected a suite of stalagmites from multiple caves across northwestern Australia.  These samples were bisected, dated at the University of New Mexico Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory directed by Dr. Yemane Asmerom and managed by Dr. Victor Polyak. Once the age models were developed, several undergraduate students conducted a wide array of analyses.  Three students precisely measured and described the flood layers, including Ms. Angelique Gonzalez who conducted an honors thesis in geology on these samples. In addition to the sediment layer analysis, other students obtained and then interpreted stable isotopic ratios of the stalagmites.  These measurements were made largely at the Iowa State University Stable Isotope Laboratory directed by Dr. Alan Wanamaker and managed by Ms. Suzanne Ankerstjerne, although some additional samples were analyzed at the University of Nevada Las Vegas Stable Isotope Laboratory by Dr. Matthew Lachniet. Oxygen isotopic ratios of stalagmites are recognized as recording past changes in monsoon rainfall amount, while carbon isotopes in the same samples are related to site-specific changes in vegetation, infiltration, and cave conditions.  Through U-Th dating, the stalagmites were shown to range in age from 40,000 - 0 years ago.  The mud layers are by far best developed in extremely fast growing stalagmites spanning the last 4,000 years.  This 4,000 year record shows changes in cave flooding activity that varied over the scale of hundreds to thousands of years, with peak flooding (tropical cyclone) activity having occurred over the past 150 years, during medieval times, and during the first few centuries of the first millennium AD. Over the last 1,500 years, this pattern is remarkably similar to reconstructions of tropical cyclones from several areas in the North Atlantic, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.  Today, one of the most prominent controls on global tropical cyclone activity is the El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a couple ocean-atmosphere system that involves most prominently shifts in ocean temperatures across the tropical Pacific, but that also changes atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns around much of the globe.  ENSO also strongly influences tropical cyclones. Today, one phase of ENSO, referred to as La Ni&ntilde;a, results in higher numbers of storms in both the Atlantic and Austr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
