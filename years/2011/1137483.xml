<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Dartmouth College proposes an exploratory project meant to offer testable proof of concept activities that enact some practical approaches to create an environment of encouragement for girls in STEM through games. The activities will take into account the context of families, schools, communities, and peer groups. The researchers hypothesize that well-designed game activities may disrupt negative stereotypes about women's capabilities in STEM fields. Through fostering and supporting girls' confidence in their abilities in STEM, they may be more motivated to become interested in STEM fields.  Using the theoretical frameworks of Critical Play, where the design process mirrors the values to be integrated into the design of the artifact, and informed by Design-Based Research, the project team will address the research questions by iterating and testing novel approaches to these issues. The proposed project explores, prototypes, iterates, and assesses interactive experiences designed to connect research findings in gender and STEM areas to girls in their own contexts. The research team proposes to prototype 10 games with the goal to finalize 4 for production.  No one has yet used a game platform to explore mitigating bias and stereotypes, and this is a new approach to challenging social norms that have been shown to decrease girls' interest in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: A recently released AAUW report points to recent research findings that identify the social and environmental factors in the underrepresentation of women in STEM areas. Much research has pointed to the specific ways in which girls might further succeed in STEM areas if particular social and cultural aspects were to improve.  Small game activities are a powerful vehicle for a much broader discussion, social interaction, and collaboration, and offer a ripe platform for STEM exploration. Discovering a set of design principles that foster change with the social and environmental factors involved in the perception of STEM fields promises an extraordinary proof-of concept contribution to the field. The successful completion of this research has great potential to show proof of concept in the disruption of gender stereotypes using games.  Some of these barriers might be changed through well-designed, collaborative game activities that can engage and energize the issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Our prior work has established narratives as a viable way to affect social and psychological change for a wide array of underrepresented groups. In this recent work we have shown games can also affect social and psychological change, specifically involving bias and STEM domains. Each of the four games created targeted a different æsubdomainÆ of bias:  Awkward Moment: A Game for 3-10 Middle School Students. Via a series of controlled experimental studies, we tested the impact of Awkward Moment on playersÆ likelihood of associating women and science, levels of assertiveness in responding to imagined occurrences of bias, and perspective-taking abilities, using a variety of measures, including: (1) an job assigning activity that we created, (2) a response-to-bias rating measure based on prior empirical findings from social psychological research, (3) the "E-drawing task," a measure of self-oriented versus other-oriented perspective that involves writing a capital letter E on oneÆs forehead and recording its orientation, and (4) a theory-of-mind measure assessing respondentsÆ ability to ignore privileged information in inferring another individualÆs subjective mindset. Results have shown that the game exerts a significant positive effect on all of these outcomes for both youth and adult players following gameplay.   Awkward Moment at Work: A Game for 3-10 Adults. A follow-up study involved Awkward Moment at Work, a variant of the original game for adults involving occurrences of workplace bias. Compared to participants in a neutral-game control condition, players of an "intermixed" version of the game (with equal representation of bias-related and neutral "moments") exhibited lower levels of prejudice, as measured by the Internal and External Motivation to Control Prejudice scales, and higher levels of perspective-taking, as assessed by the theory-of-mind measure described above. In contrast, players of an "imbalanced" version of the game (featuring a majority of bias-related "moments") exhibited lower levels of motivation to control prejudice and reduced perspective-taking, compared to players of the neutral and intermixed versions of the game. Buffalo: The Name Dropping Game: A Game for 3-10 High School Students/Adults. A series of controlled studies involving Buffalo revealed that the game significantly lowered adult playersÆ prejudices and increased their concern about being biased, as measured by the Universal Orientation Scale, a measure of universal non-prejudice assessing individualsÆ likelihood of focusing on interpersonal similarities rather than differences, and the Internal and External Motivation to Control Prejudice scales, described above. Luminaries: A Game for 2-5 Middle School Students. The last game developed for the project aimed to promote a growth mindset in relation to playersÆ perception of their ability to succeed in STEM and stimulate playersÆ interest in pursuing studies and careers in STEM.  A controlled study showed that the game effectively promoted these outcomes for female players, as measured by the Incremental Theory of STEM Intelligence scale and self-report items assessing playersÆ interest in and perceived value of STEM careers and perceived likelihood of envisioning oneÆs "future self" as a computer programmer.    We also created a mobile app, "Connections," an open source adaptation of the famous Implicit Association Test for use on mobile devices; it involves light game elements and accurately measures unconscious associations. We additionally created new survey measures as part of the research. SIGNIFICANCE: The "EAGER: Transforming STEM For Women and Girls: Reworking Stereotypes &amp; Bias" research demonstrated that games can change attitudes and beliefs about bias generally, and about women and girls in STEM specifically. This project revealed the novel ways that interpersonal interaction might be influenced by dynamic interactivity. Games can be useful for shifting the climate for eve...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
