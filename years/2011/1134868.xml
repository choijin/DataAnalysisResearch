<AbstractNarration>Water mites are among the most abundant, diverse and ecologically important arthropod groups in freshwater habitats like streams, rivers, ponds and lakes. Unfortunately, very little is known about water mite biology and diversity in North America, making incorporation of water mites into research programs nearly impossible. Additionally, very few water mite experts exist worldwide and few experts have been trained in North America during recent decades. This project will focus on one of the most abundant and diverse water mite families, Torrenticolidae, and researchers at the University of Arkansas and the Canadian National Collection will train a new generation of specialists by undertaking the following objectives: 1) collect, identify and describe North American species; 2) establish a modern streamlined approach to greatly speed up the time from discovery to dissemination of data through online resources and scientific publications; and 3) establish genealogical relationships between groups of water mites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of the project will contribute in-depth understanding of water mite biology and evolution, modernize the taxonomic process, disseminate results and interactive tools to a wide audience online through a project website and train a new generation of experts. Additionally, outreach efforts will enhance the public's understanding of a part of the natural world few think about (mites) through workshops and presentations held in national parks. Lastly, the comprehensive knowledge on torrenticolids of North America will allow cross-disciplinary use of these mites in other research programs, such as those focusing on aquatic community dynamics, biodiversity and water quality bio-monitoring, all of which could have impacts on conservation status and trends in freshwater habitats.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There are currently more than 6,000 species of water mites, representing more than 400 genera, known worldwide. They are among the most numerous, diverse, ecologically important - and unknown - groups of arthropods in freshwater ecosystems. Water mites influence reproductive output and survival of insect hosts, and studies on feeding rates indicate that water mites significantly influence the size and structure of host populations. Water chemistry and pollution ecology studies in Europe have also shown that water mites are exceptionally sensitive indicators of habitat quality. However, because so little is known about their diversity, water mites are rarely included in freshwater biodiversity inventories, biogeographic studies, assessments of water quality, or evaluations of conservation status. Most water mite species remain unnamed and few comprehensive diagnostic tools exist, rendering the group inaccessible to all but the few specialists. This problem is of great importance because acarology (the study of mites) will not progress if hypotheses cannot be tested, and the continued exclusion of mites from interdisciplinary studies will leave major gaps in our understanding of aquatic systems. Overall, this problem is due to the lack of water mite specialists, compounded by the steady loss of experts to retirement. At the start of this project, there were only two active water mite taxonomists in the US and Canada. Thus, the long-term<em> </em>goal of this project was to train a sufficient number of new water mite specialists and in doing so, advance the knowledge of water mite diversity to a point where these mites are recognized as integral to interdisciplinary research in aquatic systems.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In this project, three graduate students (2 PhD and 1 MS) and one undergraduate student were trained specifically in water mite systematics. The students undertook studies focused on revising the family Torrenticolidae in North America north of Mexico. This family of water mites is the most diverse and commonly collected water mite families in North American fast-flowing streams (i.e., think of clear, cool running mountain streams) and represented an obvious starting point for producing research that could benefit other researchers like stream ecologists. &nbsp;All students conducted fieldwork in streams around the US, including large expeditions to the northern Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest, California mountain ranges, and Alaska. The students supplemented their collections with water mite collections housed in the Canadian National Collection, representing collection events from across the US and Canada made during the last 100 years. Tens of thousands of specimens were examined and in the end, 102 new species were described and 34 known species re-described by the students. Keys to all known species of Torrenticolidae in the US and Canada were developed so other researchers could easily identify specimens found in their stream study systems. As a result of dealing with large numbers of new-to-science species, protocols were developed to increase the rate of species determination and description, which will be useful with future taxonomic work since there are still thousands of new water mite species awaiting discovery. Lastly, students developed phylogenetic trees (branching diagrams representing the evolutionary history of the group) for their projects based upon genetic data. These were used to develop species concepts and give us a better understanding about the evolution of water mites in the US and Canada.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to the products developed by the students in their thesis research, our research group developed an online bibliography to the more than 5,000 papers published on water mites and made this available to all researchers. We have also put more than 12,000 water mite collection events by US and Canadian researchers from the last 100 years into an online database. This includes data on more than 100,000 specimens from those collection events, contributing to a greater understanding of US biodiversity. As a final note to the importance of training new specialists, during the course of the project, one of the two active water mite specialists unexpectedly passed away and the other retired from research. Without funding for this project, we would find ourselves in a position of having no water mite specialists active in North America and no one to train future generations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/01/2019<br>      Modified by: Ashley&nbsp;P&nbsp;Dowling</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1134868/1134868_10123514_1554149904545_Figure1resize--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1134868/1134868_10123514_1554149904545_Figure1resize--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Some Torrenticola from Arkansas"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1134868/1134868_10123514_1554149904545_Figure1resize--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Some Torrenticola from Arkansas"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Diversity of Torrenticola in Ouachita National Forest, Arkansas.</div> <div class="imageCredit">J.R.
