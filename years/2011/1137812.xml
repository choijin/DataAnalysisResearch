<AbstractNarration>The U.S. GEOTRACES North Atlantic zonal section cruise was scheduled for 15 October through 5 December 2010.  Because of a major irresolvable mechanical failure of the ship's propulsion system, the expedition had to be terminated in the Cape Verde Islands on 4 November after completing about one third of the planned track.  This required on-the-spot changes in return travel for all sea-going investigators as well as in shipping arrangements for all their samples and equipment.  The funds requested in this proposal address the PI's need to cover travel and shipping cost associated with his participation in the continuation of the North Atlantic section cruise scheduled for autumn 2011. The travel costs would ensure that two people can participate in the second cruise, as well as for one person to travel to Woods Hole to demobilize the ship upon its return to port.  Shipping costs are needed to get a shipboard container with analytical instrumentation, a CTD, and GO-FLO bottles to the ship and back to the University of Hawaii.  Completing the analysis of dissolved Fe, Al, Cd, Mn, and Zn recovered from different oceanographic regimes of the North Atlantic Ocean would significantly further our understanding of the biogeochemical cycles of these elements in the marine environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding for the logistical support to participate in the replacement US GEOTRACES N Atlantic cruise in November, 2011, allowed us to mount our shipboard trace element program and fully participate in this cruise.  The results of this work are still in the process of being corrected by shore-based determinations of our co PI in Miami.  Initial results from the shipboard dissolved aluminium work that can be used to calculate mineral dust deposition to the ocean, show that there is greater amount of dust deposition in the western Atlantic compared to the eastern Atlantic.  This is somewhat surprising given that the major source of mineral dust to the Atlantic Ocean is the Saharan desert on the eastern border of the Atlantic Ocean.  It is believed that the cause of this apparent reversal in the expected gradient is because significant amounts of the dust that leave the African coast are carried across the Atlantic Ocean well above the marine boundary layer, and are thus not deposited in the ocean.  When this material reaches the western side of the Atlantic significant amounts of this dust descend into the marine boundary layer through atmospheric high pressure systems and are carried back across the Atlantic in the westerly winds.  During this reverse transect this dust, now in the marine boundary layer, is progressively deposited into the surface ocean resulting in a gradient of high deposition in the west, and lower deposition in the east.
