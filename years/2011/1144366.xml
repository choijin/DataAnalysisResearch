<AbstractNarration>This award will support Quantum Information Processing Workshop to be held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on December 12-16, 2011, at the Mathematics Research Center at the University of Montreal. More detailed conference information for QIP 2012 may be found at http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Quantum2011/. This workshop is the central event in the area of Quantum Computing and, more generally, Quantum Information Science. It is expected that QIP will bring together about 300 leading researchers in theoretical aspects of quantum information and computation, and play a role as one of the most important venues for the groundbreaking research in theoretical computer science. NSF support will help broaden participation at the QIP Workshop by subsidizing the travel for participants who might not otherwise attend QIP, and assist with the venue costs. Organizers aim at increasing the number of student and postdoctoral participants from the under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Overview:  QIP is an annual conference about quantum computation and information, usually held in January. Its goal is to represent the preceding year's best research in the area, in the form of both invited and contributed talks. To be able to also represent work already published elsewhere, the conference has no published proceedings itself.  The goal of the travel grant is to allow U.S. graduate students to attend the conference.       Results:  The original travel grant consisted of $20,000 to be used for two parts:  half for the QIP 2012 conference venue fees and half for graduate student and postdoc travel.  After QIP 2012, the grant had a balance of $2073.07 to be used for graduate student travel for QIP 2013.  The remaining funds were used to allow two graduate students to attend QIP 2013, held on 21-25 January 2013, at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.       Training and Professional Development:  Training young scientists will improve the quality of American science.  There is no substitute for attending the top conference in our field and meeting many of the top scientists in the area.  Supporting the QIP conference is also helpful in maintaining the community of quantum computing theorists.  Our field is young and does not have the professional societies like ACM and APS that computer scientists and physicists have.  The QIP committees (steering, program, and local organizing) are one of the few formal structures within the community of quantum information/computing theorists, and are a good candidate for nucleating additional activities in the future.       Websites:  Information about past and present QIP conferences can be found at http://qipconference.org.  Information about student travel grants are on each of the conference website main pages.  Information about QIP 2012 can be found at http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~qip2012.  Information about QIP 2013 can be found at http://conference.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/QIP2013/index.html.       Impact:  The conference contained most of the top results in the field from the past two years; see http://qipconference.org for a list.  Even the poster session contained many results that were as strong as those found in the next tier of quantum conferences (AQIS, TQC).  Additionally, the individuals selected for travel grants were at a range of different stages in their career, but almost all had made significant contributions to the conference, and to the field of quantum computing more generally.
