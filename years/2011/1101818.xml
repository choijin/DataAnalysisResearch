<AbstractNarration>This grant supports research that seeks to answer a fundamental question about matter. What is the nature of any new physics not described by the Standard Model of electroweak physics? This question will be addressed by the Qweak experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF). It will measure the proton's neutral weak charge via parity-violating electron scattering at very low momentum transfer. The proton's weak charge has a well-defined prediction in the Standard Model; a precise measurement of it is sensitive to many popular scenarios for extending the Standard Model. Our group has built and installed three hardware systems for the experiment - a set of horizontal drift chambers, a set of luminosity monitors, and halo and low beam current monitoring detectors.  During the period of this grant, we will maintain our hardware systems during data taking, analyze data, and extract physics results.  We will also begin work on a newly approved TJNAF experiment to test the Standard Model - the MOLLER experiment - a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons.  The projects we are working on involve a wide range of hardware and software tasks that will contribute to the education of graduate and undergraduate students working on the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work supported by this grant contributed to the first measurement of the proton's weak charge.  The proton's weak charge sets the strength of one form of its interaction with the Z-boson, which is the neutral carrier of the weak force.  It is analagous to the ordinary electric charge which determines the strength of the interaction with the photon that is the carrier of the electromagnetic force.  The proton's weak charge was extracted by measuring the small difference in the scattering rate of two states of polarized electrons from the proton - a technique referred to as parity-violating electron scattering.  The measurement (the Qweak experiment) was carried out using the CEBAF accelerator at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility during large parts of the 2010-2012 period.  The experiment used a very high current polarized electron beam scattering from the world's highest power liquid hydrogen target.   Comparison of this first measurement of the proton's weak charge with the prediction of the Standard Model show good agreement.  One way of indicating this is shown in the attached figure which compares various determinations of the "weak mixing angle" (including the one obtained from this measurement) with the Standard Model prediction.  Any signifcant deviation from the Standard Model prediction could be interpreted as "new physics" that is beyond the currently understood theory.  Our intially published result only represented about 4% of the total data obtained.  The ongoing analysis of the full data set will result in a much higher precision result, as shown in the figure.  This precision will allow us to probe for new physics at mass scales in the multi-TeV range.  The work of our group during this funding period included participating in the data-taking for the Qweak experiment, maintaining the hardware that our group constructed (luminosity monitors, halo monitors, and horizontal drift chambers), and various analyses of the resulting data.  We also worked on continued development of a new experiment proposed for Jefferson Lab (the MOLLER experiment) that will make a very precise measurement of the electron's weak charge by parity-violating scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons.  This measurement would provide a complementary search for physics beyond the Standard Model.  During the period of this grant, one PhD thesis was completed.  Four PhD students and four undergraduate students received training in a variety of techniques in experimental nuclear physics while conducting research for these projects.
