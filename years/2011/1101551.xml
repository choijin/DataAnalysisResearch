<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "Waves and Spectra: Analysis/PDE Conference" that will be held from January 11-14, 2011, on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will cover a variety of topics in analysis (e.g., mathematical physics, dynamical systems, spectral theory), with partial differential equations serving as a key unifying theme. All of the conference topics are central to analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.</AbstractNarration>
