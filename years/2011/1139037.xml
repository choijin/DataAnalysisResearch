<AbstractNarration>1139037&lt;br/&gt;Yeung&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turbulent fluid flows occurring in many fields of science and engineering are characterized by the complexities of fluctuations over a wide range of scales, to the extent that  their detailed computation is a premier challenge worthy of the use of world-class computational resources. The core objectives of this project are to pursue intensive efforts both computationally and scientifically to ensure successful conduct of a massive investigation of mixing and dispersion in turbulent flow, at a new world-record level of resolution on a new machine of true sustained Petascale capability. The targeted simulation will reach a resolution of 8192-cube (more than half a trillion) grid points and a Reynolds number which exceeds most laboratory experiments. In order to succeed, there are intellectual challenges to be overcome in pursuing the intricacies of several emerging new computational paradigms, including hybrid multi-cored programming and overlap between computation and interprocessor communication subject to the logic of the numerical methods employed as well as characteristics of the new machine hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conduct of the simulations and subsequent data analyses at Reynolds number higher than ever achieved before will enable important progress in the study of intermittency of turbulent fluctuations and the effect of these fluctuations on many aspects of turbulent mixing and dispersion. Strategies for code development and exploration of new programming models for the full simulation code on the future NSF Track 1 Petascale machine carry inherent risk, because of the massive size of the system whose characteristics are not fully known or determined at this time. However the urgency for supporting code development is great since the machine is scheduled to become available in 2012 and CPU hours will be in great demand from a number of research teams pre-approved by NSF. Results from the simulations and consequent unprecedented massive database are expected to draw interest from the turbulence community worldwide and be of interest in many problems of societal concern, including the efficiency of combustion devices and the dispersion of pollutants in the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To maximize the scientific impact of this work the challenges of making large datasets better maintained and more readily accessible will be be addressed via services provided by major supercomputer centers. This work will also provide a unique training opportunity for a graduate student of high caliber, echoing the success of prior joint mentoring activities by both investigators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this EAGER project a research group at Georgia Tech in the field of studies of turbulent fluid flow was able to investigate the use of several distinct programming models in turbulence while continuing to make new contributions to understanding turbulence, including the physics of high molecular diffusivity for which little data are available in the literature.  The primary outcome is that a high degree of computational readiness for the Blue Waters NSF Track 1 Petascale supercomputer has been achieved, through a code that is observed to scale well up to a quarter million CPU cores to date. This development represents significant intellectual merit in addressing the challenge of the communication-intensive nature of the numerical method chosen in multi-dimensional space.  A secondary outcome is in sustained progress in understanding the intermittency of small-scale turbulence, which is often characterized by high-intensity events that are highly localized in space, and in understanding the nature of mixing in the regime of high  molecular diffusivity.  Visualization techniques provide strong support for prior statistical results which suggest that at high Reynolds number locations of most intense local deformation and local rotation of fluid elements tend to occur together. Studies of mixing at high diffusivity provided the first rigorous tests of well-known classical theories and show that a narrower range of scales makes many aspects different from mixing in classical parameter regimes.     By enabling simulations at higher resolution that have not been feasible before, research in this project is expected to have strong impact on future studies of turbulence on ever-larger and faster supercomputers that are yet to come.  Because of the importance and widespread occurrence of turbulence, insights derived from new simulations on Blue Waters and beyond will also be relevant to a wide range of disciplines in science and engineering.  The challenge posed by communication-intensive codes has provided much impetus for effort from the research team  and from supercomputer consultants on  various strategies to produce improved performance.  Broader impacts of this work also include great opportunities for graduate students who are inspired in part by being  exposed to a supercomputing on a very large scale, well beyond the case typical for most of their peers. The element of risk appropriate for EAGER proposals has been addressed sucessfully, since concrete improvements in algorithmic performance have been achieved even as some approaches tested had turned out to be ineffective.
