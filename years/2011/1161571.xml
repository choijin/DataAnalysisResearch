<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education in the field of quantum magnetism. Research is focused on collective quantum effects, entanglement and decoherence in nanomagnetic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main thrusts include:&lt;br/&gt;1) Collective quantum effects in molecular magnets, such as propagating fronts of spin tunneling, electromagnetic and acoustic superradiance. The PIs will use the idea of self-organization of the dipolar field to study these systems. Self-organization provides a resonance condition for spin levels in a large volume of the crystal regardless of disorder. It can lead to coherent radiation of photons and phonons by a macroscopic number of magnetic molecules. A model of dipolar field self-organization recently developed by the PIs will be extended to describe this effect in bulk crystals of molecular magnets. The possibility of photon and phonon superradiance generated by propagating spin-tunneling fronts will be investigated. Theoretical and related experimental research will interact closely to investigate spin-tunneling fronts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2)  Coherent states and decoherence of spins coupled to mechanical nanoresonators. The PIs will study the entanglement and decoherence of spins by analytical and numerical methods within a fundamental microscopic model of spin-lattice interaction. The role of geometry will be elucidated and the effects of nuclear spins will be investigated. This research will address the quality factor of small resonators, as well as the prospect of using spins coupled to nanoresonators as qubits and ultra-sensitive magneto-mechanical probes. Entanglement of quantum spin states with coherent phonon states of an elastic solid, dictated by the conservation of angular momentum, will be investigated. This research will advance understanding of  the limits of spin sensors and nanomechanical actuators, as well as the role of conservation laws in decoherence of spin-based qubits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral, undergraduate, and high-school students, including women and minorities, will be involved in the research. The Nanomagnetism Group at CUNY Lehman College collaborates with researchers in the U.S. and abroad, organizes workshops on nanomagnetism, and participates in the community outreach by maintaining contacts with local schools.  Young researchers seeking careers in industry and academia will be trained in traditional and modern magnetism, as well computational methods. Students associated with the group will acquire cross-cultural experiences through international symposia organized by the Nanomagnetism Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education on magnetism with an emphasis on the role of quantum mechanical effects and on magnetic systems and magnetic phenomena which involve a length scale of the size of large molecules, nanomagnetic systems. It is focused on collective quantum effects and spin relaxation in nanomagnetic systems. The two main directions of the research are collective quantum effects in spin systems and quantum dynamics of nano-mechanical systems containing spins. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Studies of collective acoustic and electromagnetic relaxation in molecular magnets will explore recent ideas of principal investigators on self-organized moving fronts of spin tunneling and relaxation.  Analytical and numerical work, partially based on methods of laser physics, will be peformed to understand collective quantum effects in spin systems. This research may influence other areas of physics that deal with the two-level systems. It will help understand spin relaxation rates in paramagnets, as well as the prospect of obtaining coherent sub-Terahertz radiation from crystals of molecular magnets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic relaxation and decoherence due to spin-orbit effects in solids is among most fundamental, largely unsolved, problems of condensed matter theory.  They are related to such important applications of spin physics as magnetic resonance, magnetic recording, spintronics, quantum computing, and nanomechanical actuators.  Progress made in manufacturing and measurements of individual nanomagnets has ignited novel interest to this set of problems. They will be studied via analytical and numerical models involving realistic magneto-mechanical coupling that accounts for the conservation of the total angular momentum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral, undergraduate, and high-school students, including women and minorities, will be involved in the research. The Nanomagnetism Group at CUNY Lehman College collaborates with researchers in the U.S. and abroad, organizes workshops on nanomagnetism, and participates in the community outreach by maintaining contacts with local schools.  Young researchers seeking careers in industry and academia will be trained in traditional and modern magnetism, as well computational methods.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantum models of nanoactuators containing spins have been developed that provide theoretical framework for manufacturing sensitive probes at the atomic level. Explanation has been given to recent cutting-edge experiments on magnetic molecules crafted on carbon nanotubes. Mechanical forces originating from quantum tunneling of the magnetic moment have been introduced.     Self-organized turbulent fronts of quantum magnetic deflagration and detonation in molecular magnets have been studied numerically (see image) in connection with recent experiments on magnetic avalanches. It has been demonstrated that turbulence of the deflagration front develops as an intrinsic property of the avalanche. Conditions have been found that are necessary for a subsonic deflagration front to develop into a supersonic detonation.     Nanoelectromechanical devices have been suggested (see image) that explore mechanical degrees of freedom of a nanomagnet for more effective switching of its magnetization by spin-polarized currents and electric fields. A new switching concept has been proposed that explores the equivalence of high-frequency rotational oscillations and the high-frequency ac magnetic field in the coordinate frame of the magnet. Switching phase diagrams have been obtained using NSF funded CUNY supercomputer facilities.     Quantum theory of angular momentum of the elastic system has been developed. Transfer of angular momentum from atomic spins to the rotation of a mechanical system has been studied using the concept of a phonon spin. It has been demonstrated that the division of the angular momentum of quantized sound into orbital and spin parts provides useful method for the analysis of the conservation of angular momentum and for understanding microscopic mechanisms of the Einstein &ndash; de Haas effect.     The work on the project has resulted so far in 11 published research articles, 2 book chapters, and two papers submitted for publication.     Intellectual merit of our work: Our modeling of quantum spin dynamics at the nanoscale advances the field of spintronics and helps miniaturize information processing based upon magnetic memory. It addresses fundamental questions that are important for quantum computing with spins. Reversible studies of magnetic avalanches help understand processes of slow burning and detonation. Nanomechanical resonators have various applications in atomic force microscopy and in micro- and nanoelectromechanical devices for biological chemical detection and homeland security.
