<AbstractNarration>The Ocean's biomass and diversity are predominantly microbial, yet this aspect of diversity remains underexplored. Efforts in recent years have begun to document microbial diversity in marine systems, and to elucidate the processes that structure assemblages across space and time. This project focuses on two important sister clades of microbial eukaryotes, the oligotrich and choreotrich ciliates. These organisms comprise a major component of planktonic food webs as they graze on phytoplankton, and are in turn eaten by zooplankton and larval fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earlier molecular work on ciliate diversity relied on light microscopy, construction of clone libraries and Sanger sequencing. This revealed a high degree of cryptic diversity (similar species that are genetically distinct), which is surprising, given the long-held idea that all microbes are globally distributed and that few species exist, at least as compared to animals and plants. This past work also showed that ciliate assemblages contain a few highly abundant forms and many rare ones, consistent with the concept of a "rare biosphere". However, these methods are limited by high costs of both labor and materials, so that efforts to sample any local assemblage comprehensively usually resulted in undersaturation (repeated sampling continued to uncover new species). Next generation approaches are needed to truly assess the depths of biodiversity in planktonic ciliates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together investigators with strengths in ecology, taxonomy and oceanography (PI McManus) and in molecular evolution, systematics and bioinformatics (PI Katz). Pyrosequencing will be used to sample the oligotrichs and choreotrichs "to exhaustion" in coastal environments. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), a technique that generates a fingerprint of the diversity in a sample, will be used to pre-select samples for pyrosequencing based on where strong gradients are observed in the composition of assemblages in relation to environmental factors (density fronts, thermoclines, etc.). Using these approaches, combined with an informatics pipeline already in place, this project addresses three specific objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1. Determine the spatial scale of variability in ciliate diversity by measuring how ciliate assemblages change over meter, kilometer, 100 km, and basin scales.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2. Assess the contributions of different size classes of ciliates to overall assemblage diversity.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 3. Experimentally evaluate factors that control the temporal shift of individual species from rarity to commonness in a natural assemblage, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: A program to involve K-12 teachers in research, initiated under a previous award, will be continued. For the past three years, teachers have been hosted at the UConn marine labs, where they conducted independent research, learned to sample and enumerate plankton, and developed teaching resources for subsequent use in the classroom. In this project the program will be adapted to accommodate the shorter, more intense experiences most teachers prefer, and to incorporate an instructional component in broader marine sciences.  In addition to the teacher program, this project will involve training of postdoctoral fellows and undergraduates. This will include cross-disciplinary work through exchanges between the PI laboratories, with a focus on experimental design, data collection/analysis, and manuscript preparation. Both PIs are committed to involving students from underrepresented groups in their research, and PI Katz maintains intensive recruiting efforts in this area. Hence, the project will further increase the diversity of researchers studying biological oceanography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our objectives for this project were to apply molecular tools (DNA-based analyses) to understand the distribution of certain kinds of microorganisms (ciliated protozoa) in the ocean.  We know that these single-celled organisms are widespread and play important roles in the ocean's food web, but we do not know how different species vary in their distributions over space and time.  Because of difficulties in identifying them, we do not even know how many kinds of these creatures exist in the world.  Using DNA sequences in conjunction with traditional microscopy, we first made a short cruise in Fisher's Island Sound, USA, and evaluated how distributions of different species correlated with tidal currents and vertical layering in the water caused by temperature differences.  We found that although clear patterns were difficult to discern, the influence of freshwater on mixing seemed to be important; and we found that our molecular methods could be used successfully in the field.  Following the short cruise, we made a longer expedition beyond the edge of the continental shelf south of Montauk on the RV Cape Hatteras.  On this longer cruise, we were able to sample over a much greater scale, sampling throughout the water at 39 stations.  One surprising result was that a small goup of about six species was found in the majority of samples over a scale of more than 150 km.  These six were joined by a further group of four species that were only found in the offshore samples.  Even more surprising, these common ciliates were found even in very deep waters, far from the sunlit waters where they were presumed to live.  We have recently been using a more detailed molecular technique called Illumina MiSeq to look into these distributions in the same samples in more detail.  One other interesting outcome of this research is that the DNA-based methods allowed us to sample much more comprehensively than traditional microsocpy and this allows us to be much more confident that we have sampled all or nearly all the species present in an area, even ones that would be too rare to observe by microscopy.  The results suggest that individual species are ubiquitous in the ocean with very few limits on their dispersal.  For example, on samples from a single day in Long Island Sound, we found sequences identical to about 8% of all those recorded for this group of plankton in the public database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).  For comparison, if 8% of all the world's bird species were present in one day in a single area (e.g. Central Park in New York), that would be about 800 different birds!  In the history of bird watcing in Central Park, which opened in 1859, a total of 275 species have ever been observed.  We conclude from this that microbes are much more widely distributed around the world ocean, compared to larger organisms, with minimal likelihood of geograpic isolation.  In addition to the cruise results, we have performed some preliminary experiments to determine what factors (predators, food availability, temperature, ocean pH. etc.) are most important in determining what species will be present in a given area.  By isolating samples in sea tables and subjecting them to changes in these factors, we can examine them under controlled conditions and see how they change.  So far, it seems that predation and food availabilty are the most important factors, but we are continuing this line of inquiry.  To ensure that this research has broader impacts in society beyond its intellectual merit, we have been engaged in public outreach to describe our work in coursework, graduate training, teacher workshops and through public lectures at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Sea Education Association and other venues.
