<AbstractNarration>Energy sustainability is a theme of national and worldwide importance. Smart-Grid environments are focused on creating and using information and communication technologies to support new and potentially more sustainable ways of producing, transmitting, distributing, and consuming electricity.  This project focuses on creating a socio-computational system that enables citizens to make informed choices about their energy consumption, share their decisions with others and visualize the consequences of their own actions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New social-computational systems are needed to facilitate this sort of citizen engagement with the energy economy because (1) most citizens are unaware of these new technological developments; (2) information presentation is poorly designed; and (3) the social context of individual energy use is ignored resulting in few social interactions and collaborations. All of these challenges lie at the intersection of human behavior (both individual and social levels) and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The two overarching goals of this project are (a) the creation of transformative theoretical frameworks for understanding social-computational foundations for these settings, making our methodologies, components, architectures, requirements, and guidelines applicable to a large number of other social-computational systems (for example, smart cities and health-care) and (b) the development of human-centered systems for fostering smart communities in Smart-Grid environments that will turn passive consumers of energy into informed, active decision makers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The project will lead to new tools and strategies to increase the use of Smart-Grid technologies, thereby reducing overall national energy usage and dependence on foreign energy sources.  In addition, the project will make strides in including and supporting the ability of marginal and underrepresented populations to use these technologies, thereby avoiding a digital-energy divide. The Principle Investigators are working with the El Pueblo MÃ¡gico after-school effort at Sanchez Elementary School in Lafayette, Colorado, to engage students and their families in fostering energy awareness and responsibility, providing broader views on end-user energy concerns.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "Theoretical Frameworks and Socio-Technical Systems for Fostering Smart Communities in Smart Grid Environments" addressed the following themes:     Overview of the Project  To reduce energy consumption to sustainable levels, people need to start changing their behaviors and use energy more efficiently. The challenges of harvesting the benefits of technical innovations such as the Smart Grid (the next generation of the electrical grid that gathers, distributes, and acts on data from all participants) are numerous and are grounded in the intersection of human behavior (at the individual and social levels) and technology. The Center for LifeLong Learning &amp; Design (L3D) developed theoretical frameworks and systems to analyze the opportunities and requirements unique to this intersection and to help people to save energy through cultures of participation and meta-design environments.     Theoretical Frameworks for the Project  Cultures of participation provide the means for every person to migrate from a passive consumer to an active contributor. Meta-Design allows users to become active in the design and evolution of their environments. In the energy domain, both approaches are needed as most people are currently passive consumers without knowledge of or interest in their electrical energy environment.     Socio-Technical System Developments for the Project  L3D developed EMPIRE (Empowering People in Reducing Energy Consumption), a socio-technical energy feedback system, based on novel theoretical frameworks taking into consideration models of behavior change and energy usage. It used existing software and hardware infrastructure from the Smart Grid and used this data to create a culture of participation around energy usage, facilitating effects such as Social Norms and Social Proof.     Evaluation of the Project  EMPIRE was evaluated in long-term controlled studies. 20 students living in CU dorms used EMPIRE for the length of a semester while 20 students in the same buildings used a control system without support for cultures of participation and meta-design. In addition to the quantitative energy consumption data, qualitative data was collected and analyzed about how the system changes people?s behaviors towards energy.
