<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to bring together representatives of the different sectors (industry, science, regulators, and environmentalists) in a workshop that will address the environmental and social effects of hydraulic fracturing and gas drilling. An interdisciplinary workshop at Duke University is proposed to capture different environmental and social aspects and the scientific, legal, and socio-economic components related to gas extraction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will address key environmental and social issues related to hydraulic fracturing, including 1) the water-energy nexus (how much water is needed and where water availability could limit hydraulic fracturing), 2) disposal (what are the scientific factors that limit the disposal of toxic and radioactive produced water to the environment), 3) direct environmental impacts (how the different environmental effects could be avoided, mitigated, and regulated), and 4) socio-economic effects (how will the expansion of natural gas exploration via hydraulic fracturing influence U.S. energy security and affect other potential options for energy diversification, including renewable forms of energy, and what will be the socio-economic impacts on the communities in the surrounding areas of gas production?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the magnitude of hydraulic fracturing and gas drilling in the U.S., significant public interest is expected from this proposed workshop. Outcomes from this workshop will include publications of the presentations in the workshop in both professional journals and the public. The dissemination of this interdisciplinary dialogue will be also published on a web site designed specifically for the proposed workshop. Finally, the results of the workshop should help engage stakeholders and policymakers in discussions about the results and context for the conclusions reached at the meeting, including holding at least one information session or briefing in Washington, D.C.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advances in drilling technologies and production strategies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (HF) have significantly improved the production of natural gas by stimulating the flow of gas and liquidsto and from wells.  These technological improvements have increased oil and gas drilling across the United States. While the new horizontal drilling and HF technologies and associated gas exploitation are dramatically changing the energy landscape in the U.S., new research is highlighting the need to make shale-gas extraction as sustainable as possible.  Duke University scientists were first to show evidences of methane contamination in shallow drinking-water wells associated with distance to nearest gas wells in northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York (Osborn et al. 2011, paper published in Proceedings of National Academy of Science). In 2011, the National Science Foundation provided a grant to professors Avner Vengosh, Robert Jackson, and Erika Weinthal from the Nicholas School of Environment at Duke University (EAR, Division of Earth Sciences, Emerging topics #1137904. Environmental and social implications of hydraulic fracturing and gas drilling in the United States: An integrative science and policy workshop, $45,538, 08/15/2011&ndash;08/14/2012) to conduct a workshop on the environmental and social implications of hydraulic fracturing and gas drilling in the United States. With additional support from the Nicholas School of Environment at Duke University, DukeÆs Center on Global Change, and the Duke Environmental Law &amp; Policy Forum from Duke Law School, on January 9&ndash;10, 2012, Duke University brought together hydraulic fracturing experts from industry, science, academia, law, federal agencies, regulators, and the environmental sector, to address the scientific, economic, environmental, legal, and socio-economic effects of hydraulic fracturing or shale gas drilling in the United States. Entitled: Environmental and Social Implications of Hydraulic Fracturing and Gas Drilling in the United States: An Integrative Workshop for the Evaluation of the State of Science and Policy, the purpose of the workshop was threefold: (1) to provide a forum for meaningful dialogue between experts on the various issues involving hydraulic fracturing; (2) to provide the public with an opportunity to learn more about hydraulic fracturing from recognized experts; and (3) to advance the academic, scientific, and legal discourse surrounding hydraulic fracturing by compiling a report summarizing the information shared and gained at the workshop.

The public session was held in a large auditorium at Duke University and speakers discussed shale gas development and hydraulic fracturing in three panels: (1) An Overview on Shale Gas Development, (2) Major Scientific Results, and (3) the Legal and Socio-Economic Setting. The first panel included an overview of energy outlook and trends, a presentation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency discussing their upcoming study on hydraulic fracturing, and a presentation on leakage concerns in the natural gas supply chain and how releases of methane from hydraulic fracturing could impact global warming. The second panel provided a summary of major scientific findings regarding potential water contamination from shale gas production, the possible greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas, and the management of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
