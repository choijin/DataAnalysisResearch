<AbstractNarration>This award by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supports work by Professor Kristina Håkansson at the University of Michigan to explore the mechanism and improve the analytical utility of negative ion electron capture dissociation (niECD), a novel tandem mass spectrometry technique recently discovered in the PI's laboratory.  The goal of this research is to further examine the counter-intuitive process of niECD, which results in charge-increased rather than the typical charge-decreased species in other ion-electron reactions.  Further development of niECD will allow access to novel means for detailed structural characterization of important low-level acidic biomacromolecules such as phospho- and sulfopeptides, intact acidic proteins, and RNA-small molecule complexes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational goals of this work include training of graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment as well as participation in a K-12 Summer Program "Girls in Science and Engineering" offered by the University of Michigan's Women in Science and Engineering Program.  The latter activities are aimed at boosting an interest in the scientific method at a young age through the discovery that the contents of a box can be elucidated without opening it.  The broader impact of the research includes introduction of novel technology for biomolecular structural characterization with important implications for drug discovery and an enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of living organisms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fundamental and Mechanistic Studies of Negative Ion Electron Capture Dissociation (niECD)  CHE-1152531  This award by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supported work by Professor Kristina H&aring;kansson at the University of Michigan to explore the mechanism and improve the analytical utility of negative ion electron capture dissociation (niECD), a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technique discovered in Professor H&aring;kanssonÆs laboratory.  MS/MS methods involve activation and dissociation of analytes of interest inside a mass spectrometer to yield structural information.  niECD is unique among MS/MS methods as it adds charge to negatively charged ions, thus increasing the overall negative charge.  This characteristic is advantageous because product ion detection efficiency is proportional to charge.  Therefore niECD can yield efficiencies above 100%.  Furthermore, niECD cleaves peptide bonds in a highly informative manner and is compatible with analytes carrying only one charge.  The latter characteristic is not true for related ion-electron reactions that involve positively charged ions.    The goal of the research was to further examine the counter-intuitive process of niECD to allow broader access to this novel means for detailed structural characterization of important low-level acidic biomacromolecules such as phospho- and sulfopeptides, intact acidic proteins, and RNA-small molecule complexes.  We found that the number of acidic sites in a peptide is more important than the number of basic sites and that zwitterionic structures are required for niECD to proceed.  We expanded niECD to glycosylated peptides, which often carry acidic sugar modifications and thus benefit from negative ion mode analysis.  The labile nature of glycosidic bonds also is circumvented through the radical ion chemistry involved in niECD, thus allowing the location of such modifications to be determined.  Finally, ion mobility separation combined with MS was utilized to examine which solvent conditions favor transfer of biologically relevant RNA structures into the gas phase as negative ions.  Such information is essential for utilizing niECD in RNA characterization.    The educational goals of this work included training of graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment as well as participation in a K-12 Summer Program "Girls in Science and Engineering" offered by the University of MichiganÆs Women in Science and Engineering Program.  One Ph.D. degree that was entirely based on this project was awarded as well as a second, partially based on this project.  An additional five graduate as well as two undergraduate students were involved in the work.  The K-12 activities were aimed at boosting an interest in the scientific method at a young age through the discovery that the contents of a box can be elucidated without opening it.  The broader impact of the research includes introduction of novel technology for biomolecular structural characterization with important implications for drug discovery and an enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of living organisms.
