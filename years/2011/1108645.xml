<AbstractNarration>This award will support an observational program to learn about mass loss in the late stages of evolution of intermediate-mass stars, especially those in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of evolution.  The project focuses on three main questions: (1) how each generation of stars returns nuclear-processed and unprocessed material to the interstellar medium; (2) how much dust is produced in the winds from cool, luminous giants; and (3) how mass loss depends on the chemical abundances of the parent stars.  The first phases of observations will be conducted in the near-infrared, with later follow-up observations on the new Atacama Large Millimetre-submillimetre Array (ALMA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of dying stars has many implications for stellar evolution, galactic astronomy, and nucleosynthesis.  Undergraduate students will participate in all stages of the project.</AbstractNarration>
