<AbstractNarration>This grant will enable the exploration of a new science-based technology for a novel continuous process enabling the reprocessing of crosslinked polyethylene, a material used extensively today in products such as plastic bags, hot and cold water pipes, wire and cable insulation, storage tanks and many injection molded parts. Most crosslinked materials cannot be reprocessed because the network molecular structure that gives them such attractive properties is very difficult to decrosslink without destroying the polymer. In fact, today most of these discarded products are simply burned for their limited caloric value. These novel ultrasonically aided extrusion processes have the potential to produce material of sufficient quality and integrity to enable it to be reprocessed into new products. The research team will study the ultrasonic extrusion and fabrication, as well as the structure and properties of the decrosslinked polyethylene materials and will establish the process models and identify the mechanisms allowing for the prediction of the optimal conditions of ultrasonic processing and scale up of the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to the manufacture of new materials and products from waste crosslinked polyethylenes for use in many of the same applications. The societal impact would be a significant solid waste reduction in landfills. The theoretical modeling and computer simulations of the ultrasonic treatment of these crosslinked polyethylenes will contribute to the optimization of the process and design of new ultrasonic extruders. The technology could also be applicable to a broader class of crosslinked polymers beyond polyethylene.</AbstractNarration>

Among various polymer wastes, management of crosslinked plastics is a major environmental problem requiring a solution. High density polyethylene (HDPE) is typically used for rotational and blow molding of various storage tanks, extrusion of films and sheets, wire and cable insulation, pipes and conduits and injection molding of various products. Almost all linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) is used for making films and sheets with smaller amounts for making products by injection molding. Over half of low density polyethylene (LDPE) is used for extrusion of films and sheets and coating of wire and cable and smaller quantities for injection molding. In manufacturing storage tanks, wire and cable insulation and many films, hot and cold water pipes, PE is typically crosslinked by vinyl silane, peroxide and radiation. Crosslinking of PEs offers excellent environmental stress crack resistance, very good low-temperature impact strength and good heat resistance. Uncrosslinked thermoplastics can be easily reprocessed and reused. However, managing crosslinked plastics is a very challenging problem. This is due to the presence of crosslinks, a three-dimensional network, which prevents flow and shaping of crosslinked plastics upon heating and shearing. The study carried out in this project was specifically directed toward the creation of a new, environmentally friendly and science-based technology for the recycling of crosslinked plastics.
