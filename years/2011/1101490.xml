<AbstractNarration>This project will use Banach space theory to investigate some problems that are motivated by applications to data compression. It will improve the recent explicit constructions of matrices with the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) so as to match  more closely the optimal efficiency of  probabilistic constructions.   RIP matrices are used in compressed sensing to reconstruct a sparse signal by a measurements vector of much  smaller dimension  than that  of the signal. A vector contained in a Banach space can be approximated by finite expressions involving the elements of a basis or a redundant dictionary such as a frame. Typically these approximants are selected by a greedy algorithm such as the X greedy Algorithm or the Thresholding Greedy Algorithm.  Convergence results for these algorithms depend on geometrical properties of the Banach space such as uniform smoothness. They also depend on unconditionality properties of the dictionary. An important related open problem in Banach space theory to be resolved is to show that the family of constants (Elton constants) corresponding to the  nonlinear projection of  a vector onto sets of  large coefficients is uniformly bounded.  Closely connected to this is the quantization problem of replacing arbitrary real coefficients by a finite alphabet of coefficients. The existence of dictionaries with good quantization properties will be related to the geometrical properties of the Banach space. Quantitative results will be obtained in the finite-dimensional setting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Banach space is a collection of objects called vectors which can be added together or multiplied by numbers to form other vectors. There is a concept of distance between vectors which is analogous to the familiar notion of distance between the points in the three-dimensional world which we inhabit.  Mathematicians have found that Banach spaces provide the correct framework in which to formulate major areas of mathematics such as Functional Analysis and Partial Differential Equations. Banach spaces are also used by scientists and engineers to model problems in applied areas such as fluid mechanics, signals processing, and  finance. There are many different Banach spaces which can be distinguished from each other by geometrical properties such as smoothness and convexity. An individual vector belonging to a Banach space is usually identified by an infinite string of numbers called coefficients.  An important problem in data compression is to find a method to select the most significant coefficients so that the resulting finite string vector is a short distance from the original vector. The project will concentrate on this and other problems involving geometrical properties of Banach spaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  A Banach space is an important mathematical concept which generalizes the three-dimensional world we inhabit. The members (or `elements') of a Banach space are called `vectors'. Vectors can be added together and the `norm' of the Banach space measures the distance between vectors. The Banach spaces studied in this project have infinitely many spatial dimensions. The most famous and in a sense the most `symmetric' of these infinite-dimensional spaces is known as `Hilbert space'. Banach spaces are the natural setting  for many areas of applied mathematics including Partial Differential Equations and Signals Processing.   In Signals Processing a vector (or `signal') is represented by an infinite string of `coefficients' with respect to  some `coordinate system' or `basis'.  An important problem is to  find a method for   approximating  the signal by selecting a finite list of its coefficients. An obvious procedure for doing this is to be `greedy' and to select from among the largest coefficients of the signal, as these coefficients can be expected to be the most important ones and to carry the most information about the signal. This project discovered new `convergence' properties for these so-called `greedy algorithms'. To mention one highlight,  a new and highly effective algorithm was discovered for a very important coordinate system called the `multivariate Haar system'. This system is widely used in applications, especially image compression.  `Banach space theory' is the name given to the area of mathematics (part of a larger subject known as `Functional Analysis'), which investigates Banach spaces and their properties for their own intrinsic interest and importance.  Although this is a  central area of pure mathematics, it has frequently produced important applications in other areas. A good example of this is the so-called `Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma', which was  first obtained  to answer a question in Banach space theory, but later became very famous when it was used  as a key theoretical tool in the applied area of `Compressed Sensing'.
