<AbstractNarration>PIs:   Allison MacKay / Yu-Ping Chin / Charles Sharpless&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Numbers:   1133600 / 1133094 / 1132207&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluating the impacts of human pharmaceutical compounds in the environment is a daunting task, given the wide variety of chemicals administered for medical conditions and the various wastewater management schemes that facilitate their release to aquatic systems.  Prior studies suggest photodegradation reactions to be important attenuation processes for pharmaceutical compounds in the environment.  The susceptibility of pharmaceuticals to photochemical reactions will be impacted by the co-release of these compounds with effluent organic matter (EfOM).  EfOM is expected to have differing photoreactivity, relative to well-studied natural organic matter (NOM) sources, presumably because of its anticipated lower aromatic content and lower color, compared to NOM. &lt;br/&gt;The PIs hypothesize that pharmaceutical compound photodegradation will be altered with increasing proportion of wastewater effluent in natural channel flow because of the increased presence of EfOM, relative to NOM.  The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to identify key environmental system characteristics that are associated with enhanced environmental photodegradation rates of pharmaceutical compounds.  They propose three major research activities to evaluate their hypothesis.  (1): Field measurements of environmental degradation rates and pathways will be obtained for representative wastewater discharge scenarios ? forested New England watershed (Pomperaug River, CT), agricultural Midwestern watershed (East Fork of the Little Miami River, OH), and an urban stream with combined sewer outfalls (Park River, CT).  Flow-adjusted samples will be obtained downstream of the effluent discharge to measure pseudo-first order environmental degradation rates with differing seasonal EfOM-to-NOM ratios.  Photolysis losses will be differentiated from other losses by comparing daytime and nighttime observations.  Supporting lab degradation studies will resolve contributions of organic matter (OM) type to photochemical pathways.  (2): OM will be isolated from the field sites, including from effluent streams directly.  Isolation methods of XAD-8 resin and tangential flow ultrafiltration will be used for consistency with geochemistry methods.  Isolates will be characterized for their biochemical constituents (thermochemolysis), and for optical and structural properties (UV-Vis, fluorescence, solid-state 13C NMR).  (3): Quantum yields of singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and excited triplet-state OM will be obtained for OM isolates and correlated to OM characteristics (Task 2).  Together, the results of Tasks 2 and 3 will yield critical insights for interpreting differences in photodegradation rate constants (Task 1) among the sites and within seasons, as effluent contributions change at each site. &lt;br/&gt;This study will be the first to examine the fate of pharmaceutical compounds in New England and Midwestern rivers, expanding on prior fate studies from arid systems. They will establish an important body of knowledge about environmental system drivers of pharmaceutical compound fates that will contribute to robust science-based decisions about regulation, remediation, and/or ?green? design for pharmaceutical compounds.  They will work closely with the Pomperaug River Watershed Coalition and the East Fork Watershed Cooperative to engage citizens in cutting-edge science through semi-annual project progress presentations, to involve water managers and community members in water quality sampling, and to organize a cross-disciplinary Roundtable to bring together environmental scientists and engineers, regulators, with ecologists and pharmacologists to discuss environmental management of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment. &lt;br/&gt;The PIs will mentor graduate and undergraduate researchers through the process of scientific discovery ? experimental design, manuscript preparation and national professional society presentations.  The PIs will continue their record of engaging student researchers from groups underrepresented in the sciences and engineering.  Students will have a unique opportunity to work with a guiding PI team with expertise in engineering (PI MacKay), geochemistry (PI Chin), photochemistry (PI Sharpless) and systems ecology (Collaborator Nietch), providing broad context for their own projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project assessed the fate of "emerging contaminants" found in wastewater in sunlight receiving waters.  These emerging contaminants include chemicals that we associate with everyday life ranging from caffeine in our coffee to antibiotics that we use for illnesses.  Many of these substances have both unknown and known deleterious effects on aquatic organisms e.g., feminization of male fish from birth control chemicals released in human waste to coral toxicity caused by sunscreens.  We attempted to answer two basic questions i.e., are photolytic processes (reactions caused by sunlight) important in the transformation of these substances in the aquatic environment and can the differences in the aqueous chemistry of wastewater effluent impact the photofate of these compounds?  Our overall hypothesis was that sunlight mediated degradation of emerging contaminants in surface waters was highly dependent upon the types of reactive species (RS) generated by the photolysis of photosensitizers present in both wastewater effluent and stream water.  Further, we hypothesize that the dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition of wastewater effluent (e-DOM) differs from DOM that originates from natural surface waters.  To this end the photofate of emerging contaminants, we believe, are dependent upon both the type and amount of RS generated by the DOM and e-DOM when irradiated by sunlight.   Our findings from this project show that emerging contaminants are susceptible to RS, but their reactivity is highly variable.  Those emerging contaminants that react with highly selective and abundant RS e.g., triplet species of DOM, singlet oxygen are more attenuated downstream of outfalls, while RS capable of degrading a much wider variety of compounds e.g., the hydroxyl radical (OH&bull;) are much less abundant.  Surprisingly we demonstrated that e-DOM is a significantly better photosensitizer than natural DOM with respect to selective RS such as triplet DOM.   One aspect of this study was to 1) investigate the various probes used to trap RS and determine their quantum yield (the efficiency of the photosensitizer to produce the RS of interest) and/or steady-state concentrations, and 2) develop relationships between DOM properties and RS quantum yields.  With respect to the former we were specifically interested in developing an OH&bull; probe that would be easier to use than existing ones.

The last aspect of our research investigated the photofate of emerging contaminants in receiving waters downstream of wastewater effluent outfalls.  We specifically studied the reactivity of two commonly used sunscreens, oxybenzone (OB) and sulisobenzone (SB).  Both have been ubiquitously detected in natural waters and more importantly have been shown to be toxic to corals.  We demonstrated that while both compounds undergo direct photolysis, this pathway is slow and their photodegradation occurs primarily through indirect photolysis.  We were able to show that the OH&bull; plays an important role, but in the presence of e-DOM it also reacts with a RS of unknown origin.  We suspect that this specie is triplet DOM, but were unable to definitively demonstrate this.   We also conducted research on the possible toxicity of photoproducts formed from emerging contaminants.  In particular we wanted to investigate the toxicity of triclocarban (the antibacterial chemical present in hard soaps) photo-derivatives to D. magnia (common water flea) and we demonstrated that two of the products formed (both chloro-anilines) were significantly more toxic than the parent compound.

This aspect of the research demonstrated that despite loss of the parent compound, in some cases the products of the reaction are actually more toxic.  In contrast the other commonly used antibacterial substance, triclosan, formed products that were significantly less toxic to our target organism relative to triclocarban.
