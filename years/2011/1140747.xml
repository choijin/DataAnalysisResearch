<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of the US participation in the meeting Probability and Analysis which will be held at the Stefan Banach Mathematical Research and Conference Center of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences located in Bedlewo, Poland on June 10-16, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;The conference will center on a number of topics that lie on the interface of Functional Analysis, Probability, Harmonic Analysis, and applications. The organizers expect about 20-25 participants from USA, out of the anticipated total number of 80-110 participants. This proposal seeks funds to provide partial support for 15-20 US participants, with priority given to graduate students, junior researchers, and, once the needs of those groups are met, to other US participants without sufficient sources of support.</AbstractNarration>

The core of the scientific program constisted of eleven 50-minute long plenary lecturers. There were also twenty-four 25-minute long invited lectures, and five 15-minute contributed talks given  by younger participants.  The project supported participation of 11 the US-based researchers in this meeting, and it also supported attendance at several other meetings by a number of young faculty and graduate students from the US.
