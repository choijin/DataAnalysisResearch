<AbstractNarration>The MUST STEM Fellows Program merges the best elements of Cleveland State University's (CSU) existing Master's of Urban Secondary Teaching (MUST) program with the CSUTeach model. It will support 24 Fellows, in 4 cohorts of 6 students each, with full tuition scholarships over the 5-year period of the award, beginning in summer 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features retained from each program include the following: A compact 14-month program that results in a Master's degree in education and a teaching license (MUST); Understanding urban teaching through a STEM lens (MUST and CSUTeach); Working with highly skilled STEM master and mentor teachers in STEM-focused urban high schools (CSUTeach); Early field experiences (CSUTeach); Action research (MUST) and portfolio requirements (MUST and CSUTeach); Strong collaboration between faculty in the Colleges of Science, Engineering and Education (CSUTeach)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the first graduate teacher preparation program in Ohio to utilize the UTeach model, and is poised to significantly increase the number and quality of STEM teachers entering teaching in Ohio and beyond. In addition, a strong component of this program is the potential of Cleveland State to build on the prior success of the MUST program in attracting diverse candidates to STEM high school teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project completes the transformation of Cleveland State's secondary STEM teacher education program, aligning it to the UTeach model. A unique climate for innovation and collaboration is being created around the transformed programs, which is serving as a model for and catalyst of similar transformations in STEM education across the region and state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NOYCE_Impact Summary_Final Project Report_2018     The impact of the MUST STEM Fellows program can be identified in the development of highly qualified and successful and teachers in urban high schools, Action Research projects, successful partnerships with urban school districts, professional development activities for mentor teachers and MUST STEM Fellows, increased use of appropriate technology in the classroom and the addition of classroom supplies that enhance teaching and learning in the classroom.     Each of the MUST STEM Fellows completed a yearlong residency in an urban high school while earning an Ohio teaching license and a Master?s degree in Curriculum and Instruction. Their contribution to student learning included project-based learning, inquiry models, and learning activities requiring higher order thinking. The Fellows used school and personal resources to develop field trips, after school programs and tutoring programs to support student success, particularly as related to standardized tests throughout the school year.  The Fellows collaborated with teachers, parents, administrators and community agencies to support the academic, social and emotional development of their students.     Each of the MUST STEM Fellows also completed an Action Research project in their classroom.  The individual projects were designed to increase student achievement and teaching effectiveness.  The data collected from each project was analyzed by the fellows and CSU professors, and then reported to the entire faculty at each MUST school site. Recommendations for future implementation of the strategies developed were offered to each Fellow and all faculty members.     The partnerships with CSU and the urban school districts were strengthened through sharing of knowledge, resources and faculty members.  Mentor teachers were invited as guest speakers to classes and seminars at CSU, and the Co-PI of the project, Diane Corrigan, served on interview committees, a Board of Trustees, and as a guest speaker for multiple classes at the high schools.     Professional development activities were offered at the high school sites and CSU for the MUST STEM Fellows, their mentor teachers, additional faculty members and additional CSU teacher licensure candidates. The interns presented their Action Research topics and data during school-wide professional development days to faculty and administrators. Professional development was also offered to all Fellows, their mentors and additional faculty members on the topic of grant-writing.  Each participant developed a proposal for a Community Health grant. A MUST STEM Fellow participated in the Socio-Emotional Learning Conference hosted by UC Berkeley?s Greater Good Science Center.     The MUST STEM Fellows used grant funds to purchase technology to assist and enhance their classroom teaching.  The Fellows used laptops and iPads to collect data, complete reports, communicate with students and families, and identify appropriate resource materials for their daily lessons and learning activities. The Fellows also collaborated with their mentors and school administrators to select and purchase classroom supplies to aid instruction and student achievement.     It is important to note that the impact of the MUST NOYCE Fellows Project extends well beyond the persons, materials and school sites included in this project. The MUST program is rooted in and guided by its four outcomes, namely, Social Justice, Urban Teaching, Urban Schooling and Communities and Resilience, Resistance and Persistence. The MUST STEM Fellows were assessed twice during the yearlong residency on their proficiency with each of these outcomes.  Proficiency was determined by meeting criteria on a rubric which required the Fellow to give evidence of making a difference in their classrooms and school communities through community activism and advocacy for equity.  These goals and actions will serve a community of students and persons well beyond the locations of this project.
