<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the 27th edition of the South Eastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) on the campus of the University of Florida, March 17 through March 19, 2011. The SEAM conferences bring together both experienced and junior researchers, including graduate students, and postdocs to discuss recent work and advances in operator theory and function theory and related subjects, including their applications and connections to other areas of mathematics such as operator algebras, engineering systems and scattering theory, control theory, several complex variables, semi-algebraic geometry, and optimization. The purpose of this meeting is to disseminate and exchange the latest ideas and developments in the vibrant and active areas of operator theory and function theory and related subjects while encouraging the participation and professional development of both junior members of the operator theory community and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The program consists of plenary talks by leaders both senior and junior and twenty minute contributed talks. The contributed talks are hallmark of SEAM and many are given by younger mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In accordance with SEAM tradition, priority for funding and speaking opportunities will be given to graduate students and other young researchers as well as members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The professional development and integration of a diverse group of researchers into the analysis community are anticipated impacts of the project. Scientifically, there is potential for advances in function theory and operator theory and their related disciplines and areas of application in mathematics and its client disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
