<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation improvement project will study factors causing algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs.  An experimental approach in which the absolute concentration of phosphorus, the amount of phosphorus relative to nitrogen, and the amount of light are manipulated will be used to assess how these factors affect the occurrence and abundance of algal species.  The study will also assess what combination of factors lead to toxin production by blue-green algae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many inland waters are impacted by excessive nutrient input, which can lead to surface scums of algae.  This cultural eutrophication can lead to decreases in property values and recreational opportunities, and in some cases can result in disruptions of drinking water supplies.  Understanding the factors leading to algal blooms is important in developing strategies to mitigate the effects of nutrient pollution in surface waters.</AbstractNarration>
