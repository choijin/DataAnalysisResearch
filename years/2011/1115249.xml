<AbstractNarration>This is a 5-year scientific collaboration to investigate vertical transport mechanisms in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) using a combination of theory, observations, and atmospheric chemical models.  The study focuses on the mesopause region, 80-105 km altitude, and employs Na and Fe wind/temperature lidar, meteor radar, and airglow data from two observation sites at Cerro Pachon, Chile, and Table Mountain, CO.  The objectives are to quantify wave-induced vertical transport in the mesopause region above these sites, to characterize its effects on the fluxes and vertical distribution of heat, Na, Fe, O, and other key constituents, and to compare the measurements to the eddy diffusion parameterization schemes that are traditionally used to account for vertical transport in atmospheric chemistry models. Specific scientific goals include:  &lt;br/&gt;1) To characterize the vertical fluxes of heat, Na (at Cerro Pachon) and Fe (at Table Mountain) throughout the mesopause region and throughout the year, &lt;br/&gt;2) To determine the effective vertical constituent transport velocities associated with advection, turbulent mixing, dynamical transport and Na/Fe chemistry and to characterize their seasonal variations, &lt;br/&gt;3) To quantify the influence of wave-induced transport on the structure and seasonal  variations of the mesospheric Na and Fe layers by comparing model predictions with  observations, &lt;br/&gt;4) To characterize the effective vertical transport associated with OH Meinel Band, O(1S)  green line and O2 Atmospheric Band airglow emissions throughout the year at Cerro  Pachon, and &lt;br/&gt;5) Through model calculations to assess the influence of wave-induced transport on the structure and variations of other important mesospheric constituents such as atomic O. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Knowledge of the magnitude and variability of wave-induced vertical transport is important to a wide range of research problems, including general circulation modeling, atmospheric chemistry modeling, thermal balance calculations, and the study of the mesospheric airglow and metal layers. This work will contribute to a much deeper understanding of the key gravity wave transport processes and their relationships to atmospheric chemistry. In addition, this work will significantly enhance our ability to model the constituent structure of the MLT, particularly the meteoric metal and airglow layers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research has broader implications for atmospheric science because the results can be used to characterize the impact of wave-induced transport on other important constituents in other atmospheric regions, such as stratospheric ozone, which in turn affects the thermal balance of the Earth's atmosphere. Hence, the results of this project may have important applications in global climate modeling. Furthermore, the direct measurements of the vertical fluxes of mesospheric Fe and Na, in combination with modeling, will substantially improve current estimates of the absolute value of the global meteoric input flux, which are highly uncertain. This is important because the meteoric debris that enters the MLT is eventually transported into the lower atmosphere, where it affects the formation of stratospheric aerosols and is ultimately deposited in the oceans, where it contributes to the concentration of key chemical species, such as Fe. Both stratospheric aerosols and oceanic Fe play important roles in Earth's climate. Stratospheric aerosols reflect sunlight, which alters the Earth's radiation budget, while oceanic Fe promotes the growth of phytoplankton, which affects the global carbon cycles, in particular atmospheric CO2.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the Earth?s middle and upper atmosphere, atmospheric gravity waves generated from the lower atmosphere constantly perturbs the composition, temperature, and wind.  These perturbations have lasting effects on all aspects of the atmosphere in this region, due to their net vertical transport of atmospheric constituents and energy.  This project is one of three collaboratives projects that aim to measure and understand the effects of this process, by using high-resolution lidar (LIght Detection And Ranging) measurements of these transports.   This project supports the analysis of the high-quality sodium (Na) lidar measurement of vertical wind, temperature, and sodium density in the mesopause region acquired at the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) at Cerro Pach&oacute;n, Chile.   The ALO Na lidar measurement is uniquely suitable for such analysis because of its high-resolution (sufficient to resolve all important small-scale wave perturbations) and simultaneous measurements of both wind and temperature.  Its location in the southern Andes is also a special place where many mountain waves are generated in the lower atmosphere.   There are several accomplishments from this project. instrument characteristics are analyzed, and the calibration method was developed that lay the foundation for correct wave transport measurement.   New methods were developed to estimate several different types of transports by atmospheric waves.  The most noteworthy is a novel approach to measure the transport of effect of turbulence, a type of perturbations that have much smaller scales than atmospheric waves and were considered previously as not feasible from lidar measurement.  Such a quantitative estimate of turbulence transport provides a missing piece of information of the wave interaction processes with the mean atmosphere and points a new direction of lidar research.
