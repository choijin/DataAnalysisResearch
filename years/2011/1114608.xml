<AbstractNarration>Travel support will be provided for 14 young researchers and 1 frontier session organizer from US institutions to attend the 2011 Applied Probability Conference to be held in Stockholm, Sweden.  Priority for support will be given to researchers who have received their PhD within the last five years and to graduate students in the last year of their PhD programs, as well as worthy candidates from underrepresented groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Applied probability is an extremely  active area of research and interest in the field cuts across  many scientific disciplines including operations research, computer science, combinatorics, mathematics, statistics, physics and biology.  Researchers from these different fields raise different questions about and bring different perspectives to similar problems. Thus, there is great benefit in bringing together these researchers to enable cross-fertilization of ideas.   The Applied Probability Society is a focus group within the INFORMS (INstitute For Operations Research and the Management Sciences) professional society.  Its biannual conferences have established themselves as a leading forum in the field of applied probability.  The conference will consist of three plenary talks from distinguished speakers, two tutorial sessions, over seventy invited and contributed sessions, each of ninety minutes duration with three speakers.   In addition, there will also be a few ``frontier'' sessions, in which survey talks and open problems in areas of research at the cutting edge of applied probability will be presented such as random matrix theory, smart grids and systems biology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference plays a major role in establishing connections between different areas of applied probability that can potentially lead to significant new developments in the field.  The conference also serves an important educational purpose, enabling young researchers from all around the world to present their work and at the same time keep abreast of the latest advances in the field.</AbstractNarration>
