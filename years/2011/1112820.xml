<AbstractNarration>Continents, covering only ~30% of the Earth's surface, are the sole location of human habitation, yet, unfortunately are also regions of widely distributed deformation resulting in earthquakes, volcanism, landslides, etc.  Ultimately, these destructive processes are the consequence of the Earth losing heat that is stored &amp; generated (via decay of radioactive material) within its interior.  How this energy translates into the processes that shape the continent's surface still remains an outstanding challenge with great significance for understanding what makes some regions tectonically "safe" versus potentially dangerous. Fortunately, the Earth provides unique insight into its tectonic evolution via areas of the continental interior called cratons.  Cratons are thick (~200-300km), old (~3-4 billions of years) regions that have avoided deformation since their origin.  Meaning that for the majority of Earth's history while the rest of the Earth's surface was being modified by tectonic processes, cratons resisted being split apart, broken up, compressed or remelted.  This longevity and survivability of cratons provides understanding of the driving forces behind deformation over Earth's history. This study aims to increase our understanding of this problem by focusing on mapping out when, how and why thick, stable continental lithosphere forms as well as assessing the future survivability and longevity for current tectonically stable regions of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines theoretical scalings with two- and three-dimensional time-dependent numerical models to quantitatively determine the dynamic conditions required to thicken and stabilize lithosphere. It will consider two different candidates to make thickened cratonic lithosphere from - buoyant oceanic lithosphere and island arc material. It will also explore the role of a secondary process whereupon the removal of a dense layer (such as eclogite or mafic cumulates) helps promote the stability of cratonic lithosphere. It will compare the generated rheological and composition structure within simulations against seismic observations of the interior of deep cratonic lithosphere. Finally, It will address the size, frequency and nature of drips potentially arising from the base of cratonic lithosphere. By focusing on a critical stage in continental evolution, this work will provide new constraints into the dynamics of the early Earth during which the cores of continental lithosphere were formed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Plate tectonics revolutionized the field of geology (and contributed largely to other fields as well such as biology).  Yet, the theory raised as many questions as it answered.  In particular, we still struggle to understand when, how and why continents deform.  Plate tectonics predicts deformation to occur primarily on the margins of continents due to two or more plate interacting, but in actuality, deformation occurs elsewhere on continents.  This project addressed one aspect of this puzzle: the formation of thickened portions of continents.    The thickened regions of continents, called cratons, are not only scientifically intriguing.  They are also regions of economic significance (these are also the areas where diamonds are found) and societal importance due to their tectonic stability.  Cratons have not experienced major tectonic activity (i.e., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,etc.) since their formation about 2-3 billion years ago.  What makes these regions so stable?  Short answer is, in large part, their thickness.  This project expanded our knowledge of what it takes to build thick stable regions on the Earth.    It also highlighted a much speculated, but largely not well understood secondary process that might be a necessary step in making cratons.  Previous ideas did not prove viable using known Earth materials - often, the material proposed to make cratons proved too dense to thicken without sinking.  My graduate student and I demonstrated a way to remove dense material while still making a thick &amp; stable continent.  We also showed that some of the dense material can remain depending on how much of it existed as well as the strength of the surrounding material.    This project also spurred a new collaboration with a seismologist and provided context for new images of the deep interior of continents.  We suggested that the anomalous features that seismologists keep finding the more they peer into continents might be relics or scars from the formation of the thick regions.    Finally, beyond the bounds of science, the largest impact of this project is the training and support that it provided for women.  As mentioned previously, the project supported the training of a young, female graduate student.  She obtained computational skills and a background in fluid dynamics, heat transfer and material deformation.  This has allowed her to easily transition into a career in the geothermal industry.  In addition, this project help the PI obtain tenure and promotion - a critical juncture in the academic pipeline.  This helped keep the PI in academia as well as place her in a higher position within a large, research university.  Both of these impacts are critical if we wish to change the tapestry of the STEM fields.        Last Modified: 08/04/2015       Submitted by: Catherine Cooper]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
