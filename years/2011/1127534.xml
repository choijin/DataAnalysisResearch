<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the environmental consequences of the outmigration to the U.S. of indigenous people from areas of the Mexico that are considered biodiversity hotspots in Mexico.  Mexico is a mega-biodiverse country, a center of agricultural domestication, and a country where indigenous communities control more than 10% of the national land area. Mexican indigenous "territorial communities" are essential for helping to conserve and maintain the biodiversity of the country through their environmental governance.  Not only do the collective decisions of the communities guide individual members use of common lands, but they have also become recognized as key actors in conservation strategies increasingly promoted by the Mexican federal government and non-governmental organizations, including community forestry, community conservation areas, land use planning and zoning, and payment for environmental services programs.  All of these environmental management strategies rest on communal institutions and collective decision-making about the use of communal territories. However, the ability of territorial communities to govern the environments of their territories is threatened by patterns of outmigration that remove the people that provide the collective decision-making, leadership, and labor in the construction and maintenance of public works. In a previous era, the ideal was for community members to be born, to live in and die in the home territory, with interruptions only for temporary migration. This geography is changing. Currently, many have become trans-border communities with members who do not live in the community territory for long periods of time, but who often financially support families in the home territory, who may participate in collective decision-making from afar, and who may return to the home territory at various times in their lives. This project examines trans-border aspects of environmental governance in Mexican indigenous territorial communities (i.e. ejidos and comunidades), which include land, the members of that community, and the institutions through which those residents govern themselves and their territory.  In collaboration with Mexican scientists, this  project seeks to uncover the trans-border geographic dimension of these communities through semi-structured interviews with migrants in the US about their connections to the home territory, especially whether they participate in formal or informal hometown associations, whether they answer their territorial community's call to return to Mexico to serve in unpaid leadership posts, to make payments to cover community-levied labor taxes, to send remittances for environmental or other activities, and whether they have plans to return to the home territory to live later in life. Interviews will also investigate agricultural land-use in the home territory, such as loans to other household members, land abandonment, and plans for using fields in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project demonstrates the role of trans-border Mexican indigenous communities in the environmental governance of biologically-diverse territories.  The project broadens the participation of US Latino students as project research assistants and study abroad scholarship recipients. The project also enhances the infrastructure for research by cementing collaboration between US and Mexican institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported through co-funding between NSF's Geography and Spatial Sciences Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  The project showed first, that migration tears communities apart, making it difficult for them to govern themselves and manage their territories.  Simply put, communities suffer from a lack of labor for community governance and they struggle to find ways to increase participation among members who are forced to find their livelihood outside of the communal territory.

While communities have more income than decades prior, the new rural economy does not always provide the kind of livelihood that links people to community and territory,  Despite these challenges and their diminished capacity,  the communities we studied continue to govern themselves and their territories. Mexican indigenous communities are adapting to incredibly disruptive global economic and demographic forces. We argue that indigenous territorial communities can remain viable in many cases, especially if they are able to take advantage of contemporary environmental management and conservation opportunities.    Broader Impacts  The project promoted transformative learning experiences for undergraduates.  It informed an advanced course on immigration policy, and enriched courses in Latin American and Environmental Studies.   During two one-month semesters, the project provided below-cost study abroad experiences for undergraduate students to examine development challenges in communities sending migrants to Southern California.  Two undergraduates partly trained under this grant acquired and successfully completed Fulbright-Garcia Robles grants in Mexico.  The project broadened the participation of under-represented Latino students as researchers and study abroad scholarship recipients.  The project also contributed to the training of Maria Lira, a Mexican graduate student who is now completing a PhD at the University of Manitoba.  It also supported the professional development of Jim Robson who completed a two year postdoctoral stay at the University of Redlands supported by a Banting Fellowship.

We are now under contract for a book-length analysis of our results, titled Rural Communities Surviving Migration: Village Governance, Environment and Cultural Survival in Indigenous Mexico  as part of the series Routledge Studies in Environmental Migration, Displacement and Resettlement.
