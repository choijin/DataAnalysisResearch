<AbstractNarration>The University of Hawai'i Ocean FEST (Families Exploring Science Together) and Ocean TECH (Technology Expands Career Horizons) project is designed to improve literacy in oceanography and related geoscience fields using an Earth system science approach and inspire Hawaii's students, most of whom are from underrepresented groups, to pursue geoscience careers.  The project is conducting a series of community-based events to engage Hawai'ian middle, high school, and community college students and their families in hands-on, ocean-themed science activities that leverage research data from the NSF-funded Center for Microbial Oceanography, Research and Education (C-MORE) and Hawai'ian Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, as well as state-of-the-art technologies from the University of Hawai'i, Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology and Coastal Geology.  Additional objectives of the project are focused on showcasing a variety of culturally-relevant geoscience careers and fostering collaborations with Hawaii's geoscience-related businesses.  The project is expected to impact 3,600 participants, 240 volunteers, and approximately 120 educators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ocean FEST (Families Exploring Science Together) and TECH (Technology Expands Career Horizons) has two key goals: (1) Improve literacy in oceanography and related geoscience fields using an Earth system science approach; and (2) Inspire Hawaii's students, most of whom are from underrepresented groups, to pursue geoscience careers.   To achieve this goal, we originally roposed to offer 45 events to stimulate interest among middle school, high school and community college students in the ocean and earth sciences through hands-on activities and exposure to relevant careers and  technologies.   We are delighted to report that we delivered more than twice the number of events proposed within the budget allotted.  A total of 93 Ocean FEST and TECH events were offered in Hawaii over the course of this grant, from May 2013 through February 2017.  These 93 events reached an estimated 23,849 participants, including pre-college students, college students, and 1478 educators.   The events had various formats, depending on factors such as group size, grade level, available time, and participants' interests.  Sample formats included workshops, presentations, community outreach events and career fairs.  All events included hands-on science activities, featured information about earth and ocean science careers and/or showcased innovative technologies.     A key achievement of this project is a summer bridge program that we developed and implemented for three consecutive years  between Kapiolani Community College and the University of Hawaii at Manoa?s School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST).   Remarkably, 31% of SOEST?s Native Hawaiian students were recruited from this summer bridge program.  This is an important contribution to broadening participation in the geosciences in Hawaii and suggests that investing in community college &ndash; university bridge programs is a wise investment.
