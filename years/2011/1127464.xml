<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project addresses the gap between the capabilities of today's semantic analysis systems and the accuracy requirements of knowledge workers (analysts and researchers) in language-sensitive fields such as public relations, foreign affairs, and crisis management. Knowledge workers in many organizations monitor and analyze print and web coverage for content of interest. When the volume of search results is large, some filter, classify and score the results using products or systems based on semantic analysis technology utilizing extensive libraries of words, patterns, and context-specific algorithms. However, users complain that these systems fall short of desired accuracy, missing rhetorical devices such as irony, sarcasm, metaphors, double entendre, and improperly interpreting connections between sentiment and topics. Users with high thresholds for accuracy thus turn to manual processes to either supplement or substitute for technology. Building upon Phase I work, the company will create and integrate a larger set of content processing modules and enhance a pluggable architecture to support quick insertion and testing of new modules in the content processing "pipeline." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once commercialized, the system will enable more rapid adoption of technology by knowledge workers. In fields with high accuracy requirements, the need for human judgment has constrained technology use to discrete areas like search, while in subsequent processing steps, analysts must manually capture, classify, score, analyze, and report on the output.  Feedback to date suggests the product can substantially enhance the productivity and effectiveness of professionals in these fields and that it addresses a number of frustrating gaps in the marketplace.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.     In our Small Business Innovation Research Phase II/IIB Project, we continued to address the gap between the capabilities of todayÃ†s natural language processing systems and the accuracy requirements of knowledge workers in language-sensitive fields.  We developed a working content processing technology based on modules that could be plugged into a workflow process efficiently integrating human insight.  During the Phase II/IIB SBIR, we successfully built and/or enhanced five content processing modules and integrated each of these modules into a working media analysis system.  Based on the successful deliverables completed in this SBIR project augmented by privately funded product development work, PublicRelay successfully sold its solution to dozens of new brand-name customers, building a sustainable, profitable venture that continues to grow at a healthy pace.   In fields with high accuracy requirements, the need for human judgment has constrained technology use to discrete areas like search, while in subsequent processing steps, analysts must manually capture, classify, score, analyze, and report on the output.   The PublicRelay system enables more rapid adoption of technology by knowledge workers.  We have focused initially on marketing, PR and communications teams, but the fundamental technology developed has broader application to knowledge workers in other fields, including (but not limited to) markets such as brand management, crisis management, government relations, constituent outreach, foreign affairs, and homeland defense/anti-terrorism.  All of these fields share similar underlying content processing challenges that our solution helps solve.          Last Modified: 02/24/2016       Submitted by: Eric B Koefoot]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
