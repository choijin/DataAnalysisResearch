<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Although fossil floras are known from the Antarctic Peninsula region, the record of Jurassic plant life in continental Antarctica is sparse, possibly due to tectonic and magmatic activity associated with the breakup of Gondwana and the emplacement of the Ferrar Large Igneous Province. The PIs propose to examine Early Jurassic floras and paleoenvironments in southern Victoria Land, where pyroclastic rocks of the Mawson Formation contain sedimentary interbeds of fossiliferous mudstones and cherts deposited in a freshwater lake environment. They will collect plant megafossils, palynomorphs, charcoalified and petrified wood, and geochemical data constrained by detailed stratigraphy and sedimentology to provide baseline data on the composition of the floras at this time, their depositional environments, and the environment of growth. These data will contribute to understanding plant life and paleoenvironments in Antarctica during a time of increasing volcanism and will provide floral information that can be compared to other, better-known floras elsewhere in Gondwana. The presence of this high-latitude terrestrial vegetation in the Ferrar Group will allow the PIs to test the theory of rapid greenhouse warming in the Jurassic, a situation similar to that predicted for the next century in the modern world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This proposal will expand on successful education and human development activities including: outreach, teaching, and mentoring of women and under-represented students in paleobiology; mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral scholars; continuing support for workshops for middle school girls in science via the Expanding Your Horizons Program and Si! Se Puede Hacer Ciencias y Matematicas at Emporia State University, the KU Discover Technology TRIO Program, and the KU Natural History Museum. Communication to the public will be enhanced through widely disseminated publications and presentations in multiple media venues, as well as through the availability of archived digital and specimen data.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project provided funding to (1) collect fossil floras at Carapace Nunatak in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, and other nearby sites; (2) describe those floras, including the plant types included, and the environment in which they lived, using information from the geology of the sites and the plants themselves; (3) reconstruct the plant life for the Early Jurassic of continental Antarctica and the climate in which the plants existed. Two field seasons were completed. Little is known about plant life during the Early Jurassic on continental Antarctica, in part because this time period included the beginning of the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. The extensive volcanic activity that accompanied the continental breakup means that sedimentary rocks and fossil plants from this time period are relatively rare. Fossils collected from Carapace (Jurassic) included conifers, some preserved as both petrifactions and compressions, which allow us to study the anatomy and morphology of the plants. Triassic plants collected from nearby sites included the most diverse Late Triassic flora yet found on the continent, petrified wood with preserved tree-rings, and fossil fungi within the wood. This diverse flora included seed plants: conifers, true cycads, ginkgophytes, and seed ferns (an extinct group), including the first evidence of peltasperm seed ferns, which are known from other continents, but not from continental Antarctica. This flora was dominated by corystosperm seed ferns, including multiple species of leaves, pollen-producing organs, and seed-bearing structures. This diverse Triassic flora, and the discovery of additional diversity in the Jurassic flora from Carapace, provide excellent evidence of high plant diversity at what were relatively high paleolatitudes during past times of global warmth. <br /><br />The project provided support for a Ph.D. student who went on to a prestigious post-doctoral fellowship supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany, and several undergraduate students. The field party included collaborators from France and Argentina. As part of this project, we presented workshops on Antarctic paleobotany and Antarctic fieldwork to middle-school students from Kansas City, KS, to middle-school girls from throughout Kansas, and to students from the Topeka Public Schools (including a field trip). In addition, we provide specimens and displays for the KU Natural History Museum and participate in National Fossil Day outreach, as well as other outreach activities at the museum, thus engaging hundreds of school children in the excitement of Antarctic paleobotany.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/03/2017<br>      Modified by: Edith&nbsp;L&nbsp;Taylor</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142495/1142495_10175948_1507074979477_PattyatTRIO2009IMG_0017-CROP--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142495/1142495_10175948_1507074979477_PattyatTRIO2009IMG_0017-CROP--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Middle-School students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1142495/1142495_10175948_1507074979477_PattyatTRIO2009IMG_0017-CROP--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Middle-School students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students at summer TRIO workshop at KU</div> <div class="imageCredit">E.L.
