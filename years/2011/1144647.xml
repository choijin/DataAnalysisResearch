<AbstractNarration>The Thermal Biology Institute at Montana State University will host Thermophiles 2011 at the Huntley Lodge in Big Sky, Montana, September 11-16, 2011. The objectives of the meeting are to:  1) bring together all active members of the community of scientists, technologists and educators that study thermophiles to share and review discoveries and progress in thermophilic research across disciplines and applications; 2) provide a forum for young investigators to be introduced to peers and senior scientists from academia, national labs and private industry; 3) expedite opportunities for collaboration across disciplines and applications; 4) host the conference in the United States for the first time in fifteen years. This gathering of researchers who conduct basic and applied research on thermophiles is needed to foster interactions that will be fruitful in future scientific discoveries.  Thermophiles 2011 will highlight recent advances and new discoveries in thermopile metabolism which is greatly expanding our knowledge of microbial activities and diversity on earth.  The proposed meeting topics include: Genomics and Metagenomics, Evolution and Origin of Life, Applied Science of Thermophiles, Diversity and Ecology, Genetic Mechanisms and Tools, Environmental Adaptations, Physiology and Metabolism, Mobile Genetic Elements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The international and local organizing committees have been deliberate in their efforts to broaden participation in Thermophiles 2011.  Attention has been given to inviting women, underrepresented minorities, early career investigators and PhD students to participate in the Conference.</AbstractNarration>
