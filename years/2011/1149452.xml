<AbstractNarration>CBET 1149452/ Daniel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF CAREER award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program supports a research and education program focused on discovering the function of species that comprise cell membrane microdomains and promoting the advancement of women in STEM disciplines through professional development. Membrane species are essential for regulating myriad cellular processes and vital to proper function of bioanalytical assays and sensors that employ these species as transducer elements. Yet our understanding of the links between protein function and the impact of the local membrane environment of that protein on its function is lacking. In this work, we will employ a novel microfluidic device comprised of patterned, two-phase co-existent membranes to assess biomolecule partitioning into different membrane phases; identify the stimuli that trigger changes in partitioning; and quantify how partitioning impacts, and possibly regulates, protein function.  Knowing how protein function depends on the local membrane composition is vital to understanding membrane biology and appreciating how the membrane environment impacts drug-protein interactions is necessary for assessing therapeutic efficacy in mitigating diseases such as Diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and infertility, where changes in cell membrane composition are implicated in the disease manifestation. Thus the broader impacts of this research are filling a technological gap in membrane proteomic research that will be used to study how partitioning depends on membrane properties and external stimuli (chemical, biological, environmental) to ultimately monitor direct interactions between species in heterogeneous membranes and determine protein activity changes after interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coincident to the research plan, educational efforts on coaching graduate and post doctoral women to become successful leaders and educators will be implemented through a new multi-layered professional development program. The education plan will build leadership skills and educational competency through peer mentoring, teaching leadership skills through outreach programs, and career networking workshops. The broader impacts of this education plan are filling the gap between undergraduate advancement programs and professional development programs for young female professionals in the STEM disciplines; creating a model for female graduate student education that combines technical education in engineering with leadership and management skills to yield well-rounded, technically competent graduates; and ultimately increasing the number of women choosing advanced technical careers after graduate school.</AbstractNarration>

Coincident to the research plan, the PI focused her educational efforts on mentoring graduate women to become successful leaders and educators by creating a new multi-layered professional development program and an annual outreach program for 10th grade girls and their families.     The intellectual merit of this work comes from three technical challenges that were addressed: 1) integrating native proteins and their lipid environment into flat bilayers and characterizing those materials, 2) maintaining species mobility in the planar platform so that reorganization can occur when necessary or stimulated, and 3) integrating bilayers with polymer material supports to open additional opportunities for reading out protein activity and function.

The advance brings research conducted on traditionally simple bilayers to the other end of the spectrum, where complexity of the cell membrane is truly captured and moves these biomimetic platforms closer to the native situation.  The technical boarder impact of this work is embodied by the interest received by researchers outside our field and their applications.  For example, virologists are using these platforms to study host-pathogen interactions because they serve as excellent mimic of the host cell surface.  Furthermore, because this system is planar, it is amenable to techniques like single particle tracking and fluorescence microscopy to study these interactions.
