<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on algebro-geometric ideas that can be used to improve our understanding of arithmetic phenomena. The PI and co-workers have recently extended the scope of the theory of reductive algebraic groups over function fields via their work on pseudo-reductive groups. This has led to generalizations of useful finiteness theorems, and suggested new problems concerning linear algebraic groups over function fields that the PI proposes to solve. The PI will continue his work on descent theory in non-archimedean geometry, as well as on some problems in Galois deformation theory that involve reductive groups, rigid-analytic geometry, and p-adic Hodge theory. Finally, the PI will study deeper properties of a parity obstruction, including applications to Mordell-Weil ranks in families of elliptic curves over global function fields and advise PhD students working on number-theoretic problems with a geometric flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although much of the motivation for the study of number theory comes from within pure mathematics, important practical applications continue to emerge.  For example, secure Internet communication relies crucially on number-theoretic techniques of geometric origin that were invented for theoretical reasons. This proposal addresses questions in several areas of active development on the geometric side of number theory, and will lead to new theoretical methods that solve specific problems as well as lay the groundwork for future progress.  The PI also proposes to continue supervising number theory research by talented high school students and giving talks across many areas of mathematics to groups of students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the primary aims of number theory is to study properties of solutions in whole numbers to systems of equations in many variables.  The means by which such problems are studied can be via algebra, geometry, or continuous methods.  This project explored a variety of problems on the geometric side of number theory, especially in settings where a chosen prime number plays a distinguished role in the analysis, using a mixture of algebro-geometric and contnuous methods.  For example, in earlier work the PI and collaborators introduced a new class of ``arithmetic symmetries'' (called pseudo-reductive groups) that led to an array of new finiteness theorems, and in this work the classification theory of such symmetries was brought to an essentially final form. Among the work of graduate students under the PI during this period, one of them built on those ideas to significantly enlarge the scope of some important volume formulas.  Joint work of the PI towards the end of the funding period showed that properties of "compact" objects in analytic geometry over number-theoretic analogues of the complex numbers can be explored using families defined by equations over number systems with more accessible algebraic properties.   On the broader impact side, the PI continued to co-organize a semi-annual series of public lectures on mathematics by an array of distinguished mathematicians, gave presentations introducing some basic ideas of algebraic geometry to high school teachers and students, and both completed and produced some expository works with a novel angle that led to them becoming widely-used references by both graduate students and researchers.
