<AbstractNarration>The mathematical community shows expanding interest in the deformations Shepler and Witherspoon study, for example, in graded Hecke algebras and symplectic reflection algebras. These algebras pervade mathematics, appearing in algebra, geometry, number  theory, combinatorics, topology, statistics, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, and the theory of special functions (for example, they appear in the Langlands program, the theory of quantum groups, knot theory, and conformal field theory).  Shepler and Witherspoon work towards a theory of skew group algebras and Hochschild cohomology that connects work by various prominent mathematicians working in different mathematical fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their  research leads to international talks and collaborations and results in publications in selective international journals.  Shepler and Witherspoon dynamically engage the wider community by collaborating with international experts,organizing conferences and workshops, delivering invited talks in various countries, and working with outreach programs. They actively prepare junior colleagues and students (at all stages) for engaging careers which use mathematics. Their work supports research of several graduate students and summer research experiences for undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

One sometimes understands symmetry by breaking it, or deforming it, and again mathematicians encode such symmetry breaking as algebraic deformations. The outcomes of this project are better and more explicit understanding of some types of algebraic deformations in the presence of a symmetry group, the development of better homological tools for understanding these deformations, and better understanding of homological information attached to Hopf algebras.   Intellectual merit of the project: Algebraic deformations are connected to many questions of interest in the mathematical community, and the results of the project expanded knowledge in ways that will benefit mathematical research in many directions.

She published her results in papers in high quality research journals.   Broader impacts of the project: The PI organized conferences and workshops related to the project, thus reaching many other mathematicians, including students and postdocs. She directly mentored many graduate students and postdocs, training them through their work on the project. She also worked with outreach programs to the wider community.
