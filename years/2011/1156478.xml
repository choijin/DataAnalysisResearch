<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award provides funding for the development of a new paradigm in distributed manufacturing which, if successful, will integrate small and medium-sized American manufacturing facilities into virtual factories which can serve large customers. The concept of a virtual factory is intended on the one hand to leverage the creativity and efficiency of American small manufacturing businesses, and on the other hand, create "a sum that is larger than the parts" virtual enterprise so that American businesses can compete better with the bulk-manufacturing facilities overseas to which the US is losing manufacturing jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the tools to enable distributed manufacturing are already in place. For the manufacture of mechanical parts, CAD files are regularly transmitted over the Internet. CAM takes CNC milling machines a step towards printing. 3D printing, meanwhile, takes mechanical manufacturing a lot further towards the printing of form (though not functionality). In the hands of an experienced 21st century manufacturing expert, though these three technologies already enable pieces of distributed manufacturing. Key elements of a truly integrated virtual factory are missing, however. The inspection of parts manufactured in distributed environments remains unscalable. The shipping of parts shipped from distributed locations remains expensive. The proposed research attempts to fill these needs by looking at:  low-cost, networked, high-definition CT scanning to enable quality assurance in a truly distributed virtual factory; and low-cost, small-batch shipping by leveraging RFID and flexible warehousing and shipping. In summary, the goal of the research is to fight the tyranny of bulk manufacturing, by leveraging the strengths of small manufacturing shops in the US.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ US Manufacturing needs a new operating paradigm to improve competitiveness from lower-wage manufacturing countries. The strategy consists of applying the lessons of fragmentation from other industries to the US Manufacturing sector. Fragmentation of an industry describes the emergence of a disruptive approach to æstandardÆ industry procedures that creates efficiency in smaller-scales rather than relying on larger-scale economies. Fragmentation can radically change the finances, time-to-market, and/or quality of an industry. Examples include innovative companies such as Zipcar disrupting the car rental industry, Zara in the fashion industry, and eBay and amazon.com in retail.  In each of these cases, a smaller but more nimble approach challenged the status quo and succeeded in creating a new way to conduct æoldÆ business. The salient research question is why hasnÆt fragmentation applied to manufacturing and what enabling technologies are necessary to create a new manufacturing paradigm for the 21st century in the same way that new technologies have fundamentally changed how retail operates.  The vision of Fragmented Manufacturing includes a system for distributed small-lot manufacturing where small to medium manufacturers independently fill portions of larger manufacturing orders. However, to realize such a system new technologies are needed to ensure that distributed manufacturing meets the quality of traditional manufacturing while reducing costs to be competitive with offshore manufacturing.  The research project entailed two major contributions towards understanding and realizing modern fragmented manufacturing: Computed Tomography (CT) scanning for distributed quality assurance and an investigation of manufacturing tolerances in battery production.  Distributed fragmented manufacturing must address quality control, especially when multiple distributed manufacturers become involved. A distributed manufacturing system requires a fundamental rethinking of quality &ndash; both from the perspective of measurement and from the perspective of management. CT scanning offers a technological solution to quality assurance with a standardized procedure to test parts no matter where they were manufactured. A verification file, in the form of a scan or an electronic response examines and certifies a sample part before being accepted.

Lithium battery cells today are manufactured in very controlled environments with highly automated equipment and tight tolerances. However, our research shows that for some applications, tolerances for lithium cells may be over-specified, exaggerating the need to build expensive, consolidated cleanrooms. Manufacturing of lithium cells need tight tolerances to produce very low variations in internal resistance because variations within a cell can lead to localized heating. Our research shows that matching cells with similar internal resistance can have a significant benefit for manufacturers. In other words, instead of tightly regulating tolerances so that all products match, we show that manufacturing could proceed with lower tolerances that are then measured and matched. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
