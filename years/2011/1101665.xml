<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference" that will be held from May 12-14, 2011, on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference, which is the latest event in a long-running and highly influential series of conferences in the theory of several complex variables, will cover a wide spectrum of topics in the field (e.g., pluripotential theory and complex dynamics, CR-geometry and conformal geometry, invariant metrics and their applications, automorphism groups). All of the topic areas cited in the proposal are central to analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.</AbstractNarration>
