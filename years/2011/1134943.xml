<AbstractNarration>This Ethics Education in Science and Engineering project will integrate multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary education and research efforts to create a novel pedagogy of sustainability ethics for science &amp; engineering graduate students. It will create a collaborative classroom setting that draws on science &amp; engineering students? predilection for experimental learning and teamwork to explore different ethical approaches to problems in sustainability using a game-based, deliberative and participatory setting. Ultimately, this project will link science &amp; engineering graduate students on several campuses, using information-communication technology tools to create an intellectually diverse learning community studying in parallel. This project will pilot novel game modules in unique, integrative graduate education programs at the host Universities, create an Instructor workshop for the purpose of training additional faculty in the new teaching methods, and ultimately engage several Universities with sustainability programs rooted in different science, technology and engineering disciplines.  Lastly, this project will enhance the problem-solving skills of scientists &amp; engineers who will ultimately join a technical workforce that is better prepared to meet the challenge of sustainability</AbstractNarration>
