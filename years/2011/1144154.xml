<AbstractNarration>Most studies of the magnetosphere have been carried out by considering primarily the north-south (Bz) component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and most of those have considered intervals with southward IMF (Bz&lt;0). Recent discoveries have revealed anomalous thermospheric neutral density signatures caused by intense deposition of Poynting flux delivered over very localized regions under conditions that are normally considered benign. These studies have shown that relatively modest IMF By-driven localized heating at storm-onset generates neutral thermospheric disturbances that had not previously been explained. In addition studies using data from DMSP satellites demonstrated large yet localized dayside energy input. MHD simulation results for one case suggest that the localized enhanced Poynting fluxes in the southern hemisphere map to a flank magnetopause reconnection region. Most of these events are associated with dominant in-the-ecliptic interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) values, often, but not exclusively, while the IMF Bz is northward (Bz&gt;0). The objectives of this proposal are to verify the source region (magnetopause merging versus bow shock) of the Poynting flux-related dayside field-aligned currents (FACs), determine their ionospheric distribution, and examine the relative local and global impact of the Poynting flux energy input on the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. The influences of solar ejecta and high-speed streams will be distinguished and investigated for seasonal and hemispheric differences. The study will employ both data analysis from multiple satellites, ground based observations from radar and the AMIE technique and tie all the observations together with global magnetohydrodynamic simulations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research potentially transforms the way the space science community views the effects of non-southward IMF on the geospace environment.  It is at the forefront of system science in exploring the influence of non-southward IMF on the field-aligned currents that deliver focused energy to dayside regions. This is an understudied area of space physics. It also has practical application to problems related to satellite drag.</AbstractNarration>

The same data set was subsequently used in a Ph.D. study and associated publication (McGranaghan et al., GRL, 2016) to produce the first global&#8208;scale, altitude&#8208;dependent analysis of polar ionospheric conductivity variability.

The X-line switches toward the north-dusk and south-dawn for positive IMF By (Figure 1).  Intervals of large IMF By often result in localized upwelling of neutral gas in the dayside high-latitude thermosphere coincident with intense downward Poynting energy flux. The energy deposition coincides with channels of fast ionospheric flow flanked by oppositely directed field-aligned currents (FACs). Global MHD simulations have shown that flow channels with enhanced Poynting flux map to reconnection regions on the high-latitude magnetospheric flanks.  Previous energy deposition studies focused on steady state conditions of IMF By-dominant conditions. A focus of the grant was a deeper understanding of temporal responses of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system to transient IMF By features.  Wilder et al. (GRL, 2013) investigated an event when the IMF experienced a -21 nT impulse in the By direction that slowly returned to zero over the course of ~8 hours, while maintaining a steady IMF direction.  We employed FAC observations from AMPERE and ion drift observations from DMSP satellites and the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar. We reported a FAC pattern (Figure 2) with maximum currents that peaked in the late morning sector about 1 hour 15 min after the sudden impulse. Ion drifts confirmed a narrow, elongated East-West channel of fast 2 km/s flows directed toward the post-noon sector as expected for IMF By&lt;0. The upward FAC associated with this fast flow peaked at ~2 uA/m2 on the equatorward side of the flow channel.

This could be related to a fast onset of reconnection at high latitude (Eriksson et al. 2017), or else be related to sudden stresses imposed on open fields by the new IMF direction of the solar wind.  It is likely that the 11-min delay involves a processing delay of magnetic field reconnection at the Earth's magnetopause.  We also investigated the variability of high-latitude conductance that supports current channels (McGranaghan et al., JGR, 2015). Using 60 million particle spectra processed through the Global Airglow Model, we produced mean patterns and modes of conductance variability (Figure 4).

The same data set was subsequently used in a Ph.D. study and associated publication (McGranaghan et al., GRL, 2016) to produce the first global&#8208;scale, altitude&#8208;dependent analysis of polar ionospheric conductivity variability.
