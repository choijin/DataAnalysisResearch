<AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships to able and financially needy students majoring in Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, Mathematics, and Physics.   The project emphasizes enrichment opportunities that concentrate on engaged learning activities that are best suited to the students' studies and aspirations. These include faculty mentoring, monthly project participant meetings, and optional engaged learning experiences that include faculty guided or independent research, internships, and field trips to local industries. Other engagement activities involve participation in professional organizations, including attending and presenting at conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are academic support activities.  The project focuses on student engagement and faculty mentorship in the context of an interdisciplinary community of scholars. This approach is designed to strengthen undergraduate science and mathematics education, increase retention and persistence to graduation, and better prepare students for professional careers where the boundaries between academic disciplines are not clearly drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The project is increasing the number and diversity of students who complete a STEM major and go on to work in the field or to further education.  Many of the interdisciplinary activities are made available to all UVU STEM students, during and after the funding period. Moreover, the goal of graduating more and better-prepared students in mathematics and the sciences is not only an institutional goal, but a community and state goal as well. As such, the college is building partnerships with business organizations to offer internships and on-site learning experiences that take the classroom and laboratory education out to the real world. This facilitates job placement for students as well as enhances the university's relationship with local industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Utah Valley University PRO-STEM scholarship program successfully concluded with the participation of 48 students through the academic years 2013 to 2017. An addition 18 students were given partial support through the 2017-2018 year through a no cost extension. The goals of the program were to: 1) promote student success and degree completion for academically promising students in the sciences of biology, chemistry, earth science, math, and physics at UVU through financial-needs-based scholarships; 2) prepare students for post-graduate education and careers by support services aimed at enriching participants? educations; and 3) increase STEM recruitment and enrollment and completion in an open-enrollment teaching institution with traditionally low enrollments in STEM disciplines. The program provided a path to graduate success for 36 of the original cohort of 48 students. Of these 21 went on to graduate programs and the remainder obtained jobs in STEM related careers. Of the 12 not completing the PRO-STEM program, 6 transfered to other schools or non-STEM fields, and 6 left school for a variety of reasons. Two cohorts of students were selects in different years with additions to the cohorts as necessary to make up for attrition through graduation, transfer and other loses.

Regular cohort activities were held to provide social bonding among the students and give appropriate career and graduate school advice information to students. Students were regularly encouraged to engage in undergraduate research with faculty sponsorship. Indeed, success in the program was highly correlated to participation in undergraduate research. Most of the successful participants engaged in faculty mentored research and were able to present some form of their results at appropriate venues.  Intellectual Merit: The program sought participation from 'B-level' students, i.e., those that would not normally have an opportunity to receive major scholarship support, with the question to investigate, whether such support could provide a means for bolstering student success.  Indeed UVU institutionally identified several attrition points in the STEM pipeline including lengthy time to completion, excessive part-time work, and feelings of isolation by some women students. The STEM scholarships offered a means to address these and indeed one of the key outcomes was the finding that women in the PRO-STEM program succeeded at a far higher rate than their peers with less drop outs and quicker times to completion, particularly when the students were involved in mentored undergraduate research. In fact that held true for all participants where, 90% of those students taking the opportunity to work with a strong research mentor and group succeeded in the PRO-STEM program. The program made clear too, 'taking a chance' on 'B-level' students by providing a strong pathway to STEM success with strong mentorship is very effective. Conversely, it must be observed that those leaving the program invariably lacked the strong support of a research mentor and group.   Broader Impacts: UVU?s PRO-STEM program helped develop the capacity of a comprehensive open enrollment university with a markedly different student population from those at research-focused institutions to attract, retain, and graduate students in the physical sciences and prepare them for STEM professions.  Exit interviews of individual students indicated that the PRO-STEM program made a substantial difference in keeping them in school, expanding their vision of science, and giving them a stepping stone to success.  The program highlighted the need for envolved, engaged faculty willing to closely mentor students in meaningful projects, particularly for underrepresented populations of students in STEM fields. The results of this program have led directly to a track 2 S-STEM program designed to focus on the facutly mentor's role in student success in the physical sciences.
