<AbstractNarration>Vision is critical to the survival of many animals, both vertebrates and invertebrates.  This project focuses on the functions of photoreceptors, the cells in eyes that detect light, and on visual pigments, the proteins in photoreceptors that first respond to light. The levels and types of visual pigments in photoreceptors largely determine what animals see.  The PI recently demonstrated that more than one type of visual pigment can be expressed in an individual photoreceptor.  This project tests the novel idea that the relative levels of visual pigments co-expressed in photoreceptors change in response to light and darkness and signals from the animal's internal 24 hr clock (circadian clock).  The project makes use of photoreceptors in the horseshoe crab, an ancient arthropod that has remained mostly unchanged since before the time of the dinosaurs and whose photoreceptors continue to provide fundamental information about basic mechanisms of vision.  The project applies genetic, molecular and cell biological approaches to determine how levels of visual pigments in photoreceptors are regulated under different conditions of light and darkness and time of day, and biochemical and electrophysiologial approaches to characterize the spectral sensitivities of the visual pigments and the photoreceptors in which they are expressed.  This project will likely reveal previously unknown processes that many animals may use to optimize their vision under different conditions of light and darkness and time of day, and which are critical for their survival.  Furthermore, this project will provide research training in cell and molecular biology and neurobiology to undergraduate and high school students drawn largely from underrepresented groups.   The PI also has developed and will continue to oversee a large multi-generational public outreach program that trains volunteer, adult non-scientists to guide the science learning of over 5000 local K-8 students each year in animal diversity and the process of scientific investigation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The American horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) is a charismatic marine arthropod that can be identified in the fossil record of about 450 million years ago.  Horseshoe crabs play a critical role in ecology&mdash;particularly for the survival of migrating shore birds&mdash; and are the source of important biomedical reagents.  In addition, their unusually large photoreceptors have been the subject of intense study by vision scientists interested in understanding basic mechanisms of vision.  Because of the horseshoe crabÃ†s position in the animal tree of life&mdash; horseshoe crabs are chelicerates and an early branching sister group to scorpions and spiders&mdash;studies of their  visual system will provide important insights into the evolution of vision among chelicerates and arthropods in general.   Horseshoe crabs have three distinctly different types of eyes and a photosensitive tail.  Although much was known about the physiology of horseshoe crab photoreceptors, the cells that detect and respond to light, little was known about the proteins in their photoreceptors, called opsins, that are responsible for detecting light.   Intellectual merit.  A remarkable feature of horseshoe crab eyes is that they become much more sensitive to light  at night compared to the day&mdash;an adaptation thought important for finding mates at night&mdash;and this change in sensitivity is brought about by the combined effects of light and darkness and signals from an internal 24-hr  (circadian) clock.   A central goal of our research was to identify the opsins expressed in photoreceptors located in horseshoe crab eyes and central nervous system and to examine the effects of light and darkness and the internal circadian clock on the levels of these opsin proteins.  Our studies produced a number of surprising findings.   It had been thought that most photoreceptors express only one type of opsin. However, we showed that the majority of photoreceptors in horseshoe crabs express more than one type of opsin.  We showed further that the levels of co-expressed opsins in membranes are regulated differently. For example, we found that while the level of one opsin changes dramatically day to night the other changes very little.  The observed diurnal changes in opsin levels are consistent with the photoreceptor becoming much more sensitive to light at night compared to the day.  And in one type of photoreceptor, the differential regulation of co-expressed opsin levels should also lead to a day to night change in the spectrum of light the photoreceptor detects.   Photoreceptors in the different eyes of the horseshoe crab express different types of opsins.  For example, the opsins found in the photoreceptors in the animalÃ†s large lateral compound eyes  are different from those found in photoreceptors of the smaller  median eyes (ocelli) located on the anterior part of the animalÃ†s shell along the midline.  Another major surprise was the large number of different opsin types encoded in the horseshoe crabÃ†s genome (18) and that most are expressed.  Until our recent studies, it had been thought that horseshoe crabs express two different types of opsins.  We detected messenger RNAs for ten different opsins among eyes and ten in the animalÃ†s central nervous system.    Thus, photosensitivity in horseshoe crabs is far more complex than previously thought.   How horseshoe crab survival might be impacted by this complexity  of opsin expression is yet to be determined.   However, the phenomena we observed in horseshoe crabs, particularly regarding opsin co-expression and the diurnal regulation of opsin expression, are likely to be observed in a variety of species as opsin expression is examined in more diverse animals.  For example, similar phenomena were described recently in mosquitoes.   Broader Impacts.  This research provided research training for five undergraduates, four of whom are co-authors on manuscripts.  During the first three years of this grant I ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
