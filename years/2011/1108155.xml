<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a recipient of funding through the NSF EAPSI program, I spent the summer of 2011 as a JSPS Summer Fellow in the laboratory of Professor Takashi Ooi, a leader in the field of chiral onium salts for organic ion-pair catalysis, at Nagoya University in Japan.  A majority of my tenure in the Ooi group focused on the development of an enantioselective hydroxylation of 3-substituted oxindoles with molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant by employing a novel triazolium catalyst that was previously developed for alkylations of oxindoles.  Upon arrival in Nagoya, work commenced on the synthesis of several new triazolium catalysts that can be obtained in 10 steps from their respective amino acid (alanine, valine, and leucine).  These catalysts were screened under general reaction conditions to determine that the alanine-derived catalyst afforded the highest levels of enantioinduction.  Despite moderate levels of enantioselectivity (72% ee), the reaction was found to suffer from low conversions despite the presence of excess base and active catalyst.  Extensive screening of reaction conditions was conducted to ascertain the cause of low reactivity by varying the solvent, temperature, base, oxidant, reductant, and additives.  Despite these efforts, conversions remained low enough to reduce the synthetic utility of the method; however, the knowledge obtained from these experiments provided valuable insight into the mechanistic pathway of the reaction and will be utilized in the further development of the reaction and related processes.  The development of the title reaction is currently being carried out by a first-year graduate student in the Ooi group who I worked closely with during my time in Nagoya.  Upon completion of the product, the reaction will serve as a highly general and practical method for the hydroxylation of oxindoles, which will have a direct application to a wide range of biologically active compounds.  A week and a half before my return to the US, my work in the Ooi group shifted towards a project that I was working on before my departure to Japan.  Utilizing an iminophosphorane catalyst developed in the Ooi group, it was discovered that the direct aldolization of &alpha;-alkyl-&alpha;-hydroxy phosphonoacetates to aldehydes could be realized with excellent levels of diastereo- and enantioselectivity.  Based on the results obtained during my time in Japan as a NSF EAPSI Fellow, Professor Ooi extended an invitation to host me for a further three months in order to continue work on the development of the aforementioned direct aldolization.   My time in Japan exposed me to various new laboratory techniques that differ from the US and provided me with hands on training in a new area of chemistry.  Although my time in Japan was spent working long hours in the laboratory, the lifelong friends and contacts that I made while working in the Ooi group are invaluable.  My coworkers served as my lifeline while in Japan and provided me with in-depth insights into the cultural aspects of Japanese life.  During Obon, I was able to travel through the Ch?bu and Kansai regions of Japan for ten days.  The NSF EAPSI program not only provided me with the unique opportunity to travel to Japan to perform research, but it provided the necessary contact to spark a research collaboration between my research group in the US and my hostÆs group in Japan that has already led to second trip to Japan to conduct further research.
