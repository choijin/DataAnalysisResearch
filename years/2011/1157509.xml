<AbstractNarration>This proposal is catalyzing a new collaborative research project between the research group of Jim Pfaendtner (PI) at University of Washington and the Molecular Spectroscopy Group at the Max Planck Institute in Mainz, Germany (key collaborators Prof. Dr. Mischa Bonn and Dr. Tobias Weidner).  In the summer of 2012 the researchers will have a two-week planning visit to discuss in detail a new computational methodology for coupling computer simulations with protein-surface experiments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interactions between an adsorbed protein or enzyme and a surface are critical to controlling the orientation and stability of this interface.  To name only a few examples, protein-surface interactions govern biomaterial function, sensors and biofuel cells.  In spite of this great importance, we currently do not have the ability to determine the molecular-scale structural details of these systems.  It is believed that the proposed molecular dynamics (MD) based simulation approaches of protein/surface interactions can tightly couple with the techniques used by the experimental group at MPI Mainz.  Combining these approaches holds great potential, but a short planning visit is required in order to identify specific model systems and funding opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided funding for the PI and a graduate student to travel to Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Polymerforschung (MPI-P) in Mainz, Germany for a research collaboration and planning meeting.   The trip took place in June, 2013 and lasted two weeks.  The principal goals of the trip were:   1) Share research strengths and identify areas of new collaboration  2) Plan for joint proposal submissions to be considered for funding by the DFG and the NSF   3) Identify additional small collaborative research projects that can be pursued independent of the receipt of external grant funding   The visit was very successfull.  Within 4 months of the visit, the PI and collaborator (Dr. Tobias Weidner) had already submitted one joint proposal.  Two collaborative research projects are now underway with research publications planned for submission later in 2013.  As a result of the collaboration three new projects have been initiated, all of which focus on complementary strengths of the PI and the host research group.  The PI develops and uses new methods to perform molecular simulatinos of protein/surface interactions.  The collaborators group probes the orientation and conformation with a suite of experimental tools.  There is significant overlap between the experimental and theoretical toolkit, and as a result of this NSF CNIC grant, we have identified multiple paths forward to achieve tight integration of the complementary techniques.
