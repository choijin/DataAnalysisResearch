<AbstractNarration>1153340(Cortes-Caminero). AIChE will co-host, with EPA and NSF, a workshop that is intended to catalyze the advancement of the design of sustainable supply chains nationwide. The workshop will be held at NSF on September 12-13, 2011.  This workshop will bring together government leaders, industry representatives, and academic experts to chart the way forward on design of sustainable supply chains. It will provide a forum for university, federal agency and industry thought leaders to share their vision for sustainable supply chain design, outlining challenges, knowledge gaps, and research needs.  This workshop will foster partnerships necessary to develop and propagate sustainable supply chain design.  The workshop program, presentations and related resources will be placed on the Internet for the public at large. In addition, a final report will be issued that contains recommendations on areas in need of research.  The report will identify the greatest opportunities for, and the obstacles that might hinder the creation of sustainable supply chains.</AbstractNarration>

This situation is exacerbated by the fact that competing economic and regulatory drivers often create barriers to effective collaboration between industry and policy-makers around the topics of sustainability or environmental conservation.  The workshop participants examined the following questions:  What are the challenging industrial and societal problems to be solved?

Where are the gaps in knowledge?  What are the problems faced by existing sustainable design capabilities?  What are the opportunities for design of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
