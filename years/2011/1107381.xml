<AbstractNarration>Linking Belowground Phenology and Ecosystem Function in a Warming Arctic ? Non-technical abstract (E. Post, PI)&lt;br/&gt;This project comprises a four-year, passive warming experiment of low-Arctic tundra vegetation at a long-term study site in Greenland, with the primary aim of measuring the response of plant roots to warming, and the role of this response in ecosystem carbon exchange.  Phenology, the annual timing and progression of events such as aboveground plant growth, is a well-studied an important component of the ecology of climate change, but remains under-studied belowground.  This study will estimate and compare above- and belowground responses of plant phenology to warming and their respective contributions to ecosystem function, specifically the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and tundra.  It will furthermore determine which plant types, e.g., shrubs or grasses, show the greater belowground response to warming and contribution to ecosystem carbon exchange.  &lt;br/&gt;Novel insights into the expected response of the Arctic to climate change will emerge from this experiment, which will also expand the infrastructure for field-based experimental and observational research in the Arctic.  This research will promote the involvement of under-represented groups by recruitment of students through Penn State?s Minority Undergraduate Research Experience program, and promote education and dissemination of its results through a summer field ecology module at the study site and in courses at Penn State and the University of Alaska-Anchorage.  Results will also be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences by participating students and the Principal Investigators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project has revealed that the initiation of above-ground growth is not synchronized with the initiation of below-ground growth in either of the two plant lifeforms investigated: grasses and shrubs. We found peak root growth occurred two and one half weeks before leaf growth. Indeed, roots grew at temperatures at or below 0 C. Timing of spring root growth does not appear controlled by carbon produced during spring photosynthesis. This may uncouple timing of spring root with that of shoot growth and activity. Consistent with such uncoupling, spring leaf cover was advanced by warming and delayed by herbivory, but neither treatment significantly affected root growth timing.  A general conceptual model on controls of root phenology was developed in relation to climate change.    Spring carbon fluxes were not closely linked to spring root growth.  While root biomass far exceeds shoot biomass in these systems, it does not appear that timing of root growth in the spring is the main driver of spring ecosystem carbon fluxes, but more controlled by plant photosynthesis. While experimental warming did not strongly alter the duration separating early season root and shoot growth, our results suggest that continued warming may elicit such changes in both of these functional groups. This may have implications for ecosystem function and carbon dynamics, especially towards the end of the growing season.
