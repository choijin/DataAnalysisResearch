<AbstractNarration>Researchers from the University of Connecticut, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Harvard University plan to address three questions related to the global biogeochemical mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) cycles, namely (1) what are the abiotic and biotic mechanisms for formation of methylated Hg and Se compounds in the upper ocean?; (2) what is the role of photochemical reactions in air-sea exchange of Hg and Se?; and (3) how are the biogeochemical cycles of Hg and Se related?  To attain their goal, the scientists will participate in a cruise of opportunity to the Tropical North Pacific, as well as carry out laboratory culture and controlled incubation experiments.  Samples collected during the cruise will be used to determine the speciation of Hg and Se, as well as obtain measurements of photochemical status (i.e., UV, ozone, light levels, chemical (i.e., natural organic matter, redox metals), and biological (i.e., chlorophyll a, phytoplankton composition,proteomics, estimates of carbon mineralization) properties.  The laboratory culture and controlled incubation experiments will be used to determine the specific pathways for Hg and Se compound formation and degradation, especially the role of photochemical transformations, as well as assess the importance of Se as a binding ligand for Hg in the marine environment.  Lastly, the researchers will continue to develop the oceanic sub-model of the GEOS-Chem global biochemical Hg model to include the cycling of Se and will use the model to ascertain the importance of various processes of conversion and evasion in the global cycles of these two elements.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards broader impacts, this study has societal benefits because it would improve our understanding on how mercury enters seafood which impacts human health.  Results from the research would be included in curriculum material.  One graduate student from the University of Connecticut, one postdoc from Harvard University, and one graduate student from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution would be supported and trained as part of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project contributed to the development of a global 3-D model for mercury cycling in the oceans (Figure 1) and a preliminary model for the global air-sea exchange of selenium.  Our research provided insight into factors controlling the reactivity and loss of mercury from the ocean to the atmosphere, as well as factors driving uptake of the neurotoxic and bioaccumulative species, methylmercury.  We found that the fraction of elemental mercury in surface waters is highest in offshore waters and this is correlated with a higher fraction of degraded terrestrial organic matter.  Marine dissolved organic matter appears to have little impact on uptake of methylmercury by cells but terrestrial dissolved organic matter can inhibit uptake at high concentrations.  We also measured for the first time active production of the bioaccumulative species, methylmercury, in oxic estuarine seawater. Understanding these processes is important for anticipating the effects of future climate-driven changes in freshwater discharges on contaminants such as methylmercury in marine food webs. This work has more broadly contributed to a 3-D biogeochemical modeling capability for persistent global contaminants that is available to the global community of GEOS-Chem and MITgcm users.  This research was also used to inform the negotiations of the global Minamata Convention for controlling anthropogenic mercury released led by the United Nations Environment Programme in 2013.
