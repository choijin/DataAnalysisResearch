<AbstractNarration>This is a 5-year scientific collaboration to investigate the dynamics in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) over the Andes Mountains in northern Chile. The objective is to characterize and understand wave phenomenology in the 80 to 100 km region, including background state interactions and effects. The investigation will be carried out at the newly established Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) at Cerro Pachón (30.3°S, 70.7°W, 2530 m), Chile. This location is uniquely important for wave studies because it is a region of steep terrain and prolific wave generation that produces particularly pure examples of terrain generated waves due to the extreme dryness of the area and relative lack of convection, and it provides data for  a region, the subtropical Southern Hemisphere, that currently is poorly characterized in terms of planetary waves, tides and gravity waves.  The suite of instruments at ALO comprises a Na wind/temperature lidar, an all sky imager, a multichannel photometer, a mesospheric temperature mapper, an infrared camera, and a meteor radar, which will be used to observe waves and wave phenomena over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The project aims to provide the most detailed study to date from a Southern Hemisphere mountainous site of the characteristics and variability of instabilities, gravity waves, tides, planetary waves and mean winds and their interactions over a continuous 5-year period. Specific questions that will be addressed include:  &lt;br/&gt;1) What is the climatology of waves and wave related phenomenology over the Andes?&lt;br/&gt;2) What are the origins, lifecycle and morphology of instabilities at ALO?&lt;br/&gt;3) What atmospheric conditions lead to the formation of various wave phenomena?&lt;br/&gt;4) What are the characteristics of the interactions between tides, planetary waves and gravity waves and their effects on the MLT variability? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide new education and training opportunities for students at all three universities involved. International collaborations with strong student involvement will also be pursued under this project with the Ciudad Universitaria, Argentina and the University of Adelaide, Australia.  The unique dataset collected during this project will be made available to the scientific community and will support research on a wide range of scientific topics in both atmospheric science and astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This 5-year research grant supported novel collaborative optical measurements of "weather" events in the Earth?s upper atmosphere from the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO), located at the Cerro Pachon Observatory, Chile (30.3&deg;S, 70.7&deg;W, 2530 m), high in the Andes Mountain Range.  The ALO was established in 2009 and houses several optical instruments, including the Utah State University (USU) Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (MTM).  This is a robust digital camera system designed to measure a broad-spectrum of atmospheric waves, colloquially termed "gravity waves".  These waves are imaged continuously at night throughout the year as they propagate into the upper levels of the Earth?s atmosphere (called the "mesosphere" at an altitude of about 87 km, or 50 miles).   Gravity waves (GW) are a naturally occurring atmospheric phenomenon generated by strong weather disturbances, such as fronts, storms and intense winds blowing over high mountain ranges, such as the Andes. They are important as they can transfer huge amounts of energy upwards into the atmosphere when they break, like wavers on a beach.  At lower altitudes, GW breaking creates the unsettling, and sometimes dangerous, turbulence felt by passengers flying over mountainous regions.  At higher altitudes, GW breaking can create major "weather disturbances". The Andes region therefore provides an excellent natural laboratory for investigating GWs and measuring their influences on the mesospheric region where future space planes will fly.    Our studies have achieved the primary goals. The MTM has operated automatically throughout the program resulting in approximately 9 years of near-continuous, high quality data for characterizing gravity wave events and their seasonal variability, where coordinated observations have previously been sparse. This is our longest MTM data set and analyses to date have yielded the following key results: (a) new evidence for "mountain generated waves" propagating into the upper mesosphere including the winter-time conditions under which they occur, their spatial scales and temporal intermittency, and (b) the energy transported by GW over the Andes was found to be ~50% larger (on average) than that previously measured by the same MTM over Maui, Hawaii, in the central Pacific Ocean, under different GW forcing conditions. In addition, this well-characterized data set has enabled novel studies of long-term mesospheric temperature variability in the upper atmosphere over the Andes.  A Physics graduate student at USU, recently gained his Ph.D. (July 2018) analyzing and interpreting the MTM data from ALO reported herein.
