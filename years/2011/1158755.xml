<AbstractNarration>Private foundation funding of academic research has grown substantially over the past 10 years. Increasingly, foundations employ a new strategic funding process modeled after venture capital investing, in which project outcomes are identified by the sponsor with a specific problem to be solved, a team is selected based their potential contribution and a community of common inquiry is created and funded over a long period of time.  This new funding model originated with disease-oriented foundations, such as Michael J. Fox and Faster Cures and is diffusing to other types of foundations and agencies within the federal government, suggesting that this new model may offer advantages to scientific inquiry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, despite the growing importance of foundations and strategic funding models, little is known either about whether foundations complement or substitute for other sources of founding or whether strategic funding practices can enhance the overall functioning of the American research enterprise.  This study considers the role of private foundation funding in the larger university research enterprise as well as the impact -- both in terms of research practices and research outcomes -- of this new strategic funding model.  This project describes how the university research enterprise is evolving in response to the demands of new funding sources coupled with increased institutional fiscal pressures and calls for greater problem solving relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project uses detailed records of research proposals, funded projects, and intellectual property (IP) agreements from a set of diverse research universities to make three intellectual contributions. First, it examines the extent to which private foundation sponsorship provides a new model of research funding that affects the conduct of research. Second, it compares the contractual agreements of foundations employing strategic practices to managing funded projects to the contractual research agreements of other sponsors to assess the extent to which a new open model of innovation is being implemented.  Finally, it evaluates the extent to which foundations, in general, and venture philanthropy in particular, complement or substitute other types of funding sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The current omission of foundation and nonprofit funding presents a confounding effect that would introduce downward bias in the estimation of the impact of public funding. This study expands the discussion of the funding of academic research to recognize the role of foundations and further to consider differences in funding strategies and the use of contractual terms in sponsored research agreements.  Recognition of this richness provides evidence useful for measuring the impacts of research funding and the ongoing debate about the efficacy of different research funding strategies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report     The Evolving Research Enterprise project studied the role of foundations in the evolving enterprise of academic research. The researchers set out to describe the phenomenon of venture philanthropy in academic research and assess the extent to which it provides a new model of research funding.  They also worked to understand how attributes of venture philanthropy affect the conduct of research, and considered the relationship of foundation funding to other funding sources and to commercial outcomes.     This research project started with the creation of a dataset of research grants awarded to four universities (and 5 campuses) between the years of 2000-2012. After initially collecting this data, the team spent quite a bit of time cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis. Though the university datasets had a lot of the same information, the way data was stored, reported, and labeled varied significantly across the universities. Reconciling the data included cross-walking variables across universities, and ensuring that the same filters and rules were used for each university?s dataset. Once the data was thoroughly cleaned, we aggregated the data, resulting in a database with 46,440 award projects. Data on the projects included: award amount per year (broken down to direct and indirect funds per year), sponsor name, sponsor type, department name, department type (aligned to NSF Broad Categories), start and end year, project PI, and project title.     The research team investigated the variation in award IDC rates (indirect cost rates) among project sponsors. The team found significant variation in the amount of indirect funding provided&mdash;both from different funding types, as well as to different academic fields within a university. The rate variation has important implications for the sustainability of the university research enterprise.  In examining star scientists and team performance in the context of academic entrepreneurship, we find that the counterfactual pairing of star principal investigators with non-star teams creates lower synergies than counterfactual pairing of star-teams to non-star principal investigators. We take this result as an indication that the contribution of the constellations to overall joint performance is relatively more significant than the contribution of the stars.  Finally, we found that venture philanthropy presents a new model of research funding that is particularly helpful to those fighting orphan diseases. This model includes active management of the commercialization process to accelerate scientific progress and material outcomes. In examining the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the development of the drug Kalydeco&reg;, we found that the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation adapted to a venture philanthropy model and took an active role in drug development, stewarding the commercialization process from funding basic scientific work in academic institutions, to making an equity investment in a start-up firm.
