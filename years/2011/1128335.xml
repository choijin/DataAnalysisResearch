<AbstractNarration>The concept of large area electronics builds on facile solution processing and inexpensive raw materials. Towards this end, the project has two primary technical tasks. In the first task, we intend to thoroughly characterize and optimize a novel form of solution processable graphene that has superior optical and electrical properties. In the second task, we intend to demonstrate a facile patterning method for integration into large area organic electronics. The intellectual merit of the proposal arises from its materials science impact ? a realistic material that is transparent, flexible, solution processable and can be readily implemented as universal electrodes in a variety of organic electronics devices has yet to be demonstrated. The broader impacts of the proposed project arise from the societal impact of a fast switching and low power consuming electronics that are inexpensive will be tremendous.  Large area electronics are used in wide ranging consumer devices and the use of reduced graphene electrodes could lead to devices that would encourage more standby operations, save energy and extend battery life. The educational goals of this proposal are to provide research experience for undergraduates, provide laboratory modules for K ? 12 teachers that can be demonstrated in schools, and to participate in the enrichment activities of the Nanotechnology for Clean Energy IGERT Program (Director is the PI of this proposal). In addition to the above, an active international collaboration is planned with Imperial College London.</AbstractNarration>
