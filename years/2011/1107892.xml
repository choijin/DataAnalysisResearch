<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research on Carbon, Water, and Energy Balance of the Arctic Landscape&lt;br/&gt;at Flagship Observatories in Alaska and Siberia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arctic landscape interacts with the global and regional climate by exchanging carbon dioxide, methane, water, and energy with the atmosphere.  Understanding how these exchanges are regulated and how they change is a key goal of the US Study of Environmental Arctic Change and the NSF Arctic Observatory Network.  The first goal of this work is year round monitoring of carbon, water, and energy balance at two arctic sites, Imnavait Creek in Alaska and Cherskii in Siberia.  The work will be a collaboration among researchers from the Marine Biological Laboratory, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Northeast Science Station, Russia, and the University of Michigan.  The second goal is the development of these two sites as  ?Flagship? observatories for research on arctic lands and freshwaters.  The main task here is to integrate the new carbon, water, and energy balance data with the already large, diverse, and growing data bases from other research done at these sites.  A third aim is to promote PanArctic comparisons and development of PanArctic data bases.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; Broader impacts include contributions to education, including underrepresented groups, through participation in the Logan Science Journalism program, the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research Schoolyard program, and outreach to Native Alaskan communities.  Research and education infrastructure will be enhanced by making the data bases available online.  Benefits to society include improved understanding of the impacts of climate change, especially in Alaska where the local residents are closely tied to the land through traditional, subsistence lifestyles.</AbstractNarration>

This AON project was a collaboration between University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), the Marine Biological Laboratory, and the University of Michigan; the UAF portion focused on extending continuous, year-round measurements of C, water, and energy balance in terrestrial ecosystems in the Alaskan and Siberian Arctic, which we have collected via eddy covariance since 2007.

However, permafrost temperature in a borehole near our site was the warmest north of the Brooks Range in the Thermal State of Permafrost network, and has increased steadily since 2006. Soil temperatures in late fall and early winter in 2014 were high, and soils did not freeze fully until late December, about 8 weeks later than usual. Warm fall soil temperatures likely promoted C loss, because soil microbial activity could continue at a high rate for a longer period of time. C loss correlated with the length of time in fall during which the soil is at 0 <sup>o</sup>C, even though air temperature is below freezing; this occurs because the latent heat of freezing water retards soil cooling. Together, these observations suggest that this area may be close to crossing a tipping point of permafrost thaw. In contrast, all three tundra ecosystems showed net C uptake during summer. Eddy covariance data showed that summer C uptake increased over time in the tussock and heath sites, but not in the wet sedge.
