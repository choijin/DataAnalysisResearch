<AbstractNarration>The endocrine control of animal growth is far more complex than generally presumed.  A common model for growth regulation suggests that growth hormone (GH) released from the pituitary gland stimulates the production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I in the liver, which in turn stimulates many of the resulting growth processes.  This is known as somatomediation.  The model is almost 40 years old and is a ubiquitous feature in Endocrinology textbooks.  However, several recent studies suggest alternatively that IGF-I produced locally (e.g. in muscle &amp; bones) is a far more important regulator of growth than is circulating IGF-I, although these studies define growth almost entirely from a bone perspective.  The model ignores other regulatory factors (e.g. myostatin) and does not incorporate recent studies suggesting that growth dependency on circulating IGF-I may be a tissue-specific phenomenon.  In fact, recent data suggest that myostatin, a potent negative and local regulator of muscle growth, may also inhibit hepatic IGF-I production and that muscle is more dependent upon circulating IGF-I than is bone.  A better understanding of somatomediation and how it is influenced by myostatin will help explain this extremely important endocrine concept.  The objective of this research project is to determine myostatin's novel endocrine role in negatively regulating somatomediation.  The central hypothesis is that myostatin's ability to inhibit striated muscle growth is mediated in part by directly reducing the hepatic production of IGF-I and its bioavailability in circulation.  The hypotheses will be tested by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) determine how myostatin regulates circulating IGF-I, (2) determine how myostatin-regulated liver IGF-I production controls striated muscle growth and (3) determine myostatin's impact on pituitary GH release. Graduate and undergraduate students will perform these studies and will include those from under-represented groups.  Results from the studies will be incorporated into courses taught by the principle investigator and will be presented in joint seminars with the Washington Center for Muscle Biology in addition to being broadly disseminated through traditional venues.  The studies will also benefit society as a whole through many outreach activities that target K-12 students, their families and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific merit.  Our long-term goal was to better understand striated muscle growth.  The objective was to determine how a factor secreted almost exclusively from muscle and heart, myostatin, controls organismal growth by in turn controlling the production of a known growth regulator, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1).  Our central hypothesis was that myostatin?s ability to inhibit striated muscle growth is mediated in part by directly reducing liver production of IGF1 and also its concentration in the blood.  Myostatin is known to affect muscle directly, but is not known to act as a legitimate hormone whereby it enters the bloodstream and regulates not only muscle, but also other tissues.  We tested this hypothesis by (1) determining how myostatin regulates circulating IGF-I, (2) determining how myostatin-regulated liver IGF1 production controls muscle growth and (3) determining myostatin?s impact on pituitary growth hormone (GH) release.  This last aim was particularly important as GH secretion controls IGF1 production and circulating levels and this in turn stimulates the growth of many different tissues.  Our studies determined that myostatin indeed inhibited GH-induced IGF1 production in liver cells, that this compromised muscle growth even when the myostatin gene was removed and that myostatin controlled the development and function of the pituitary gland.  Furthermore, our studies suggest that myostatin controls the pools of stem cells within muscle, heart, fat and the pituitary gland that together controls the growth of these tissues.  These studies are the first to identify myostatin as a legitimate "hormone" and have helped revise the most recognized model for growth regulation, the somatomedin model.  We also serendipitously discovered a means to attenuate the actions of myostatin specifically in muscle and heart using a non-pathogenic virus to deliver the smad7 gene.  Treating mice with this vector greatly enhanced muscle growth and prevented the wasting of muscle and heart when mice were implanted with colon cancer cells.  We have since patented this gene therapeutic and are developing the intellectual property through a new biotechnology company, AAVogen Inc.  Broader Impact.  Our goal was to build upon the PI?s strength in integrating research with teaching and with outreach in the community.  To this end, 10 trainees were supported by this award while in the PI?s laboratory and an additional 21 trainees were supported indirectly through collaborative publications.  The PI continued to volunteer in local schools by giving presentations in the "gifted and talented" program and in regular classrooms.  He also integrated results from these studies into his lectures and managed the Washington Center for Muscle Biology.
