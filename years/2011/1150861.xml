<AbstractNarration>This NSF CAREER award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program supports the development of technology for cryopreservation of cell-based therapeutics.  Cell-based therapies have the potential to treat a wide variety of medical conditions, ranging from neurodegenerative diseases to cancer, and cryopreservation enables long-term storage of living cells, which would greatly facilitate supply chain management for cell therapy products.  This proposal addresses two major deficiencies in current cryopreservation technology.  The first is the inconvenience of removing cryoprotectant additives (CPAs) after thawing.  As an example, the current procedure for removal of CPAs from red blood cells takes over an hour, making it impractical to use cryopreserved blood in emergency situations.  The second deficiency relates to toxicity during vitrification, a cryopreservation strategy based on the use of high CPA concentrations to suppress ice formation.  Vitrification is particularly promising for cell types that respond poorly to conventional freezing procedures, such as granulocytes.  However, for vitrification to reach its full potential, new strategies are needed to minimize toxicity, particularly during CPA addition and removal.  Thus, both of these deficiencies are primarily caused by inadequacies in current CPA addition and removal procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research uses a novel mathematical optimization strategy to predict CPA addition and removal procedures that minimize toxicity and protocol duration, while simultaneously avoiding osmotic damage.  The resulting procedures involve continuous changes in the extracellular solution composition that are not possible to implement with the centrifugation-based operations that are currently in use.  This project proposes the use of microfluidic processes to impose precise control over the time-varying extracellular solution composition, enabling implementation of the mathematically optimized CPA addition and removal procedures.  This work is expected to dramatically decrease the time required for CPA removal, which will greatly facilitate the use of cryopreserved cells for cell-based therapies, and it will reduce toxicity during CPA addition and removal, which will open new possibilities for vitrification of valuable cell types such as granulocytes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the integrated education and outreach efforts is to foster the development of a diverse science and engineering workforce with a deep understanding of mass transfer.  To this end, the objectives are to (1) develop new software tools for teaching mass transfer that allow students to conduct "virtual experiments" involving cell membrane mass transfer and microfluidic separation processes, and (2) recruit and retain Latinos in science and engineering careers by engaging Latino undergraduate and high school students in summer research projects and through participation in OSU's Latino summer camp, which serves students from grades 3 to 12.</AbstractNarration>

The predicted time-minimized procedure for removal of glycerol requires rapid and precise changes in extracellular solution composition to prevent osmotic damage.  The centrifugal cell washers that are currently used for processing RBCs are not capable of implementing such rapid and precise changes in solution composition.

A promising membrane-based microfluidic device was developed and shown to enable 50% removal of glycerol in a single pass without excessive osmotic damage.  In parallel with development of microfluidic devices, a series of experiments were performed to better understand the biophysical properties of RBCs and to validate the mathematically optimized procedures. Overall, the results of these experiments suggest a broad distribution of glycerol permeability values in human RBCs, which makes it challenging to design of a one-size-fits-all method for glycerol removal. Nonetheless, the results confirm the potential for significantly reducing the glycerol removal time compared with existing methods.      A similar approach was used for the investigation of granulocyte cryopreservation.  Granulocytes are a type of white blood cell that help fight infection, and there has been increased interest in granulocyte transfusions as a treatment for patients with weakened immune systems.  As a first step toward development of an effective cryopreservation procedure, a systemic study was performed to quantify the permeability of the human granulocyte membrane to various different CPAs.  The resulting permeability data was used to design and test methods for cryopreservation of granulocytes using glycerol.  The results of these experiments suggest that glycerol is toxic to granulocytes, and hence not a very effective CPA. Nonetheless, the permeability properties determined in this project lay the groundwork for continued investigation of granulocyte cryopreservation using other CPAs, such as dimethyl sulfoxide or ethylene glycol.     To test the new strategy for minimizing cytotoxicity during CPA addition and removal, experiments were performed using cultured endothelial cells.  Using toxicity-minimized CPA equilibration methods, it was possible to achieve high enough CPA concentrations for vitrification of the sample, without causing statistically significant damage to the cells.  In contrast, conventional methods for CPA equilibration resulted in nearly complete cell destruction.     In summary, this research has established new strategies for reducing processing time and toxicity during CPA equilibration, which has the potential to improve cryopreservation outcomes for various valuable cell types.
