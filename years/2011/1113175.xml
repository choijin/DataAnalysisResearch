<AbstractNarration>This project will stimulate a new international research initiative between Howard University, the Los Angeles Counnty Museum of Natural History, and the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (CAS), Beijing.  It leverages expertise and specialized skills, facilities, and/or other resources of the foreign collaborator(s) and access to the collections at the Natural History Museum of Ethiopia.  Chinese colleagues are seeking funding from the Chinese Natural National Science Foundation to facilitate their research on this project and for the training of a Chinese national student at Howard University. PIs will develop web content and e-exhibits on hipparion evolution, biogeography and paleodiet for all involved institutions at Howard University. The innovative high risk-high return nature of this proposal makes it a suitable fit for an EAGER.  Letters of collaboration and permission for access to relevant Ethiopian museum collections are provided.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved the study of lineages of hipparionine, 3 toed horses, previously known as the Sivalhippus Complex (hereafter SC).  This study documented: the origin of the most primitive clade(s) of the SC, their provincial evolution, geographic extension and evolutionary radiation throughout Eurasia and Africa.  This study confirmed that the most primitive clade, Sivalhippus initially arose in IndoPakistan circa 10.4 Ma following entry of the North American immigrant taxon Cormohipparion into Indo-Pakstan.  Two additional clades arose circa 7 Ma, Plesiohipparion, in China and Eurygnathohippus in Africa.  These last 2 clades are believed to be related but soon had disjunct geographic distributions.  Plesiohipparion first appeared in East and West China and extended its range into Turkey, Central Europe and Western Europe, perhaps multiple times between 5 and 2.5 Ma.  Eurynathohippus arose, and was confined to Africa beginning circa 7 Ma.  The last clade to appear was Proboscidipparion which apparently originated in China circa 5 Ma. and made an extension into Turkey circa 4.0 Ma.  These relationships were elucidated over the course of the grant term, but in the last 6 months the PI investigated the oldest and most primitive hipparions from the Vienna Basin, Austria Pannonian C horizons.  This study, not yet published, elucidated the characters of the oldest and most primitive hipparions and found that two characters in these hipparions have been found only in the African clade Eurygnathohippus: co-presence of ectostylids and pli caballinids on the adult mandibular cheek teeth.  This implies that members of the Sivalhippus Complex have their genetic history in the deepest part of the late Miocene soon after the initial immigration event.  Together with these members of the SC complex there were other genus-level taxa that radiated in the Old World Neogene and Quaternary, including: Cormohipparion, Hippotherium Hipparion s.s., Cremohipparion, and Baryhipparion. Beyond resolving the alpha systematics of Old World hipparions, we have gained new insights into the timing and geochronology of Old World hipparions and their paleoecological characteristics. This work has enabled better interprovincial to intercontinental scale geological correlations across Eurasia, Africa and North America where the genus Cormohipparion originated.
