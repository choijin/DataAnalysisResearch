<AbstractNarration>Because natural landscapes are changing rapidly, understanding the factors that determine how organisms select both habitats and resources remains a central question in ecology.  Theory predicts that animals can balance the costs posed by food quantity or quality, predation risk, and the physical environment, but few studies have adequately assessed how multiple variables interact at spatial and temporal scales that are functionally relevant to a foraging animal.  This research offers a new and synthetic approach to understand functional links between habitat features and habitat use. It combines behavioral, nutritional, chemical, spatial, and physiological ecology to evaluate comprehensively the factors that influence habitat use by generalist and specialist herbivores: two species of rabbits. Tradeoffs among four habitat features (nutrients in food, toxins in food, security cover, and thermal cover) will be measured in the laboratory and under natural field conditions to model and compare the functional importance of these features.  The investigators will integrate results to predict resource selection and infer habitat quality when organisms are faced with complex decisions in natural environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops a new method for quantifying habitat value in a relatively simple system that will enhance predictions of the consequences of environmental change in more complex systems.  It includes a novel educational model that trains graduate, undergraduate, and high school students who will conduct research collaboratively across three universities, participate in a tiered mentoring program, and engage with the community and regional biologists.   This research and educational program is designed to broaden the scientific experience of students, to foster collaborations between academia, land management agencies and the public, and to contribute to society by providing models that predict how animals will alter their use of habitats in rapidly changing ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

Our goal was to develop a new way to model habitat selection by animals that addresses the &ldquo;why&rdquo; question and also allows us to measure the value of different resources to those animals.&nbsp; We tackled this issue by studying the pygmy rabbit, the world&rsquo;s smallest rabbit that lives only in the sagebrush rangelands of the western USA.&nbsp; Pygmy rabbits are a species of conservation concern that use sagebrush shrubs for food, security from predators, and shelter from extreme temperatures.&nbsp; Sagebrush smells great because it contains several different chemicals that are meant to discourage browsing by animals, but pygmy rabbits have an interesting ability to tolerate these chemicals.&nbsp; Most other animals like cottontail rabbits cannot eat as much of the plant chemicals.&nbsp;</p> <p>We conducted two types of research: 1) studies of habitat selection by captive pygmy and cottontail rabbits where we controlled the options available and limited confounding factors, and 2) field studies where we observed the behavior of free-ranging, wild rabbits.&nbsp; In the captive experiments, we offered rabbits different combinations of food, security and temperature, and we measured their choices.&nbsp; We developed a mathematical model that allowed us to quantify how much of one they would tradeoff for another (for example, how much food quality they would give up to forage in a safe versus risky location).&nbsp; Then, we compared tradeoffs between forage, security and temperature made by pygmy rabbits (diet and habitat specialists) with tradeoffs made by cottontail rabbits that are about twice the size of pygmy rabbits and are considered habitat generalists.&nbsp; Next, we went to the field and measured each of these properties (food, security, and thermal shelter) at many locations within our study sites in Idaho, and we used imagery collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to map these properties across the landscapes.&nbsp; We used GPS telemetry to track free-ranging pygmy rabbits and record their locations and habitat use during both summer and winter.&nbsp;</p> <p>We found that pygmy rabbits valued security more than food quality when compared to cottontails.&nbsp; This makes sense because they are smaller and potentially more vulnerable to a broader range of predators, and they can tolerate at least some plant chemicals better than cottontails.&nbsp; Also, temperature influenced the foraging behavior of both rabbit species &ndash; both ate more food and consumed forage with lower nutrition at colder temperatures, but temperature did not influence the amount of plant chemicals that animals consumed in the diet.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the field, we documented that pygmy rabbits traded off security and thermal shelter differently between seasons.&nbsp; During summer, rabbits selected shaded habitats with high concealment from predators, but activity levels were independent of ambient temperature.&nbsp; During winter, however, security, but not thermal properties, influenced selection of habitat, and activity was positively correlated with ambient temperature, especially during nighttime and early morning hours.&nbsp; The ability of animals to shift behavior with temperature might help to buffer them from the consequences of climate change, up to a point.&nbsp; Understanding what habitat resources animals value and how they tradeoff competing resource needs can help us to better manage multiple use landscapes to maintain quality habitat for wildlife.&nbsp; This is especially important when climate and landscapes are changing rapidly.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Janet&nbsp;L&nbsp;Rachlow</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1146166/1146166_10171176_1504062924941_adult_winter--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1146166/1146166_10171176_1504062924941_adult_winter--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Adult pygmy rabbit during winter"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1146166/1146166_10171176_1504062924941_adult_winter--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Adult pygmy rabbit during winter"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Pygmy rabbits are active throughout the year.
