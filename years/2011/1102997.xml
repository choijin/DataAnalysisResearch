<AbstractNarration>The NanoBio Science Partnership is led by Tuskegee University and includes partner universities (Auburn University, Alabama State University, Tuskegee University, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, and The University of Alabama); community colleges (Central Alabama Community College, Enterprise State Community College, Shelton State Community College, Wallace State Community College, Hanceville, and Wallace State Community College, Selma) and school districts (Barbour, Bullock, Dallas, Lee, Lowndes, Macon, Montgomery, Perry and Selma).  The partnership also includes supporting partners from the Alabama Math Science and Technology Initiative (AMSTI), the McWane Science Center, Cornell and Wisconsin Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers, the Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering (SECME), and local industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NanoBio Science Partnership addresses critical needs in middle grade (6th-8th) science education in the Black Belt region, an area that has long been characterized as socioeconomically and educationally disadvantaged.  The partnership provides professional development to 6th to 8th grade science teachers in order to shift their instruction from conventional teaching strategies to the use of an inquiry-centered approach in conjunction with the infusion of NanoBio science principles and 3-D simulations of concepts from their science curricula.  Curriculum modules that support inquiry are being developed for use by the teachers and are tied to the middle grade science curricular objectives.  The project also is recruiting and training prospective science teachers through the partnering universities' teacher preparation programs to provide them with an appropriately challenging and contemporary science curricula and teacher education foundation.  Data on student and teacher performance are collected and analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods.  Ultimately, the project will directly impact approximately 80 teachers and 10,000 students over five years.  The partnership seeks to make a lasting positive influence on education in the Black Belt region and its economy.  Findings in connection with research questions being studied in the project and in regards to the overall project evaluation are being synthesized in order to be disseminated broadly.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through generous support from the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s Math and Science Partnership (MSP) Program, a partnership of academia, business, and government stakeholders in Alabama has provided tens of thousands of middle school (grades 6, 7 and 8) students in the state&rsquo;s Black Belt region over the last nine years with unique and far-reaching learning experiences in Science courses. The partnership&rsquo;s focus on schools of the Alabama&rsquo;s Black Belt was motivated by a dire need to address pressing and long-standing concerns with outcomes in Science Education in the region, especially amongst students from communities that have traditionally been underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).</p> <p>The main focus of the MSP project was to provide training to 80 in-service middle school teachers in the partnership to teach Science concepts from the Alabama Course of Study through 60 innovative grade specific course modules that promote hands-on, inquiry-based learning and problem solving in the Sciences through culturally relevant lessons. Moreover, the course modules are designed to interact synergistically with powerful cutting-edge laboratory experiences wherein students are immersed in authentic science experiments. The modules and experiments were developed jointly by STEM and Education faculty from academic institutions in the MSP partnership, in close collaboration with the participating teachers. Collectively, these resources provide the necessary scaffolding for all students to build a robust knowledge of middle school Science concepts.</p> <p>The course modules have been disseminated widely through publications and presentations at numerous national events. They are posted online on the Alabama Learning Exchange (ALEX) so that teachers anywhere in the country may access to benefit students on a very large scale. They have also been published as a collection of modules contained in three books whose contents are organized by Science topics from each of the 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grade levels, a resource which is especially critical in communities that lack access to reliable Internet service. The course modules continue to be used extensively by teachers in many parts of the state of Alabama.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to providing training to the 80 in-service Science teachers in the use of project resources, the partnership has also recruited, mentored and supported 19 pre-service Science teachers who were enrolled in Teacher Education Programs at institutions in the MSP partnership. These teachers-in-training enhanced their field experiences by taking active roles in the development of the 60 course modules and in their implementation by teachers in the partnership schools. All pre-service teachers recruited by the MSP partnership have obtained their certification and have assumed teaching positions in high-needs middle schools in the state. They have joined the 80 in-service teachers that were trained by the MSP and are teaching Science using project advocated resources, which in turn will benefit thousands of students long into the future.</p> <p>Through the commitment of participating teachers to learning new instructional strategies and infusing in the classroom diverse sets of resources developed by the MSP project, middle school students have fortified critically important science concepts taught at the middles grades and solidified key competencies such as critical thinking, scientific reasoning, creativity and oral and written communication skills. With the global buy-in from school administration of the MSP developed instructional resources, Alabama&rsquo;s Black Belt region will continue to produce competitive middle school students with strong backgrounds in Science.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/13/2020<br>      Modified by: Mohammed&nbsp;A&nbsp;Qazi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div
