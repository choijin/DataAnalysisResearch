<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to reveal experimentally many unusual properties of graphene surface plasmon and to develop next-generation nanophotonic devices. This research will investigate localized surface plasmon resonances in doped graphene nanostructures, explore transverse electrical surface plasmon, and develop a pump-probe space-time-resolved spectroscopy method to study terahertz surface plasmon polaritons. Graphene-based active plasmonic devices including modulators, interferometers, and dynamic infrared frequency-selective surfaces will be demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to integrate fundamental research of graphene plasmonics with novel device applications. The research addresses the current needs and challenges of graphene plasmonics, designs and develops experimental techniques to understand basic properties of graphene surface plasmon. The development and demonstration of the proposed active plamsonic devices will further provide new understanding of manipulating light on a two-dimensional surface, paving the way for advanced applications of graphene as an active metamaterial. The proposed research is transformative in that it enables the development of a range of novel photonic devices with integration and functionality that cannot be achieved with conventional materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are to provide ultrasmall photonic devices and integrated electronic-photonic circuits for photonic industry and information technology, and to integrate cutting-edge research with education which provides a broader education opportunity for one of the most diverse student body in the nation. The education and outreach programs include the integration of the proposed research with the UH-based NSF programs, curriculum development for nanoengineering minor option, and providing summer camp and science projects for local high school students.</AbstractNarration>

More than 20 presentations at major conferences such as APS March meeting, ACS national meeting and MRS meetings. Filed one patent for applications of graphene in display and sensing.  Provide research experience for 7 REUs and 1 RET. Supported 5 graduate students and supervised 5 Ph.D. theses.      Significant Results:  Synthesized high-quality large-size bilayer twisted graphene, observed folded optical phonons in twisted bilayer graphene, observed enhanced 2D line in twisted bilayer graphene, provided a complete understanding of twisted bilayer graphene as a new type of superlattice, as well as new understanding of quantum interference effect on double-resonance Raman scattering. Many exotic effects have been discovered in twisted bilayer graphene, which still attracts a lot of attention.       Developed a new method to prepare clean graphene which can then be transferred to any substrates with a large size.

Thus, this work has opened wider new applications of graphene and other nanomaterials.      Revealed that the spatial self-phase modulation of a laser beam through graphene suspension is due to thermal-lens effect rather than the intrinsic non-linear optical property of graphene. Thermal lens effect is universal in the liquid suspension of nanomaterials, is mainly the property of solvents, should not be mistaken as the property of nanomaterials.

Graphene is just one example of a large family of two-dimensional materials. Understanding basic property of graphene will help to understand the basic properties of other 2D materials, especially the anisotropic optical constants and non-linear optical effect.       Demonstrated that 2D nanomaterials such as WS2 can emit and absorb light and surface plasmon at the same wavelength. By coupling WS2 to Ag nanowires, we then show that WS2 monolayers are able to excite and absorb surface plasmons of Ag nanowires at the same wavelength of exciton photoluminescence. Our demonstration of resonant optical generation and detection of surface plasmons enables nanoscale optical communication and paves the way for on-chip electronic&minus;photonic integrated circuits.     Other achievements:  Discovered a new optofluidics principle and demonstrated the generation of a steady-state water flow by a pulsed laser beam through a glass window. Laser streaming opens up new research and applications in optofluidics as well as traditional photoacoustics and acoustic streaming.       Developed several nanomaterial catalysts for efficient hydrogen generation, efficient electrochemical water splitting and solar water splitting. These new catalysts will help to develop even more efficient materials for solar water splitting.         Last Modified: 08/31/2017       Submitted by: Jiming Bao]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
