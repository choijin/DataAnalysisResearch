<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate how to improve end-user programmer productivity and learning through user interfaces and algorithms for capturing, sharing, and accessing programming expertise. Focus is on the needs of end-user programmers who create graphical user interfaces and build physical computing systems. Fieldwork and data analyese will be conducted to understand current practices around seeking and providing advice online. Informed by this framework, tools will be developind for creating and sharing high-quality examples and tutorials, finding and recommending relevant examples, and integrating found code into new projects. Success of the methods will be evaluated through laboratory experiments and deployment of instrumented software. This work draws on methodology from computer-supported cooperative work, end-user programming, the design of authoring tools, project-based learning, and design of computer-realized scaffolding. Four types of results will be produced: 1) knowledge about the types of problems end-user programmers seek help on; 2) analysis how current systems help and hinder the sharing of expertise; 3) novel techniques to improve expertise sharing within programming environments; and 4) evaluations that quantify the benefits of such techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmers increasingly rely on Web resources such as question answering sites, forums, and example repositories to help them prototype, implement, and debug software. This trend is especially prevalent in end-user programmers, who write code but are not professionally trained in Computer Science. They vastly outnumber professional programmers in the United States. Current development tools are largely ignorant of the social exchange of programming advice online: program editors and Web applications are isolated from each other. This lack of specific applications for describing and sharing programming expertise limits the effectiveness of both production and use of knowledge. This work will lower the threshold for programming digital media. The research will increase the quality, scope, and utility of online reference materials. Access to these materials can accelerate learning, improve productivity, increase self-efficacy of programmers, and democratize the production and sharing of programming knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An increasing number of jobs in the United States economy require familiarity with information technology and programming. People often learn programming concepts and skills online in two major ways: 1) through formal education in online classes such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs); 2) through informal education on blogs, question answering web sites, online forums and similar sites.   The objective of this research project was to improve how people learn programming topics online by introducing news ways that more knowledgable users such as teachers and experts can share their expertise with less knowledgable users.   For formal education, we studied how different functions of online learning platforms affect the engagement and learning outcomes of students in large programming courses. We also created a technique that helps teachers of such large courses more effectively review hundreds of homework assignments and write feedback on programming mistakes.   For informal education, we contributed several new techniques that help people produce better code examples they can then publish and share online. These techniques enable people to create short, concise examples from big, complicated programs; design step-by-step tutorials; and author automatic explanations for code found on any web page.   We evaluated these new techniques through controlled laboratory studies to characterize the benefits they have for people.
