<AbstractNarration>The upstream movement of waterfalls controls the shape of many landscapes and sets the rate by which landscapes respond to changes in climate and tectonics. However, we currently lack mechanistic models for waterfall erosion which inhibits our ability to predict landscape response to environmental perturbations. The goal of this project is to fill this knowledge gap through a combination of experiments in an indoor waterfall laboratory and monitoring waterfall processes in nature.  The waterfall experiments will be completed in a new state-of-the-art hydraulic and sediment flume at the California Institute of Technology.  This work will lead to mathematical theories for the sediment transport capacity and erosion of waterfall plunge pools.  The models developed from flume experiments will be tested against sediment transport data that we will collect at an active waterfall in the San Gabriel Mountains, CA, and over longer timescales against a new database of waterfall retreat rates compiled from previous studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to deriving and testing models for waterfall retreat, our work will aid understanding sediment routing and storage in mountain streams because waterfall plunge pools are natural temporary sediment sinks, with importance for mitigating river flood hazards and understanding habitats of aquatic organisms that depend on pools in summer months.  A focus of this proposal is an integrated research and education program. Waterfalls are ubiquitous and awe-inspiring landforms in the natural landscape; they provide a great medium through which to interest students and the public in issues of erosion and sedimentation, as well as landscape evolution.  The proposed educational program includes mentoring summer undergraduate research fellows and PhD students who will be directly involved with the research.  Through the Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program, undergraduate students will define and develop a project, write research proposals, carry out subsets of the laboratory and field work, submit a technical paper, and give an oral presentation at a symposium modeled on a professional technical meeting.  Outreach events will be focused on tours, classroom visits, and field excursions for students and teachers in the Pasadena Unified School District (P.U.S.D.), a district where the majority of students are from groups under-represented in geosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In many landscapes, the erosion of river channels occurs through the upstream propagation of waterfalls, which in turn can trigger hillside erosion and therefore landscape change as a whole.  Waterfalls often represent an upstream propagating wave of erosion initiated by a significant perturbation in Earth-surface topography, for example, due to coastal cliff erosion by waves, offset along a fault due to an earthquake, or a changing climate.  Waterfalls also exist at the downstream end of dams, and waterfall erosion can undermine these structures leading to costly damage to life and property.  Despite the importance of waterfall erosion, there is a lack of mechanistic theories for waterfall erosion, and, because waterfall erosion tends to occur relatively slowly, there is an absence of detailed observations needed to test such theories.  During the course of this study, we developed new theories for the erosion of bedrock at waterfalls and tested them against computer models, physical experiments and field measurements.  The physical experiments were carried out in the Caltech Earth Surface Dynamics Laboratory where we built indoor waterfalls using synthetic foam as a bedrock simulant and subsequently eroded the experimental waterfalls through the action of flowing water and gravel.  Field observations included sampling and dating waterfalls to constrain their erosion histories in Kauai, Idaho and California.  Altogether, our work has provided a better understanding of the processes and rates of waterfall erosion over both human and geologic timescales, and has informed new mechanistic models that can be used to predict sediment-transport and bedrock-erosion rates at waterfalls.  In addition, through this project a number of graduate and undergraduate students were trained in quantitative science, and results were disseminated through publications, scientific conferences, and community outreach.
