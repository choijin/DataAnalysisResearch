<AbstractNarration>This project will apply theoretical simulations of glacial flow to the understanding of surface structures on Mars. The Principal Investigator is currently modifying the computer code TEKTON, which simulates the flow of elastic materials using the finte-element method. The modifications center on the addition of a thermal model that allows the medium to have a varying temperature with depth; heating and cooling mechanisms include radiative heating by the Sun and the dusty Martian atmosphere, radiative emission from the surface, and subsurface conduction. Effect of slope and time-variable heating are also to be included. In this project, the Principal Investigator and an undergraduate student will analyze the properties of craters showing concentric crater fill, using images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and use the resulting data with the improved code to simulate glacial flow in craters. The goal is to test the hypothesis that concentric crater fill results from the interaction of converging debris-covered flows, and to connect fill morphology to the stresses operating on the flow. This project addresses the history of water on Mars, which is directly related to the possibility of Martian life. The work involves the participation of an undergraduate student, and the award will support an early-career, female Principal Investigator.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: Periodic changes in obliquity on Mars leads to recurring ice ages.  The mid and high latitudes on Mars are periodically covered in large ice sheets.  When the climate shifts, we are left with landscapes that have been modified by glacial activity.  We studied these relict glacial landforms to gain insight into formation mechanisms and to place constraints on the extent and volume of ice mobilized during the last glaciation.   As part of our study, over 90 HiRISE images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter were analyzed.  Sixty-three of these images contained relict glacial landforms such as dissected mantle terrain and concentric crater fill.  The glaciated terrain in each image was mapped using ArcGIS and the areal extent of the glaciation was determined.  From this, we estimated the volume of ice mobilized during the last glacial period.  A manuscript summarizing this work is currently in preparation.  Broader Impact:  A large portion of the image analysis was completed by Shelby Chandler, a female undergraduate researcher working under the guidance of Dr. Searls. This project was Ms. ChandlerÃ†s first research experience and at the end of the project she successfully presented a poster at the 2013 Geological Society of America Conference (Chandler &amp; Searls, 2013).  They are currently working on a manuscript for publication and all research products will be made publically available as a supplement to the publication.
