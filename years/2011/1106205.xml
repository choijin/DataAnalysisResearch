<AbstractNarration>Presently, a typical large mm-wave radio telescope costs more than $100M but state-of-the-art arrays of focal-plane heterodyne receivers cover less than 10% of the useful field of view with large gaps between sensitive areas. Moreover, individual components are not efficiently coupled to the energy concentrated by the antenna, reducing the telescope's resolution on the sky by 20% and typically losing about half of the available signal. The key new development proposed by collaborators Drs. N. Erickson and B. Jeffs of the University of Massachusetts and Brigham Young University, respectively, is the construction of focal-plane arrays utilizing phased array feed techniques. This approach differs from traditional feed horns by using a cluster of small antenna feeds to synthesize a single feed for the main antenna. Such an array collects all of the energy in the focal plane. Phased combination of the elements of this focal plane array allows one to synthesize horns of optimal size and amplitude/phase distribution to enhance the telescope resolution and compensate for telescope surface errors. At the same time they produce nearly as many beams on the sky as elements in the array.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While phased focal-plane arrays hold great promise for revolutionizing the field of radio astronomy, successful deployment of large two-dimensional arrays is still several years off, for it requires hurdles to be overcome in manufacturing, processing, as well as packaging.  Drs. Erickson and Jeffs plan to test concepts for producing receiver front-ends with very small element spacings, demonstrate the utility of modern digital signal processors to do the vector combination of beams, and develop computational algorithms for combining the beams, calibrating the array, and processing the final data stream.  The goal of this 3-yr project is an 8 x 8 array covering the frequency range 70 - 95 GHz with 100 MHz bandwidth, cryogenically cooled and installed on the 100-m Green Bank Telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to paving the way for future large, efficient, two-dimensional mm-wave receiver arrays, the Erickson/Jeffs project will involve engineering and astronomy graduate students at the two collaborative institutions and provide advanced research topics for talented undergraduate students in the Five College Astronomy Undergraduates Internship Program.  It will thereby educate members of a new generation of researcher in the complex art of mm-wave array instrumentation.   Funding for this work is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research has resulted in the fabrication of a 64 element focal plane phased array receiver tuning the 70-96 GHz frequency range.  The 64 elements fully sample the region they span in the focal plane, with each element measuring the electric field over a region somewhat smaller than one half-power beamwidth.  These individual elements are then combined in groups and summed with different weights to form up to 215 beams on the sky.  The difference between this receiver and a conventional focal plane array is that the output comprises a complete sampling of a region of the sky in a single pointing, much like a photographic image, while a conventional array has large gaps between elements.  The receiver is extremely compact, with the feed array only 48mm square, and it is housed in a dewar to cool it to 20K for lowest noise operation.  The feed array uses pairs of rectangular feed horns combined with a simple waveguide splitter to form a very efficient receiving element with a symmetric beam.  Each feed pair then couples to a low noise InP MMIC amplifier with 25 dB gain.  The amplified output is then coupled back into waveguide and sent to the room temperature module through a non-contacting waveguide joint.  Some very novel techniques have been used to miniaturize the electronics, including the fabrication of a custom MMIC downconverter.  This downconverter MMIC includes an LO amplifier and a LO pass-through port so that an entire row of 8 elements uses a single LO input.  After 2 frequency conversions, the signal is then sent to a baseband converter and digitizer that produces the final beam summed outputs.  About 40 elements are fully operational and these were tested on the Green Bank 100m Telescope in Oct 2015.  In these observations we were able to easily calibrate the receiver amplitude and phase response using astronomical sources including SiO masers and quasars.  A comprehensive analysis of the receiver shows that in full operation it will have equivalent imaging sensitivity to a conventional array with 110 pixels.   This type of receiver works better when there are more elements, and because it is so compact, is well suited to be built with large numbers of elements.
