<AbstractNarration>This project aims to study computational tractability of several fundamental problems concerning cuts, flows, and matchings in networks. For instance, how does one design a minimum cost network that realizes a given set of pair-wise connectivity requirements among the nodes? How does one assign routes in a network so as to avoid congestion? How fast can one find an assignment of tasks to machines so that each task is assigned to exactly one machine capable of executing the task and no machine is given more than one task? Together, these are among the most widely studied combinatorial optimization problems, and it is no surprise that the study of these problems is connected to major developments in algorithms design, hardness of approximation, and graph theory. The goal of this project is to design improved algorithms for these and related problems as well as to identify the complexity of obtaining near-optimal solutions for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems outlined in this proposal are intrinsic to many applications, and thus improved algorithms for these problems are of value to computer science and related disciplines where these optimization problems routinely arise. The research proposed here will go hand-in-hand with educational and student-training initiatives as well as outreach activities. The PI will integrate topics from this research in an advanced undergraduate course that will include research opportunities for students. The PI will also develop a lecture series to introduce high school students to exciting ideas in theoretical computer science.</AbstractNarration>

The problems studied in this project are intrinsic to many applications, and thus improved algorithms and new insights for these problems are of value to computer science and related disciplines where these optimization problems routinely arise. Some of the key research findings include (a) a new lower bound on the space needed to compute a near-optimal matching in a static network revealed in a streaming manner (that is, the network is presented one link at a time), (b) new local information algorithms for several network optimization problems, (c) an extremely small space algorithm for estimating the size of the largest matching in a static network that is revealed in a streaming manner, (d) a separation between computational tractability of influence maximization in symmetric and asymmetric networks, (e) a new load-balancing algorithm for a classical assignment problem, (f) improved space lower bounds for estimating the maximum cut size in a streaming network, (g) an analysis of the convergence properties of BGP network routing protocol as a function of the expressiveness of local preference policies, (h) a distributed match making algorithm that formally explains empirically observed rapid convergence in double oral auctions, (i) near-optimal algorithms for stochastic matching (a problem that is motivated by kidney-exchange), and (j) identification of the optimal tradeoff between space and accuracy for computing a maximum matching in a dynamically changing network that is revealed in a streaming manner.  The project supported training of four PhD students two of which have graduated. In course of this project, the PI also gave several lectures and short courses to high-school students to help them discover the broad applicability and the power of algorithmic thinking in computer science and other disciplines.
