<AbstractNarration>The Twenty-sixth Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications will be held at the City College of New York, CUNY, on July 26-29, 2011. The conference series covers many areas in topology. This year's special sessions are in: Dynamics and Applications, Set-Theoretic Topology, Topological Groups and Semigroups,     Asymmetric Topology, and Topological Methods in Functional Analysis. Each session has an associated plenary speaker. More details and instructions on how to contribute talks can be found at: http://topann.comyr.com/SumConf2011.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the invention of calculus came the need to understand limits, continuity, and shapes more general than classical geometric ones. The resulting branch of mathematics is topology, and among its more recent catch phrases is "chaos theory" (related to "dynamics", which studies the results of applying continuous functions repeatedly). In addition to a dynamics session there will be sessions in set-theoretic topology which considers spaces where limits and continuity can be defined, in topological groups and functional analysis which discuss uses of the interplay between topology and algebra. The remaining session is in asymmetric topology, a topic that has become useful in computer logic and the sorts of representations of infinite spaces by those where only a finite number of points can be used, such as with television and computer screens.</AbstractNarration>

Based on previous conferences, it should be attended by over 150 mathematicians, including a significant number of graduate students. It will be the fifth of this conference series to be held at City College, where it originated in 1984, but the series has become truly international. Of the conferences that took place during the past 10 years, five were in the US, 2 in Europe, and one each in Mexico, South Africa, and New Zealand. Proceedings of all the conferences since 1987 have appeared; for over a dozen years they have been published by Topology Proceedings. Since 1995 workshop lectures have appeared in Topology and Applications. A broadly defined conference like this one is a cost-effective way for researchers to meet, bring to light and get feedback on their latest results, and learn new results of others. Our conference and the Summer Topology Conference Series will bring to our participants the leading researchers and the latest developments in topology and related areas; foster applications of topology in these related areas; expose graduate students to the excitement and intense research activity of such a conference and help train them to do work in applications of topology; and facilitate communication and collaboration among topologists from a wide geographic area, both from this country and from overseas, at a time of year convenient to many faculty members.     Project Outcomes:  The 2011 conference had two workshops: one on Dynamics and Applications led by Ethan Akin (CCNY), and one on Set-theoretic Topology led by Franklin Tall (Univ. of Toronto). Following the patterns of previous conferences, it was composed of presentations by plenary speakers and special-topic sessions by selected speakers.  It had special-topic sessions in i) Asymmetric Topology; ii) Dynamics and Applications; iii) Set-Theoretic Topology; iv) Topological Methods in Functional Analysis; and v) Topological Groups and Semigroups. All abstracts and speakers for talks given at the 2011 Summer Conference on General Topology and Applications are available at the Topology Atlas web site: http://at.yorku.ca/topology/.  Indeed, similar information for almost all Summer Topology Conferences 1995 - 2017 can be found at this site.  A total of 154 participants from all over the world attended the conference to make presentations or attend these presentations. About 65 of them are from the United States and the rest from various countries. The general reaction of the participants supported in this group travel grant was very positive as this conference provided them the opportunity to learn about other?s work and applications, but also the excellent opportunity to establish their professional network. This is especially true to the young researchers.  The conference and the presentations there enabled speakers to disseminate their research findings in topology research to the mathematics community.
