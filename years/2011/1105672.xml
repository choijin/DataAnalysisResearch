<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  Mounting concerns about the availability, environmental impact and cost of energy on the economic health and well being of society provide strong motivation for substantial improvements in the efficiency of propulsion and power generation systems.  Crucial to these improvements are material systems capable of higher temperature operation, epitomized by multi-layer engineered surfaces in gas turbine engines.  An interdisciplinary academic/industry team aims to develop the scientific understanding needed to meet the challenge and guide progress in this critical technology.  Emphasis is on (i) the science-based discovery of materials with the requisite performance and durability in the unprecedented conditions expected in future engines, and (ii) establishing the relationships between materials chemistry, structure and properties to enable materials design and implementation.  By collaborating closely with a leading engine manufacturer, the outcomes of the scientific research have a direct and more immediate impact on technology and its design infrastructure. The project builds on established relationships between the academic and industrial participants and a network of international collaborators that create an exceptional educational environment where students (i) work on scientifically challenging problems with substantial potential for technological impact, (ii) are mentored by an interdisciplinary team of academic and industrial experts in the field, and (iii) have opportunities for research internships at industrial laboratories and international institutions.  The team has an established record of promoting the participation of undergraduates, women and members of underrepresented groups in research projects and international experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:  The overarching objective of this project is to establish a science-based framework for underpinning the conceptual design of new materials systems for gas turbine engines with substantially improved efficiency.  The aims of the research are (i) to understand the limitations of current materials to meet the temperature/performance targets of advanced engine technology, (ii) to explore new directions in materials design, and (iii) to develop the science base needed for implementation.  Key elements of the strategy include (i) an interdisciplinary, systems-based approach, (ii) the use of multiphase constituent layers designed to evolve readily into a desirable configuration and retain functionality over the life of the system, and (iii) the development of modeling approaches that allow efficient assessment of concepts and guide their experimental validation. Because of the chemical and morphological complexity of the layered architectures, novel computational tools are needed to capture and integrate the dynamics of the system and the individual layers.  Simulations are coupled with a strong experimental activity to identify and solve the critical challenges in design, synthesis/processing, and characterization of the structures and their constitutive behavior.  Scientific advances are envisaged within the following themes: (i) constitutive behavior of multiphase oxides and alloys, as well as their interfaces, at relevant temperatures (ii) synthesis of metastable structures and their evolution into phase assemblages with the desired attributes, (iii) the thermodynamics, diffusion and phase transformation mechanisms/kinetics underpinning said evolution, (iv) the role of stresses arising from the internal system dynamics and/or imposed thermal/mechanical stimuli on the structural stability and evolution of damage, (v) approaches to probe the state of the system and its properties at various stages in the evolution.  The project offers unique educational experiences for students and post-doctoral scholars by (i) learning first-hand how to work within an interdisciplinary research group focused on a scientific theme in the context of a critical technology; (ii) acquiring knowledge of industrial research-team protocols by combining well designed internships with co-supervision by the industrial team members; and (iii) participating in international research exchanges with foreign institutions (in Australia, Japan, Germany and the UK) and in topical workshops.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FUNDING: This National Science Foundation project is co-funded by two of the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE)'s Programs: (1) East Asia and Pacific, and (2) Europe and Eurasia; the Engineering Directorate and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Persistent concerns about the availability, environmental impact and cost of energy on the economic prosperity and well being of society provide strong motivation for improving the efficiency of propulsion and power generation technologies.  Crucial to this goal are material systems capable of higher temperature operation, epitomized by multi-layer engineered surfaces in the hot section components of gas turbines.  Beyond their traditional roles in aircraft propulsion and electricity generation, gas turbines are also envisaged as essential components of integrated systems with renewable sources, e.g. wind turbines, whereupon their impact broadens considerably. The overarching objective of this project was to establish a science-based framework for underpinning the conceptual design of new materials systems for gas turbines with substantially improved efficiency.  Its primary impact on society is on the economics of energy production and transportation, and the reduction of environmental emissions enabled by the capabilities of materials systems studied under this project.  Exemplary benefits include affordable airfares, as well as enhanced access to industrial and consumer power, with ramifications to clean ground transportation technologies.  Materials systems of interest are layered combinations of metals and ceramics deposited on the surfaces of the structural components of the engine, which are actively cooled.  The layered system provides thermal protection through an outer ceramic with low thermal conductivity, as well as environmental protection by means of an aluminum-enriched layer that generates a thermally grown protective oxide during service.  The system evolves in the extreme environment, limiting useful life.  An aim of this project was to identify material design paths that enhance their performance and durability by manipulating their natural evolution.  Key elements of the strategy involved (i) the use of constituent layers designed to evolve early into a desirable configuration and retain functionality over the life of the system, and (ii) modeling approaches that allow efficient assessment of concepts and guide their experimental implementation.   The project demonstrated its intellectual merit (i) by addressing the scientific principles underpinning the limitations of current materials to meet the performance targets of advanced gas turbine technology, and (ii) by taking a systems-based interdisciplinary approach to explore new directions in materials discovery and design.  Because of the complexity of the layered architectures, efficient computational tools were needed to capture and integrate the dynamics of the system and the individual layers.  Simulations were coupled with strong experimental core activities to identify and solve the critical challenges in design, synthesis/processing, and characterization of the structures and their constitutive behavior. Key outcomes are outlined below.  Improved scientific understanding of the phase equilibria and evolutionary processes in novel oxide systems of interest for the protection of gas turbine components.  These illuminate broader issues of processability and stability in service. New experimental methods to probe the mechanisms underpinning toughness in thermal barrier oxides, motivating models to support the interpretation of the measurements especially in materials containing structural segmentation.   Science-based concepts for evolving layered bond coats designed to generate the requisite protective oxide at the surface and achieving the desired mechanical properties in the bulk, to minimize plasticity and/or creep induced damage. Enhanced high-throughput DFT approaches to model phase stability, constitutive behavior of oxides, metals and interfaces, as well as thermodynamic hierarchies, diffusion and mechano-chemical effects on phase transformations and toughening mechanisms.  This includes a new recursive approach to the parametrization of multi-component alloy Hamiltonians and their use in cluster expansions. Highly efficient discrete element methods, including new developments in distributed cohesive zone models, to analyze fracture in brittle systems as influenced by the relative properties of the bulk and the grain boundaries.  Emerging insight into the limitations of current DFT approaches to modeling the stability of silica polymorphs, the effect of doping and their transformations.  This is a fundamental problem of critical importance in environmental barrier coatings for ceramic composites. Four students completed doctoral dissertations under this project, two of them female.  Two of the graduates are working in industry and two more doing post-doctoral training abroad. The students enriched their educational experience by (i) working within an interdisciplinary research group focused on a scientific theme in the context of a critical technology; (ii) acquiring knowledge of industrial research-team protocols during well designed internships co-supervised by the industrial members of the team; and (iii) participating in international teaming relationships through exchanges with foreign institutions and topical workshops at UCSB. Five undergraduates did internships under this project, two of them female and two Hispanic, mentored by the graduate students and PIs.  Of these, at least two are pursuing doctoral degrees at the present time. The project has yielded 34 journal publications and one book, with a few additional papers in the final stages of preparation.
