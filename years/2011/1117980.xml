<AbstractNarration>Many experiments in molecular biology designed for discovering cellular functions and organization, or estimating the efficiency of drug treatments, are prohibitively expensive to be systematically conducted on large scale systems. It is therefore of paramount importance to develop analytical methods for predicting which experiments are likely to provide the most informative outcomes of biological tests, based only on a small sample of incomplete and noisy measurements. Frequently, the incomplete data are random or pseudo-random samples of a matrix, or more generally, a multidimensional array (tensor). This suggests the use of a new algorithmic and analytic paradigm, termed low-rank matrix and tensor completion, for solving the inference problems at hand. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves the development of novel tensor and nonlinear completion methods for inference of protein-protein interaction networks and design of synthetic lethality experiments. The methods used represent a combination of information-theoretic and algorithmic approaches centered around constrained optimization on Grassman manifolds. This research program has the potential to benefit many branches of molecular biology, neuroscience, computer vision, control, economics and signal processing in terms of answering fundamental inference questions for sparse systems and reducing the cost and time associated with system testing and experimental design. It will also provide unprecedented opportunities to graduate students in the electrical engineering and mathematics departments at UIUC to explore state-of-the art technologies and research problems at the intersection of molecular biology, bio-informatics, and signal processing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this award include thereotical and algorithmic contributions to the field of sparse data processing, and the creation of new application domains for the developed techniques in systems biology. The most important findings include two new methods for analyzing biological networks (gene regulatory and cancer driver gene networks) under various sparsity priors, and accompanying software implemenations that allow one to perform causal inference of interactions in small network modules and inference of cancer driver genes based on what is known as the mutual exclusivity principle.  Intelectual merits: The project outcomes include the theoretical analysis of subspace pursuite methods coupled with Granger causality, which allow one to predict unknown interactions in regulatory networks; the theoretical analysis of tensor completion methods over finite fields and their use in network coding and for prediction of protein-protein interactions.  Broader impacts: The project has brought forward new interactions with life scientists and computer scientists, and enabled a number of students supported by this grant to transition from electrical engineering to life science research. The education of truly cross-disciplinary researchers that can communicate with mathematicians and biologists alike was also an important componet of the program. Furthermore, the developed software solutions, now publically avaialble, are expected to be used by systems biologists for various network inference tasks.
