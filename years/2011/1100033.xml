<AbstractNarration>The New York City area has long tradition of great strength in number theory.  Recently, this tradition has begun to spread to the rest of the state.  This proposal seeks to initiate a regular annual conference in number theory to be held in Upstate New York.  The four investigators represent four different leading institutions: Binghamton University, Cornell University, SUNY--Buffalo and the University of Rochester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern number theory focuses on a host of problems; some date back to the ancient Greeks, while others are motivated by contemporary problems in technology, such as data encryption.  Number theory research in Upstate New York runs the gamut of many of these topics. At the faculty level research, this proposal will integrate several isolated specialists in the region and create an environment that stimulates collaborations and new directions for future work, while at the same time strengthening ties between researchers in Upstate New York and those near New York City.  This will maintain and enrich the intellectual merit of the region's number theory research. It will also help graduate students and post-docs by exposing them to work of leading experts, by allowing them to communicate their own research and interests, and by giving them the chance to interact among themselves.</AbstractNarration>
