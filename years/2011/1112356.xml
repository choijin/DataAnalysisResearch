<AbstractNarration>This award in the Division of Chemistry supports research by Professor Seth N. Brown at the University of Notre Dame to explore the activation of monometallic centers by nonclassical oxygenation reactions. The main strategy is based on using redox-active ligands that use small bite angles to encourage higher coordination numbers on complexes of molybdenum and tungsten.  Ligands will include both known (catecholate, bis(iminophenoxide), amidobis(phenoxide)) and novel (hexadentate tris- (iminophenoxide), bis(hydroxyphenyl)triazole) designs. Interactions of molecular oxygen with complexes of the reduced ligands, as well as possible molecular oxygen generation from dioxo complexes of the oxidized ligands, will be studied mechanistically. The ability of the ligand-oxidized oxo complexes to deliver oxygen to substrates will also be analyzed to determine the geometric and electronic factors that encourage this reaction. Possible catalytic reactions that combine molecular oxygen activation with atom transfer to organic substrates, such as oxidative cleavage of alkenes (i.e., ozonolysis using molecular oxygen), will be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores ways to synthesize oxygen-containing organic molecules more efficiently. Activating molecular oxygen is a prime target for catalysis, with impacts in green chemical synthesis and renewable energy storage. It is a difficult target because the intermediate oxidation states of dioxygen (such as peroxide) are high in energy, placing an intrinsic roadblock on efficient reactions.  The research will provide broad training of postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students.  Undergraduates (including members of underrepresented groups) will be recruited and encouraged to pursue research throughout their undergraduate careers.  Graduate students and especially postdoctoral scholars will be encouraged to mentor undergraduates in collaboration with the PI in order to assist in their training and provide them with motivation to pursue careers in teaching and research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most important problems in chemistry is how to translate between electrical energy and the energy stored in chemical bonds, such as in the combination of a fuel and oxygen.  If one can turn chemical energy into electrical energy, one can operate a fuel cell; if one can turn renewable electrical energy (such as wind or solar power) into chemical fuels, then one has a way of storing these intermittent energy sources for later use.  Tapping both kinds of energy involves moving electrons, so one would think that these interconversions would be straightforward.  But it turns out that the kind of reactions that involve simply moving electrons, as through a wire, called "outer-sphere" reactions, do not interface well with the kinds of reactions that involve making and breaking chemical bonds, called "inner-sphere" reactions.  In order to bridge these two spheres of reactivity, one needs special catalysts.  Traditionally, these catalysts have relied heavily on transition metals, drawn from the center of the periodic table.  Sometimes these metals are expensive or toxic; more importantly, the need for them to excel both at bond-making and at transferring electrons makes it difficult to design efficient catalysts.  We have developed systems that exemplify a novel design strategy, which divides the labor of catalysis to allow a metal center to manage any bonds that need to be broken or formed while delegating the work of moving electrons to organic molecules that are bonded to the metal center (called ligands).  In particular, we have demonstrated the viability of this strategy using a number of new reagents for a particular subclass of reactions that involve moving oxygen atoms from one molecule to another, a process we have dubbed "nonclassical oxygen atom transfer".   Chemists have habitually tried to assign the electron-shuffling in such compounds as exclusively pertaining either to the metal or to the ligands attached to the metal.  However, it seems reasonable to think that, in some cases at least, the work of moving electrons might be shared between metal and ligand.  In order to probe this intermediate situation, we developed a method for translating readily available structural data into a quantitative measure of the electron distribution between metal and ligand, and substantiated its physical relevance through other measurements on the compounds.
