<AbstractNarration>The need for robust language processing capabilities across academic disciplines, education, and industry is without question of vital importance to national security, infrastructure development, and the competitiveness of American business. However, at this time a robust, interoperable software infrastructure to support natural language processing (NLP) research and development does not exist. To fill this gap, this project establishes an large international collaborative effort involving key international players to develop an open, web-based infrastructure through which massive and distributed language resources can be easily accessed, in whole or in part, and within which tailored language services can be efficiently composed, disseminated and consumed by researchers, developers, and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive network of web services and resources within the NLP community. This requires four specific activities: (1) Design, develop and promote a service-oriented architecture for NLP development that defines atomic and composite web services, along with support for service discovery, testing and reuse; (2) Construct a Language Application Grid (LAPPS Grid) based on Service Grid Software developed in Japan; (3) Provide an open advancement (OA) framework for component- and application-based evaluation that enables rapid identification of frequent error categories within modules, thus contributing to more effective investment of resources; (4) Actively promote adoption, use, and community involvement with the LAPPS Grid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing access to cloud-based services and support for locally-run services, the LAPPS Grid will lead to the development of a massive global network of language data and processing capabilities that can be used by scientists and engineers from diverse disciplines, providing components that require no expertise in language processing to use. Research in sociology, psychology, economics, education, linguistics, digital media, and the humanities will be impacted by the ability to easily manipulate and process diverse language data sources in multiple languages.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     With the LAPPS Grid we have created a platform that allows non-specialists to process text and extract infromation from that text. Dozens of popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) components are wrapped as webservices and made available to be incorporated in processing chains without the user having to worry about how the components interact with each other.  To achieve interoperability among tools and data, all use the same format (the Lapps Interchange Format) and a simple common vocabulary that is published at http://vocab.lappsgrid.org.  To use the LAPPS Grid a user has several choices. A user can visit one of the Galaxy portalsat https://galaxy.lappsgrid.org or https://jetstream.lappsgrid.org, where a variety of interoperable tools and datasets are made available. Galaxy was adopted early on in the project as the front-end workflow manager, due to its ease of use and proven track record. With Galaxy, workflows can be created in an intuitive way and results can be visualized.  For programmers, we developed the LAPPS Services DSL, a groovy-based scripting language for writing and accessing SOAP clients. The DSL language is easy to use and has allows us to quickly write scripts to access NLP webservices. Finally, LAPPS Services can also be distributed as Docker containers.  Access is provided to a variety of corpora, including the Open American National Corpus (OANC) and the Manually Annotated SubCorpus (MASC), and several corpora containing biomedical data. In addition, some of the holdings of the Linguistic Data Consortium can also be accessed thorugh the Grid, as well as PubMedCentral data available from PubAnnotation.  The LAPPS Grid has been used in a variety of courses including the Carnegie Mellon University graduate course ?11-791 Intelligent Information Systems?.
