<AbstractNarration>Introduction of the Web has had a great impact on our daily lives.  Web services technology is expanding and has received significant attention in the software industry under the broader umbrella of service-oriented architecture.  Interaction with web-based applications is expected to increase.  However, coverage of this topic is generally not provided in early computing courses.  This project is expanding a pilot effort that developed learning materials for introductory programming courses (NSF DUE-0837056).  Project objectives include improving student learning in introductory courses and increasing faculty adoption of the approach at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are engaged by developing introductory programs that connect to web services they are familiar with such as social networking sites, search engines, and location-based applications.  This is accomplished by providing simplified access to the internet services. Course materials being developed include lecture notes, lab activities, on-line tutorials, programming assignments, and testing materials.  Other project outcomes include a web repository for the freely available materials.  Empirical studies are designed to measure student performance and engagement with the content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To encourage faculty to adopt the approach, summer workshops are offered.  There is a mini-grant incentive for attendees to support local implementation.  Participants agree to attend two workshops and collect assessment results during the academic year that contribute to the overall project.  Faculty from twenty-four colleges and universities are expected to participate during the three year project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Teaching introductory programming course can be a challenge for both students and instructors. This project was a 4-year study that introduced Web services (WS) in the first Information Systems and Computer Science programming courses. WS technology allows software to be consumed as a service in a standardized manner over the Web, simplifying data transfer and software development/integration.  WS technology was used in these courses based on the increased use of the technology in industry and its ability to provide a real world feel to student programming activities. The study shows a commensurate student test performance for WS-taught courses when compared with standard-taught courses but a significant increase in student assessment of learning gains. Furthermore, the qualitative aspects of the study show approval from the instructors who participated in the project and positive feedback from the students on the use of WS in the classroom.  The intellectual merit of the research can be summarized as follows:  (1)  The research findings of the treatment groups experiment provided information on the effectiveness of using WS for introductory program sequence at varying academic institutions:  The project recruited 20 faculty participants from across the United States outside of Illinois State University. The participants will continue to have access to the resources developed over the life of the project.  (2)  The research findings from the instructors participating in the project gave insights on how WS can be successfully incorporated into the introductory CS/IS programming sequence:  An implementation model was developed and tested for future studies based on lessons learned from the current experiment (Figure 1)  (3)   The development and maintenance of course materials exposed students to new technologies that allowed them to develop skill and knowledge based on technologies utilized in the IT industry:  The faculty participants produced their own labs/assignments that were then provided to other participants to enrich instruction during and beyond the life of the project. The resources will continue to be available on the course repository.  The broader impacts of the research can be summarized as follows:  (1)   The deliverables of this project are situated in a repository for ease of exploration by instructors and students:  Lore.com was used to host teaching materials, presentations, learning videos and other documentation. Lore also provided a means for faculty participants to engage one another via posts and messaging.  (2)   Live Web services are hosted in the repository for educators to incorporate into their classrooms:  Over 2 dozen Web services were created as part of the grant. The Web services will continue to be available and hosted for instructors to use in their classrooms.  (3)   Faculty workshops to transfer, further disseminate, and provide feedback for the course materials were conducted:  3 face-to-face workshops and a virtual workshop were developed and delivered to introduce 22 faculty participants to the approach. One post participation workshop was conducted and supplemented by 3 ad-hoc post participation meetings.  (4)   One or more articles describing the research results and the course materials were written and submitted for publication in reputable outlets:  2 journal articles, 2 conference proceedings, 1 book citation, 1 manuscript in progress to be submitted for review at a top-tier journal.   Outcomes  The goal of the project was to expand the use of the WS approach through mini-grants to other institutions, as well as expanding the curriculum knowledge repository through a collaboration site where the faculty could interact. The outcomes are given below:   Objective 1:  Increase performance in introductory programming courses through the use of SOA/Web services as a framework for engaging students.  The CKS test (line 1, Figure 2) is a 20-item general examination of programming knowledge...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
