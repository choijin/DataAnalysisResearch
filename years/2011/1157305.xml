<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: Telomeres are specialized structures located at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. These structures consist of repetitive DNA sequences and a complex array of proteins that cap chromosome ends and protect chromosomes from deleterious rearrangements. The overall goal of this research is to investigate the mechanisms of the Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 (CST) protein complex, which constitutes a critical and widely conserved component of telomeres. Despite a great deal of analysis, there are numerous gaps in the current understanding of how this complex is put together and how it protects telomere DNA. Preliminary studies uncovered two unexpected features of the CST complex: it is dimeric and contains more copies of Stn1 than the other subunits. Moreover, a second Cdc13-like protein (called Cdc13B) that regulates telomeres was identified in many Candida species. By analyzing the detailed interactions among the CST components and those between CST and telomeric DNA, this research will provide critical insights on how the cells maintain chromosome stability. In addition, by studying the functional overlap or diversification between Cdc13 and Cdc13B, this investigation will expand current understanding of the evolution of telomeres. The findings are also likely to influence telomere research in other organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This project includes the training and development of underrepresented minority undergraduates at Hostos Community College (HCC), part of the City University of New York (CUNY). Motivated students will receive initial training at their home institution in a specially tailored laboratory course. They will then directly participate in the project during summer internships. Due to the well-established nature of the protocols for subsets of the experiments, the students will have realistic opportunities for making meaningful contributions to the project. The students' achievements will be showcased at HCC and other forums. Scientific reports authored by students will be published in the HCC on-line journal Hostos Journal of Student Research. They will also be presented at the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS). These activities should generate interest among peers at HCC and beyond, and help motivate and encourage these students to pursue careers in science. Moreover, while the project has a primary focus on telomere biology, the findings will also provide general insights on protein-nucleic acid interactions as well as on the co-evolution of proteins and their DNA-targets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project were to determine how the tips of the chromosomes (telomeres) are protected and stabilized, and how the major factors that are responsible for telomere protection evolve over time. Telomeres are complex structures made up of double stranded DNA, single stranded DNA, and many proteins.  All of these components are crucial for the formation of a unique structure that allows the chromosomes to be stably maintained in both dividing and non-dividing cells.  Understanding of telomere structure and evolution will therefore contribute to a fuller understanding of heredity and genetics.     This study was carried out using several fungi, which are easier to manipulate and whose evolutionary relationships to one another have been well characterized.  The focus was on a three-protein complex called Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 (CST) that binds to single-stranded telomere DNA. This complex is required to protect telomere DNA from degradation and other abnormal reactions.  It is also required for the synthesis of telomere DNA.  By studying the makeup of this complex, how different parts of the complex fit with one another, and how the complex binds to single-stranded DNA in several fungi, we were able to arrive at the following significant conclusions. (1) The Stn1 component of the CST complex is critical for the assembly of the entire complex, by acting as a bridge to bring the other two components together. (2) The Cdc13 component of the complex is responsible for DNA-binding, and has evolved rapidly in evolution such that the Cdc13 in each fungus has strong preference for the telomere sequence in the same fungus, i.e., Cdc13 binds telomere DNA with very high "sequence specificity". (3) This sequence specificity is achieved in some fungi through the duplications and dimerization of Cdc13.  In other words, an ancestral Cdc13 gave rise to two distinct Cdc13 molecules. These two Cdc13s form a dimeric complex, with each Cdc13 binding a different portion of the telomere sequence. (4) Disrupting the assembly of the CST complex or disrupting DNA-binding by the CST complex caused the telomeres to become abnormal.      Altogether, the conclusions of our studies help to increase understanding of how the tips of the chromosomes can be protected, and how single-strand telomere binding proteins can evolve over time. The results are relevant to the field of genetics as well as that of evolution.       Last Modified: 06/29/2017       Submitted by: Neal F Lue]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
