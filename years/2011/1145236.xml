<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Barry M. Trost of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University aims to improve efficiency in organic synthesis through the development of asymmetric catalysis.  Specifically, three areas of catalysis are targeted.  The first involves the rational design of ligands for formation of dinuclear and heterodinuclear metal complexes as catalysts for addition reactions.  The second area involves asymmetric trimethylenemethane cycloadditions. The third area examines Pd catalyzed asymmetric allylic and benzylic alkylation.  Novel Ru-Pd sequential reactions for asymmetric synthesis and examination of such systems in the context of Mo catalyzed reactions will also be pursued.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need of increasingly complex organic molecules for a myriad of applications ranging from biology to material science heightens the need for increased efficiency in organic synthesis.   This project intends to achieve high synthetic efficiency through high reaction selectivity and high atom economy.  Successful accomplishment of this project will positively impact the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and specialty chemical industries and contribute positively to the sustainability of the society.  The project will also provide excellent trainings to the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows involved, including those currently underrepresented in Chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

To optimize structure for function typically requires complex structures which then form formidable challenges. Being able to synthesize such complex structures, especially in a time efficient manner, critically depends upon the nature of the "tool box" that the scientist solving these complex problems has. This program focuses on expanding that tool box to broaden the types of structures that can be available for these important practical objectives. The "tool box" being referred to is the underlying synthetic reactions that allow the conversion of simple readily available building blocks to these more complex molecular arrays.
