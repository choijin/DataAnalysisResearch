<AbstractNarration>Data-intensive real-time applications, such as transportation management, military surveillance, and network monitoring, need to handle massive amounts of stream data in a timely fashion. It is challenging to support real-time stream data services (RTSDS) due to stringent timing constraints, potentially unbounded continuous stream data, bursty stream data arrivals, and workload variations due to data value changes. This project will develop cost-effective methods and a runtime system for RTSDS. The project will systematically investigate methods and tools to support real-time continuous queries for RTSDS even in the presence of dynamic workloads. Specifically, the project will study a) real-time continuous query modeling, b) new performance metric design c) adaptive query scheduling design, d) tardiness control and load shedding, for both single node and clustered RTSDS. The project will also have prototype implementation and testbed evaluations. The results and findings of this project will advance and seamlessly integrate real-time computing and stream data management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real-time stream data services (RTSDS) play an important role in many emerging application including intelligent transportation, green buildings, smart grid management, military surveillance, and network monitoring. Our everyday lives are highly dependent on these applications. RTSDS is a fundamental technology for developing critical data-intensive real-time applications with great socio-economic impacts. The project will develop the scientific foundations and associated engineering principles for building RTSDS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide excellent opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to acquire hands-on experience as well as theoretical backgrounds in RTSDS. The PIs will work closely with students to carry out the research in this project. Through this project, the PIs will train students to become strong in both analytical and implementation skills, and help them solve challenging problems in RTSDS.</AbstractNarration>

It is challenging to support real-time stream data services (RTSDS) due to stringent timing constraints, potentially unbounded continuous stream data, unpredictable stream data arrivals, and workload variations due to data value changes. To address these challenges, this project has developed cost-effective techniques and software for RTSDS. The project has systematically investigated and developed methods and tools to support timely RTSDS even in the presence of dynamic workloads. Key outcomes include the following: 1) various control theoretic techniques are applied to support robust real-time data services, 2) systematic data stream load shedding techniques are developed to avoid overload, 3) effective deadline assignment and differentiated RTSDS schemes are developed, 4) predictive thermal control techniques are developed to avoid overheating the processor due to intense real-time data stream processing, 5) a new real-time scheduling mechanism is developed to leverage the massive parallelism provided by GPGPUs (general graphic processing units), 6) a real-time sensor data analytics framework, called RTMR (Real-Time MapReduce), is designed and implemented to support parallel in-memory analytics of sensor data streams in real-time, and 7) real-time wireless data delivery protocols are developed. The expected broader socio-economic impact of this project is significant due to many important applications, including the aforementioned ones, which can be supported by RTSDS. Underrepresented groups of students were advised to work on relevant projects and publish research results at peer-reviewed conferences and journals.
