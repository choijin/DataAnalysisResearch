<AbstractNarration>This research project is devoted to performance analysis and improvement of production systems widely used in semiconductor manufacturing - the re-entrant lines. It is universally accepted that performance of re-entrant lines is characterized by large variability and oscillations of the throughput (TP) and work-in-process (WIP). This leads to performance degradation and long and unpredictable production cycle time. At present, no rigorous explanations of these phenomena are available, and the attempts to combat them are far from being successful. The research is intended to develop a theory that explains fundamental reasons for these phenomena and provide techniques for their alleviation. The approach is based on the methods of nonlinear dynamics. Specifically, the project will investigate steady states of re-entrant lines, their (Lyapunov) stability properties, periodic and chaotic oscillations, and transient behavior (i.e., the processes of convergence to steady states after machine breakdowns). As a result, the project will provide analytical tools for investigating the performance of re-entrant lines, including TP and WIP variability, and offer quantitative methods and qualitative insights that can be used by production personnel to mitigate the undesirable dynamic phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research will be attained through industrial short courses to be offered by the PI at semiconductor manufacturing plants. These courses will present the results of this research in the format appropriate for factory floor applications. The PI has been offering similar courses in the automotive industry for over ten years, where the results of prior NSF-supported research on serial lines and assembly systems have been presented. As an outcome, some of these results have been incorporated in standard operating procedures at several automotive plants and led to a substantial performance improvement. Similar outcomes are expected to be obtained in the semiconductor industry as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project develops an analytical, yet practical, theory for raw material release rates in production systems, in particular, serial and re-entrance lines. These systems are widely used in manufacturing, especially in small- and medium-size enterprises, where buffer capacities are not hardware-limited and may be viewed as "infinite".  In such systems, the curve of the production lead time (LT) vs. the raw material release rate (RR) has a knee-type shape. This function is referred to as the Characteristic Curve (CC) of a production line. Operating the system below the knee of CC is not efficient since RR (and, thus, the throughput, TP) can be increased without an appreciable increase of LT. Operating the system above the knee is also counterproductive, since LT (and, thus, work-in-process, WIP) becomes extremely large without a significant increase of TP. Hence, the desirable operating point is at the knee, which is why it is often referred to in practice as the ?sweet point?.  Prior to this project, there has been no rigorous theory for identifying sweet points and calculating RR to ensure the sweet point operation. The research carried out under this grant has developed such a theory. This represents the intellectual merit of the work carried out. The broader impact of this work is in providing the semiconductor and other manufacturing industries with a simple method, which could be used for both increasing productivity and reducing production lead time, resulting in a higher product quality as well.    In more technical terms, this research has shown that having a constant RR, even a relatively small one, could lead (due to various types of machine breakdowns) to complex dynamic behavior of production systems, such as instability, oscillations, and even chaos. To combat these detrimental phenomena, RR must be controlled on a feedback basis. While the excising methods, such as Kanban and CONWIP, offer such a possibility, they do not lead, in general, to sweet point operation. In this project, we have developed:  an analytical theory for CC calculation as a function of the machine and buffer parameters; a method for sweet point identification, as the point on CC with the largest curvature (in the rigorous meaning of this term); an analytical formula for feedback-based raw material release, which ensures the sweet point operation.   The feedback law, derived in this work, uses the information on the current work-in-process in order to decide whether the release should take place and, if it should, the release amount, which ensure the desired lead time (in particular, that of the sweet point or any other point on CC), while maximizing the throughput.  The approach of this research is based on stochastic analysis of production systems at hand, where the randomness is due to machine breakdowns (characterized by various reliability models, such as Bernoulli, exponential, Weibull, gamma, etc.).
