<AbstractNarration>Droplet Thermotaxis: A New Platform Technology for Droplet-based Microfluidic Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to develop a new platform technology for droplet-based microfluidic systems and demonstrate chemical unit operations using the developed platform for applications in chemistry and biology based on the study of the fundamental science of thermotaxis actuation. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is found at the cross-section of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and chemistry, laying the solid foundation and design guidelines for various microfluidic devices and systems that can take advantage of the newly discovered droplet actuation mechanisms.  The proposed work will provide fundamental information for understanding the dual behavior of droplets, underlying science of unique transport mechanisms at the interfacial boundaries (liquid-liquid, liquid-air, liquid-solid), practical tool kits for droplet-based chemical experiments, methodology for optical diagnostics of miniaturized devices and systems, and novel experimental protocols for controlled chemical reactions.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are summarized as (a) wide applicability of our technology for handling liquid samples in a self-confined configuration and for the effective thermal management of droplets relevant to many disciplines (b) dissemination of cultivated knowledge to research communities across electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry and biology and (c) long-lasting educational outcomes from thoughtfully designed multidisciplinary mentorship and outreach activities involving undergraduate, graduate and K-12 students.  &lt;br/&gt;This program is built upon a new and transformative discovery ? bidirectional droplet actuation based on the surface film deformation, unlike the traditional approach. This program will help understand the defining science and working principles so the newly proposed actuation mechanism may be favorably used for miniaturized devices and systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project is to develop a new platform technology for manipulating droplets that can be used one day for rapid chemical analysis systems. On contrary to a common belief that a surface of a liquid in a container is flat, this work is based on the research teamÆs counter-intuitive observation - the liquid surface could be curved upon heating due to a change of surface tension.  A floating spherical water droplet with a thin air gap could be formed on an oil film and used as a carrier that contains chemicals. A stable configuration of the droplet at the air-oil interface depends on the height from which the droplet is released and the size of the droplet.  When a small water droplet is released from a certain height from the inert oil surface, it can sustain the impact, preserve its spherical shape, and levitate on the oil film surface. When the oil is heated locally using a microheater, a temperature difference between hot and cold sections creates deformation of oil surface with a downhill slope towards the hot spot due to the surface tension effect. Then the droplet moves down the surface slope because of gravity. The droplet acts like a hovercraft that glides over the oil surface with an air cushion.  Force and energy analysis on this interesting configuration revealed that physics behind this counterintuitive observation &ndash; bending of a horizontal liquid surface. The research team discovered underlying science of unique transport mechanisms at the interfacial boundaries (liquid-liquid, liquid-air, liquid-solid), and developed practical tool kits for droplet-based chemical experiments, found methodology for optical diagnostics of miniaturized devices and systems, and provided novel experimental protocols for controlled chemical reactions.  The methodology that is developed throughout this project can be used for effective thermal management of droplets, which is critical to understanding heating or cooling mechanisms of electronic devices and thermal systems as well as chemical and biological systems. The findings in this fundamental study can be beneficial to many applications that need to deal with a small amount of chemical and biological liquid samples. The project successfully demonstrated the applicability of the theoretical framework to the practical aspects of chemical and biological sensing.
