<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Izumi Shimada, Rafael Segura will collect and analyze data from archaeological excavations at the major pre-Hispanic urban site of Cajamarquilla on the Peruvian central coast. Specifically, the project will investigate the role of inferred major hydrological disturbances during a time span of ca. 800 years in local and regional cultural processes from an interdisciplinary perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous paleonvironmental reconstructions in the central Andes indicate the occurrence of extraordinary and prolonged droughts and floods during the Middle Horizon (MH, ca. AD 550-1000) and Late Intermediate Period (LIP, ca. 1000-1470). These phenomena would have compelled people to develop appropriate adaptive responses and, in some cases, differentially accelerated cultural change. Thus, it has been hypothesized that rapid population nucleation and/or site abandonment episodes on the central coast would reflect crucial accommodations to hydrologic upheavals. However, serious voids still undermine understanding of the referred natural-cultural processes. Particularly, the region lacks reliable relative and absolute chronologies; systematic studies of local paleoenvironmental history and processes have barely started. In addition, excessive focus on one culture-one period impedes an assessment of links between paleoenvironmental variation and short and long-term human responses. Cajamarquilla provides an excellent setting to address these concerns because of its economically strategic but hazardous location and relatively well preserved multicultural occupation over MH and LIP, including associated canals and inferred reservoirs and storage facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To test the primary hypothesis that severe environmental fluctuations conditioned the foundation, abandonment, and reoccupation of Cajamarquilla during the MH and LIP, Mr. Segura will conduct the following: (1) collection of radiocarbon samples to refine occupational history vis-à-vis the postulated natural phenomena; (2) analysis of sedimentary deposits (including thin section microscopy analysis) and microbotanic remains (pollen grains, starch grains and phytoliths) from natural and cultural features, such as bank exposures of a nearby dry water course, abandoned canals and reservoirs, and house floors; (3) assessment of the structural and functional characteristics of selected canals, reservoirs and storage pits; and (4) characterization of abandonment and architectural reconstruction events vis-à-vis signatures of destructive flooding or severe water shortage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have a broader impact beyond the research topics presented.  Firstly, it will improve knowledge and appreciation of potential risk in an area historically impacted by floods and droughts, especially in the context of global warming. This will be relevant for preventive measures and urban planning as modern populations live on ancient channels around the site and elsewhere in the world. Second, because of its focus on combined cultural and natural data, the project will foster synergetic international collaboration of professionals and students representing different disciplines that will enhance their skills as well as their own disciplinary and cross-disciplinary knowledge and appreciation. Finally, the research will enrich and disseminate our knowledge of Cajamarquilla, one of the only two still-preserved large urban sites on the central coast. This will enhance future protection of the site against uncontrolled modern urban growth.</AbstractNarration>

Our study of the local hydraulic infrastructure (e.g., canals) indicates that Cajamarquilla primarily obtained its water from the nearby R&iacute;mac River. This finding does not support the old hypothesis that the Huaycoloro Quebrada was the principal source of water for the site. The hypothesis was built on an untested assumption that there was an unprecedented humid period during its occupation.             Microbotanic remains and sediments also suggest strongly that Cajamarquilla developed in a primarily arid environment. Dryness, however, did not imply the absence of massive surge of water in the quebrada. Flooding from the Huaycoloro had significant implications for the nature and history of the site. For example, extensive, hard and thick underlying mud deposits provided a distinctive geological condition that seems to have been one of the key factors for the foundation or persistence in human occupation of Cajamarquilla: firm strata were well suited for large-scale construction of underground bottle-shaped storage chambers locally called silos, which are unique to the site in dimensions (usually 4 m in deep) and number (minimally 2,277).             Occasional subsequent mudflows also provided benefits to Cajamarquilla people. The finer flooding sediments were exploited over time for diverse purposes such as mud for architectural construction and pottery production. The periodic clay deposition implied that residents learnt to live with runoff over and around the site. However, floods were also a destructive agent as exemplified by the water-damaged segments of the principal canal that supplied water to Cajamarquilla, a catastrophic event that, among other factors, hastened the abrupt abandonment of the site during the Ychsma period.             The over 2,000 silos of Cajamarquilla configure an extraordinary situation as no other site in the entire Peruvian coast exhibits such a great number of them. If most silos are similar to the two silos excavated by the project, both of which had abundant remains of maize and chili pepper, then the site was an impressive storage center for storing food and, possibly, other items. Because of their great number, spatial distribution, and continuing construction, it is quite likely silos were a planned facility constructed to respond to strong regional needs that wait for future clarification.             As seen, our results confirm humans are not passive and merely reactive agents to environmental hazards. Cajamarquilla residents actively adjusted the site and their lives on the basis of a careful evaluation of the pros and cons of the local hydrology and geodynamics. Given many cultural patterns repeated from Lima to Ychsma period, reoccupation or occupational continuity in some sectors did not result from lack of h...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
