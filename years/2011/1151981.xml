<AbstractNarration>The Rochester institute of Technology -- in collaboration with Auburn University, Carnegie Mellon University, and TERC -- proposes the initial stages of a years-long iterative process to develop an evidence-based, pedagogically-sound computing trajectory for students in middle school through early college. The project is based on a novel three-stage model of programming instruction using the Microsoft Kodu, Alice, and Tekkotsu programming frameworks. It will address the questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Can the proposed three-stage model for programming instruction, accelerate student progress on mastering computational thinking?&lt;br/&gt;-- Can students develop a deeper understanding of computer science concepts by learning to draw explicit analogies between realizations  &lt;br/&gt;   of the same idea in different settings, i.e., in different software frameworks, or in Kinesthetic Learning Activities like CS   &lt;br/&gt;   Unplugged?&lt;br/&gt;-- How can programming environments be made more accessible to students with disabilities such as visual impairment, deaf/hard of &lt;br/&gt;   hearing, mobility impairment (e.g., cerebral palsy), or learning and cognitive impairment (e.g., autism or ADD)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last question will be addressed in collaboration with Microsoft FUSE Labs on accessibility enhancements to Kodu, and continuing development of BridgIT, an alternative to Alice designed with accessibility in mind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant will do preliminary work on these questions, collecting pilot data at a week-long summer camp for students, and a two-day workshop for K-12 teachers. The award will allow the PIs to refine their hypotheses, conduct pilot experiments, deepen their relationships with academic and industry partners, and formulate the detailed research plan needed for the eventual full proposal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Goals.  The Computer Science for All (CS4ALL) project was designed to develop a model for computer science education that could serve a broad audience of students and teachers.  Our specific goals were:  To help students understand computer science concepts by developing a novel way to teach computer programming &ndash; one that demonstrated the same idea in different settings and taught students to draw explicit analogies between them To develop adaptations that would enable students with disabilities to fully participate in CS education      Activities and Outcomes.  We designed (and piloted) a laddered curriculum using a series of programming environments (Microsoft Kodu, Alice, and Lego Robotics) and kinesthetic activities to introduce and reinforce computer science concepts.  The combination of computer-based and hands-on activities enabled students to explore and apply CS concepts in different ways while working in small groups.  Careful attention was given to enable students with disabilities to fully participate.  Examples of changes for inclusiveness include student material legibility, kinesthetic activity material design, and programming tutorial files designed to maximize legibility and participation by all students.  The curriculum was tested in a one-week computer programming camp at Auburn University in July 2012.  Thirty-one students attended the camp, including seven with disabilities.   Analysis of student work and pre/post-camp attitudinal surveys indicates that participants learned the computer science concepts introduced in the curriculum, and that they came away from the camp more confident in their computer science abilities.  The majority of students felt they learned a lot about programming during the camp, and intended to continue their explorations in computer programming.  The results from this planning grant led to the submission of a full proposal to the CE21 program to implement a modified version of the tiered curriculum for second and third graders, using Kodu and Scratch.   A workshop was held at Auburn University in February 2013.  Twelve middle and high school teachers attended the 2-day workshop to learn about the activities and technologies used in the curriculum.
