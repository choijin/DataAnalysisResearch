<AbstractNarration>There is a growing global trend to utilize alternative energy resources mainly driven by rising energy demand, depleting natural resources and adverse effects of carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption.  The earth's near surface contains a huge potential of stored geothermal energy that can be used for heating and cooling.   Below a depth of about 10 m, seasonal ground temperatures remain stable compared to outside air temperatures, typically lying between 10-18Â° C.  This near surface heat energy can be efficiently accessed using heat exchangers consisting of buried pipes (i.e., "geothermal loops") filled with a glycol-water mixture that is circulated between the structure and the subsurface using a ground source heat pump.  Over the past 20 years, this ground coupling concept has been expanded from mainly residential applications to large-scale projects.  Of particular interest is the application where geothermal loops have been integrated into deep foundation elements, such as piles, piers, or drilled shafts.  These systems, referred to as Energy Piles, are used in soft soils where deep foundations are already needed for structural support.  The integration of the geothermal loops comes at little additional cost.  Energy Piles have the advantage of being applicable in any climate or region, including those where wind and/or solar power have limited effectiveness.  In ideal conditions, Energy Piles can significantly reduce carbon footprint and lower heating and cooling costs and energy use for buildings by as much as 80%.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Energy Piles have seen exponential growth in Europe and Japan over the last decade, they have received little attention in the US.  This is partly due to a lack of awareness about their benefits, along with a lack of US case studies that demonstrate their cost-effectiveness.  There are also questions related to their thermal and thermo-mechanical behavior that must be answered before their designs can be fully optimized.  The main issues involve a lack of standardized field testing procedures and a lack of long-term operational studies that cover a wide range of climatic and soil conditions.  The main purpose of this study is to investigate long-term Energy Pile behavior and to develop new Energy Pile design guidelines.  The project will involve field testing at five sites across the US, along with advanced numerical modeling, and technology transfer and outreach.  During the field tests, the tested Energy Pile will be loaded to simulate the combined effect of the building load as well as the temperature changes due to heat exchange operations.  In addition to field tests on individual piles, the heat exchange behavior of a group of 9 Energy Piles will be tested at one of the sites to better understand the group efficiency of Energy Piles.  Experimental results from the field tests will be used to calibrate the advanced numerical models that simulate long term Energy Pile behavior in a series of parametric analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is conducted in partnership with several industrial participants as well as non-profit organizations and government agencies.  Several industrial participants are providing in-kind contributions by building full-scale field tests, donating materials, instrumentation and heat pumps.  Three foundation engineering contractors (Berkel, Thatcher and Layne GeoConstruction) are installing Energy Piles and assisting with the field testing.  Piping for the geothermal loops and heat pumps for the field tests will be provided by REHAU and WaterFurnace, respectively.  Geo-Instruments, Inc. is assisting with field instrumentation and data acquisition, and providing the necessary sensors for the field tests.  Several non-profit organizations and government agencies such as the US Green Building Council, the Deep Foundations Institute, and the Federal Highway Administration are participating by reviewing the findings, providing guidance, and helping to broaden dissemination of the results to the engineering community and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main intellectual merit is that, this university-industry collaboration will answer key questions about long-term thermo-mechanical and Energy Pile group performance, and provide new industry design guidelines and field testing procedures.  In terms of broader impact, the work would help promote the use of Energy Pile technology in the United States, and thereby help reduce fossil fuel consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, lower the cost of heating and air conditioning, and decrease our reliance on foreign energy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There is a developing trend around the world to explore alternative energy sources. The main driving forces are growing global energy demand, depleting natural resources and the potential effects of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption. Geothermal energy is one of the promising renewable sources that can be utilized to offset such trends. To date, the use of geothermal energy has been limited mainly to certain localized hot-spot areas where it is used either for district heating and/or electricity generation. However, the constant temperature and heat storage capacity of near-surface soils in any region represents a significant potential of stored energy that can be used for heating and cooling of buildings.</p> <p>Ground temperatures below a depth of about 10 meters remain stable compared to outside air temperatures, typically lying between 10-20&deg;C in most regions. As an example, the ground temperature profiles at three cities representing cold, mild and hot climates are shown in Figure 1. Temperatures near the surface fluctuate with seasonal ambient temperature changes, while the temperatures at deeper levels remain stable at about the mean annual temperature at that location. This relatively constant temperature and the thermal storage capacity of the ground can be exploited for heating and cooling purposes.</p> <p>Traditionally, geothermal boreholes have utilized this concept for space heating and cooling. Over the past 20 years, this ground coupling concept has been expanded from geothermal borehole systems to the use of building foundation elements as heat exchangers. Energy piles in particular are one innovative technology in which geothermal loops are integrated into the deep foundation elements, such as piles, piers or drilled shafts, which enables the utilization of these elements as heat exchangers. In this concept, energy piles serve the dual purpose of providing structural support and can be used for building heating and cooling as shown in Figure 2.</p> <p>This study focused on the long-term performance of energy piles in climates where unbalanced seasonal heating and cooling demands are prevalent. The integrated research plan consisted of experimental and numerical modeling components. A series of thermo-mechanical pile load tests were performed in Houston, Texas where seasonal cooling demands outweigh heating demands due to the hot climate. A photograph of the field test setup and a schematic of the testing configuration are shown in Figure 3. Heating and cooling episodes were imposed on the test pile as the structural load was maintained to investigate the thermo-mechanical behavior of the energy pile under different conditions.</p> <p>The analytical and numerical modeling component of the research plan included building physics simulations to establish energy demand profiles at more than 100 locations around the world. As an example, annual ground thermal loads for heating/cooling demand are shown in Figure 4. It is seen that the amplitude and duration of ground cooling loads are larger and longer respectively for Moscow with cold climate. Ground cooling and heating loads are somewhat balanced for Istanbul where the climate is mild. On the contrary, ground heating is dominant in terms of amplitude and duration in comparison to ground cooling for San Antonio with hot climate. These ground thermal loads can have implications for the long-term performance of energy piles.</p> <p>Furthermore, ground thermal loads are used to evaluate the long-term performance of energy piles in terms of ground temperature progression and thermo-mechanical behavior. It is likely that the ground temperatures will decrease over the course of energy pile operations at cold climates as a result of unbalanced ground energy demand. Similarly, ground temperatures will increase in hot climates as schematically shown in Figure 5. These types of unbalanced energy demand profiles and changes in ground temperatures will have a significant impact on the long-term performance and efficiency of energy piles. A series of analyses were performed and ground temperature changes within the energy pile are evaluated after 30 years of operation as shown in Figure 5. It is seen that ground temperatures decrease 2-4&deg;C in cold climates and increase 3-7&deg;C in hot climates whereas ground temperature changes are limited in areas with mild climate.</p> <p>Long-term thermo-mechanical behavior of energy piles was also investigated. Figure 6 shows the progressive uplift of an energy pile in San Antonio as a result of temperature increases and thermo-elastic expansion. These types of temperature-induced displacements can be problematic for the serviceability of the building foundation.</p> <p>In terms of intellectual merit, this study addressed a series of critical research questions about the performance of energy piles, especially what conditions make them most efficient and how repeated thermal cycles affect their long-term performance and structural load carrying capacity. In terms of broader impacts, progression of ground temperature changes at areas with unbalanced seasonal energy demand can be critical. Long-term operations under these conditions can impede the efficiency of heat exchange operations and inhibit the sustainable utilization of the ground as a renewable resource.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/13/2016<br>      Modified by: Guney&nbsp;Olgun</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473796523789_GroundTemperatureProfiles_compressed--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473796523789_GroundTemperatureProfiles_compressed--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473796523789_GroundTemperatureProfiles_compressed--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Seasonal ground temperature profiles in Moscow, Russia, Istanbul, Turkey and San Antonio, Texas, U.S.A. representing cold, mild and hot climates respectively.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Guney Olgun</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Guney&nbsp;Olgun</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473796583976_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473796583976_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473796583976_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Components of an energy pile with circulation loops as fluid is circulated to exchange heat with the ground and a typical energy pile system integrated to a building for heating and cooling.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Guney Olgun</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Guney&nbsp;Olgun</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473796856231_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473796856231_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473796856231_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Configuration of the thermo-mechanical pile load test in Houston, Texas and the load frame during testing of Test Pile 1 (TP-1).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Guney Olgun</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Guney&nbsp;Olgun</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473797002812_GroundThermalLoads_compressed--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473797002812_GroundThermalLoads_compressed--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1100752/1100752_10116666_1473797002812_GroundThermalLoads_compressed--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ground thermal loads and the equivalent sine wave representations throughout a year for Moscow, Russia, Istanbul, Turkey and San Antonio, Texas, U.S.A. representing cold, mild and hot climates respectively.
