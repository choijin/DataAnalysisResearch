<AbstractNarration>Triton College collaborates with its high school, university and business partners to create a pathway of study leading to skilled jobs in agricultural technology and sustainable agricultural practices with emphasis on supporting an ecological and sustainable balance between production agriculture and urban food systems. This pathway results in a seamless interdisciplinary curriculum for high school students to transition to community colleges and to four-year university programs with the implementation of an Associate of Applied Science in Sustainable Agricultural Technology. This degree creates a pipeline of students entering the emerging field of sustainable agricultural technology and also expands our urban regional sustainable agricultural economy. The degree also provides students with a strong foundation in STEM career and technical education focused on transferring knowledge and skills related to  sustainability, food science, horticulture, and related areas in the "green-collar" segment of the national economy. The project incorporates State of Illinois' Agriculture Education curriculum for high school workshops showcasing real-world examples of sustainable agriculture in urban areas. Formative evaluation provides the assessment of the new career pathway, curricular content, planning and implementation of the project activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sustainable food security is important as the population of the world is predicted to reach 9.6 billion by the year 2050 (Kochhar, 2014) and increases the demand for food on global, national, and local levels.  While industrial agriculture systems have kept pace with the increased demand for food, the water and land resources needed by conventional farming practices are shrinking on a per capita basis.  Currently, 82% of the U.S. fresh water is used for irrigation (Faeth, 2012).  Moreover, between 1975 and 2005, United States experienced a 32% reduction in arable land (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2013).  With a continually growing national population of approximately a 76% increase per year, there is a need for alternative and sustainable food production systems.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2011), population growth in the United States is especially high in urban centers. There was a 12% increase between 2000 and 2010 and over 80% of people in the U.S. live in cities. The centralization of population growth in urban centers creates a demand for food, and consumers are largely disconnected from the conventional food production system in rural communities.  The urbanization of the U.S. combined with increased consumer interest in sustainable lifestyle choices has resulted in the rise of urban food systems in metropolitan areas such as farmerÆs markets, community gardens, and urban farms.  For example, Chicago currently has 830 documented urban gardens and farm sites (Chicago Urban Agriculture Mapping Project, 2015).  In addition to the outdoor gardens, Chicago is also home to a number of entrepreneurs who have converted unused warehouse space into productive indoor farms (City of Chicago, 2006).  These hydroponic and aquaponics facilities provide local restaurants and grocery stores with year-round supply of fresh produce.  These growth in urban agriculture has created an increased need for trained urban agriculture technicians in the Chicago area (Illinois Green Economy Network, n.d.).  This project developed an educational pathway to address the demand for sustainable agriculture technicians in the Chicago metropolitan region by recruiting, training, and placing students in science technology engineering and math careers.  To this end, Triton College: (1) created a Sustainable Agriculture Technology (SAT) program, (2) developed a new pipeline of students using articulated curricula from high schools to community college to four year colleges and universities, and (3) engaged industry and community partners to help design and implement the educational pathway to meet the demand for sustainable agricultural technicians (Triton College, 2014).  First, regarding the SAT program development, this project began by defining and identifying the guiding principles of SAT. Next, Triton College faculty developed 17 new courses and created the SAT Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree and curriculum (Triton College Horticulture Department, n.d.).  In total, 347 students enrolled in at least one course developed by this project.  Of which, eight students graduated with a degree or certificate in SAT.  Second, regarding the educational pipeline, this project conducted an environmental scan to identify and build relationships with three high school partners within Triton CollegeÆs service area. Triton College faculty led a series of five professional development workshops for 23 high school science educators.  These workshops resulted in the development and implementation of three school-based agriculture projects, integration of sustainable agriculture into high school science education, and increased awareness of sustainable agriculture careers among 207 urban high school students.  Moreover, 40% of high school students reported they would like to learn more about SAT careers. This project also focused on expanding access to urban high school students and underrepresented minorities. As such, 331 minorities were re...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
