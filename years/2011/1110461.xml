<AbstractNarration>Flowering plant diversity is regarded as a striking example of rapid radiation. Hypotheses to explain the evolutionary success of flowering plants consider the role of plant-animal interactions mediated by the flower. Using a candidate gene approach, this proposal will test for the function of MADS box genes, known to be responsible for flower development, in the evolution of floral form. We focus on the Zingiberales, a lineage of tropical plants including bananas and gingers, containing a diversity of floral forms associated with efficient pollination. Also, this research will isolate candidate MADS box genes from Zingiberales species and examine their expression temporally and spatially to characterize the gene networks underlying flower development and evolution. Genome sequences for Musa and transcriptome (RNA-Seq) data from across Zingiberales will be used to investigate additional genes responsible for the evolution of flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research contributes to multi-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in evolutionary biology, developmental genetics, and plant morphology. Results will be presented at national and international scientific meetings and as peer-reviewed publications. A better understanding of the gene networks underlying evolution of flowers will benefit other research studying non-model flowering plants and may prove helpful for agricultural research in Musa acuminata (banana), Zingiber officinale (ginger), Cucurma longa (turmeric), Elettaria sp. (Cardamom) and the improvement of horticultural cultivars.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

What are the genetic and evolutionary processes underlying diversity of forms we see in plants? These are just some of the fundamental questions concerning developmental evolution of floral diversity that this proposal contributed to answering.  In general terms, one major results of this research was the generation of data support the hypothesis that evolution repeatedly uses a few basic mechanisms in order to shape different parts of the plant, a process referred to as æco-optionÆ. In the case of the Zingiberales, we show that the morphological evolution of the male floral organs (stamens) utilizes similar developmental mechanisms to those used to shape leaf form.  However, the evolution of morphological diversity is not always as simple as understanding basic genetic mechanisms from model systems.
