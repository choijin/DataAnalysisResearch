<AbstractNarration>This project investigates cross-cultural differences in memory. In six experiments that integrate behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) methods, this approach analyzes how the details people remember for visual images differ across cultures. The lens of culture can direct preferred modes of processing and/or attention to particular features of the environment, and this will affect what is remembered. In a comparison of East Asian, Turkish, and Western (i.e., American) cultures, Angela Gutchess of Brandeis University will examine cultural differences in exactly what people remember. Americans are predicted to remember more specific details due to their preferential attention to features. In contrast, the groups will be well-matched on general memory, which is not dependent upon attention to features. Predicted cultural differences in memory should reflect the use of intentional strategies, and directing people's attention to specific, relevant features should reduce cross-cultural differences in memory. Furthermore, aging, which reduces the availability of cognitive capacities to deploy strategies and process details in explicit memory, should reduce cross-cultural differences in memory specificity. In contrast, for implicit memory, cultural differences in memory for specific details will continue to be observed because the development of implicit memories is not thought to depend on cognitive capacity.  Functional neuroimaging methods will provide converging evidence for cultural differences in memory specificity, and identifying neural regions will help the PI to distinguish between different theoretical accounts for why people from different cultures remember things differently.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the proposal include examining cultural differences across both explicit and implicit memory, which are thought to be separable memory systems. To date, the majority of research findings on memory are based on Western populations, meaning that theories of memory may largely characterize Westerners and may not generalize to other populations. The study of cultural differences will lead to a more inclusive field of psychology, with a better understanding of which memory principles are universals vs. are culture-dependent. The proposed work will make substantial advances in understanding the mechanisms of cross-cultural differences in memory specificity by employing a multimethod approach using sensitive memory measures, including neuroimaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By studying memory in a multicultural world, the proposed studies may contribute to better cross-cultural understanding as well as better scientific understanding. Little work has investigated cultures outside of the East/West dichotomy. If the nature of memory formation differs across cultures, this could help people better understand why people from Eastern and Western cultures often view the world differently because what we remember powerfully shapes what we believe. In legal settings, for example, people who remember more details of the situation in which a crime was committed may hold a perpetrator less responsible than people who focus solely on (and disproportionately remember) the perpetrator's actions. Diverse populations will also be included in this research through international collaboration and participation of non-Westerners in the proposed research.  This will provide a training ground for young scientists across international sites and heightening their awareness of the impact of culture on psychological processes. Finally, the work will be broadly disseminated through participation in international conferences as well as science outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project advanced our understanding of how culture influences memory and attention.  We established that although Americans and East Asians similarly remember having seen pictures of objects before, Americans can encode more perceptual details of objects into memory than East Asians.  The recruitment of neural regions, as assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) also differs during the encoding of items with high levels of specific detail vs. more generally at the level of the item (e.g., being able to recognize that one saw this specific mug earlier, versus another mug with different perceptual details).  East Asians recruited both memory (hippocampus) and late visual (fusiform) regions more than Americans during the encoding of objects with specific details, compared to the formation of more general memories.  How these regions differently contribute across cultures must be elucidated in future research.  However, our studies provide evidence that culture should be considered another individual difference that affects general and specific memory and modulates neural regions underlying these processes.   In addition to our work on memory specificity, we investigated cross-cultural differences in memory errors.  We found that Americans are more likely to falsely remember categorically-related information, consistent with their preference for using categories to sort and explain information.  This cultural difference extends to healthy older adulthood, with older Americans committing more categorical memory errors than older Turks.  Furthermore, older adults across cultures commit more memory errors for information that has related meaning to the studied information.  This provides preliminary evidence that age-related increases in memory errors are pervasive, and are not an artifact of cognitive styles associated with a particular culture.  We also find evidence of cultural differences in emotional memory.  We assessed this using the emotion trade-off effect, through which emotional objects impairs memory for neutral background information, relative to the encoding of neutral backgrounds that had been paired with a neutral object.  This paradigm has been well-characterized in Western cultures, though we find that it is not as robust of an effect in our study of Turks.  This finding may be in line with previous work showing cross-cultural differences in attention to background contexts. Our results may suggest that Eastern culturesÆ prioritization of background contextual information may help to protect against the trade-off effect in emotional memory.  We also find evidence that Turks are better at resolving visual interference than Americans.  In detecting a central item in the Flanker task (e.g., responding to the middle item in an incompatible display like E F E or a compatible display like E E E), AmericansÆ accuracy was more impacted than TurksÆ accuracy on incompatible trials.  Overall, these results suggest ways in which individuals from different cultures may perceive, attend to, and remember, different aspects of the environments around them.  The project also offers some initial evidence as to the role of perceptual and mnemonic brain systems that can be shaped by culture.  This work contributes to our understanding of psychology in a multicultural world. Because prior research has been conducted predominantly in Western cultures, our understanding of human thought and interaction may not characterize subgroups within a culture or non-Western populations. Broadening our understanding of cultural differences will lead to a more inclusive field of psychology, with a better understanding of which principles are universals, and more accurate models of memory. This research offers initial evidence of the different types of information or strategies that are remembered, accurately or erroneously, across cultures, including with age.
