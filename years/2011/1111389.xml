<AbstractNarration>Prof. Scott McLuckey at Purdue University is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program for investigations aimed at expanding analytical capabilities of mass spectrometry via novel approaches to gas-phase ion formation and transformation.   Mass spectrometry is a powerful means of characterizing the mass and structure of gaseous ions.  Dr. McLuckey is exploring novel approaches for generating gaseous ions based on exposing charged droplets and/or clusters to reactive vapors.  Altering the chemical environment in charged droplets can have dramatic effects on the observed mass spectra, with respect both to ionization efficiency and ion-type.  This work will add to the range of options available to manipulate analyte species for subsequent mass spectrometric analysis because it represents an approach that is intermediate between the bulk condensed-phase and the gas-phase.  &lt;br/&gt; This work has significant potential for expanding and improving the performance and applicability of mass spectrometry.  The work is highly multi-disciplinary, and exposes students to ion physics, ion chemistry, instrumentation, and analytical chemistry, in addition to issues specific to the measurement challenge (e.g., pharmaceutical analysis, biomarker detection, protein interaction research, etc.).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemical analysis, which addresses the questions of "What is it?" and "How much is there?" at the atomic and molecular levels, has become an essential activity in support of the economy, our stewardship of the environment, health care, criminal justice, etc.  Indeed, chemical analysis affects our lives in many ways.  Among the most powerful tools for chemical analysis is mass spectrometry (MS).  MS is a technique that relies of the precise and accurate measurement of atomic/molecular mass to address the question "What is it?" and signal levels to address the question "How much is there?".  In order to be able to use mass spectrometry, the atoms/molecules of interest must first be generated as gaseous ions.  It is this process of gaseous ion formation that was the focus of this research project.    Among the most powerful and widely used approaches for generating gaseous ions from non-volatile and thermally labile species is electrospray ionization (ESI).  The 2002 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to John Fenn for his pioneering work with this ionization method.  It has become the most widely used approach for ionizing involatile compounds that are present in solution.  It has become a dominant method for ionizing compounds of interest in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, for example.  This technique relies on the generation of charged droplets that eventually give rise to gaseous ions.  The processes by which ions are generated from charged droplets are complex and are currently understood mainly at a qualitative level.  However, there are roles for chemistry in the liquid droplets, surface exposure effects, and gas-phase reactions.  This research project was devoted to altering the chemistry in charged droplets with the ultimate objective of expanding the capabilities of ESI in generating ions for subsequent analysis via mass spectrometry.  Our research employed two approaches to altering the chemistry of the electrospray droplets that give rise to ions for mass spectrometry.  The first involved exposing the electrospray droplets to reactive vapors.  The second involved the use of electrospray emitters with two channels that lead to rapid mixing at the point where charged droplets are formed.  The former approach enables the alteration of droplet chemistry mostly after the droplets are formed whereas the latter enables the alteration of solution chemistry just prior to, and in conjunction with, droplet formation.  Using the vapor exposure method, we succeeded in demonstrating the ability to denature or renature proteins in the droplets with consequent alteration of the charges observed on the ions by exposing the droplets to either gaseous acids or bases.  It is useful to be able to alter the charges of ions in many chemical analysis scenarios.  We followed this work by showing that we could denature proteins and label them with deuterium atoms.  This allows for the study of protein denaturation.  This work was described in an article that was highlighted on the cover of the Journal of Mass Spectrometry.  We also showed that exposure of electrospray droplets to organic vapors could result in removal of salt cations, thereby resulting in a greatly simplified mass spectrum with minimal salt adduction.  We were able to determine the underlying mechanism for this surprising result.  An instrument vendor now offers a front-end option for mass spectrometers that is designed to enable the vapor exposure approach.  The second approach has allowed for the introduction of non-volatile additions to make ESI mass spectra more useful.  We have also showed that the mixing of solutions within the electrospray emitter can be enhanced via controlled electroosmosis.  This has enable the development of what we call ælab-in-a-tipÆ.  Collectively, the research conducted in this project has added new capabilities for the most important method for generating ions for mass spectrometry.  The broad impact of this work is the impro...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
