<AbstractNarration>Most natural signals are inherently sparse in certain bases or dictionaries where they can be &lt;br/&gt;approximately represented by only a few significant components carrying the most relevant &lt;br/&gt;information. In other words, the intrinsic signal information usually lies in a low-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;subspace and the semantic information is often encoded in the sparse representation. &lt;br/&gt;Processing of such signals in the sparsified domain is much faster, simpler, and more robust &lt;br/&gt;than doing so in the original domain, making sparsity an extremely powerful tool in many &lt;br/&gt;classical signal processing applications. Recently, with the emergence of the Compressed &lt;br/&gt;Sensing (CS) framework, sparse representation and related optimization problems involving &lt;br/&gt;sparsity as a prior called sparse recovery have increasingly attracted the interest of researchers &lt;br/&gt;in various diverse disciplines, from statistics, to information theory, applied mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;signal processing, coding theory and theoretical computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves the analysis, development, and application of robust sparsity-driven &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for already-collected highly-correlated data sets where signals often exhibit a high &lt;br/&gt;level of joint-sparsity and rich correlation structure. Examples of such data include natural video &lt;br/&gt;sequences, volumetric medical images, huge image database, hyperspectral imagery (HSI), &lt;br/&gt;and raw synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals. The research develops a novel unifying robust &lt;br/&gt;sparse-recovery framework based on context-aware and observable data-adaptive dictionaries,&lt;br/&gt;focusing on two classes of practical applications of sparse recovery: (i) Representative -- &lt;br/&gt;denoising, concealment, inpainting, enhancement; and (ii) Discriminative -- clustering, detection, &lt;br/&gt;classification, and recognition. Recovery/Discrimination accuracy is greatly improved by taking &lt;br/&gt;into account inter-patch spatial correlation,  inter-frame temporal correlation, and by adapting &lt;br/&gt;algorithms dynamically based on local signal contents as well as by maximizing the level of &lt;br/&gt;discrimination within the sparse recovery process.</AbstractNarration>
