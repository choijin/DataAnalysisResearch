<AbstractNarration>Doing mathematics involves more than simply solving problems; justifying mathematical claims is an important part of doing mathematics. In fact, proving and justifying are central goals of learning mathematics.  Recently, the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics has again raised the issue of making and critiquing arguments as a central practice for students studying mathematics. If students are to learn to make and critique arguments within their mathematics classes, teachers must be prepared to support their students in learning to argue appropriately in mathematics. This learning often occurs during class discussions in which arguments are made public for all students in the class. The act of creating arguments together in a classroom is called collective argumentation. Teachers need to be able to support students in productively engaging in collective argumentation, but research has not yet shown how they learn to do so. This project will document how mathematics teachers learn to support their students in engaging in productive collective argumentation. The research team will follow a cohort of participants (college students majoring in mathematics education) through their mathematics education coursework, observing their engagement in collective argumentation and opportunities to learn about supporting collective argumentation. The team will continue to follow the participants into their first two years of teaching, focusing on how their support for collective argumentation evolves over time. During their first two years of teaching, the research team and participants will work together to analyze the participants' support for collective argumentation in order to help the participants develop more effective ways to support collective argumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research has shown that engaging students, including students from underrepresented groups, in appropriately structured reasoning activities, including argumentation, may lead to enhanced learning. This project will provide information about how teachers learn to support collective argumentation and will allow for the development of professional development materials for prospective and practicing teachers that will enhance their support for productive collective argumentation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The CAREER: Learning to Support Productive Collective Argumentation in Secondary Classes project investigated how secondary mathematics teachers learn to support their students in making mathematical arguments. This project followed a cohort of prospective secondary mathematics teacher through their on-campus coursework, through student teaching, and into their first few years of teaching. Prospective teachers' engagement in pedagogical-focused and content-focused courses (2 per semester) was carefully documented, with particular attention paid to their engagement in argumentation as students. A strategically-designed unit about engaging students in argumentation was taught, and prospective teachers' engagement in that unit was documented. Data was collected to examine the prospective teachers' beliefs about mathematics, teaching, and proof as well as their developing professional identities.

Others rejected the teacher perspective and used their experiences as students to validate the arguments. Still others used a combination of these perspectives. Prospective teachers who drew on their own experiences as students expected primarily empirical arguments from students, while those who drew on multiple experiences held higher expectations for students.

We published a case study introducing a new way prospective teachers may engage in their teacher education programs. In this case study, we used information gleaned from interviews and reflective papers to introduce a prospective secondary mathematics teacher, describe her beliefs and shifts in beliefs, identify a resistance to change that resonated with our other experiences, and conclude that this new belief structure allows us to explain her reactions and interpretations within our secondary mathematics education program.
