<AbstractNarration>Supercells (long-lived rotating thunderstorms) have great impact on our society, accounting for the vast majority of tornadoes and very large hail, and also often producing intense local rainfall and damaging non-tornadic winds.  Recent climatologies and process studies have revealed that cold pool (outflow) properties, lower tropospheric vertical wind shear, and lower tropospheric stability are fundamental to processes such as supercell maintenance and tornadogenesis.  However, true "cause and effect" remains elusive because there are still a number of unknown physical links.  This lack of knowledge is important because, without it, the ability to forecast and produce timely warnings (and avoid false alarms) for supercellular hazards is unlikely to improve. This research seeks to address gaps in the knowledge base by continuing our hypothesis-driven research on fundamental supercell processes.  This study includes both analyses of recently-collected data from the Verification of the Origins of Rotation Experiment 2 (VORTEX2), as well as numerical simulations that are motivated by and compared to those measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this application is to analyze the lower tropospheric outflow processes and storm-environment feedbacks in tornadic and non-tornadic supercells.  To accomplish the goal of this application, the project will pursue three specific objectives: 1) explain the downdraft processes that produce surface vorticity beneath supercells; 2) establish the comparative importance of low-level vertical wind shear vs. low-level stability in the maintenance or demise of supercells; and, 3) identify the near-storm environmental modifications produced by supercells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This study directly addresses three of the VORTEX2 scientific foci: tornadogenesis, relationships between supercell storms and their environments, and storm-scale numerical weather prediction. The research is innovative because it exploits the cutting edge VORTEX2 dataset to attack gaps in the knowledge base, and because it addresses a number of novel hypotheses for production of surface vorticity in supercells.  The outcomes of this effort will include advanced understanding of low-level processes in supercells, including dynamics associated with tornadogenesis, storm maintenance, and storm-environment interactions. The research is expected to be significant, because it will provide additional insight into severe storms that threaten citizens' lives and property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;Given the considerable initial outlay of public funds for the VORTEX2 campaign, continued support for analysis of VORTEX2 data is a well-leveraged investment.  In the face of 2011's historic number of tornado fatalities, advances in supercell and tornado forecasting and warning would be in the public interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support training and mentoring for graduate students as well as a postdoc.  The PI also continues to incorporate data and results from VORTEX2 into his routine courses.  The high profile of the experiment and unprecedented datasets make the results extremely appealing to students.  The PI also has an ongoing commitment to involving underrepresented groups in his research and field work.  The PI agrees to restriction-free share VORTEX2 mobile soundings data with the community, and is committed to helping the community fully exploit those data.  In addition to the routine venues of conferences and journal articles, the PI will interact with operational forecasters from the National Weather Service, teach operational short courses, and present public research talks on VORTEX2.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Supercells (long-lived rotating thunderstorms) have great impact on our society, accounting for the vast majority of significant tornadoes, among other hazards. The goal of this project was to analyze the difference between environments that produce tornadic storms vs. environments that produce nontornadic storms.  We developed a novel modeling technique for including environmental heterogeneity (or unsteadiness) within idealized simulations, which  was then used alongside observations to understand how environmental changes led to the dissipation of an intense supercell from VORTEX2.  It appears that both low-level stability and changing environmental vertical wind shear played an important role in storm demise.  This modeling technique was also used with VORTEX2 soundings to isolate the impacts of the early evening transition upon supercell evolution.  Early-evening increases in low level shear established stronger mesocyclones in the simulated supercells, which were able to compensate for the contemporaneous increases in static stability.  This might  explain why the peak occurrence of tornadoes in in the early evening (when low-level shear has increased) rather than in the mid-afternoon (when instability is greatest).  We used observations and idealized simulations to study a supercell from VORTEX2 that was decoupled from the near-surface air.  Air parcels above a stable layer fueled the storm as a result of the simulated supercell?s own dynamic lifting. In contrast, low-level air in the simulation followed an ??up&ndash;down?? trajectory, being lifted dynamically within the stable layer before becoming strongly negatively buoyant and descending back to the surface; this mechanism can lead to severe surface winds despite the low-level stability.  We developed a new technique for analysis of supercell simulations, which isolates the fraction of an air parcel?s final vorticity that is attributable to the initial ambient environment (as opposed to being storm-generated).  This technique was used to show that pre-tornadic surface vertical vorticity originates due to temperature gradients within the supercell and not rearrangement of initial vorticity from the far field.  This finding was reinforced by a series of toy model simulations using a heat sink, which showed that ambient vertical shear is in no way a requirement for the production of large surface vertical vorticity.  Instead, the key is flow through the zone of cooling (where vorticity is again produced via temperature gradients).  We used VORTEX2 soundings to create the first observationally-based 3D composites of the near storm environments of tornadic and nontornadic supercells (Parker 2014).  It appears that vertical wind shear increases as one approaches a supercell within the inflow sector, providing favorable conditions for supercell maintenance (and possibly tornado formation) despite small amounts of low-level cooling near the storm.  The composites also reveal that tornadic supercells occurred in environments with more instability, more vertical wind shear, higher boundary layer relative humidity, and lower tropospheric horizontal vorticity that is more streamwise in the near-storm inflow.  We then used the VORTEX2 composite soundings (above) to produce idealized simulations of supercells in the mean tornadic and mean nontornadic environments.  Both environments produce strong supercells with robust midlevel mesocyclones and hook echoes.  However, the supercell in the tornadic environment develops a tornado-like vortex exceeding the EF3 wind speed threshold, whereas the supercell in the nontornadic environment produces shallow vortices, which never reach the EF0 wind speed threshold.  Analysis showed that while the nontornadic supercell readily produces subtornadic surface vortices, these vortices fail to be stretched and intensified by the low-level updraft. This is due to a disorganized low-level mesocyclone caused by predominately crosswise vorticity in the lowest few hundred meters above ground level within the nontornadic environment. In contrast, the tornadic supercell ingests predominately streamwise horizontal vorticity, which promotes a strong low-level mesocyclone with enhanced dynamic lifting and stretching of surface vertical vorticity.    This grant supported the training and mentoring of one post-doctoral scholar as well as four graduate students.  This included the mentoring and completion of graduate degrees by two female scientists.  The PI supported infrastructure for research via continued sharing and processing of soundings data from the VORTEX2 project.  In addition to the routine venues of conferences (AMS Conference on Severe Local Storms, AMS Conference on Mesoscale Processes) and peer-reviewed journal articles (14 articles partially or fully supported), the PI frequently interacts with operational forecasters via presentations at local NWS offices, through a regional e-mail list and blog, through monthly conference calls among participants in the "high shear-low CAPE" severe weather working group, and through teaching at recent operational courses.  Societal benefits that could reasonably be expected to accrue from the completed research include improved forecasting, nowcasting, and warnings for tornadoes and other supercellular hazards.
