<AbstractNarration>This project will be host a Biodiversity Conference in New York City from November 6-9, 2010 for the purpose of creating a blueprint for a coordinated mission of species exploration, inspiring public participation, and assessing impacts on science and society. This conference will assemble leaders from such diverse fields as taxonomy, ecology, evolutionary biology, biomimicry, computer engineering and grid computing, sustainability, climate change, history, and sociology. National and international perspectives will be represented as well as views of scientists involved in several related biodiversity initiatives, including the CollectionsWeb RCN, BHL, Encyclopedia of Life, CBoL, and PBI projects. The workshop will explore needs with regard to collections infrastructure, cyberinfrastructure, digitization, and the workforce; strategic goals to rapidly accelerate rate of species discovery by an order of magnitude; and strategic guidelines for assessing community needs over the decade ahead.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On November 7-8, 2010, about 50 scientists, engineers, scholars, and students met in New York City to consider whether technological advances make it feasible to consider an ambitious mission to discover and describe earthÃ†s species and map their distributions in the biosphere.  Sustainable biodiversity is important to ecosystem functions, but without baseline data about what species exist and where it is difficult to detect or monitor changes in biodiversity.   Nearly 2 million species have been described since 1758 but it is estimated that 8 to 10 million additional species remain unknown to science.  It was concluded that an immediate acceleration of the rate of species discovery by an order of magnitude, to about 200,000 species/year, would result in near encyclopedic knowledge of species in 50 years or less.  A combination of strategic investments in cyberinfrastructure, collections, workforce, and collaborative research were recommended to achieve this increased rate of discovery.   Such a mission would have transformative impacts on environmental research and make the adaptations of millions of organisms to their environments accessible to engineers, designers, and others seeking sustainable solutions to challenges facing society.  The proposed mission would leverage existing expertise, collections, and projects and result in immediate and enduring benefits to science and society.
