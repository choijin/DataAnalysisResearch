<AbstractNarration>How do Americans' attitudes toward social groups affect their attitudes about political issues? Scholars have long known that issues can have a "group-centric" basis. That is, people when people think of an issue, they think of the group that issue would seem to most involve.  Still two important questions remain. What specific kinds of group-centric attitudes are relevant to the formation of policy attitudes? Under what conditions do group-centric attitudes predict policy attitudes? Via a 2012 survey, the investigator will assess attitudes toward two social groups -African-Americans and Muslims- using a variety of measures. Scholarly literature uses many such measures but does not always consider which of them is more predictive of attitudes and why. The survey will also contain a set of experiments that investigate three types of conditions that may determine whether issues become group-centric in the public's mind: who sponsors the policy, whether the policy directly targets a group, and whether the policy is framed as implicating a group. By testing for the individual and joint effects of these conditions, the investigator  can better determine how and why group-centrism affects political attitudes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have several important implications. Questions about the impact of attitudes toward social groups, such as stereotypes and prejudice, occur within political science, psychology, sociology, and economics, among others. The impact of attitudes is also of interest to educators, advocacy groups, political leaders, and others who seek to mitigate such effects. Prejudice toward Muslims has been a particular concern; one that still lacks thorough empirical assessment. The findings should therefore interest scholars across several subfields as well as policymakers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The subject of my grant is  how peopleÃ†s attitudes toward social groups come to be associated with  their attitudes toward public policies. Through a series of experiments carried out within a 2012 survey, I show that views of groups can matter in both unsurprising and surprising ways.   The unsurprising finding is that views of groups matter more when the issue clearly implicates this group.  For example, people with unfavorable attitudes of African-Americans are more likely to oppose affirmative action than people with favorable attitudes of African-Americans.  The more surprising finding is this: when a prominent group member is identified as supporting a policy, attitudes toward that group become more salient, even if the issue itself has nothing to do with that group.  For example, simply identifying Barack Obama as supporting or proposing policies like financial reform, the two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and domestic eavesdropping makes attitudes toward African-Americans important predictors of whether people support those policies.  There are two further twists as well.  First, Obama's support can actually invert the politics of an issue.  The best example is domestic eavesdropping.  Typically liberals would be more likely to oppose those policies than conservatives.  But when Obama is named as a supporter, racial liberals become more supportive than racial conservatives.  This suggests that racial cues can trump ideological cues.  Second, even though Obama is believed by some to be a Muslim, his support for a policy does not make people's attitudes toward Muslims a more salient predictor of their own views of that policy.  In other words, citing Obama's support makes people think more about his race than his religion.  Why is this research important?   PeopleÃ†s attitudes toward social groups are frequently characterized by  stereotypes and other misperceptions&mdash;Southerners are dumb, blacks are  lazy, and so on.  And sometimes their attitudes toward public policies reflect  their stereotypes of the groups who might benefit from those policies.   Put simply, some people favor or oppose policies at least partly  because they like or dislike the groups who might benefit.  This is a potentially problematic basis for public  opinion.  We would like opinions about public policy to center on  considerations of the objective benefits and costs of policies, or on  broader values about the role of government in economic, political, and  social life.  But when opinions about public policy are based at least  in part on stereotypes of social groups, then it is difficult to  characterize those opinions as well-informed or even accurate.  Ideally,  people would not oppose immigration because they think Latinos are  lazy.  Ideally, they would not support increasing taxes on the wealthy because they  think all rich people are greedy.  The purpose of my project is to figure out what makes these kinds of  stereotypes more potent predictors of attitudes.  Is it just inherent  in the nature of certain issues?  Or does political debate need to  implicate a particular group directly?  And does it matter who the  publicly visible sponsor of the policy is?  If we can answer these  questions, we will know something about how to make stereotypes less  potent forces in debates over public policy.
