<AbstractNarration>The research seeks fundamental understanding in cloud physics, precipitation physics, radar meteorology, and radiative transfer through clouds.  To that end, the researcher, in collaboration with graduate students, plans to conduct theoretical investigations, perform numerical experiments, analyze data from a variety of sensors, and suggest novel experiments.  The specific objectives are following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Physics of rain: do all raindrops fall at terminal speed?  Theoretical investigation and analysis of data from video disdrometers and Doppler radars will be conducted, with emphasis on fluctuations of raindrop fall velocities and deviations from a terminal speed.  This study will have implications for retrieval by profilers, Doppler radars and disdrometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Radar meteorology: the research will search for coherent backscatter data based on new theoretical analyses.  Data analysis from short pulse radars, and exploratory signal processing will be conducted.  This study will have implications of recently discovered fluctuations in raindrop surface tension in radar polarimetry.  Non-Rayleigh signal statistics of radar echoes and in-phase/quadrature signatures of heterogeneous targets will also be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Cloud physics: Is cloud ice "sloppy"? Study of freezing of supercooled water droplets and the resulting "scarred" ice and theoretical investigation of defect number density in ice versus the degree of supercooling will be carried out.   Investigation of diffusional growth of cloud droplets with emphasis on the quasi-steady approximation and associated relaxation times in mixed-phase clouds will be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Radiative transfer through clouds: surfactant-caused change in optical properties &lt;br/&gt;and the possibility of hyperspectral signatures in cloud albedo will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits:&lt;br/&gt;The questions above have not been fully addressed previously. Furthermore, fundamental studies of fluctuations in clouds and precipitation are likely to yield insights into the structure of precipitation media, fundamental processes in clouds, radar signal analysis and interpretation, and light attenuation in heterogeneous materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This research is also likely to have broad impacts on cloud physics and development of precipitation.  It will improve characterization of rainfall spatial structure for better rainfall estimation with weather radar, and radiative properties of clouds. In addition, insofar as supercooled water is a metastable liquid, the associated irreversible phase transition is of wide interest in material science.  Hence, study of the resulting defect riddled ice is likely to contribute to solid state physics as well as to physical meteorology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The original goals of this NSF proposal were to gain deeper understanding of the random and unpredictable features of weather and climate phenomena as these occur in physical and radar meteorology. The topics were: microphysics of warm (no ice) rain; weather radar; cloud physics and random drop collisions; freezing of water; transfer of sunlight through clouds.  To that end, several important outcomes of this project resulted as described next.     We examined data of millions of raindrops and concluded that most of the raindrops do not fall at the so-called terminal speed predicted by the conventional theory.  In fact, at any drop size, the measured distribution of fall speeds turned out to be much broader than anticipated on the basis of previous work.  Thus, as common of a phenomenon as rain suddenly is filled with many interesting questions.  These are not only a matter of pure scientific curiosity but have important applications such as estimating soil erosion caused by rain, or the impact and probability of flooding.     We considered the topic of small airborne particles such as dust and sand (aerosols) absorbing and scattering light and specifically worked on the question of the amount of radiation extinguished by such particles, depending on their shape.   Very often such small irregularly shaped particles remain aloft in the atmosphere for days, especially in the size range of several microns.  Assuming that such particles are randomly oriented, we were able to show that, for the same volume, spherically shaped particles extinguish least radiation.   Furthermore, for a fixed volume, the amount of extinguished radiation increases with the degree of asphericity or with the aspect ratio. We also showed that while crossing the Pacific ocean, the very non-spherical particles such as disks and needles, experienced more drag per volume, and stayed aloft higher and longer than their spherical counterparts. This contributes to our understanding and estimates of global dust transport.     We have also developed a method for analyzing time series of data, based on the occurrence of breaking records in such series. Record breaking even is such an event which exceeds all previous records in magnitude, for example.  It is distinct from a global maximum.  We used the technique to examine patterns of monthly mean temperatures around the globe. The spatial patterns of record-setting temperatures turned out quite different from actual temperature patterns.  We also managed to extend the scope of the record-breaking statistics to the general problem of measurement accompanied by measurement error and noise.      We continued to study the freezing of supercooled water into ice and identified, with the aid of high speed imaging camera, the importance of triple line at the boundary between water, air, and the substrate.  Our results suggest that when the triple line is curved and/or in motion or when the substrate is textured,  freezing of supercooled water becomes more likely.     We used satellite data on atmospheric turbidity over Boston as well as data from local ground-based stations to glean information on harmful pollution in the city.  We demonstrated that changes in the spatial resolution of satellite measurements profoundly affect the conclusions about the environmental pollution sources.
