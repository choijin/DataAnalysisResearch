<AbstractNarration>The timing of flowering is especially important in plant development because it directly impacts reproductive success. For example, flowering at the wrong time could mean that important pollinators are not present or that fragile embryos will be subjected to freezing temperatures. Thus, plants have complex and highly specific mechanisms to harmonize flowering with the natural ecosystems in which they evolved. Understanding flowering time has further important implications in agricultural settings, as flowering time can have profound effects on the overall production of commercially valuable vegetative organs, fruits, and seeds. To properly time flowering, many plants have an internal clock that monitors day length (photoperiod) and seasonally activates genes that drive the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth. In particular, activation of the floral integrator gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is an essential early step in the photoperiod-regulated transition to flowering. This project uses a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to specifically investigate how regulatory proteins called NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) mechanistically control FT expression to initiate flowering. In addition to potentially impacting agricultural production and our collective understanding of natural ecosystems, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students in both the research and classroom laboratories. Elements of the research aims will be incorporated into an upper division Plant Physiology course. Additionally, molecular plant biology forums will be initiated as part of an effort to improve collaborative interactions among Oklahoma researchers. All discoveries and resources developed from this funding will be made freely publicly available through a combination of peer-reviewed publications, distribution to public stock centers/data repositories, and direct distribution of materials.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award began with the vague understanding that a complex of proteins called NF-Y was a positive regulator of photoperiod-dependent flowering. In other words, we knew that plants required some individual members of this NF-Y protein complex to perceive variations in day and night lengths and use these environmental cues to properly time when they flowered. Since receiving funds in 2012, we have focused on developing a more complete mechanistic understanding of precisely how NF-Y complexes accomplish this task in the plant cell. Our NF-Y focus has been on flowering in the model plant Arabidopsis and, to a lesser extent, Brachypodium, while other labs worldwide have done parallel research in rice, wheat, and several other plant species. Our work with collaborators has identified the key roles of NF-Y complexes in the regulation of the&nbsp;<em>FLOWERING LOCUS T</em>&nbsp;(<em>FT</em>) gene, one of the key regulators of plant flowering. We, and others, have shown specifically where NF-Y complexes bind the DNA of&nbsp;<em>FT</em>&nbsp;to activate its expression, how this impacts the organization of the chromatin in this region, and even how subsets of the larger NF-Y complex work with a previously known regulator of flowering&nbsp;called CONSTANS. The NF-Y by CONSTANS interaction has been resolved to the level of the specific nucleotides of the&nbsp;<em>FT</em>&nbsp;gene that are bound by this novel complex. Importantly, CONSTANS is a member of a larger family of about 40 related proteins, meaning that our results have pointed to a likely DNA-binding and regulatory mechanism that was not previously known and has the capacity to be important for many other processes.
