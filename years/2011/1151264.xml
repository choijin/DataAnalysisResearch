<AbstractNarration>In this CAREER award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Leslie Sombers of North Carolina State University and her graduate student researchers will be supported to investigate the use of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to monitor the enzymatic generation of hydrogen peroxide with carbon-fiber microelectrodes.  The approach that Prof. Sombers and her students are developing will be used to measure the presence and dynamics of specific, non-electroactive analytes in biological tissue.  For her integrated educational project, Prof. Sombers will work with her students to develop a presentation to be given to the public at the North Carolina Museum of Science on the use of electrochemistry, as well as working with North Carolina State's Science House on developing hands-on materials for use in K-12 education. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In situ detection of biologically active molecules is important in helping to innovate in biology, neuroscience and medicine.  The kind of work that Prof. Sombers and her students are developing will allow researchers in these fields to make chemical measurements in relatively un-perturbed living systems.  This is important in answering fundamental questions that can lead to new understandings of the operations of living systems, as well as developing new approaches to medicine.  The graduate students working on this project will gain useful inter-disciplinary experience at the intersection of biology, chemistry and electronics.  Prof. Sombers will also continue her efforts at increasing the opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to participate in the STEM enterprise.</AbstractNarration>
