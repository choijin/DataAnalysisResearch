<AbstractNarration>This award funds the continued operations and further development of Einstein@Home and its software infrastructure, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC).  Einstein@Home is one of the largest and most powerful computers on the planet. It searches astrophysical data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars. Unlike a normal supercomputer, the computing power of Einstein@Home comes from ordinary home computers and laptops that have been "signed up" by about 300,000 members of the general public.  When otherwise idle, these computers automatically download observational data over the Internet from Einstein@Home servers, search the data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars, and return the results of the analysis to the servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutron stars are exotic objects: they represent the most compact form that a star can take before it collapses into a black hole.  Since they were discovered in 1967, about two thousand neutron stars have been found (including several discovered in 2010 and 2011 by Einstein@Home).  Neutron star observations provide a unique view into the behavior of matter at extreme pressures and densities, and into the nature of gravitation when gravity is very strong.  Under certain circumstances, neutron stars can be emitters of pulsing radio waves (pulsars). Einstein@home exploits the unique capabilities of the Arecibo Radio Observatory, the largest and most sensitive single-dish radio telescope in the world, to search for these signals. It is possible that neutron stars can also emit gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were first predicted by Einstein in 1917 but have never been directly detected. Einstein@home can search the data from gravitational wave detectors such as those of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) for these signals. Einstein@home also supports the BOINC software infrastructure to benefit dozens of computationally intensive projects in other areas of science, that also exploit volunteer distributed computing. And it is a remarkable tool for scientific outreach: Einstein@Home allows hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens from around the world to participate in and make meaningful contribution to cutting-edge scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  Einstein@Home is a project that uses computer time, donated by volunteers from around the world, to search for the weak astrophysical signals produced by spinning neutron stars. These stars, also called pulsars, are the most compact massive objects found in the universe, apart from black holes.  Einstein@Home concentrates on searches for which the sensitivity is limited by the amount of computing power available, so that increasing the number of participating computers makes it possible to identify more sources.  This NSF grant funded the development and operation of Einstein@Home from 2011-17.  During this period, we published about fifteen discovery, upper-limit and method articles in Physical Review, the Astrophysical Journal, and other highly-regarded journals.  Volunteers and Computer Power  During the funding period, the number of volunteers who contributed to our project has approximately doubled, to nearly half-a-million individuals.   As volunteers upgraded their computers, the computational power they provide has increased by a factor of more than twenty, from 330 Teraflop/second to almost 7 Petaflop/second.  On the current (November 2017) Top-500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers, this would rank Einstein@Home in between #15 and #16.  Infrastructure  During the funding period, the Einstein@Home project servers, file servers and database servers were upgraded twice.  This allowed us to handle larger volumes of work and larger numbers of volunteers.  During that period, the systems at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee were networked via VPN to mirror systems at the Albert Einstein Institute in Germany.   This allowed the pre- and post-processing  of some of the data to be shared, and enabled off-site backups.  The Einstein@Home web site was completely rewritten using a Drupal Content Management System, making it more attractive to volunteers (see first image). This is valuable:  more volunteers and more computing power lets us identify more astrophysical signals.  Gravitational Wave Searches  During the funding period, we carried out searches for continuous gravitational waves in data from the fifth and sixth science runs of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) and from the first observing run of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO).  (Data from the second observing run of aLIGO is now being processed.) We also developed new methods to search and postprocess the data, and to identify instrumental artefacts which might be confused with signals.  While no signals were detected, these give the most constraining limits for such signals (example in the second image).  Radio Pulsar Searches  During the funding period, we carried out searches for new radio pulsars in data from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and from the CSIRO Parkes Observatory in Australia, to find two neutron stars orbiting each other very quickly (period under 1h).  While we did not find one, fifty-three new pulsars were discovered, including a number of exotic systems, for example the double-neutron star binary PSR J1913+1102.  This is a significant fraction of all pulsar discoveries made during that period.  Gamma Ray Pulsar Searches  During the funding period, we carried out two extended search campaigns for gamma-ray pulsars in data from the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Satellite, launched in 2008.  These searches are very compute-intensive, because for a typical neutron star the detector only "catches" one single photon every billion rotations of the star.  The Einstein@Home search method has found over half of all gamma-ray pulsars ever detected via these pulsations, including the youngest gamma-ray pulsar ever found. It is responsible for all discoveries after 2011 (see third image). The two search campaigns have detected 23 new gamma-ray pulsars: more than 1/3 of those discovered via their gamma-ray pulsations.  Most recently we reported the discovery of PSR J1744&minus;7619, the first radio-quiet millisecond gamma-ray pulsar ever discovered (see fourth image).  Efficient Applications  During the funding period, we developed more computationally-efficient applications for Einstein@Home, and extended the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) to serve multiple applications and application versions to our volunteers.   More than half of our volunteers have personal computers containing high-performance graphics cards, so we developed versions of our main applications that run efficiently on both NVIDIA (CUDA) and AMD/ATI/Intel (OpenCL) graphics cards.   These are  as much as a factor of fifty faster than the same application on a normal computer's central processing unit (see fifth image, where the speedup is a factor of 45!).  Broader Impacts  The purpose of Einstein@Home  is to discover new neutron stars.  But the impact on science and society is broader.  Scientifically, this collaborative grant funded the further development and extension of BOINC, enabling its use in other scientific areas, unrelated to astronomy or astrophysics.  For society, Einstein@Home gives the general public a unique way to contribute to science.  A Google search for "Einstein@Home" returns 2.3 million hits; many are links to outreach or scientific articles, including those from our own website.  The Einstein@Home web site community message boards contain about 150,000 postings from our volunteers.
