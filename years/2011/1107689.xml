<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EAPSI: Multiple interactions in a network facilitates its threshold cascades     Viral marketing, instant fads, the spread of bank defaults&mdash;these cascades of changes in people, companies and financial institutions increasingly pervade modern life, with important and sometimes dire consequences. This has motivated the study of simple models of cascades in a network of individuals connected to one another. A commonly studied rule (the so-called Watts model) is that people buy a new product, say, if a sufficiently large fraction of their friends have (because friends recommend it and because its utility increases as more people use the product). By considering lending rather than friendships, this model can also describe spreading default among banks.     Most studies so far consider just one kind of interaction among the systemÆs constituents, such as friendships in a social network. But often people, banks, countries and others interact in many different ways. For instance, friends and work colleagues exhibit different influence on a personÆs decision to buy a new smartphone app. Banks also interact in many ways&mdash;through balance sheet claims, derivatives contracts and reliance on common credit lines&mdash;which collectively cause cascades. This motivates studying multiple kinds of interactions.     On an NSF EAPSI fellowship in Seoul, South Korea, in collaboration with Prof. Kwang-Il Goh and his PhD student Kyu-Min Lee at Korea University, we generalized the Watts model to multiple kinds of interactions. Namely, we studied the rule that a person joins a growing movement, say, if a sufficiently large fraction of friends in any of her social spheres have joined it.     What we found is that considering multiple kinds of interactions facilitates cascades&mdash;and in nontrivial ways.  It is easier to get an enormous cascade when people (or banks) interact in multiple ways. What this suggests is that advertising may become more effective with every new medium, while banks may grow more vulnerable with every new lending mechanism.     Prof. Goh, PhD student Kyu-Min Lee and I continue to collaborate across the Pacific after the summer concluded.
