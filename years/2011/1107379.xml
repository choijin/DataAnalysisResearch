<AbstractNarration>Many physical systems admit nonlinear waves. These systems often exhibit dissipation that is considered to be negligible or weak. However, recent work by the investigators and recently published observations of dissipation rates of ocean swell, show that the models using weak dissipation provide an inadequate description of some aspects of the evolution of nonlinear surface water waves. Thus, a main emphasis of this research is to develop a theory from first principles for the propagation and evolution of nonlinear surface water waves on a viscous fluid, with no approximation on the size of dissipation. The research addresses several projects that build on this notion and/or are intended to apply the mathematical results to ocean applications. The projects fall into two categories: A) surface waves propagating on a viscous fluid and B) waves in shallow or finite-depth water. The investigators will approach these problems by combining their individual strengths in modeling and analysis, numerical simulations, and physical experiments to obtain a fundamental mathematical description of the physical phenomena. They will then use publicly available data from ocean observations to apply their results to ocean settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this research is to understand at a fundamental, mathematical level the propagation of waves on a surface of water, and to apply this understanding to observations of waves measured in the laboratory and in the oceans. Particular applications include the effects of dissipation on the generation of waves by wind, the subsequent propagation of ocean swell, and the development of rogue waves in shallow and deep water; predicting dangerous versus benign tsunamis given the Richter-scale measure of the magnitude of the responsible earthquake and some readily available information about the geology of its location; and modeling large-amplitude waves on beaches with variable bathymetry using the new mathematical approaches investigated here. In addition, the mathematical results are expected to describe nonlinear waves in several settings, including light waves in an optical fiber, spin waves in a thin magnetic film and others. Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored and involved in experimental studies and theoretical analysis; through this project they will receive training in interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

The main intellectual outcomes of this grant include the following:   &bull; It was found that on scales over which waves evolve, the rate of dissipation in the ocean scales similarly to the rate in the laboratory and that dissipation can play an important role in the propagation of ocean swell.    &bull; Models for wave dissipation were derived that take into account viscosity as well as the effects of the air and an air-water interface that is contaminated with either a monomolecular film or a thin film of fluid.  &bull; It was established by comparing predictions from several mathematical models with data collected in physical experiments that an accurate mathematical model of dispersion (i.e. how waves "spread out") is required to model shallow-water waves.    &bull; Often, it is the pressure field under ocean waves that is measured. This measurement must be inverted to obtain a time series of the surface displacement. An exact inversion formula and an accompanying approximate formula were found by other colleagues and the PIs. Either formula does a better job than existing models of predicting time series measured in the PIÃ†s Pritchard Laboratory of localized waves, periodic waves, reflected waves and groups of waves.   &bull; A mathematical technique was developed for solving a set of three, coupled, partial-differential equations that govern systems of three resonant waves called resonant triads.   The main broader outcomes of this grant include the following:   &bull; This work involved the training of fifteen undergraduate students, three students that received MS degrees, four PhD students, and one postdoctoral researcher.    &bull; The work on inverting pressure has applications in coastal engineering and oceanography as well as in mathematics.   &bull; The solution technique for the equations of resonant triads will be useful in many fields including water waves, optics, and plasma physics.
