<AbstractNarration>The International Meshing Roundtable is a unique conference that aims to bring experts together to discuss mesh generation and related topics, which plays an important role in computational mechanics and related areas. This is a rare opportunity for researchers in the field of mesh generation to exchange ideas and also an excellent educational opportunity for students and postdoctoral fellows who are working on the meshing research and related applications. Potential topics for discussion in the conference include: CAD and computational geometry issues for meshing, surface and volume mesh generation, analysis and/or demonstration, software design, and implications of application on finite element/volume analysis, geometric modeling, computer graphics, scientific visualization, and other novel applications. The event will be held on October 23-26, 2011, in Paris, France. This is also the first time that this conference will be held outside the US in the past two decades. The conference includes four short courses, presentation of conference papers, presentation of research notes, a poster session, and a professional development session targeting students and postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the event consists of knowledge dissemination of a field of research essential to modern technologies. The symposium will include graduate students, post-docs and young researchers. The event will bring together international researchers and developers from academia, national labs, and industry in a stimulating, open environment to share technical information on mesh generation and related topics.</AbstractNarration>
