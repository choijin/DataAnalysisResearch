<AbstractNarration>This EAGER Project is the first phase in a multi-stage, multi-year project to explore Chugach artifacts in museums all over the world.  The ultimate goal is to create a larger project will create  a complete digital archive of Chugach material culture worldwide; build a temporary exhibition that can travel both within and beyond the Chugach Region local exhibits in rural communities in the Chugach region ; and establish a group of committed and trained youth and Elders who will curate their local exhibits and share the information they contain in future years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the goals of this project is to provide an avenue for the people of the region to see artifacts from their heritage and learn about the cultural significance of those artifacts through Augmented Reality technology. Although the artifacts will be on loan to the project, the exhibit will represent a vast array of cultural knowledge not currently accessible in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further, the model the project will create for studying and displaying historical information about all indigenous peoples using augmented reality technology will be examined for its utility to museums and cultural organizations in other times and places.  The project will explore critical research questions of interest to scientists and community members alike, such as:  How were traditional values and worldview expressed through objects produced within the culture? What is the value to people today of knowledge about their cultural heritage? What connections can the people of the region make between the traditional knowledge exhibited and their worldview?  These questions are particularly relevant in the context of the Alutiiq culture that has already undergone massive changes since the objects were produced and a region where people are striving to regain a culture they fear has been lost.  The guiding questions will provide a pathway towards regaining the cultural knowledge that has undergone many generations of changes. The traditional knowledge exhibited by the artifacts will be researched and documented to retain the knowledge for future generations to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research is potentially transformative on numerous levels:&lt;br/&gt;1) Youth &amp; Elders: Interaction between Youth &amp; Elders will bring a natural teaching and learning experience that was once a part of the Sugpiaq culture as they work together identifying artifacts and documenting the significance of the artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;2) Material &amp; Social Culture: The objects will be described to the Youth by the Elders on how the Sugpiaq made, used, and preserved the artifacts. How they were used in their everyday lives and the artifacts social significance will be documented.&lt;br/&gt;3) Technology &amp; Exhibits: Augmented reality technology will be used for display and interaction with the artifacts. An online archiving system will be used to document the culturally significant artifacts. &lt;br/&gt;Each of these aspects of the project will produce a model of community and science partnerships for researching and preserving knowledge and artifacts of great cultural and community significance.</AbstractNarration>
