<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF EAPSI program provided funding for the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing, China and Mississippi State University in the United States to collaborate for a study on Daurian pika (Ochotona dauurica).   The Daurian pika is a lagomorph, widely distributed in the grasslands of the Mongolian Plateau. Unlike the American Pika (Ochotona princeps) living solitarily in talus of high mountains, Daurian pikas live in burrow systems year-round, with two-four pikas per group.  The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the sex and age compositions of social groups of Daurian pikas and (2) to observe individual and social behavior of Daurian pikas.  Analysis for the first objective is continuing, and family structures are still being determined.  Initial observations were completed for the second objective.  Pika activity was classified as social, nonsocial, and other.  The study found that a majority of the time was spent doing nonsocial activities like sitting and feeding.  Pikas spent less time doing social activities like touching and playing.  The least amount of observed time was spent doing other activities like moving out of site or into a burrow.  It is important to determine the family structure of a social group of Daurian pikas and their activity patterns.  Daurian pikas are social lagomorphs, living in the steppes on the Mongolian Plateau; whereas, American pikas live solitarily in the alpine ecosystem and are vulnerable to global warming. Information gathered from this study and future comparative studies of American and Daurian pikas will help with understanding the impacts of global warming on American pikas and the evolution of group living in Daurian pikas.
