<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Gilbert Nathanson of the University of Wisconsin-Madison will couple liquid microjets with molecular beams to explore collisions and reactions at the surfaces of volatile aqueous solutions.  These gas-liquid scattering experiments will be performed by directing a beam of atoms or molecules at the surface of a liquid jet in vacuum and monitoring the identities, energies, and reaction times of the products with a mass spectrometer.  Liquid microjets are narrower than a human hair and are surrounded by only a thin vapor blanket, permitting scattering experiments to be carried out using pure, basic, and salty water solutions with vapor pressures up to several Torr.  The proposed research is dedicated to learning how acidic gases such as DCl and oxidizing gases such as F2 react with water molecules and ions at or near the surface.  The long term objective is to develop a molecular picture of gas-water reactions by exploring the interfacial analogs of bulk solvation, the "like dissolves like" rule, proton transfer, acid dissociation, and oxidation-reduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program benefits society through its research, mentoring, and outreach activities.  Scientifically, this program will help reveal the ways in which gases and aqueous solutions react industrially and in the environment.  It will concurrently provide a setting to mentor graduate and undergraduate students from a wide range of backgrounds.  The familiarity gained in this research will further be used to improve General Chemistry classes on aqueous chemistry and to engage K-12 students and their parents through hands-on surface chemistry workshops.</AbstractNarration>

We first investigated the evaporation process itself by dissolving gases such as helium and argon in the microjet and monitoring the velocities of the evaporating He and Ar atoms.  As expected, the "sticky" Ar atom evaporates in a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speeds.  To our great surprise, however, He atoms evaporate at much higher speeds.

What happens when an incoming HCl molecule lands on the surface of water?  Possible pathways are depicted in Figure 2.  Our microjet experiments show that even surface water molecules form strong enough hydrogen bonds to HCl to capture it on every collision (only "solvation" and not "trapping-desorption" in Figure 2).  This result implies that surface thermal motions are too weak to "kick" the HCl molecule from the surface before it dissociates.  Surface water molecules appear to behave like their bulk-phase cousins, readily attacking strong acids and solvating them enough to dissociate immediately.  Thirdly, spurred by the ease with which strong acids react with water, we substituted formic acid (HCOOH) for HCl and again observed that even this weak acid forms strong enough hydrogen bonds to disappear into water on every collision.  We observed similar results for weak bases such as dimethyl amine.  The biggest surprise occurred with collisions of formic acid dimer, (HCOOH)2.  This dimer is pre-bonded by two strong hydrogen bonds.  We again observed that it interacts strongly enough with surface H2O molecules to dissolve on every collision.  The dangling hydrogen bonds of surface H2O molecules must swap with the formic acid-formic acid hydrogen bonds to capture the dimer every time.
