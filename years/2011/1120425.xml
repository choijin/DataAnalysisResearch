<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  How organisms adapt to new environments is an important evolutionary question. Genome sequencing projects are currently discovering the genetic differences found in populations and between species. However, it is more difficult to determine which of these genetic changes cause adaptation and how. This project uses evolution of yeast populations in controlled laboratory conditions to watch evolution in action. By using new cheaper, faster sequencing methods, the genomes of evolved yeast strains can be decoded and compared to the ancestral founder cell. Discovered mutations can be engineered into new strains to test their effects alone and in combinations. These engineered strains will also be used to ask how mutations control which genes are active under the growth conditions. Finally, the project will repeat the evolution experiment multiple additional times to find how reproducible the results are. Results will allow discovery of what kinds of mutations are responsible for adaptation to new environments, how they lead to adaptive change, and how frequently the same genes acquire mutations if evolution is performed repeatedly. Due to the complexity of natural environments, simplified laboratory systems, like the one employed here, offer distinct advantages for testing these important questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This work will have a number of broader impacts in undergraduate and public science education, inclusion of underrepresented groups, and scientific understanding. Dr. Dunham has a strong record of educating undergraduates, including women, underrepresented minorities, and students from primarily undergraduate institutions. This research will allow more students to participate in substantive, independent research. Further understanding of evolutionary processes is a benefit to science and society. In particular, experimental demonstrations of evolution are a compelling example of evolutionary change in action. Understanding adaptation will also be useful to learning how to improve domesticated crops, animals, and microorganisms through selection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How do changes in DNA sequence allow organisms to adapt to new environments? Evolution in nature can be complex to study due to the large number of variables changing at once, and the difficulty of knowing events that happened in the past.  However, it's easy to make evolution happen in the laboratory simply by growing microbes in culture flasks: in a population of cells growing with a limited food supply, those cells that randomly get beneficial mutations will be able to outcompete their neighbors and take over the culture.  Performing evolution in the laboratory has many advantages.  We can control growth conditions, collect samples that span months or even years of evolutionary time, and repeat the experiment to see how often we get the same results.  Yeast is a great system for laboratory evolution because it grows quickly, shares many features in common with animal and plant cells, and has a small genome that is cheap to sequence.  It is also easy to do genetic crosses and genome engineering.  We evolved dozens of populations of yeast in three different growth media to watch how their genomes would change as they adapted.  In order to accomplish this, we first had to build a device called a chemostat, which maintains the yeast growing under carefully controlled conditions for months at a time by continuously flowing media and air through a culture vessel.  Chemostats are traditionally large and difficult to run.  In contrast, our miniature chemostats can be run 32 at a time by undergraduate researchers.  We published protocols and detailed video instructions so other researchers can build their own devices in their own labs.  After evolving the yeast cultures, we used next generation DNA sequencing to determine where each evolved strain's genome differed from its ancestor.  We then used genetic crosses to figure out the contribution of a subset of these mutations, individually and in combination.  By sequencing 96 populations, we could look for patterns, such as multiple populations that shared the same mutations.  Many of the mutations affect how much gene products are made in a cell, and these are some of the interesting mutations we are continuing to study.    This project provided scientific training for five female undergraduates, four of whom so far have coauthored papers and all of whom have continued in science and medical careers, including drug development, genetic counseling, pharmacy, and medicine.  Their graduate student mentor is now applying his yeast evolution and engineering skills in the synthetic biology industry.
