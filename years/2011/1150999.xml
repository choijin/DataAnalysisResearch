<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project explores the feasibility of a consortium-based program of research and evaluation to support ongoing reforms in the DC public schools and to ensure a high priority for STEM education policy and practice in the emerging design of the consortium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on several recent NRC reports, the project will support (1) the improvement of the infrastructure for collection and analysis of STEM-specific transcript data so that it becomes an integral part of the data and indicator system for DCPS; (2) an exploration of the effectiveness of a consortium in determining priority topics for evaluation and research; and (3) ensuring that the new consortium produces new knowledge useful to other consortium-based efforts underway across the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notion of a university-based consortium as a strategy for improving DC public schools is both bold and innovative and warrants exploration, development and monitoring. There are also significant risk factors reform in the DC public schools takes place in a highly charged political environment where 17 different management structures have been tried since 1804. However, the notion of a consortium that provides accurate evidence and data is a vital one, as the District attempts to sustain the momentum of reform that was initiated by moving to Mayoral control.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In May 2007, Washington, D.C.Ã†s Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) adopted a de facto policy requiring that all students pass Algebra I by the end of ninth grade in order to graduate high school on time (DCMR Title 5-E, chap. 22, sec. 03). The District was among one of the first states or territories to require four years of mathematics to earn a high school diploma and to specify a required sequence of math courses for graduation (Zinth, 2012). Under this policy, District of Columbia Public School (DCPS) students who do not pass Algebra I&mdash;the first course in the required sequence&mdash;by the end of ninth grade will be off track for high school graduation because they will not have the prerequisite to move to the next required math course in the sequence. Once off-track, their odds of completing high school on time with a DCPS diploma are greatly diminished (Allensworth &amp; Easton, 2007).  This high-stakes requirement, passing Algebra I, may present a daunting challenge for many of DCPSÃ†s current and rising ninth graders. In 2013, only 57 percent of eighth graders scored proficient in mathematics on the statewide high stakes assessment, the District of Columbia Comprehensive Assessment System (DCAS; DCPS, 2013),[1] and only 19 percent scored at or above the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) proficiency level (NCES, 2013).[2]  These students, if promoted to ninth grade, may very well be unprepared for Algebra I.  The purpose of this study was to examine ninth gradersÃ† Algebra I pass/fail rates in DCPS high schools and identify students likely to fail Algebra I in the 9th grade before they enter high school. Specifically, we used extant DCPS data on eighth graders, following them to ninth grade to address the following question: Which eighth grade variables and thresholds serve as a robust set of early warning indicators for failing Algebra I in ninth grade? We also examined middle schools to address the following question: Which middle schools enroll high concentrations of students likely to fail Algebra I in ninth grade and are in particular need of additional resources and/or supports to prepare students to pass the course? By addressing these questions, we should be able to develop an early warning indicator to provide a means to flag students who are at substantial risk for failure to help position DCPS educators to allocate resources and implement supports to the students and middle schools that need them.   The study found the following to be key early warning indicators of Algebra I failure:  &middot; Attendance below 90 percent; &middot; One or more suspensions; &middot; Failing an 8th grade mathematics course; and/or &middot; Scoring below proficient on DC CAS mathematics test      Furthermore, the pairing of two particular indicator combinations (failing 8th grade math and displaying at least one behavioral indicator) was the best early warning indicator of future Algebra I failure in ninth grade.     During the time frame of our study, the D.C. Mayor for EducationÃ†s office (DME) has under taken a study of high school graduation that dovetails with our findings and identifies overlapping early warning indicators for dropping out of high school. After sharing our results, the DME staff suggests we continue our work to better understand what is happening inside middle school academic experiences to make recommendations. Additionally, we have shared our results with DCPS Instructional Superintendents charged with supporting and improving middle school principals at a time when the political agenda includes opening new and improved middle schools across the city.
