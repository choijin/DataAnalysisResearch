<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the international conference "Challenges for Nonlinear PDE and Analysis" that will take place from June 20-24, 2011, at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on a variety of topics in the theory of partial differential equations (e.g., calculus of variations and optimal transport; qualitative properties and viscosity solutions of parabolic and elliptic PDE; dynamical issues for dissipative, dispersive, and fluid equations; front propagation and transport in mechanics, physics, and biology). All of the topic areas cited in the proposal are central to analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.</AbstractNarration>

The Madison conference also had a wide scope but had a differentformat: five main speakers gave two hours of lectures on theirresearch. This allowed for a stronger introductory component makingthe lectures particularly valuable for young researchers who wereexposed to a variety of techniques and applications of partialdifferential equations.  The speakers discussed subjects as diverse asasymptotics of stochastic perturbations of partial differentialequations, optimal transportation and super-conductivity.   Funding provided by the grant focused overwhelmingly on young researchers and was an important contribution to their training, reseach and education.
