<AbstractNarration>Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that provides the foundation for a significant fraction of computations in science and engineering. Historically, the importance of linear algebra is such that highly specialized codes written by computer scientists have been used by the community of scientific programmers as a vital part of their application programs.   With the rapid changes in computer architecture during the last several years, it would seem that corresponding modifications in linear algebra routines would be warranted. However, such progress is not in evidence; the development of such routines has been just incremental, involving successive rewrites of routines that had their genesis in the last quarter of the last century.   Correspondingly, there is something of a disconnect between the current "state-of-the-art" linear algebra libraries, modern computer architectures, and applications that utilize the libraries.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The new project will create a new, vertically integrated framework and implementation that revisits every layer of software, from low-level kernels to higher level functionality.  The vertical integration is completed with a new generation of software for computational chemistry applications, guaranteeing that the developed software, to be freely available to the public, supports sustained innovation in that domain and other sciences.  The development builds on the FLAME project, which has been funded by NSF and industry for more than a decade.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to apply state-of-the-art algorithms and software from dense linear algebra to the domain of computational chemistry. Recent advances in dense linear algebra make it possible to represent tensor computations found in quantum chemistry solvers in more elegant format that also improves their performance on modern computing systems. This project will the full potential of modern linear algebra methods for solving the electronic Schroedinger equation.  We evaluated the performance of the Hartree-Fock method at scale without solving the generalized eigenvalue problem, which is the standard method, and found that purification based solvers are competitive relative to the state-of-the-art (NWChem) both for larger molecular systems and larger numbers of processing elements.  The iterative CCSD and CCSDT methods were implemented in the Cyclops Tensor Framework and performance was demonstrated on tens of thousands of processing elements, where the efficiency of SUMMA-based tensor contractions was shown to be substantially more efficient than the unstructure algorithm used by NWChem. Iterative coupled cluster methods were shown to achieve a large fraction of peak performance on both Cray and IBM supercomputers.  We contributed to the development of a number of open-source software packages, including Elemental, NWChem, and ARMCI-MPI, and we collaborated with the developers of GTFock and BLIS.
