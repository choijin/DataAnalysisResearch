<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under NSF's Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES) activities, which aim to address the challenges of creating a sustainable world. This Research Coordination Network (RCN) sustainable energy project brings together a multidisciplinary team including U.S. academics from Arizona State University, Northeastern University, University of Michigan and Rochester Institute of Technology , together with academics from Cardiff University (U.K) and Mountains of the Moon and Makerere Universities (Uganda) as well as researchers at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the US Army Corps of Engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on concepts of strong and weak ties, the network will build ties among stakeholders for sustainable energy systems with subgroups focused on 1) innovations in energy technologies, 2) sustainability implications of manufacture, use and end-of-life at scale, and 3) energy and human development.  Ties between and within groups will be developed through industrial, government and developing country residencies through which graduate students acquire tacit knowledge necessary to bridge various stages of the innovation system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops knowledge and the human capital necessary for sustainable energy systems as well as mechanisms for interdisciplinary training necessary in a variety of technical domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Federal award 1140190 "RCN-SEES: Sustainable Energy Systems" funded the coordination of research between three US academic institutions and several industry partners such that their academic research is better aligned with societal needs and doctoral graduates are better prepared for diverse career pathways -- including those outside academia.  The award was led by three universities, Arizona State, Northeastern, and Rochester Institute of Technology working in collaboration, and several international academic partners, including Cardiff University (Great Britain), Makarere University (Uganda), and the University of the Free State (South Africa).  Industry partners included General Electric, Air Products, Earthshift Global, and First Solar.  Federal agency participation came principally from the Engineering Research &amp; Development Centrer at the US Army Corp of Engineers.  Moreover, the research coordination network has resulted in the formation of a new 501c3 called the Sustainability Conoscente Network that sustains the activities of the network beyond the life of the federal award.  The research carried out under the auspices of this award has created new methods of environmental life cycle assessment that steer development of novel energy technologies, such as photovoltaics, towards environmentally preferable outcomes.  The doctoral students trained completed one or more internships embedded in their non-academic and/or internatonal partner organizations to become better attuned to the needs and expectations of organizations beyond their home universities and assessment of these experience indicates that the trainees report improvement in their career preparedness and sense of self-efficacy.
