<AbstractNarration>1160005/ Bentley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most successful examples of the new field of synthetic biology have come from imparting new capabilities into microorganisms for the production of unnatural products or products not typically made by those cells. Entire genomes are rearranged - at times to ensure the effects of product overproduction are tolerated by the producing cells (e.g., biofuels can inhibit producing cell growth). Generally, all cells act identically and optimally.  In few examples are the cells themselves the "product" of synthetic biology. In an alternative view, individual cells can carry out high level functions. They can even direct other groups of cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation of this work is to exploit the sensing and computational power of bacteria. More specifically, a new biological switch that will expand the reach of synthetic biology is envisioned - a switch that is activated by cells that recognize "features" on nearby surfaces. Notably, one could build a bacterium that surveys the area-based density of a feature on the surface below. A "go"::"no-go" decision is made and implemented by the "smart" bacterium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One potential application would reengineer bacteria to recognize a cancerous cell from a healthy cell. The cancer cells have more epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on their surfaces than healthy cells. While nanoparticle-based drug delivery brings drugs to any cell displaying the receptor, this new methodology would instead ask the drug carrying bacteria to decide whether the cell is truly cancerous, based on the surface density of the EGFR. The bacteria could then reprogram themselves to synthesize the drug and deliver it. This autonomous smart mode of drug delivery is unprecedented.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Need.  Biological systems are complex.  A few years ago it was believed that sequencing the genome would unlock the secrets to biology.  We now know that specific stimuli trigger the conversion of genotype into phenotype.  Phenotype-controlling stimuli can be physical (e.g., the photoperiod cues plant development), chemical (growth factors determine cell fate) or biological (e.g., pathogens can induce immunity or disease).  Typically, cells recognize such stimuli using receptors (e.g., chemical or photoreceptors), and receptor-mediated recognition is transduced by intracellular chemical pathways (e.g., second messenger systems) or a sequence of electrical impulses (e.g., action potentials).  And a single cell?s response is coordinated over a hierarchy of functional length scales to integrate cellular phenotype into behaviors at the tissue, organ, organismal and ecosystem level.  While understanding such complex biological systems may seem daunting, each incremental advance in our knowledge has resulted in better ways to prevent disease, preserve biodiversity and protect our environment.     The Opportunity.  New experimental platforms have often had transformational effects on the study of biology (e.g., the microscope).  In this project, we proposed that biofabricated devices could have such a transformational affect &ndash; as platforms that allow multicellular bio-systems to be probed and monitored in real time and through multiple modalities.  Additionally, the promise of synthetic biology to enable new processes and products by the rewiring of genomic DNA is limited only by the imagination. The combination of these concepts enables one to fabricate systems, processes, and products from the bottom-up, by the directed alignment of component parts.     In this work, we proposed a "smart switch", a means by which bacterial cells would hover over a surface and interrogate the density of identifying receptor molecules on cancerous cells. We proposed to use bacterial quorum sensing mechanisms but in a manner where they would interpret molecular features of surfaces. While one motivation of our "smart switch" is the treatment of cancer via "smart" bacteria, we are particularly excited about the promise of interrogating and controlling the device/biology interface. Bacteria that are themselves the product of synthetic biology can "dock" onto surfaces, take on a multicellular phenotype and "actuate" behavior, all with autonomously controlled logic functions. The real transformation will occur:  when biological experiments can be performed within the device in a high-throughput manner; when the devices can apply multiple stimuli to a biological specimen in a spatiotemporally controllable manner; and  when a set of biological responses can be monitored and even controlled in real-time by on-chip sensors and actuators with the information being fed-back to inform future stimuli and biological response.
