<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop key components of community-based pervasive systems which will allow citizens to respond to disasters. The systems will make use of inexpensive networked sensors and communication devices distributed among families and communities. The sensors/devices will enable the collection of situational information and the dissemination of alerts, by use of fault and delay-tolerant networks, and through the use of Cloud computing and crowd sourcing techniques. The Indo-US partnership in this effort will study these issues in the context of the Indian subcontinent where urban and rural landscapes are unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sensor-based detection technologies will be studied to help identify events, e.g. abnormal ground motion, and fault-tolerant networks will be designed to connect the sensor systems together and to a resource-rich cloud infrastructure. Methods for performing sensing analysis and data fusion in the cloud will be incorporated so as to address tradeoffs among rates of false positive alarms, false negative alarms, and time to detection.  The existing infrastructure will also be used to design systems for delivering actionable alerts/information to responders and communities using multiple networks. The community-based sensing and alerting techniques developed will be evaluated in campus testbeds at UCI/Caltech, culminating in a pilot study/drill at one of the Indian institutions with regional experience in disaster management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dealing with disasters effectively is a global concern and techniques to leverage communities for data collection and alerting is an effective strategy, especially in nations with diverse populations with varying degrees of technological sophistication. The research will enable a new generation of community-based cyber-physical systems in emerging markets, in which the community helps to detect, communicate and respond to rapidly evolving events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, floods and epidemics. Students at different levels (graduate, undergraduate, K-12) will gain experience with developing real-world applications in a global context via courses and independent study projects. Students will benefit tremendously from exposure to the next generation of community-based cyber-physical systems technologies that will help design safer living environments for the future,</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on incorporating citizens and humans in a participatory sensing process where individuals and/or devices belonging to individuals are used to capture and provide sensor data that can help determine the onset/progress of extreme events (earthquakes, fires, tornadoes etc.).   Our research also developed techniques to exploit knowledge of geographical correlations for reliable sensing and alerting in disasters. The main aim is to create inexpensive networks of sensors, devices and humans with data fusion carried out in cloud computing services for detecting and responding to hazards such as earthquakes and fires primarily for deployment  in developing countries where infrastructure may be limited or unavailable.  Through joint research and diverse network testbeds in Southern California (UCI, Caltech) and in Gujarat/Kerala states in India, this effort designed an overarching architecture and a common set of information technology tools for disaster management. A key part of the proposed research deals with getting ordinary citizens in communities to collaborate and deal with emergencies. To address the above research agenda, our Indo-US partnership consists of experts on distributed computing, event detection and disaster response, delay tolerant network and seismology.   The collaborative Caltech-UCI project has 2 key collaborators in India -  (a) IIT Gandhinagar,   exploring challenges in  cloud computing and resilient networking technologies for earthquake sensing and (b) IIST Trivandrum,  exploring the use of DTN based networks and cloud platforms for sensing and mobile data collection in shantytown fires.   Our goal is to support improved information flow in evolving situations through distributed sensing, processing and dissemination capabilities.  During large-scale disaster scenarios, the data from the deployed  sensors can be used to generate situational awareness is imperative for responders and victims;  achieving timely and reliable data collection under disaster conditions is challenging due to the presence of  network failures and congestion due to power failures, blocking due to high network use volume, etc.  To address this problem, we consider techniques that exploit redundant paths and mobile data collectors to acquire data required for situational awareness in a timely manner. The idea is to  use any and all available networks to transport the sensed data to cloud platforms where they can be analyzed rapidly; this information is quickly triaged to devices and emergency responders who can then take appropriate action (sound sirens, initiate safety procedures, communicate risk information).     Specific topics addressed at UC Irvine in this project include: a) Sensor-based detection technologies for identifying events, focused on abnormal, life threatening hazards including severe ground motion and hazardous fires, b) fault-tolerant networks that connect sensor systems together and to the Cloud for further sensemaking; c) algorithms for detecting anomalous events, and research that characterizes tradeoffs among rates of false positive alarms, false negative alarms, and time to detection; d) systems for delivering actionable alerts and information to first responders and the community using a variety of networks.
