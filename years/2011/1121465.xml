<AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is on Nodulin-like Instrinsic Proteins (NIPs) involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes.  This process represents a major pathway for conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into reduced ammonia, which is a biologically usable form of nitrogen.  The symbiosis is established by the infection of legume roots by rhizobia soil bacteria, resulting in the formation of the nitrogen-fixing organ, the root nodule.  Rhizobia bacteria are enclosed within a specialized plant organellar compartment, the symbiosome.  The symbiosome membrane mediates the exchange of metabolites between the bacterial symbiont and plant host, and is critical for a successful symbiosis.  NIPs belong to an ancient family of channel proteins that mediate the flow of water and metabolites across cellular membranes.  Nodulin 26 (Nod26) is a NIP that constitutes the major protein component of the symbiosome membrane and has two important roles in nitrogen-fixing symbioses.  First, as a rapid transporter of ammonia, Nod26 is proposed to facilitate the release of this fixation end product from the symbiosome.  Further, Nod26 forms interaction complexes with glutamine synthetase which is a critical nitrogen assimilation enzyme.  This interaction is postulated to prevent accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia gas by allowing its rapid incorporation into the nontoxic amino acid glutamine.   In a secondary role, Nod26 facilitates the bulk movement of water across the symbiosome membrane and is proposed to be part of an osmoregulatory network that controls the diffusion of oxygen gas within nodule tissues.  This provides a finely tuned regulation of nitrogen fixation rates in response to metabolic need and environmental stresses.  The aim of this project is to investigate the multifunctional symbiotic role of Nod26 in soybean and a model legume, Medicago truncatula.    The specific objectives are: 1. To define the structural basis for water vs. ammonia transport of Nod26 and its interaction with glutamine synthetase; 2. Investigate mechanisms that regulate Nod26 selectivity for water and ammonia, and its overall transport behavior in response to environmental cues (e.g., soil drought and water logging) that affect nodule gas diffusion and fixation rates; and 3. Address the impact of Nod26 on the establishment and maintenance of the rhizobia-legume symbiosis by using the molecular genetics tools available in Medicago.  This project should contribute fundamental insights into the molecular basis of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume/rhizobia associations as well as its regulation.   In addition, since Nod 26 is the structural archetype of the NIP transporter family, the project will shed light on the molecular basis for differences in transport selectivity and biological functions of NIPs in other plant membrane systems.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance and importance &lt;br/&gt;This project will serve as a training vehicle for multiple graduate students and undergraduate student research scholars, as well as a postdoctoral associate, in fundamental aspects of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.  In addition, this project will provide support and promote the following STEM initiatives at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK):  1. The P.I's involvement as scientific director of the Tennessee Junior Science and Humanities Symposium (TJSHS), which is a state-wide program designed to foster basic science research by high school students.   The TJSHS is held annually and involves a three day symposium during which the very best high school students from throughout the state of Tennessee are convened and are given an opportunity to present their research.  2. Involvement in the Pre-collegiate Scholars Program designed to provide high school science scholars from East Tennessee with multi-semester research experiences at UTK and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.   3. Participation of female graduate students in the P.I.'s laboratory as role models and mentors for a STEM outreach project at UTK ('Gadget Girls Adventures in STEM') which targets middle school girls and is designed to stimulate their participation in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The legume plant-rhizobium bacterial nitrogen fixation symbiosis is an essential component of the global nitrogen cycle, is a major mechanism through which combined nitrogen enters the biosphere, and is a process of agronomic importance.  In this project, the P.I. has investigated the role of a specialized class of integral membrane proteins known as the "nodulin 26" and "nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins" (NIPs) in the nitrogen fixing symbioses of the agronomically important crop soybean as well as the model legume Medicago truncatula (also known as Barrel medic). Nodulin 26 is the major protein component of the symbiosome.   Symbiosomes are specialized cell structures that contain the nitrogen fixing rhizobia bacteroids and mediate the flow of fixed nitrogen and metabolite transport that is integral to symbiosis.  Our work shows that nodulin 26 mediates the transport of both water and fixed ammonia from the bacteria to the plant host. Thus, the protein appears to have two biological functions in nitrogen fixing nodules: 1. Water flux in response to environmental stress; and 2. Fixed ammonia nitrogen flux as part of the nitrogen fixation process.   As an additional facet of this project, we have also investigated the other biological functions and physical properties of nodulin 26-like NIPs beyond nitrogen fixing symbioses.  Outcomes: Intellectual Merit  1.     We showed that the dual functions of nodulin 26 noted above are regulated by calcium and protein phosphorylation in response to environmental cues (flooding, drought and salinity) that affect nitrogen fixation.  The results suggest that phosphorylation may serve as a regulatory switch between water and ammonia transport functions that aid in regulation of nitrogen fixation in response to changing environmental conditions and needs.  2.     New information was obtained on the structure of nodulin 26 and its interaction with enzymes (e.g. glutamine synthetases) that assimilate fixed ammonia into a usable form for the plant.   3.     The project also provided new information on two separate categories of glutamine synthetase enzymes, and provided information on how stress and other physiological cues may selectively regulate nodule specific isoforms of this enzyme.  4.     Besides nodulin 26, the project has identified additional new transporter proteins (members of the MATE transporter family) that are specific to the symbiosis, and which support nitrogen fixation through the uptake of key iron nutrients.  5.     Beyond nodulin 26, we have elucidated the structural basis of different categories of NIPs from other plant species that have evolved to acquire new transport functions beyond the field of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.  These include transport of other key plant nutrients such as boric acid. A role for these in reproductive biology and pollen development was found.  Outcomes: Broader Impact  This project (through all years) has provided support for the training of five graduates students at the University of Tennessee Knoxville (with three receiving their Ph.D. degrees), one postdoctoral associate, twenty UTK undergraduates, and two East Tennessee high school students from the Precollegiate Scholars Program sponsored by UTK.  Undergraduates include Biochemistry &amp; Cellular and Molecular Biology (BCMB) Undergraduate Research Scholars obtaining course credit (12), work study lab assistants (4), Freshman under the UTK Discovery Living and Learning Community (3), and a summer REU student (1).  This REU student was from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at Rochester Institute of Technology (NTID/RIT), and her participation was part of a pilot program and partnership between the UTK BCMB department and National Technical Institute for the Deaf at Rochester Institute of Technology to bring deaf students to UTK in a summer REU program.  This in turn has led to new STEM initiatives in the department to engage Deaf and Hard of Hearing undergraduates.
