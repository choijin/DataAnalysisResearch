<AbstractNarration>PI: Aaron P. Smith (Louisiana State University &amp; Agricultural and Mechanical College)&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Niranjan Baisakh (Louisiana State University Agricultural Center)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rice is a staple crop that feeds more than two billion people worldwide. Agricultural lands used for growing rice frequently contain sub-optimal nutrient levels. Low availability of two important nutrients, phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe), commonly limits crop productivity, whereas excess Fe can cause toxicity in rice grown under flooding conditions. Because of these growth restraints, plants modulate complex responses to fluctuating P and Fe levels via genome-wide transcriptional regulatory networks that involve numerous genes. DNA is found in the nucleus wrapped around histone proteins into structures known as nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin, which is a fluid, higher-order assembly that is modified by many remodeling complexes. Although chromatin structure plays a substantial role in controlling gene expression, the chromatin-level mechanisms involved in regulating nutrient homeostasis in plants are not well understood. Previous work has shown that the interaction between P and Fe influences the onset of deficiency-induced stress responses. The goal of this project is to identify chromatin-level mechanisms that regulate the uptake, assimilation, and utilization of P and Fe in rice. The four specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine the physiological and transcriptional changes in rice seedlings under P and/or Fe deficiency; 2) identify nutrient deficiency-dependent changes in nucleosome positioning across the rice genome; 3) examine the role of the H2A.Z histone variant in regulating gene expression in rice genome-wide; and 4) characterize the histone post-translational modifications present at rice P and Fe homeostasis genes during nutrient deficiency. By correlating three key components of chromatin structure (i.e. nucleosome positioning, histone variant localization, and histone modifications) with gene expression profiles, the regulatory mechanisms that modulate P and Fe deficiency responses will be revealed. Identifying these chromatin-level mechanisms will provide opportunities for developing crops with improved nutrient use-efficiency, significantly improving U.S. and global agriculture. All sequence data generated during this project will be made available to the public through the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the education of graduate and undergraduate students. The investigators have research groups diverse in ethnicity and gender, and will continue to foster involvement of underrepresented groups in research by mentoring students through programs available through LSU, including the Pre-doctoral Scholars Institute and Noyce Tigers Research Internship. Other planned activities include K-12 outreach through the annual Super Science Saturday event, and training of student-teacher pairs from area high schools in hands-on research for two weeks during the summer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Essential nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) frequently limit plant growth due to their low availability in most soils.  Plants adapt to nutrient deficiencies by undergoing sophisticated responses controlled by large gene expression networks.  Although the higher-order structure of DNA (i.e. chromatin) is a major determinant of gene expression, the chromatin-level mechanisms involved in regulating nutrient homeostasis have not been investigated.  This project used genome-wide approaches to investigate several mechanisms that regulate the uptake, assimilation, and utilization of P in rice.  Rice served as an excellent system for the work because the complete genomic sequence is known and rice is a staple crop important to agricultural economies across the globe.  Three major aspects of chromatin structure were revealed to play roles in responses to P deficiency:  nucleosome occupancy, H2A.Z histone variant deposition, and H3K4me3 abundance.  Interestingly, different sub-sets of genes were shown to be more sensitive to changes in the various chromatin landscape components.  Mapping these components generated numerous data sets that will soon be made available to the public, and which will be invaluable to future investigations of how organisms respond to environmental stressors.  The project resulted in the publication of numerous journal articles and conference presentations, and the findings will provide future opportunities for developing crops with improved nutrient use-efficiency, significantly improving U.S. and global agriculture.     This project contributed to the education of many graduate and undergraduate students, including several from underrepresented groups.  The project also saw the formation of a plant nutrition teaching module that was presented at the annual Super Science Saturday public science event, which was attended each year by over 1000 K-12 students.  Other educational outreach activities that resulted from this award included the training of student-teacher pairs from area high schools during the summer, and demonstrations of plant nutrition and development at an elementary school.
