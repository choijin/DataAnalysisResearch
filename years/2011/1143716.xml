<AbstractNarration>This grant will fund the Center for Women in Mathematics at Smith.  The overall goal  of the Center is to increase the number of U.S. citizen women earning doctorates in the mathematical sciences by helping women make the transition from casual mathematics student to committed woman in mathematics. The main activity of the Center is to offer the nation's first post-baccalaureate program in mathematics previously established by NSF award 0602110.  The post-baccalaureate program enables women who have graduated college without the necessary course work in mathematics to continue to graduate school. A secondary activity of the Center is to enrich the lives and careers of women in mathematics in the northeast through its annual WIMIN conference and additional outreach and community-building programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The post-baccalaureate program taps into the largest underutilized source of mathematical talent in the country: American women.  Women earn 43% of bachelors degrees in mathematics, and yet still make up only 29% of mathematics graduate students and 17% of tenured graduate faculty.  This grant funds a program that intervenes at a critical point, the transition to graduate student.  The program  helps women who graduated from college without the coursework and confidence necessary to succeed in graduate school.  The Center maintains a stimulating and supportive  environment of students, faculty and alumnae.  In addition to comprehensive mentoring and a rich curriculum, the Center gives students the opportunity to do research with faculty throughout the year.  The grant will also provide community and support  for  mathematical women at all levels.  Smith College is a regional center for women mathematicians.  Each year, the Center for Women in Mathematics hosts Women In Mathematics In the Northeast (WIMIN), showcasing research and offering women in the area a chance to renew ties, to network, and to seek and offer mentoring and advice.   The Center also runs a growing number of outreach programs and a weekly seminar featuring northeast women mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the Mathematics Department of Smith College in running the Center for Women in Mathematics.  Key elements of the Center are its post-baccalaureate program, its annual undergraduate conference, and its weekly lecture series.   Under the post-baccalaureate program, Smith accepts women with a strong interest in mathematics but with modest backgrounds and lacking confidence.  After one year at Smith, most of these women are able to gain admission to doctoral programs in mathematics.  In the six years of the grant, we enrolled 62 students.  Of those, 40 went on to Ph.D. programs and 8 to Master's programs.  In the previous five years of the program, nearly half of the doctoral students earned Ph.D.s (the success rate nationally is significantly less (about 40% of U.S. citizen women entering Ph.D. programs finish).   We give our students a year of undergraduate mathematics, research experience with faculty, and careful mentoring.  Most importantly, students support each other, both during their time at Smith and afterwards in their scattered graduate programs.  They also benefit from a community of over a hundred women mathematicians who have passed through Smith College.     The research experience consists of working in groups with faculty on open problems.  Each year the post-baccalaureate students present the results of their Fall research at the Joint Mathematics Meetings and the results of their Spring research at various undergraduate conferences.   A key feature of the post-baccalaureate program is a seminar focussing on the naure of mathematics, on experience of being a mathematician, and especially on the trials and challenges of graduate school.  The seminar is designed to help students make an informed decision about a career in mathematics.   The post-baccalaureate program is enhanced by WIMIN, our annual undergraduate mathematics conference.   WIMIN (Women in Mathematics in the Northeast) brings together undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty in a day of talks celebrating the contributions of women to mathematics.  It has become an important event for regional women mathematicians and their students.  It regularly draws around 140 participants.   The program is further enhanced by the weekly lecture series.   The series features young women mathematicians in the area.  Each talk is followed by a meeting of the aforementioned seminar where the post-baccalaureate students can engage with the speaker and learn about her career path, her enthusiasms, plus the high and low points of her graduate school experience.   A last feature of the program is an annual reunion at the Joint Mathematics Meetings.   This helps to unite past and present students and gives them an opportunity to support, seek support, mentor, and be mentored.   As the grant ends, we will be working to continue the program without NSF funding.   The chief difference will be markedly less financial support for students.
