<AbstractNarration>This project is awarded under the Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond competition, with support by multiple Directorates and Divisions at the National Science Foundation as well as by the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative of the Semiconductor Research Corporation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will explore the interactions between candidate QCA molecules bound on a surface and employ the well-developed theory of electron transfer in mixed-valence compounds, focusing it on the particular problems presented by the molecular QCA paradigm.  An interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers from the University of Notre Dame will use a combination of synthesis, theory, measurement, and device architecture engineering to study classes of mixed-valence compounds designed for QCA operation. Candidate molecules will be synthesized and deposited on surfaces, shifts in the charge distribution of one molecule due the interaction with neighboring molecules will be imaged directly, and methods for querying and integrating these molecular systems into electronic devices will be developed. The interdisciplinary nature of this work will impact the education and training of students at all levels. Outreach efforts will include introducing scanning microscopy to the K12 classroom and continuing to develop a MATLAB project to energize high school science and math students by putting real programming power into their hands.  At the graduate level, the fusion of chemistry and electrical engineering cultures will produce a broader perspective for students and overcomes disciplinary linguistic and conceptual barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computing using molecules has the potential to generate ultrasmall devices that use little power; however, many significant technical hurdles must be overcome to realize the benefits of molecular level computing.  This work will further our understanding how molecules can communicate via their charges, which could lead to computer circuits that do not use the flow of electrical current to transmit information.  Such work could impact industries that use microprocessors in their products, including computer, consumer electronics, automotive, etc.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is a well-established tool  for  probing of structure at the molecular scale.  A major  accomplishment of  the funded project was the use of STM for the first  time to reveal the  location of a single electron within a molecule.  In  the mixed-valence  molecules that were studied, one electron can move  between two or more  well-separated metal atoms.  For some molecules,  electrons were observed  either to localize on one atom or another; for  other molecules,  electrons spread between all available atoms.  The  ability to make these  observations, along with the insight into  electron-transfer processes  that these observations give, makes STM an  important tool in the  eventual design of electronic devices that depend  on the correlated  localization of individual charges.    We have developed robust routes for the preparation of molecules that can be used as electronic switches for potential use in computing technologies, i.e. ?zeros? or ?ones? depending on the state of the switch. The routes created provide access to a large number of different molecules that may be systematically altered to enable tuning of their structures to optimize their use. The switching modality is realized by the movement of single electrons between two metal centers within the molecules. A novel set of switches have been developed where a charged bridging unit between the metals can be used to generate a ?null? state, which is a key requirement for the realization of molecular microprocessors.       STM images of the mixed valence zwitterion on a gold surface are shown below.    We developed a theory of field-driven switching of the molecular charge configuration which included the interaction between electronic states, vibrational molecular states, and the thermal environment. The image below shows the electronic polarization P as a function of time when the molecule is switchiing, and the probability density of the vibrational coordinate Q. When switching very quickly, the oscillations of the molecule can be seen damping to the environment. We conclude that indeed switching at picosecond speeds is foreseable in integrated molecular circuits.          A serendipitous discovery is another highlight of this project. In order to better control the position of the molecules for surface imaging we have been exploring adding functional groups to the outside of the molecule that would guide self-assembly. This looks promising and regular lines and other arrays have been imaged. In one case however, the surprising result was the emergence of quasi-crystaline order on the the surface. This is the first time a single molecular species has been shown to support this aperiodic five-fold local ordering.  Upon surface adsorption, ferrocenecarboxylic acid molecules form cyclic pentamers that self-assemble into quasicrystal-like patterns.  In the figure below, the shapes from a Penrose tiling &mdash; pentagon, star, boat, and rhomb &mdash; are overlaid to show the long-range structure of the monolayer. This  involved the synthesis, imaging, and theoretical groups.       Measurement of the electron position within a molecule is a challenging task.  We have developed single-electron transistors, which are the best electron detectors known, for this task.  Our fabrication method uses a combination of electron-beam lithography, chemical-mechanical polishing, and atomic layer deposition to make the smallest possible devices to aid the interfacing of the detectors to the molecules.  One challenge in the fabrication of these devices is the electrical noise that is the result of defects in the device.  We have developed an anneal procedure which nearly eliminates this noise, as shown in the figure below.         Last Modified: 11/26/2016       Submitted by: Craig S Lent]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
