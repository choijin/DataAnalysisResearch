<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to offset the costs for 30 students and postdocs from U.S. educational institutions to attend the 44th CIRP International Conference on Manufacturing Systems (ICMS 2011) to be held June 1-3, 2011, in Madison, Wisconsin. The conference provides an international forum for researchers to discuss innovation and the state of the art in the broad field of manufacturing systems, and to disseminate their recent advances and share their views in this area. More than 150 abstracts have been submitted on topics ranging from machining to sustainable manufacturing to maintenance logistics. The conference will consist of 2 days of technical presentations and keynote speeches, as well as tours of the University of Wisconsin-Madison?s manufacturing laboratories for research and teaching. Publishing and participation in ICMS 2011 is open to all members of the international manufacturing research community.  A committee will select the students and postdocs for conference support (hotel and registration) based upon the following criteria: presenting a paper, their research statement, underrepresented status, and paper authorship. The availability of conference support will be advertised on the conference website and through mailings to the U.S. manufacturing research community.  In this unique intellectual environment, students and postdocs will attend technical presentations by the leading international experts in the broad field of manufacturing systems and network with senior and peer researchers from around the world. These experiences, both within and across disciplines, will foster new ideas in their research and deeper fundamental understanding of manufacturing science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students and postdocs from U.S. institutions attending ICMS 2011 will learn about the latest research progress and challenges in manufacturing systems, and to present papers they co-authored. They will have the opportunity to practice their communication skills and network with researchers and engineers from the U.S. and around the world, fostering future collaborations and shaping their future careers in, manufacturing science and engineering. This conference experience will be invaluable for the highly talented group of students and postdocs who, as future manufacturing professionals and academics, will drive U.S. efforts to ensure its competitiveness in manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
