<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this workshop is to identify new research and educational opportunities in the mathematical and computational geosciences with particular focus on the NSF program on Collaboration in the Mathematical Geosciences. The workshop will bring together the leading senior and promising junior researchers to discuss current research trends in the mathematical and computational geosciences. The workshop program will include presentations from the leaders in the field which will inspire break-out sessions devoted to subfields as well as to cross-cutting, interdisciplinary research. The participants will discuss the scientific, educational, and organizational challenges faced by researchers engaged in the field. The results of the discussions and conclusions will be summarized in a white paper that will be presented to NSF for use when planning future initiatives in mathematical geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants at the workshop, through open discussion, will identify the promising research trends and hot topics in the field of mathematical and computational geosciences. This, in turn, will stimulate the development of new mathematical and computational research supporting the understanding of phenomena in the geosciences and the coupled energy-environment system. It will also support understanding of approaches  to the management of energy resources. The participants will identify important ways in which research and education in the field can contribute to the new NSF-Wide Initiative on Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) and programs such as Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Forward Looking Workshop on the Mathematical Geosciences convened in Crystal City, Washington, D.C. on Sept. 16-17, 2011.  The workshop was devoted to presentations and discussions of research and methodological challenges arising at the frontier of geosciences and mathematical and computational research. Participants discussed models and opportunities for successful collaborations that could be supported by interdisciplinary National Science Foundation (NSF) programs such as the past program on Collaboration in Mathematical Geosciences (CMG).  Participants collaborated on a white paper summarizing the findings and recommendations. The white paper was edited by the Organizing Committee with input provided by the speakers and session leaders and by the participants at large.  The details about the workshop including a list of participants can be found in the White Paper on the Mathematical Geosciences which is also The publicly available on the SIAM Activity Group in the Geosciences website.  Broader Impact    The workshop participants identified forward looking trends and topics in the field of mathematical and computational geosciences. The recommendations identified in the white paper provide input from and to the community of researchers in the mathematical, computational and geosciences on the funding opportunities that may be available and needed in the future. This in turn, will stimulate new mathematical and computational research supporting the understanding and management of various phenomena in the earthÃ†s climate, oceans, land surface and interior.  Impact on Education and Human Resources  There is a continued strong societal need for scientists well trained in interdisciplinary work. Multi-disciplinary programs such as CMG make a strong impact by establishing active collaboration and by training postdoctoral scientists that are uniquely qualified in both mathematics and geosciences.
