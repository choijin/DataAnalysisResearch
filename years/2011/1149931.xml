<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program at NSF, will investigate the formation, structure-magnetic property correlation of the ultrathin (diameter, d &lt; 4 nm), one dimensional magnetic nanowires. It will further explore their potential as effective contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this CAREER proposal, a new "selective heating" method for the synthesis of ultrathin magnetic ferrite nanowires will be explored. The key principle to this new approach is to selectively decompose certain ligands of the precursor complex based on an understanding of the precursor chemistry, creating a ligand soft template for ligand-directed growth. The unique spinel structure of ferrite nanowires makes doping an important parameter to tune their magnetic properties. Therefore, doping effects on the morphology, structure, and magnetic property of the ultrathin nanowires at extremely small scale will be systematically investigated. Finally, the relaxivity of ultrathin iron oxide and doped ferrite nanowires will be evaluated and further correlated with their structures and morphologies, establishing a link among synthesis-structure-property-relaxivity. The relaxivity is a key parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of a contrast agent in MRI. The proposed studies will significantly advance the field by unraveling the essential knowledge and design rules for synthesizing ultrathin nanowires with controlled structural and magnetic properties for various applications. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies will significantly advance our fundamental understanding of a new wet chemistry approach to the synthesis of ultrathin nanowires. The developed synthetic strategies and the underlying mechanisms can be readily extended to the fabrication of other nanomaterials with similar dimensions. Beyond bioimaging, these ultrathin magnetic ferrite nanowires have great potential in gas sensing, photocatalysis, spintronics, and energy. The impact of this CAREER proposal will be further enhanced through several educational and outreach activities, including:  (1) initiating a "Science Party for Kids" program with a local (Rock Quarry) Elementary School to introduce science and engineering concepts to students early; (2) promoting participation of underrepresented groups in nanomaterials through research programs, lectures, scientific demonstrations, and professional societies; (3) generating and disseminating new scientific knowledge resulting from this CAREER proposal through several avenues, such as peer-reviewed publications, seminars, conference presentations, teaching, summer school lectures, and websites.</AbstractNarration>

The method developed through this award has led to the preparation of several non-spherical iron oxide nanoparticles for the first time, such as ultrathin nanowhiskers (<em>Nano Letter, 2011</em>), ultrathin nanoplates and nanoflowers (<em>Chem. Comm. 2012)</em>, magnetic ferrite nanocubes (<em>Nanoscale 2015</em>). <strong>Second</strong>, &nbsp;through this award, ultrathin magnetic nanowires &nbsp;and ultrasmall nanoparticles have been explored as clinically preferred <span style="text-decoration: underline;">positive</span> MRI contrast agents, serving as potential &nbsp;safer alternatives to gadolinium complexes. The currently available positive contrast agents, gadolinium (a heavy metal) complex, pose potential health risks to patients. The development of safer and effective positive MRI contrast agents addresses the risk problems associated with the existing gadolinium-based contrast agents, broadening the application of MRI techniques, and ultimately improve human health. This award has demonstrated the feasibility of using iron oxide nanowhiskers to generate positive contrast <em>in vivo</em> (<em>Advanced Functional Materials, 2015)</em>. The cellular interactions of these nanowires were also carefully studied in comparison with ultrasmall iron oxide nanoparticles (<em>Nanoscale</em>, <strong>2016). In addition, the scalable production of ultrathin nanowires have also been explored (</strong><em>Journal of Nanomaterials</em>, <strong>2015). </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Third</strong>, much of this award efforts has been devoted to create functional surfaces, another critical component for biomedical applications of iron oxide nanoparticles. Using spherical nanoparticles as a model system, a facile method was developed to attach various molecules onto nanoparticle surfaces for hydrophilicity and desirable functionality (<em>Langmuir, 2011</em>), which are key parameters to their interactions with biological systems. This approach offers efficient phase transfer, no nanoparticle aggregation, great solution stability, and versatile functional groups for further conjugation. This piece of work was so well-received by the field that the related publication became one of the most read articles of the Journal through the year, and the work was subsequently chosen as a Nature highlight (<em>N</em><em>ature, 476, 9,-04 August 2011</em>). Furthermore, a conjugation method was successfully established to attach various functional molecules (<em>e.g.,</em> targeting, therapeutic, etc) onto nanoparticle surfaces (<em>Langmuir, 2012 and J. Materials Chemistry B, 2014</em>). Specific targeting is one of the major challenges in nanomedicine to reduce toxicity and enhance drug or diagnostic efficiency. The uniquely designed functional surfaces of nanoparticles allow for effective conjugation of biological molecules without the need for any type of chemical linkers. Eliminating the use of chemical linkers significantly simplifies the conjugation process, increases the efficiency of the conjugation and reduces the requirements of well-trained personnel. The innovative conjugation approach has led to a U.S. utility patent (<em>Patent Application No. 14/136,704</em>) and the related publication was selected as the front cover of the Journal by the editor (<em>Journal of Materials Chemistry B<strong>,</strong> 2014</em>).</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Broader Impact</strong></p> <p>Scientifically, this Career award has greatly advanced our fundamental understanding of a new wet chemistry approach, ?selective heating? to the synthesis of ultrathin Nanowires and other-shaped iron oxide nanoparticles.
