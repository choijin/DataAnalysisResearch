<AbstractNarration>Elmhurst College is implementing a "Keys to Success Through Year One" (KEYSTONE) program that is focusing on increasing the number of STEM graduates in biology, chemistry, computer science, exercise science, mathematics, physics, and cognitive psychology by 36% by reducing attrition of first-year students.  The project is addressing three principal reasons students switch out of STEM majors:  course work is too demanding, non-STEM disciplines appear more interesting, and job prospects are perceived to be better elsewhere.  Five year-long programs for first-year students are being implemented to combat attrition.  A student's engagement with KEYSTONE begins with a personalized invitation to join the project.  During the mandatory new student orientations, STEM students are attending a new session on the special academic experiences designed for them.  During the academic year, STEM students are participating in (i) a STEM-focused First-Year Seminar class, (ii) project and experiment-based courses in the January term, (iii) a STEM-specific, one-semester-hour STEMinar in the spring term to reinforce the developing STEM learning communities, and to introduce students, in a discussion-based format, to relevant professionals and career options, (iv) a one-semester-hour spring term class to prepare students for summer research, and (v) a summer research experience for a subset of the rising sophomores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KEYSTONE interventions are anchored in the research literature and represent current effective practices.  They, in combination with synergistic activities on campus, are contributing to a transformation of the undergraduate research culture of Elmhurst College.  The project is being evaluated for both formative and summative purposes with data being collected to guide the project and to determine the efficacy of the specific interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KEYSTONE project is broadening participation in STEM careers by actively combating attrition, by utilizing known interventions that are particularly effective for students at-risk or from underrepresented groups.  Several of the interventions are being designed and implemented to ensure long-term sustainability.  The project is increasing the number of students graduating with STEM degrees through strategic advising, monitoring, and engagement of first-year students.  The project's success is articulating a model program that could be adopted or adapted by many other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The KEYSTONE Program increased the number of STEM students retained in their first year and graduating from Elmhurst College, contributing to the growing need for STEM graduates nationally.  Elmhurst College is located in the Chicago metropolitan area and is a comprehensive college in the liberal arts tradition that has seen an increase in STEM majors in recent years.  This project aimed to support that increasing STEM population, and increase the likelihood of their success, through a series of interventions.  Those interventions eased both their academic transition and their integration into the STEM learning community at Elmhurst.  Key components of the program included: 1) a STEM-focused fall semester First Year Seminar with goal setting exercises, 2) peer mentors who provided support and organized study groups, 3) a January term CURE (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience), 4) a spring semester "STEMinar" exploring the diversity of STEM careers, and, for a select group of participants, 5) a summer research internship with Elmhurst faculty.  These activities increased the number of students having early research experiences and participating in Elmhurst?s interdisciplinary STEM learning community.  The KEYSTONE Program model is transferable to other colleges looking to increasing STEM success.    The January CURE course and the summer research internships had the highest impact on student retention and success rates, reinforcing the importance of research experiences early in an undergraduate career.  In particular, the January CURE course was able to reach a large number of students with a relatively low input of institutional resources.  Over the first five years, a total of 146 students participated in the January CURE and 86 students took part in the summer research experience.  The five-year graduation rate for students who participated in the January CURE was 78.2 percent and 90.3 percent for students who had the summer research experience.     The KEYSTONE Program did undergo several changes over the period of the grant.  The most substantive change was shifting the primary point of initial connection with the STEM first-years from the STEM First Year Seminars to the STEM introductory courses.  This involved linking peer mentors with introductory STEM courses at Elmhurst, rather than pairing peer mentors solely with First Year Seminar sections.  This was done to expand the impact of the program and ensure that the maximum number of students possible had access to peer mentoring services.  This also increased the success of the peer mentors in establishing content-focused study groups.     KEYSTONE achieved its goal of graduating over 200 STEM majors by the last year of funding.  KEYSTONE also met its retention goal of 65 percent of STEM majors in their third semester.  The KEYSTONE Program model has been presented at a number of national conferences and has been published, making it accessible to be adopted by interested institutions.
