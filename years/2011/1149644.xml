<AbstractNarration>Future ExaScale computing systems are expected to exceed a hundred-thousand nodes and contain a rich mix of heterogeneous computing resources created by coupling multi-core processors with accelerator processors. However, current applications are not yet able to exploit more than a few tens of thousands of these nodes, or effectively manage this heterogeneous mix of resources to balance workloads. Moreover, this heterogeneous mixture of resources in hybrid or multi-paradigm systems presents programmers with new, but challenging opportunities for exploiting the various types of parallelism within algorithms. This CAREER research will formulate an inclusive hierarchical framework for performance modeling and analysis of hybrid computing systems that include multi-core processors and accelerators. The framework includes a coarse-grained model for rapid assessment of the fitness match between the application and the hybrid system and a fine-grained model for predicting execution time and workload balance analysis. These models will be useful for researchers and scientists developing, optimizing, and maintaining scientific codes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project includes forming a taxonomy of application and architecture characteristics through a rigorous study of application optimization and execution on multi-core and accelerator processors. The study focuses on the inter-node parallelism of the applications across a mix of heterogeneous nodes and the intra-node parallelism on the multi-paradigm nodes. These hybrid system studies elucidate the application and architecture characteristics included in the coarse and fine-grained models of the hierarchical framework. The optimization methods (resource ratio optimization, load balancing and memory management) and the model framework are qualitatively assessed for other application domains not included in this study. The project also transitions this knowledge into educational modules suitable for classroom use in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Tesseract is a framework that enables researchers in HPC to analyze how a particular distributed algorithm would perform on a supercomputing cluster.

Another tool called X-MAP was developed to profile the hardware counters and the associated metadata to predict the optimal hardware configuration.  Ongoing research initiated under this award aims to address the coupled goals of predicting the optimal execution time and optimal hardware configuration by developing a unified prediction interface that is algorithm and data-agnostic by leveraging advances in Machine Learning.  The Query Based Engine (Q.B.E) shown in Figure 3 has the following main objectives:   Given profiling data from an algorithm, predict the optimal runtime by combining outputs from different models trained on the profiling data.   Given training metadata such as node configuration, GPU model, number of CPUs, etc. predict the best node configuration for the given data.    These objectives transform into two specific query modes in the engine: (1) produce a continuous value that corresponds to predicted runtime and (2) produce a human-readable description that corresponds to the optimal hardware configuration given the profiling data. Q.B.E. performance prediction results for the SNN Wilson Model are shown in Figure 4.
