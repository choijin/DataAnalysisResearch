<AbstractNarration>Cluster algebras were introduced by S. Fomin and A. Zelevinsky as a framework for studying total positivity and canonical bases in semisimple groups.  They have since appeared in a wide range of mathematical areas, including Teichmüller theory, Poisson geometry, quiver representations, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic combinatorics, and even in partial differential equations (in the equations describing shallow water waves).  This project will bring new Coxeter-theoretic tools to bear on the study of cluster algebras, in order to greatly expand the class of well-understood cluster algebras, and to prove new results even in finite type.  Much of the research will use the combinatorics and geometry of sortable elements and Cambrian fans, developed by the investigator in collaboration with D. Speyer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together two streams of mathematical research that both have deep connections to a broad array of mathematical fields.  Coxeter groups are an algebraic abstraction based on reflective symmetry, and they have played a role in some of the important mathematical developments of the past century.  Cluster algebras are a more recent discovery, but have already shown surprising applications in unexpected areas.  The application of Coxeter-theoretic tools is one of several promising approaches to the structural study of cluster algebras.  The interaction also goes in the other direction, as cluster algebras bring to light new ways of understanding Coxeter groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit   Cluster algebras were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky as a framework for studying total positivity and canonical bases in semisimple groups. They have since appeared in Teichm&uuml;ller theory, Poisson geometry, quiver representations, Lie theory, algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics. The data specifying a cluster algebra include a Cartan matrix, which encodes a reflection representation of a Coxeter group. In finite type, Fomin and ZelevinskyÆs model of almost positive roots combines with the investigatorÆs model (with Speyer) based on sortable elements to give a very detailed picture of cluster combinatorics in terms of Coxeter groups and root systems. Outside of the very special case of finite type, much less was known. This project has brought new Coxeter-theoretic tools to bear, greatly expanding the class of well-understood cluster algebras, and proving new results in finite type. The following are specific results.   Combinatorial models for affine cluster algebras:  We have successfully modeled cluster algebras of affine type using the union of two Cambrian fans.  Morphisms of cluster algebras: We have exhibited subring relationships between cluster algebras of distinct finite types and relationships between their g-vector fans, and anticipate much deeper results in this ongoing effort.  Universal geometric cluster algebras: We have constructed cluster algebras with universal geometric coefficients in surface types and have found what we conjecture to be the correct construction in affine type.   Cluster computations via sortable elements:  We have developed computer code for algebraic and combinatorial calculations in cluster algebras of finite type.   Broader Impacts   The investigator supervised a student who received her Ph.D. in 2013 and is currently supervising four students (one coadvised).  Four of these five students are female.  The investigator has disseminated research results through publications, visits with colleagues, and presentations in national and international conferences.  The investigator presented a series of lectures for an MSRI graduate summer school on Cluster Algebras and Cluster Combinatorics.  The investigator served on the Steering Committee for the Triangle Lectures in Combinatorics conference series, which he co-founded.  The investigator wrote an invited chapter on the weak order for a coming book on lattice theory.              Last Modified: 10/20/2015       Submitted by: Nathan Reading]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
