<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to increase the longevity of seafloor geodetic measurements by developing and demonstrating an inexpensive, permanent seafloor benchmark. The benchmark will provide a physical tie to the sea floor lasting for decades (perhaps longer) on which geodetic sensors can be repeatedly placed and removed with millimeter resolution. Global coordinates estimated with seafloor geodetic techniques will remain attached to the benchmark allowing for the interchange of sensors as they fail or become obsolete, or for the sensors to be removed and used elsewhere, all the while maintaining a coherent series of positions referenced to the benchmark. The benchmark will be designed to be lowered via a wire to the seafloor with sensors attached. The sensors will be capable of being recalled via an acoustic command sent from a ship to release from the benchmark and freely float to the sea surface for recovery. The duration of the sensor attachment to the benchmark will last from a few days to a few years depending on the specific needs of the experiment. The recovered sensors are then available to be reused at other locations, or again at the same site in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If high accuracy, cheap, campaign-style seafloor geodesy can be developed, the studies that could be done with such a system could transform our knowledge of subduction zones and megathrust earthquakes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In January 1700, a great earthquake occurred at the Cascadia Subduction Zone along the coast of Washington, Oregon and Northern CA.  The seafloor was displaced so forcefully that a tsunami travelled to Japan causing the run up of water at coastal towns that was recorded in historical accounts.  The tsunami also inundated the US Coast, but in 1700 the area was undeveloped.  Sediment records offshore suggest these events occur every few hundred years.  It has now been 315 years since the last event and the US Pacific Coast is now highly developed.   The offshore oceanic Juan de Fuca plate subducts, at the rate of a few centimeters per year, beneath the continental North American tectonic plate.    Strain accumulates incrementally within the continental slope to be released over a few tens of seconds during the next great earthquake.   When this occurs the seafloor rapidly returns to its undisturbed location and massive amounts of sea water are displaced causing the tsunami.    A key question to estimate the potential size of a future tsunami is to measure now, over a few years, how fast the seafloor is deforming.      We have developed a technique that combines GPS with precision acoustic ranging to transponders on the sea floor.  This technique allows us to measure seafloor displacements with centimeter resolution.  Thus, over a few years the rate of seafloor deformation can be measured.  A key limitation of the technique has been that the transponders only last about 5 years before their batteries are depleted.  We would like to recover the transponders and replace their batteries and re-use them.  However, the precisely determined positions of the seafloor are attached to the transponders.  If we recover them our time series ends.    To solve this problem, with funding provided by this project, we designed, developed and tested a new, low-cost, permanent seafloor benchmark.  The new benchmark uses a registration system (3 ball pins and 3 grooves) that allows us to remove and replace a transponder, keeping it to within a millimeter of its original location.  This allows us to both reuse transponders, thereby greatly reducing costs, and to extend the time series of position for years, thereby improving the precision of the seafloor displacement measurements and ultimately better estimates on the size of a potential tsunami.  We have deployed these benchmarks at three sites in the Cascadia Subduction Zone.  The seafloor displacement at these sites is being measured during the next few years.   Additional sites along the Cascadia Subduction Zone have been proposed.           Last Modified: 01/08/2016       Submitted by: C. David Chadwell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
