<AbstractNarration>This project explores the design and use of multi-lifespan information systems; that is, information systems that not only meet the needs of today's users but can also maintain their usefulness beyond a single human lifespan. Specifically, the project will (a) test the feasibility of a multi-lifespan information system design approach; (b) generate preliminary design knowledge and methods for multi-lifespan information system design; and (c) contribute meaningful information system designs in our domain of study - international justice. To achieve these goals, the project will leverage the Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal testbed in two types of research activities: multi-lifespan information system envisioning; and digital information tagging and meaning making from a multi-lifespan perspective.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project will explore the feasibility of  the potentially transformative multi-lifespan approach, including: (a) envisioning futures responsive to the information needs, concerns, and values of different generations; (b) through conceptual, technical and policy-oriented mechanisms, anticipating and supporting shifts in societal, political and technological conditions; and (c) conducting preliminary investigations into how to involve the public in interacting with deployed multi-lifespan systems. The project work is likely to catalyze new design methods and technical mechanisms, ones that can account for divergent futures, evolving socio-political situations, and robust information system adaptability.  New techniques for managing privacy, security, and freedom of expression are anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research will promote important societal values including human rights, security, freedom of expression, and peace-building; and inform developments in the field of international justice. The results will also be highly relevant for other digital collections that are intended to outlast the creators' lifespans.</AbstractNarration>

Our goals were two-fold: (a) to generate rigorous design knowledge and methods for conducting multi-lifespan information system design; and (b) to contribute meaningful design products in support of developing justice and peace-building.

Information Design Responsive to Shifting Socio-Political Conditions. As societies shift, opportunities for information systems change accordingly. In this project, the complex and rapidly shifting Rwandan context with respect to freedom of expression provided a fruitful environment for exploring information system design. For example, we developed the online public curation tools (described above) in response to the 2008 Rwandan Genocide Ideology Law, which placed strong constraints on certain types of speech related to genocide. We developed principles, policies and practices to syste...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
