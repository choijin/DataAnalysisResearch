<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. This nano-related proposal requests support for development and application of a unified&lt;br/&gt;theoretical approach to the thermodynamics and dynamics for fluids confined in porous&lt;br/&gt;materials. This unified modeling framework is expected to have major impact upon the materials&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering of new porous materials and their use is many applications, ranging&lt;br/&gt;from catalysis, adsorption and membrane separations, to low-k dielectrics in microelectronics, to&lt;br/&gt;sensors and diagnostics in biotechnology. The theory being  developed, dynamic mean field&lt;br/&gt;theory (DMFT), is fully consistent with the thermodynamics of confined fluids as described by&lt;br/&gt;classical density functional theory (DFT). With DMFT one can take a model porous material in&lt;br/&gt;contact with a bulk fluid and investigate the response of system to step changes in the bulk&lt;br/&gt;state (chemical potential or pressure). The system evolves to a final state in which the density&lt;br/&gt;distribution is also a solution of DFT for the system. The theory can describe&lt;br/&gt;adsorption/desorption dynamics for complex pore network structures, including the nucleation&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms for pore condensation and evaporation, as well as the dynamics of cavitation or&lt;br/&gt;pore blocking. The theory can also be applied to mixtures, to study phenomena such as the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of capillary condensation of mixtures or the dynamics of the displacement of one&lt;br/&gt;species in a porous material by another. The research project has the potential to be a&lt;br/&gt;transformative contribution to the modeling of fluids confined in porous materials.&lt;br/&gt;There are three components to the project: i) DMFT for fluids in pore networks. We will study&lt;br/&gt;the mechanism for pore condensation/evaporation as well as cavitation for fluids in pore&lt;br/&gt;networks We will also study partial wetting and partial drying systems with applications to&lt;br/&gt;condensation of water in carbon materials and to mercury porosimetry; ii) DMFT for fluid&lt;br/&gt;mixtures. We will study pore condensation of binary mixtures, including the effect of pore&lt;br/&gt;network structures and nonideality in the mixtures. We will also consider dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;displacement processes such as in enhanced coalbed recovery of methane; iii) Further&lt;br/&gt;theoretical development and assessment of DMFT. The investigators will test the accuracy of DMFT through&lt;br/&gt;comparison with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics and Kawasaki dynamics simulations. The investigators&lt;br/&gt;will also investigate the origin of symmetry breaking in the dynamics of nucleation processes.&lt;br/&gt;They will study the explicit inclusion of fluctuations in DMFT and will also consider the utility of&lt;br/&gt;higher order approximations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. While the research proposed here is fundamental in nature the potential&lt;br/&gt;impact upon applications of porous materials is significant and affects many technologies. There is an enormous worldwide&lt;br/&gt;effort on the materials science and engineering of new porous materials and DMFT provides a&lt;br/&gt;new approach to understanding the dynamical behavior of fluids confined in such systems that&lt;br/&gt;is consistent with the thermodynamic treatment from DFT. The research is transformative&lt;br/&gt;because it provides an approach to modeling confined fluids properties that treats&lt;br/&gt;thermodynamics and relaxation dynamics in a unified context. The research will help bridge two&lt;br/&gt;research communities in the area of confined fluid properties, one focused on adsorption&lt;br/&gt;isotherm measurements and thermodynamics and the other focused on transport phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;..&lt;br/&gt;The project includes significant education and outreach programs including creating&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research opportunities, including REU for students from community and four year&lt;br/&gt;state colleges and enhancing the involvement of young researchers in international&lt;br/&gt;conferences the PI is organizing. The project also includes collaboration with industry&lt;br/&gt;(Quantachrome) and international collaboration (University of Leipzig).</AbstractNarration>
