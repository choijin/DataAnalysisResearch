<AbstractNarration>In this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes in the Chemistry Division, Dr. E. Neil Marsh, from the University of Michigan, will elucidate the mechanism of a newly-discovered hydrocarbon-forming enzyme from cyanobacteria, aldehyde decarbonylase (cAD). Biosynthetic pathways that generate hydrocarbons have become the subject of intense interest recently as their potential to generate new biofuels has been recognized.  Aldehyde decarbonylase is a member of a well-studied class of enzymes, the non-heme di-iron dioxygenases.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary studies have shown that cAD catalyzes a most unusual reaction involving the conversion of long-chain fatty aldehydes to the corresponding alkanes and formate.  To investigate the mechanism, alternative substrates that may act as mechanism-based inhibitors will be synthesized to gain evidence for proposed radical intermediates in the reaction.  The role of the reducing system in the reaction will be investigated and the components of the native reducing system in the host cyanobacterium P. marinus, will be identified. Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to investigate the role of active site residues in determining substrate specificity and controlling the mechanism of the reaction.  Lastly, kinetic isotope effects will be measured to provide insight into the rate determining step in cAD and the nature of the transition state leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a pressing need to develop new pathways to produce biofuels based on hydrocarbons as sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels.  The cyanobacterial enzyme aldehyde decarbonylase produces hydrocarbons and has attracted particular interest for biofuels applications; yet its extremely low activity presents a major stumbling block to its use.  Understanding how the enzyme works is the first step to designing better enzymes, or synthetic catalysts, that accomplish the synthesis of hydrocarbons more efficiently.  This, in turn, may allow the development of new routes to biofuels that can substitute for current fossil fuels including gasoline, diesel and jet fuels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biological pathways that produce hydrocarbons have become the subject of intense interest recently as their potential to generate new biofuels has been recognized.  In this project we examined one such pathway from photosynthetic cyanobacteria.  This pathway takes fatty acids, which are important components of all cells, and converts them into alkanes which are an important component of fuels such as gasoline and diesel.  The last step in the pathway involves a very unusual chemical reaction involving the conversion of long-chain fatty aldehydes to the corresponding alkanes and formate.  We have studied the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction in cyanobacteria, known as cyanobacterial aldehyde decarbonylase (cAD) or cyanobacterial aldehyde deformylating oxygenase.     We have shown that the enzyme will take aldehydes of  varying carbon chain- lengths, from 4 - 18 carbons in total, and convert them into the corresponding alkanes.  In particular, this includes the production of alkanes such as propane, and octane which are important fuel molecules.  However, the enzyme reaction was found to proceed extremely slowly, so that it is unlikely to be useful for commercial biofuel production.  To better understand how the enzyme works we investigated its reaction with substrate analogs designed to react with the enzyme as mechanism-based inhibitors.  These compounds either inactivated the enzyme or reacted in a manner that indicated that the enzyme generates free radicals as intermediates. We also used x-ray crystallography to determine the atomic structure of the enzyme with substrates bound.  Putting this information together with studies that used substrates labelled with heavy isotopes of carbon and hydrogen, we were able to trace the pathway of reaction and propose a detailed mechanism for the conversion of aldehydes to alkanes and formate catalyzed by the enzyme.  Understanding how the enzyme works is the first step to designing better enzymes, or synthetic catalysts, that accomplish the synthesis of hydrocarbons more efficiently.  This, in turn, may allow the development of new routes to biofuels that can substitute for current fossil fuels including gasoline, diesel and jet fuels.
