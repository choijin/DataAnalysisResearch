<AbstractNarration>The project will examine the extent to which training science faculty members at an HBCU community college (CC) in two teaching techniques (Reading Apprenticeship and critical thinking skill development) and subsequently supporting trained faculty through introductory science course redesign and implementation will result in improved student learning outcomes, particularly for minority students at the community college. The reading apprenticeship pedagogy focusing on strengthening disciplinary science reading skills would address the academic developmental needs of entering community college students in west central Alabama, known as the Black Belt for the acute poverty, inadequate public education, poor health, and high unemployment that exists in the region. The critical thinking skill development pedagogy would change the focus from simply covering science content at the community college to fill gaps in student preparation to developing their critical thinking and reasoning to improve students' problem solving ability.  The project will contribute knowledge on what are effective approaches in teaching science in an HBCU community college specifically, and could generalize to other community colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF project tested an approach to faculty professional development and its impact on student achievement in introductory science classes at an HBCU community college.  Faculty worked in small teams to learn to teach contect based reading skills and critical thinking skills in their courses.  They then redesigned their courses in an attempt to increase student learning and student engagement, incorporating new activities into the courses.  Student critical thinking skills and attitudes towards science were measured before and after courses were redesigned using pre- and post-course measures.  Faculty were observed by the principle investigators, interviewed, videotaped during classes, and kept journals.  Results showed that institutional leadership change can have an effect on faculty focus and comfort with implementing course level changes.  The more institutional level changes were occurring, the less comfortable the faculty members in the project seemed to be with making and maintaining course level changes.  Individual faculty were als variable in their comfort and willingness to make major course changes and to test those changes over an extended period of time.  Overall, with the redesigns made to courses, a higher percentage of students remained in the course for the term and earned a passing grade.  However, this result did not hold for all courses tested.  Contrary to the project hypothesis, no bigger impact on student persistence and attidude was observed for black students than for white.
