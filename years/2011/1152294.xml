<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Catalysis Program, Professor Lawrence R. Sita from University of Maryland at College Park will work on discovering and developing new paradigms, catalysts and polymerization processes that can be used to significantly expand the range of polyolefins and their end-use applications in support of new technologies.  The primary hypothesis that will be pursued is that different categories of fast and reversible dynamic processes that are competitive with chain-growth propagation can be introduced to establish two-state living coordination olefin polymerization in which the relative rates of the dynamic process and propagation can be brought under external control to direct polyolefin production over a spectrum that is delineated by two extreme boundary structures. Several new paradigms will be conceived and developed in order to remove existing restrictions that are presently imposed by classical approaches that are based on a one-to-one correlation between catalyst structure and polyolefin product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the scientific impact this work will provide support for a continued scientific and economic competitive position of the U.S. in the global polyolefin and chemical industries and support training of future generation of scientists and engineers for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related careers. Importantly, the discovery and development of new technological inventions and innovations of commercial value will support the national economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merits of the project are that several new paradigms have been identified and experimentally established that serve to greatly expand the range of structures and properties of polyolefins - one of the most commercially- and technologically-important classes of synthetic materials - that can be derived from a very small set of olefin feedstocks.  These paradigms are based on different embodiments of two-state living coordination polymerization of olefins. Of these, two-state living coordinative chain-transfer polymerization (LCCTP) now serves to remove previous limitations on scaling the quantity of polyolefin that can be obtained from a living polymerization.  In another case, two-state group transfer living coordination polymerization has been used for the programmed stereoengineering of a polyolefin in which the stereochemical microstrusture of the material can be systematically varied in fashion to generate new families of polyolefin products from the same olefin and polymerization process. In a third area, the project served to introduce and establish the concept of remote steric interactions that uniquely occur in a dinuclear catalyst as a means by which to control steroregularity and copolymer composition of the final polyolefin products in a manner that is distinctly different than that which can be obtained using the corresponding mononuclear catalyst.  Finally, the project was successful in developing and establishing end-group functionalized polyolefins (x-PAOs) as a new category of non-polar building blocks for the development of nanostrucutred amphiphilic materials in which the free volume occupied by the non-polar domain can be varied in controlled fashion.  The broader impacts of the project is that several of the new paradigms that have been developed will serve to influnence thinking and research in several other disciplines, including chemical engineering, materials science and catalysis.  The project further served to establish industrially-relevant processes by which large quantities of molecularly-well-defined polyolefins that are derived from a living polymerization can now be produced with the intent of developing new technologies that are based on these materials and which have the potential to have near-term beneficial impact on society and the economy.   The project has also provided an important platform for the training of future generations of scientists and engineers, including many from underrepresented groups.
