<AbstractNarration>This award funds research in new methods and algorithms for computing strategic equilibria.  Many economic situations involve repeated interactions between agents.  These repeated strategic interactions also appear in other realms of social science including politics and international relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most basic formalization of such interactions is a repeated game. This provides a mathematical framework in which ongoing interactions can be quantified and the impact of such factors as the myopic temptations to cheat, the number of participants, the information available to participants when they plan their moves and responses, the compellingness of present versus future concerns, and so on, can be simultaneously assessed in a coherent way.  An indispensable tool in this endeavor is the notion of equilibrium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, except in the most trivial formulations, the actual computation of possible equilibria is a difficult task.  Even in relatively simple stylized settings it is difficult for the social scientist to investigate the impact of changes in underlying conditions (what happens if the price of certain inputs changes, what if regulations are put in place which limit the information firms have about their rivals, what if trade tariffs are altered, and so on). This project aims squarely at this computational problem.&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his team seek to develop methods that yield answers rapidly using standard laptop computers.  Preliminary results include a number of promising new methods.  The overall goal is to extend these results to other important classes of repeated interactions and thereby provide students, researchers and practitioners, important new tools to facilitate their analysis of ongoing interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My co-author Yuliy Sannikov and I have invented a new theoretical algorithm for computing the subgame perfect equilibrium payoff set of two player infinitely repeated games with perfect monitoring.  This class of games is of fundamental importance both for theory and for application. Relevant fields of application beyond economics include, polititcal science, international relations and theoretical biology.  It is very important for applied researchers to have a convenient method of computing equilibrium value sets and seeing how these change as underlying parameters vary. Such exercizes are also extremely useful to students attempting to understand the nature of repeated strategic interactions. User friendly tools have not previously been available. Our work provides such tools.  With the assistance of students we have also developed an implementation of our theoretical algorithm.  This algorithm has been made publicly available and can be found at:  www.princeton.edu/econtheorycenter/research-links/dynamic-games-algorithm  The algorithm is extremely quick and improves dramatically on previously known methods. In an economic example of Cournot dupoloy introduced and computed in Judd, Yeltekin and Conklin (2002) our algorithm is 1000 times quicker.  To the extent that the algorithmic tools we provide help economists understand their dynamic strategic models better, they develop a deeper understanding of the economy, and this can impact economic policy and through it, society at large.
