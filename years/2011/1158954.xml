<AbstractNarration>The researchers from University of California-Berkeley will establish collaborations with the group of Professor Christiane Koch in Kassel, Germany for development of theoretical tools for control of quantum systems in realistic environments.  The long term goals are to identify the opportunities for quantum control and its limitations under general conditions when a quantum system is not isolated but interacts with its surroundings.  This extension of the field of quantum control to the general non-unitary dynamics experienced by quantum systems in contact with an environment is essential for achieving the high fidelity quantum operations that are required by the many new and developing quantum technologies arising from fields including quantum information, ultracold gases and nanoscale devices.  The collaborations will combine the expertise in algebraic and analytic methods of quantum control at Berkeley with the numerical optimal control methods used in Kassel, to formulate new, physically motivated and numerically tractable methodologies for determining the extent of controllability of open quantum systems.  The research group will work to develop a set of numerical tools for optimization of quantum control on realistic open quantum systems of interest to the quantum physics, chemical physics and quantum device communities. Establishing these  collaborations will enabling students and postdocs to learn and implement state of the art high level numerical optimal control theoretic methods in a broad range of quantum dynamical studies.  &lt;br/&gt;Exchange visits of Berkeley students and postdocs to Kassel will have the broader impact of exposing US graduate students and postdoc to the European research and education system, as well as giving them the opportunity to collaborate with scientists in a European research group.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative project with the group of Christiane Koch in Kassel enabled the development of new methodologies and tools for high quality control of complex quantum systems in the presence of coupling to environments.   The primary motivation and applications of these coherent control methodologies was to enahle coherent quantum manipulations of arrays of quantum bits in realistic settings for quantum information processing as well as for fundamental studies of ultrafast quantum dynamics of electrons in atoms and molecules.   In the area of quantum information processing, our research combined analytic theoretical formulation of maximally entangling dynamical protocols for for coupled quantum bits with numerical optimal control calculations to arrive at practical schemes for achieving high fidelity logic gates for quantum computation architectures based on diverse physical realizations of quantum bits.  These include neutral atoms trapped in an optical lattice constructed from counter-propagating laser fields, and superconducting quantum circuits with macroscopic quantum bits formed from Josephson junctions. For the superconducting circuits we made the first comprehensive charting of the entangling power and fidelity of quantum gates as a function of the physical parameters, providing a critical enabling tool for design of quantum information processors.   In the area of ultrafast quantum dynamics of electrons in atoms and molecules, we developed optimal coherent Raman excitation protocols using X-ray light sources that generate localized (single-atom) valence excitations.  Since Raman excitation of atoms with X-rays proceeds via unbound intermediate states, the challenge here was to suppress the ionization and losses from such intermediate states which degrade the coherence of the final state.  We showed that optimal control theory allows design of pulse forms to ensure maximal coherence and flexibility in the target state.  The broader impact of this work is seen in both the implications for quantum information processing and advanced probes of ultrafast dynamics, and in the educational and human resource benefits that resulted from the research.  The coherent control toolbox developed in this collaborative project is benefitting efforts to build both quantum computers and quantum simulators, enabling the required high-fidelity quantum operations to be implemented in realistic, non-isolated arrays of quantum bits.  The coherent control of X-ray stimulated electronic dynamics in atoms and molecules is an enabler and preqrequisite for development of multi-dimensional spectroscopies in the X-ray regime, and hence for the direct study of ultra-fast (attosecond time scale) excited state electronic dynamics that such multi-dimensional spectroscopies can in principle reveal, provided they are realized coherently.   From the educational and human resources perspective, this catalyzing collaborations project between the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Kassel enabled Berkeley students and postdocs to learn and implement high level numerical optimal control theoretic methods in their research into dynamics of trapped old atoms, of x-ray processes on atoms and of electronic energy transfer in light harvesting systems. The project facilitated extended meetings of PIs, graduate students and postdocs from the Berkeley and Kassel groups to set up and nurture lasting collaborations between the two groups.  It provided opportunities for Berkeley students and postdocs to interact with scientists outside Berkeley in a professional collaborative setting, with Berkeley students and postdocs traveling to Kassel, giving presentations there, working with our collaborators, and experiencing the scientific system in a different country. The project with the University of Kassel led to development of greater independence, collaborative skills and professional maturity for the Berkeley graduate students and postdocs, provi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
