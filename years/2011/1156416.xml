<AbstractNarration>This proposal is designed to continue the Ralph Bunche Summer Institute (RBSI), a program of the American Political Science Association (APSA) and hosted by the Department of Political Science at Duke University, as a REU Site in Political Science. The RBSI is designed to expand opportunities for students-of-color by preparing black, Latino, and American Indian undergraduates to enroll in doctoral programs and become political science college and university professors, and/or researchers in the field and related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RBSI immerses undergraduates in the summer of their junior year in a five-week intensive program that includes graduate level course work, and the design, analysis, writing, and presentation of original research papers. The program simulates the graduate school experience and focuses on scientific analysis by introducing the students to research methods and statistics, and the research enterprise that is the lifeline of professional political scientists. Those students whose empirical papers are judged to be of high quality are invited to present their papers in a poster session at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The APSA initiated the Ralph Bunche Summer Institute in 1986, with the goal of increasing the number of black Americans pursing advanced degrees in political science. In 2000, RBSI was expanded to include other students-of-color. The numbers of students-of-color in doctoral programs in political science has waxed and waned over the years, but appears to be on an upward trajectory. The RBSI has played a major role in this increase. Nevertheless, the need for blacks, Latinos/as and American Indians with doctorates in political science remains. The ultimate goal of the RBSI is to increase the number of black, Latino, and American Indian political science faculty in U.S. colleges and universities. Results suggest that the RBSI is succeeding in increasing the numbers of students-of-color in political science graduate programs, and the numbers of blacks and Latinos with doctorates in political science, but the need is so great that more needs to be done. This project will address those needs.</AbstractNarration>

The students participate in the five-week, for-credit Institute that includes two graduate level courses, lectures from distinguished political scientists, prep class for the  Graduate Record Examination, informal sessions on applying to graduate school, and visits from leading graduate institution recruiters. A major part of the Institute is the studentsÆ preparation of original, analytical and empirical research papers, and, for the top students, the opportunity to present their papers in a poster session at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association.  This immersion in aspects of political science as an analytical field of inquiry encourages top black, Latino and American Indian students to consider graduate education in political science rather than the typical law school career track.  The RBSI is a unique experience not only for the students, but also for the faculty and teaching assistants who organize and run the program.  It is an experience that is not easily put into the words. For the faculty and teaching assistants, the Institute provides an opportunity to teach a group of very smart and highly motivated students in an intimate and comfortable setting.  It also gives Duke University political science graduate students, who serve as teaching assistants, classroom experience.  For the students, the Institute affords an opportunity to not only learn more about political science and graduate school, but to interact with other bright minority students.  Intellectual debates are fierce and unending. By the end of the session, lasting friendships have been forged and a new support network created.  It is an exhilarating experience.

The RBSI is designed to expand opportunities for students of color by preparing black, Latino, and American Indian undergraduates to enroll in doctoral programs and become political science college and university professors.
