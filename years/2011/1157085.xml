<AbstractNarration>This award is to support the renewal of the REU site run by JILA (formerly Joint Institute of Laboratory Astrophysics) and the Department of Physics at the University of Colorado. The primary objective is to provide opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in high quality ongoing research programs. This year selected students will spend 10 weeks during the summer at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The intellectual focus of the REU program is physics and undergraduate students are paired up with preeminent faculty to do research in the fields of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, Biophysics, Condensed Matter Physics, Elementary Particle and Nuclear Physics, Plasma Physics, Physics Education Research, and Geophysics. Although the main emphasis of the summer is centered around each student's individual research lab, where the students are expected to master at least a part of a large task, a variety of other activities take place during the program. These include ethics, electronics, and machining classes, a "Getting Into Grad School" discussion, as well as lab tours and a weekly science seminar series aimed at the students. The program culminates with a day of presentations given by each of the REU students.</AbstractNarration>
