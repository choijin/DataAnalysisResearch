<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The projects in this proposal would generalize the highly&lt;br/&gt;influential tables of Cremona to the next (ordered by discriminant) totally real&lt;br/&gt;number field and to higher dimensional modular abelian varieties. This would&lt;br/&gt;improve on algorithms available for computing with elliptic curves and abelian&lt;br/&gt;varieties, and provide useful data and tools for number theory researchers. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research would also advance techniques for constructing points and coho-&lt;br/&gt;mology classes on elliptic curves, and for understanding the arithmetic of elliptic&lt;br/&gt;curves over number fields. This project would have as a concrete deliverable new&lt;br/&gt;publicly available tables and software that will be of use to many number theorists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The PI is co-authoring a popular expository book with Barry&lt;br/&gt;Mazur on the Riemann Hypothesis, co-authoring a graduate level book with Ken-&lt;br/&gt;neth Ribet on modular forms and Hecke operators, and intends to release a new&lt;br/&gt;edition of his modular forms book. The PI has tables of data that are freely avail-&lt;br/&gt;able online, and whose creation has been supported by NSF FRG grant DMS-&lt;br/&gt;0757627, and the proposed research would expand these tables further. He will&lt;br/&gt;also continue to organize the development of the free open source NSF-funded&lt;br/&gt;Sage mathematical software project that he started. The PI organizes dozens of&lt;br/&gt;"Sage Days" workshops that involve many undergraduate and graduate students,&lt;br/&gt;and touch on number theory, algebraic topology, combinatorics, special functions,&lt;br/&gt;numerical computation, and other areas. The PI is also a co-PI on the UTMOST&lt;br/&gt;NSF grant (DUE-1020378), whose goal is to make Sage more accessible to high&lt;br/&gt;school and college teachers and students.</AbstractNarration>
