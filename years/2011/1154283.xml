<AbstractNarration>Over the past two decades, a new spectroscopic technique called laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been developed and has gained favor for in situ field measurements in hostile environments. The goal of this proposal is to build a LIBS system suitable for deployment on Alvin with pressure cases and interfaces that are Alvin compatible. Once constructed, the PIs will re-validate the laboratory measurements in a test tank. At the end of this phase, they should have a working LIBS system that is compatible with Alvin, and that has been validated in a real water environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work itself addressing the advancement of the technology and the measurement environment are state-of-the-art research and development. The system configuration and results in this harsh environment will benefit other applications for real-time monitoring, including industrial processes and space exploration. Additionally, the research will lead to several student PhD dissertations, and collaborations among international research teams.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded the design, construction and laboratory validation of a laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) spectrometer capable of operation from a remotely operated vehicle to ocean depths of about 3000 m. LIBS utilizes a laser focused to a beam of order 10 &mu;m in diameter to create a plasma or "laser spark" once the power density exceeds the breakdown threshold of the material. A gated spectrometer  covering part or all of the ultraviolet through near infrared range (200-1000 nm wavelength) is used to capture the plasma spectrum. This relatively simple apparatus yields simultaneous sensitivity to many elements in the parts-per-million (ppm) range in solids, liquids, gases and aerosols. An in situ chemical sensor with the characteristics of LIBS has myriad applications in chemical, geological, and biological oceanography in regimes ranging from the laboratory to estuaries to the coastal zone to the deep ocean.The specific target of this work was hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean ridges where seawater circulates through the fractured and permeable oceanic crust. Exit temperatures at discrete, focused high temperature vents range from 200-405&deg;C at ambient pressures of 150-500 atmospheres.  The project presented a number of scientific and engineering challenges that were in the end overcome.
