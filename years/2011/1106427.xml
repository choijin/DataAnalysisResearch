<AbstractNarration>Knowledge of the cold plasma mass density is critically important for a number of magnetospheric studies in the inner magnetosphere. For instance models of the mass density are important for radiation belt research, magnetohydrodynamic models of the solar wind and magnetosphere interaction and Ultra Low Frequency wave research. This is a very difficult quantity to observe directly so an indirect approach will be used. This approach makes use of Alfv√©n wave resonances.  The research will expand on previous determinations of the mass density by extending the results closer to the Earth (L~2) and providing a 3D model. The resulting density model will be parameterized by location, solar wind and geomagnetic conditions. This improvement in our knowledge of the mass density will result because of new data from the THEMIS mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strength of this proposal is that it will address a great need for mass density models that extends beyond the present study. If the only accomplishment of this study is expanded radial coverage of the density models it will be a success and that is highly probable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mass density of the plasma in the magnetosphere is highly variable in the region outside the radial distance of approximately three Earth radii.  A major controlling factor of the density is the solar wind flow speed and the southward component of the interplanetary magnetic field, which jointly control the magnetospheric electric field and the associated large-scale convection as well as various instabilities occurring within the magnetosphere. The instabilities play an important role in the transport of ions within the magnetosphere and between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere.  Another factor is the solar radiation, which controls the production rate of ions at the ionosphere. The mass density is an important physical quantity that needs to be determined in magnetospheric research, because it controls the propagation speed of various plasma waves in the magnetosphere that are related the temporal and spatial variations of the flux of energetic electrons in the radiation belt and energetic ions in the ring current.    Despite the importance of the mass density described above, this quantity is very difficult to directly measure using particle instruments. One reason is that the mass density is usually carried by ions of low energy, which are affected by photoelectrons that surround spacecraft. This makes an alternative technique known as magnetoseismology a valuable alternative in estimating the mass density. The principle of the technique is very similar to that of seismic techniques used in other fields, such as diagnostics of the solid earth. In the magnetosphere, we use magnetophydrodynamic (MHD) waves as the diagnostic tool. MHD waves come in basically two different propagation modes, one that propagates along the background magnetic file like oscillations propagating along a string and the other that propagates isotropically like sound waves.  The former is called the Alfv&eacute;n mode and the latter the fast mode.  In our project, we used Alfv&eacute;n waves.  In the magnetosphere, Alfv&eacute;n waves are usually observed as standing waves excited at various harmonics.  Magnetospheric disturbances with time scales of 10 to 1000 s, usually generated by pressure variations of the solar wind, propagate to the ionosphere and are reflected. The reflection occurs at both the northern and the southern ends of magnetic field lines, so the disturbances quickly become standing waves.  The frequency of the standing waves depends on the mass density.  When the density is higher, the frequency is lower because the mass provides higher inertia.  This simple relation between the wave frequency and the mass density makes it possible to estimate the mass density by accurately measuring the wave frequency.   Standing Alfv&eacute;n waves are permanently present in the magnetosphere but their detection depends on the location of observation as well as on the sensitivity of wave measurements.  In our project, we made use of electric field and magnetic field data available from various spacecraft to estimate the mass density over a wide range of radial distances and local times.  The mass density, when combined with the electron number density determined using other means, also gives us information on the ion composition, the concentration of oxygen ions in particular.  We applied the Alfv&eacute;n wave magnetoseismic technique to data acquired by the Van Allen Probes, THEMIS, Geotail, and GOES spacecraft and determined the spatial variation of the mass density and ion composition and their dependence on the geomagnetic activity, solar wind condition, and the solar activity.  The major findings include:  (1) Regular presence of multiharmonic standing Alfv&eacute;n waves in the dayside plasmasphere, which enables us to use the magnetoseismic technique in the plasmasphere.   (2) Dominance of hydrogen ions over oxygen ions in the plasmasphere.  (3) Significant contribution of oxygen ions to the mass density near geosynchronous orbit during geomagnetically active periods and at times of high solar EUV flux.  (4) Importance of the radial gradient of the mass density in controlling the strength of coupling between fast mode waves and Alfv&eacute;n waves, a process known and field line resonance.  The results are not only scientifically interesting but also are valuable in building tools for space weather modeling.
