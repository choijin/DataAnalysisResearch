<AbstractNarration>Realizing the power of CyberLearning to transform education will require vision, strategy, and an engaged, talented community. Activities are needed to energize the community, refine and sharpen the path forward, and provide a more active and ongoing forum for clarifying the big ideas and challenging questions. In response to this need, SRI International, together with the Lawrence Hall of Science and with key support from the National Geographic Society, will organize a set of activities to advance a shared vision of the future of learning, encompassing the systems, people, and technology dimensions mutually necessary for any scalable and lasting advances in education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovative format for these activities is inspired by the TED talks, Wikipedia, and social networking. As in TED, a small set of leading researchers will be selected to give very short, very high quality, stimulating talks. These CyberLearning Talks will be featured at a 1-day summit meeting in Washington, DC, streamed so that local cyberlearning research communities may participate at a distance, and posted on a website. As in Wikipedia, CyberLearning Pages will be created, each page featuring a synopsis of a big idea in CyberLearning and the relevant research challenges. The 1-day conference will be followed by a small 1-day workshop focusing on how to evaluate cyberlearning efforts, identify progress, and identify important new directions. Finally, to disseminate and stimulate conversation about both the video talks and Wikipedia entries, a presence for the community will be created on social networking sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target outcomes of the effort will be (i) a cyberlearning research community with participants from across the many current constituent communities, and fostered awareness and appreciation of the broad range of expertise and interests across that wider community; (ii) foundations for sustained discussion of big ideas, insights, and challenges to help this new community define a more engaged, crisper vision of its own future, (iii) a community resource that can become a site for interconnecting stakeholders in the CyberLearning community and supporting investigators in improving field-generated proposals, and (iv) an emerging sense of direction for CyberLearning among a wider audience of leaders. Such community building and awareness is expected to foster collaborations that will lead to innovative and research-grounded ways of using technology to transform education -- formal and informal and across a lifetime.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Cyberlearning Research Summit was a high-profile gathering on January 18, 2012 in Washington, DC, featuring top-quality research-based speakers who shared visions for the future of learning with emerging technologies. Organized by SRI International and the Lawrence Hall of Science, and hosted by the National Geographic Society, the day was filled with TED-like talks about what Cyberlearning is, what it can become, and the transformative potential it has to shape learning and our future. The core objectives of the Summit were to:  Develop      and articulate a clear role for emerging technology in the process of      learning. Address      not only an individualized or personalized view of learning, but also the      equally important view of learning as social and cultural and as something      that people best do together. See      how the process of learning can be connected across the different settings      of everyday life, allowing meaningful ties among across school, home,      community and other sites of learning. Envision      the necessary systems to bring learners, technologies, content, and      context together in cohesive ways. Articulate      new approaches to democratizing access to advanced STEM knowledge and      accelerate learnersÆ progress along learning progressions towards deep      disciplinary understandings.   The Summit resulted in a high quality collection of talks, which are available for public use on the Cyberlearning Community Wiki at http://cyberlearning.sri.com.
