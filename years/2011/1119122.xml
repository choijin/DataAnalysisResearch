<AbstractNarration>The Development of Ambitious and Equitable Mathematics Instruction project is supporting and investigating the implementation of reformed mathematics instruction at the middle school level in two large school districts. Project researchers are asking:  What does it take to support mathematics teachers' development of ambitious and equitable instructional practices on a large scale?  The project has built on what was learned in a previous, successful project studying the implementation of a middle school mathematics curriculum. The primary goal of the new project is to develop an empirically grounded theory of action for implementing reform at school and district levels.  The researchers are investigating reform within a coherent system that focuses on leadership and school-based professional development.  In addition, they are facilitating a longitudinal study of the curriculum implementation by continuing the data collection from the original study.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In order to build a theory of action, the project team is synthesizing data from a variety of domains including instructional systems (e.g., curriculum, materials, professional development, support for struggling students, and learning communities), mathematics coaching, networks of teachers, school leadership, and district leadership. Investigators are using a variety of analytic techniques to successfully integrate both quantitative and qualitative data as they seek to understand how school district strategies are playing out in schools and classrooms and how those strategies can be revised in order to improve student learning of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; An empirically grounded theory of action for implementing reform will help the mathematics education community to implement and to understand the process of reforming mathematics instruction at the middle school level.  Many advances in mathematics instruction have been documented within a limited context, but researchers and practitioners need to understand the full range of action necessary to achieve similar successes at a district-wide level.  The model developed from this project, in conjunction with longitudinal data, has the potential to guide future reform efforts that seek to provide ambitious and equitable mathematics instruction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Schools and districts across the U.S. face the challenge of supporting increasingly diverse groups of students to attain increasingly rigorous learning goals across multiple subject matter areas including mathematics. Not surprisingly, the proportion of students judged to be proficient in mathematics has dropped significantly in most districts when more rigorous assessments of student learning were implemented. The Middle School Mathematics and the Institutional Setting of Teaching (MIST) project addressed this issue by establishing genuine partnerships with two large urban school districts for four year and additional two districts for eight years.  In these partnerships, we investigated what it takes to improve the quality of mathematics teaching and student learning on a large scale by doing research with rather than on the districts.   Our district partnerships had had both pragmatic and research goals.  We addressed our pragmatic goal of adding value to the districts? instructional improvement efforts by collecting and analyzing data each year to document how each district?s instructional improvement strategies were actually playing out in schools and classrooms.  We then shared our findings with leaders of each district each year and made actionable recommendations about how they might revise their current improvement strategies to make them more effective. The districts found our finding relevant because they focused directly on the problems on which they working, and they took up 67% of our recommendations.  In the course of our collaboration with the four districts, we compiled a longitudinal data set that spans from the classroom to district instructional leadership. The analyses that we conducted of these data enabled us to address our primary research question: what does it take to improve the quality of math teaching and student learning on a large scale? The empirically grounded improvement strategies that we identified constitute a coherent theory of action for instructional improvement that bridges the traditional divide between research on teaching and learning, and research on policy and leadership. The ToA consists of three top-level components: a coherent instructional system for supporting teachers? improvement of their instructional practices,  school leaders' practices as instructional leaders in mathematics, and district leaders' practices in supporting the development of school-level capacity for instructional improvement.  The first of these components, a coherent instructional system, comprises four elements:  Goals for students? mathematics learning and vision of high-quality mathematics instruction  A subsystem of supports for teachers? learning that includes pull-out professional development, school-based teacher collaborative meetings, and mathematics coaching, as well as teachers' advice networks Instructional materials and assessments  Supplemental supports for currently struggling students    This ToA provides actionable, research-based guidance on the types of improvement strategies that schools and districts can implement to address the challenge of supporting all students in attaining increasingly rigorous learning goals.  Although our work focused on mathematics in the middle grades, one of our partner district?s efforts to apply our findings to other grade levels and to other core subject matter areas suggests that the findings are relevant to instructional improvement efforts that aim at rigorous learning goals more generally.
