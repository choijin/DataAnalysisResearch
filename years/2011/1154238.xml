<AbstractNarration>The mid-ocean ridge system is the largest feature on the surface of the Earth. It is also the site of much active faulting, and of most of the Earth's volcanic activity. The production of new seafloor by the process of seafloor spreading is a fundamental process that shapes the planet's surface. A half-century's research has revealed much about the mid-ocean ridge system, and an increasingly important tool for understanding the workings of mid-ocean ridges is numerical modeling. Though the ridge system is three dimensional, such models have, up to now, been limited to two dimensions owing to computing limitations. This project represents an ambitious collaborative effort to build the first genuinely 3D models of faulting and magmatism (volcanic processes) over a global range of mid-ocean ridge settings. This project has a variety of broader impacts. The results of this study and the development of a new 3D visco-elasticplastic tectonics code will benefit studies of long-term lithospheric deformation generally, with broad applications in Earth (e.g., GeoPRISMS and Earthscope programs) as well as planetary science. In addition, 3D time-dependent visualizations will make exceptionally stimulating and intuitive illustrations for use in ongoing classroom instructional and K-12 outreach activities. Most of the budget will support two talented and promising graduate students. Finally, the PIs will work with the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG) to document, benchmark, and disseminate both our 2D and 3D codes, thereby contributing the the scientific infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plate tectonics describes the processes by which the EarthÆs tectonic plates collide and move apart.  In this study, we investigated the behavior of the EarthÆs crust and lithosphere where tectonic plates diverge at mid-ocean ridges.  This divergence is accommodated by tectonic faulting and the characteristics of the fault patterns that develop are controlled by the physical properties of the crust.  Specifically, the structure of mid-ocean ridges is fundamentally three-dimensional (3-D), with across- and along-segment variability generally increasing as the spreading rate and/or magma supply decrease.    In this research, we developed quantitative 2-D and 3-D numerical models to simulate tectonic faulting at mid-ocean ridges.  These models were used to investigate how faults rotate during their growth and how erosion and mass wasting processes influence the development of normal faults.  We also used 3-D models to determine how multiple normal faults will grow and link together during extension and how this linkage is influence by magmatism along the ridge axis.  The results of our study and the new 2-D and 3-D visco-elastic-plastic tectonics code developed through this project will benefit studies of long-term lithospheric deformation generally, with broad applications in Earth (e.g., NSF GeoPRISMS and Earthscope programs) as well as planetary science. In addition, 3-D time-dependent visualizations of these numerical models make exceptionally stimulating and intuitive illustrations that have been used in classroom lectures and K-12 outreach activities by the PI.  Finally, a major impact of this study was supporting the Ph.D. research of MIT/WHOI Joint Program student Jean-Arthur Olive who graduated in February 2015.
