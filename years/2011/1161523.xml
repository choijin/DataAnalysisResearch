<AbstractNarration>The Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry will continue its series of annual "Winter Schools" in 2013, 2014, 2015, with the 2013 Arizona Winter School taking place March 9-13, 2013 at the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ. The Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry was founded in 1997.  The NSF has provided the primary support for the center since its inception, with renewal of funding in 2002, 2006, 2009, and 2012.  The primary activity of the Southwest Center is the Arizona Winter School (AWS), an annual meeting which has become a prominent national event and provides high-level training and research experience for graduate students in arithmetic geometry.  The AWS is an intensive five-day meeting, organized around a different central topic each year, that features a set of courses by leading and emerging experts.  The AWS is not a traditional conference: the speakers organize courses of four lectures, provide lecture notes in advance, and propose projects for graduate students to work on during the meeting.  Nightly working sessions on these projects and on separate problem sets are run by the speakers and postdoctoral fellows.  On the last day, students present their findings to the participants of the meeting.  The result is a particularly intense and focused five days of mathematical activity for everyone involved.  Recent Winter School topics have included Number Theory and Dynamics, Stark-Heegner Points, and Ramification and Geometry.  The topics of upcoming Winter Schools will be guided by future mathematical developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Winter School, connections among peers are formed, and mentoring relationships between students and senior researchers are developed.  As has been the case at previous Winter Schools, subsequent collaborations between participants at all levels are the norm. Students make concrete strides toward becoming research mathematicians, post-doctoral assistants gain valuable mentoring experience in their academic careers, and faculty develop new interests and see new connections that lead to important published results.  The Southwest Center website shares reusable content from the Winter Schools, including lecture notes, project descriptions, and audio and video of lectures.  Through these thorough records, the dialogues begun at the AWS are extended to the greater mathematical community, and the efforts of the AWS participants are made freely and indefinitely available to all.  More information about the upcoming and past Arizona Winter School programs can be found at the Southwest Center's website: http://swc.math.arizona.edu/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Arizona Winter School (AWS) is a five-day workshop for graduate students in the mathematical field of arithmetic geometry, held annually in March at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona.  Since the first Winter School in 1998, the AWS had developed a significant reputation around the world as a highly successful, model school in graduate mathematics education.  The NSF award was the primary source of support for the 2013-2015 meetings and provided supplemental support for AWS 2016.     Arithmetic geometry lies at the interface between the fields of number theory and algebraic geometry.  At its core, it studies arithmetic questions, such as the finding of integral solutions to Diophantine equations, from a modern geometric perspective.  In practice, it is a field of vast scope that utilizes and informs theory from much of modern mathematics.   Each Winter School is held on a topic of special interest to researchers in the field of arithmetic geometry, with lecture series given by four distinguished speakers on a particular topic related to their research.  The topics of the schools supported by the award were:   AWS 2013: Modular Forms and Modular Curves  AWS 2014: Arithmetic Statistics  AWS 2015: Arithmetic and Higher-Dimensional Varieties  (AWS 2016: Analytic Methods in Arithmetic Geometry)  The speakers prepare lecture notes prior to the school, which are posted online.  Videos of the lectures are also posted online shortly after the talks.  In evening working sessions, the speakers and a project assistant supervise smaller groups of Ph.D. students on research projects created prior to the school, and the students present their results on the last day of the school.  Other groups of students work in one of two problem sessions led by a postdoctoral expert, or in one of four study groups that each follow one of the lectures led by an expert postdoctoral guide.  By numerous accounts, the totality of the events at the school make for an intensely rewarding experience for the Ph.D. students, aiding significantly in their development as research mathematicians.  It is typical for many students to continue collaborations begun at the school and to publish the results of their work in research journals.  The first three meetings primarily supported by the award were the three largest Winter Schools to date, with between 189 and 227 participants each, including 140 to 184 graduate students.  These students come from around the world, from institutions large and small, to participate in the event.  By all indications, the reputation of the AWS continued to grow throughout the course of the award.  The conference is organized by a group of five mathematicians linked to the Southwest U.S. and has an advisory board of distinguished mathematicians who help in the selection of the topics and advise on the selection of speakers for forthcoming schools.  The organizers work to ensure the participation of a diverse group at all levels of the school and in the evening working groups, in particular by members of underrepresented groups.  At the end of each meeting, the organizers provide a survey to all participants on the various aspects of the school and its organization.  The organizers use this as a tool in making continued improvements to the structure and organization of the school.
