<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chombo is a software package developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for performing a particular type of spatially adaptive computation called adaptive mesh refinement, which is very important to many types of scientific models.  For example, a tsunami is far more tractable to model if one allows a simulation to use coarse resolution over the ocean, where precise calculations are not essential, and fine resolution near coastlines, where the small-scale dynamics of the event are of utmost importance.   Chombo's source code is open source and available to the public; however, in my experience many researchers judge it to be too complex for their own use.  This perceived complexity (much of it due to issues that are inherent to large software projects) limits the use of a great resource, and one that represents a sizable investment of human resources and government funds.   This projet identified several challenges that must be overcome by new users of Chombo, addressing them concisely and creatively through a brief new layer of documentation.  This has the potential to make Chombo a viable option to other researchers, in the process exposing them to many powerful programming techniques due to modern computer science that may assist them in other computational projects as well.
