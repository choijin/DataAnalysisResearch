<AbstractNarration>This  proposal consists of several projects using algebraic topological techniques to study questions arising in String Topology,   the topology of moduli spaces, and the study of Topological Quantum Field Theories. The theory of String Topology, first introduced by Chas and Sullivan in 1999, now  involves a vast array of rich structure on spaces of paths and loops of manifolds.  In this proposal, there are   projects that will relate string topology to geometry and topological field theory.  This includes a joint project with A. Blumberg and C. Teleman that will relate string topology to the recent classification theories of topological field theories due to Costello and Hopkins-Lurie.  In particular they will construct and study a  string topology category  of a manifold,   and compute its Hochschild homology.   They will investigate the ``Calabi-Yau" properties of this category.  In this study interesting questions involving the role of Koszul duality in topological field theory arise, which the authors will address.     Cohen and his collaborators  also have a   goal of comparing the symplectic field theory of the cotangent bundle of a manifold, with the string topology of that manifold.   Other projects in this proposal include a collaboration with M.Schwarz on   the development of  the ``Quantum String topology" of a symplectic manifold, and   a  project with N. Kitchloo, to address conjectures by the geometers F. Lalonde and D. McDuff on the Serre spectral sequence for bundles with symplectic fibers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal consists of several projects investigating the  area of research known as "String Topology", as well as related questions.   String topology, a theory that was first introduced by Chas and Sullivan in 1999,  studies structures on spaces of paths, loops, and surfaces.  This structure was motivated by formalisms in string theory in physics.  The idea is to understand how loops (or paths) in a background space can evolve in time. Loops can evolve by changing in size and even breaking apart.  These phenomena are measured by studying surfaces mapping to the background space, that span these loops.  In this project, Cohen tends to study various aspects of the theory related to topological quantum field theories, as well as those related to symplectic geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project pursued a research program in algebraic topology, with connections to both other areas of mathematics and to theoretical physics.  "String Topology" is the study of the topology of spaces of loops and paths in manifolds.  It was motivated by theoretical physics, in that this mathematics is necessary in understanding how elementary "string particles" can evolve in space and time.  One of the main outcomes of this project was the proof of a conjecture that the field theory represented by string topology, and the field theory represented by the so-called "symplectic Floer theory" of  the cotangent bundle are equivalent.  As said above, string topology is motivated by particle physics.  But the symplectic geometry (especially of the contangent bundle) comes directly from classical mechanics.   The fact that these theories are equivalent should lead to a much greater understanding of each theory.    Another major outcome of this project was the discovery of "gauge symmetry" in string topology.  This was not even conjectured prior to this work.  This is a potentially very exciting development as it could lead to direct relationships between this area of algebraic topology and the 4-dimensional geometry studied by gauge theory, and in turn its relationship to gauge field theory in physics.  During the period of this grant, the PI supervised 6 PhD students who performed their research on questions related to this project.  They were supported financially by this grant.  In addition the PI produced 6 research papers  that have been published in peer-reviewed journals and/or posted on the ArXiv.  These papers were all related to this project.
