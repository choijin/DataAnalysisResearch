<AbstractNarration>The electric grid in the United States has evolved over the past century from a series of small independent community-based systems to one of the largest and most complex cyber-physical systems today.  However, the established conditions that made the electric grid an engineering marvel are being challenged by major changes, the most important being a worldwide effort to mitigate climate change by reducing carbon emissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates key aspects of a computation and information foundation for future cyber-physical energy systems?the smart grids. The overall project objective is to support high penetrations of renewable energy sources, community based micro-grids, and the widespread use of electric cars and smart appliances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has three interconnected components that, collectively, address issues of computation architecture, information hierarchy, and experimental modeling and validation.  On computation architecture, the framework based on cloud computing is investigated for the scalable, consistent, and secure operations of smart grids. The research aims to quantify fundamental design tradeoffs among scalability, data consistency, security, and trustworthiness for emerging applications of smart grids. On information hierarchy, temporal and spatial characteristics of information hierarchy are investigated with the goal of gaining a foundational understanding on how information should be partitioned, collected, distributed, compressed, and aggregated. The research also develops an open and scalable experimental platform (SmartGridLab) for empirical investigations and testing of algorithms and concepts developed in this project. SmartGridLab integrates the hardware testbed with a software simulator so that software virtual nodes can interact with physical nodes in the testbed.   This research also includes a significant education component aimed at integrating frontier research with undergraduate and graduate curricula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merits:  This project investigated aspects of a computation and information foundation for future cyber-energy systems&mdash;the smart grids&mdash;that aim to support high level of renewable integration, distributed energy resources, community based micro-grids, and the widespread deployment of electric cars and smart appliances.     The direct impact of a smarter grid is that by enabling higher efficiency and more use of renewables, power costs to the consumer are kept to a minimum, system stability is maintained, and yet the level of pollution is reduced.     A primary focus of the research effort was to explore information hierarchies in smart grids.  Part of our work was primarily computational: we developed new stochastic optimization techniques that allow system operators minimize overall system cost in the presence of generation and demand uncertainties.  A key innovation emerging from this effort is a set of novel techniques for forecasting probability distributions of locational prices of electricity, network congestions, and operation contingencies.  Such techniques empower consumers to reduce consumption without sacrificing quality of comfort, market participants to manage risks and optimize profit, and system operators to reduce cost and maintain system reliability.       Data analytics for this setting represented a second major component of this project.  New monitoring algorithms using sensors of different modalities were developed.  Novel quickest detection schemes were discovered for detecting anomalies.  Significant progress was made in characterizing risks associated with attacks on cyber-physical energy systems.  In particular, we analyzed existing and potential vulnerabilities of power system state estimation.  We developed strategies and preventive measures against malicious data attack on power system control center and market operations.     The project also had a significant practical side, looking at the software infrastructures in use at the bulk and distribution layer of the power grid, and innovating by creating  new computation paradigms for capturing smart grid data and for hosting analytics that continuously track that data and tune grid settings.  For this work, we focused on the opportunity offered by bringing modern cloud computing concepts to bear on grid operations, for example in situations where independent system operators or regional transmission organizations coordinate in large interconnected power grids.  Our effort resulted in a new cloud-hosted data capture and analysis platform together with software tools for managing and analyzing bulk power state data from PMU and SCADA devices.  These results are very real and practical, and in ongoing work we are collaborating with several system operators (ISO-NE, ISO-NY and NYPA) to deploy our code in preproduction experimental settings.  The operators see clear value in the mix of secure sharing of files, strong consistency, and good real-time delay properties our solutions offers.     Another practical result of our effort was an experimental testbed that integrates hardware modules and software simulation was developed for empirical investigations.  This testbed provided a flexible platform capable of simulating complex smart grid operations.     Broader Impacts:  The project had significant broader relevance.  Smart grid is really just one of the first examples of a so-called Internet of Things application.  Further examples will include smart buildings and cities, smart highways, and other kinds of smart transport systems.  Smart factories and smart shopping markets will bring the benefits of machine learning and AI directly to the end consumer.  Our work creates a real-time infrastructure suitable for a wide range of such use cases.     The project additionally included a significant teaching and training component.  Over 20 Masters and PhD students participated in various aspects of the project.  Strong outreach efforts were made in broadening participation of under-represented groups in engineering. Examples include a female postdoc of the project go on to be a faculty member in  a major academic institution in the area of smart grid and a freshman female students participating in developing machine learning methods for forecasting locational marginal prices of electricity.      Finally, we broadly disseminated its findings and results, not only to researchers in engineering and computer science communities, but also to industry and the general public (through interviews).  Websites featuring on cloud technologies were developed as conduits to potential transitions to practice, and software solutions were placed into the public domain using open-source 3-clause BSD free licensing.  Wider adoption is already taking place.             Last Modified: 11/18/2016       Submitted by: Lang Tong]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
