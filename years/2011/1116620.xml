<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is improve the stability of software&lt;br/&gt;systems. Many modern programming languages use static type checking to&lt;br/&gt;eliminate errors from programs. However, the type systems that&lt;br/&gt;underlie these checkers are conservative and reject several classes of&lt;br/&gt;useful, correct programs. In particular, the techniques of generic&lt;br/&gt;programming, which optimize data structures, generalize interfaces and&lt;br/&gt;eliminate boilerplate in program development, are difficult to type&lt;br/&gt;check. Although dependent type systems provide flexibility in type&lt;br/&gt;checking, particularly with respect to generic programming, they have&lt;br/&gt;not yet been integrated into realistic programming languages.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work of this project will augment a mature, general&lt;br/&gt;purpose, statically-typed programming language with support for&lt;br/&gt;dependently-typed programming. Specifically, the project will extend&lt;br/&gt;the source and intermediate languages of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler&lt;br/&gt;(GHC). Although generic programming is the key application area, the&lt;br/&gt;Haskell extensions proposed here will enhance the capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;dependently-typed programming in Haskell in many domains. This project&lt;br/&gt;is in collaboration with the designers and implementers of the GHC&lt;br/&gt;compiler at Microsoft Research, Cambridge. The team includes world&lt;br/&gt;leaders in the areas of dependent type systems, generic programming,&lt;br/&gt;language design and implementation. As GHC is an open-source project,&lt;br/&gt;the extensions to Haskell will be freely distributed. Furthermore, the&lt;br/&gt;project will have educational benefits through the funding of doctoral students&lt;br/&gt;and the integration of its results into advanced graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
