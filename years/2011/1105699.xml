<AbstractNarration>The Georgia Topology Conference is an annual event which has established itself as a mainstay of the American topology community over the past 50 years. It takes place at the University of Georgia in Athens in the Spring or Summer. The focus of the conference is a subfield of topology which varies from year to year; recent topics have included three- and four-dimensional manifolds, knot theory, contact and symplectic topology, and the calculus of functors. Each year, the conference gathers a core of senior researchers together with a larger group of young mathematicians, mostly recent Ph. D.'s and graduate students.  Participation by members of under-represented groups is encouraged and funded; in particular the speakers and organizers generally include several women.  The conference format is designed both to help disseminate important new research and to provide a formative experience for early-career mathematicians.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, topology is the study of the properties of a space (such as the universe that we live in) which are preserved when the space is continuously deformed.  The subject has many connections to physics and has applications to such topics as robotics and image analysis.  This conference is designed to serve as a venue for new approaches to fundamental questions in topology and to facilitate the career development of young mathematicians working in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information is available on the conference website:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.ams.org/meetings/calendar/2011_may18-22_athens.html</AbstractNarration>

Each year, the organizers choose a different topic in geometric topology and invite a mixture of established researchers and strong early-career mathematicians working in that area to give one-hour talks at the conference.

The conference is designed with an eye toward encouraging communication and collaboration between the particiants, with an unhurried schedule for the talks and time allotted for less formal interaction.  For many of the younger participants, this is one of their first opportunities to present their work to a broad audience, and there are many successful topologists around the country who look back on their past participation in the conference as a formative event in their careers. The four conferences that were held with support from this grant all represented successful implementations of this general plan.  The 2011 conference, organized by Michael Usher,concerned Hamiltonian dynamics and Floer theory.  David Gay and Gordana Matic organized the 2012 conference, which focused on symplectic and contact topology.  The 2013 conference, run by Jason Cantarella and Clay Shonkwiler, dealt with the geometry of polygon spaces and its connection to statistics and physics.  Finally, Will Kazez and Dan Margalit organized the 2014 conference on the topic of mapping class groups of surfaces.  In each case, the conference provided a stimulating environment that led to collaborations and gave helpful experiences to young mathematicians.
