<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research project is to assess multidisciplinary optimization (MDO) methods as coordinating frameworks for the systems engineering process during the detailed design of large-scale complex systems. Systems engineering is the process that coordinates the integration of many design teams within a large project.  The research addresses simultaneous optimization of the system design and the systems engineering process itself.  The emphasis of the work is on the detailed design phase, in which an organization is divided along component lines rather than by engineering discipline, and the design of thousands of components occur in parallel.  The research will first investigate payoff measures of the system in a relevant context and formulate these measures into optimization objectives and constraints.  Next, several MDO methods will be examined for their potential to facilitate systems engineering process coordination, and formal metrics will be established to measure effectiveness of the methods.  These methods will be assessed using a simulation of the design of a gas turbine engine as a representative example of a large-scale complex system.  The simulation will include both physics-based analyses and behavioral models that describe the action of component design teams in response to different process coordination approaches.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The engineering effort devoted to detailed design in systems such as aircraft significantly exceeds the effort expended on the earlier phases of conceptual and preliminary design.  If successful, this research can potentially introduce improved ways of organizing the detailed design of large-scale complex systems to reduce cost overruns and schedule delays.  The research program may also reinvigorate the study of MDO in a new and meaningful way.  To encourage continued research in this area, a graduate seminar course on the applicability of MDO to systems engineering management will be created, employing the simulation as a pedagogic aid.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Large engineering design projects, such as new aircraft or new spacecraft, regularly overrun their budgets and take years longer than planned.  The expense, duration, and uncertainty of these projects has hampered our nation's ability to produce the systems we want and need.  There are undoubtedly better ways to develop such systems, but large projects with thousands of engineers extending across many years are very difficult to study, and without rigorous study, new design methods are just guesses rather than proven tools.  This project developed a way to simulate complex design organizations so that new methods can be studied in simulation.  It also developed a validation strategy, so that when new methods are proven out in simulation, we can also compellingly prove that they will be successful in the real world.  We are already conducting follow-on projects using this simulation approach to evaluate controversial systems engineering methods.  In addition to developing an approach to simulation (and building a trial simulator), we learned more about systems engineering.  We developed a new way of talking about the actions and effects that make up the development of large complex engineered systems.  These new ideas are now being taught to students as a part of systems engineering courses at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.  Six students worked on various phases of this project and learned about how systems engineering is a effective activity within large organizations.   Most of the funding for this project went directly to supporting these students.  Four of our students are women, and one is a member of a minority underrepresented in STEM professions, so this project contributed to encouraging women and underrepresented minorities to successfully engage in STEM careers.  Two of the six have already completed PhD degrees.  Another is a successful engineer at a startup company.         Last Modified: 06/16/2017       Submitted by: Paul D Collopy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
