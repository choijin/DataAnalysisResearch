<AbstractNarration>Information technology is an established component of the infrastructure of modern societies, and cryptography is a cornerstone of information security.  Provable security quantifies the resilience of cryptographic constructions to attacks.  This quantification is often relative to the hardness of a handful of reference "intractable" problems like integer factorization.  Because of the intrinsic strength of heterogeneity, diversifying the set of intractable problems enhances the robustness of the overall structure.  This project responds to the challenge by building a foundation for cryptography from problems in combinatorial group theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project capitalizes on earlier efforts on the algorithmic unsolvability of standard computational problems in combinatorial group theory like the "word problem", but looks at them through the lens of the probabilistic modeling, characteristic of modern cryptography.  The research objectives can be grouped into three main categories: 1) identifying efficiently sampleable distributions on which (variants of) the standard computational group-theoretic problems remain _difficult on average_; 2) developing new _hard group-theoretic learning problems_; and 3) exploring the implications of this foundational work to applications with enhanced cryptographic functionality, with the long-term goal of deriving group-theoretic instantiations of public-key cryptography with homomorphic properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this project will enrich the theory and practice of cryptography with new tools and alternatives, stimulating for researchers throughout the cryptography and group-theory communities, thus fostering collaborations between the two fields.  The undertaking of the research entails significant student participation in research at institutions that serve demographic groups that have been historically underrepresented in computer science and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to develop a framework for formulating and analyzing computational problems arising from combinatorial group theory, and to explore their viability as a platform for cryptographic applications.  Notable results in the context of our explorations of computationally hard group-theoretic problems include the generalization of the "Learning Parity with Noise"(LPN) and "Learning With Errors" (LWE) problems to an abstract class of learning problems, and an instantiation of this new class of problems based on the theory of finitely generated groups of exponent 3.  We also established preliminary evidence to the computational hardness of this new computational problem, which we termed "Learning Burnside Homomorphism with Noise" (Bn-LHN). Specifically, we showed that the Bn-LHN problem enjoys a strong form of random self-reducibility: solving the problem on a random instance is not any easier than solving the problem on an arbitrary (worst-caste) instance.  In terms of cryptographic applications of computational problems from group theory, the results of this project range from the design and implementation of new cryptosystems and protocols, to lower bounds tests for enhanced functionalities like private information retrieval (PIR), to contributions to the theory of Cayley hash functions and of secure multiparty computation in general and delegatable computation in particular.  Some of these results are highlighted below; refer to the list of publications produced as a result of this research for more details.  * We developed a symmetric cryptosystem whose security can be provably established based on the conjectured hardness of the Burnside learning problem. A prototype implementation is available on the PI's webpage.  * We devised a "litmus test" to establish the feasibility of protocols based on "somewhat homomorphic encryption" that aim at certain levels of communication efficiency.  In more detail, we developed formal machinery and models that capture many common uses of somewhat homomorphic encryption, and then proved lower bounds in this model for non-interactive two-party protocols.  Our model draws from those developed by Yao in 1979 and by Abelson in 1980, which we generalize into an abstract "protocol pattern" and then specialize for our needs. We then demonstrated how to apply the general lower bounds in this model to a number of cryptographic protocols including PIR and private keyword search.  We also showed that constructing a group homomorphic encryption scheme over any finite, non-abelian *simple* group is equivalent to constructing a fully homomorphic encryption scheme.  * We proposed a generic key exchange protocol based on semidirect products of (possibly non-abelian) (semi)groups.  Our protocol generalizes the classical Diffie-Hellman (DH) protocol (corresponding to the use of cyclic groups), but can also be instantiated with non-abelian (semi)groups, resulting in several useful features that make it compare favorably to the DH protocol.  * We put forth a protocol for delegating computation of group operations from a computationally weak client who holds an input and the description of a function, to a single computationally strong server who holds a description of the same function.  Specifically, we offered new ideas for secure and efficient delegation of the inversion of a group element, of exponentiation with a private base and public exponent as well as of exponentiation with a public base and private exponent.  As part of the educational efforts of the project, we developed a course in Algebraic Cryptography that was published as a book.  We also provided valuable training opportunities for research assistants by running periodical one-&shy;on&shy;-one meetings with CUNY Math and CS doctoral student on hard learning problems over algebraic structures and their applications to cryptography.
