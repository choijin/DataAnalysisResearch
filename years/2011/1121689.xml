<AbstractNarration>How do sensory signals in different parts of the brain get combined to form a single unified perception that we experience?  Despite amassing a wealth of detail in the past century about the cellular components of the brain, this fundamental question as to how their activities are coordinated or integrated, remains largely unanswered.  The experiments proposed here would begin to uncover how neurons in the rat's touch sensory system combine signals from long whiskers on the two sides of its face when it judges the width of a tunnel opening in the dark.  The approach is to record the electrical activity of sensory neurons while trained rats report whether they sense a wide or a narrow opening with their facial whiskers.  Selectively turning off neurons on one side of the brain or the other (using a drug) will quantify how much the signals from the two sides of the face are being mixed in different task conditions.  Thus these experiments will begin to explain the remarkable ability of neurons to change the mix of sensory inputs in order to adapt and optimize their processing for changing circumstances.  Using the rat as a model system makes it feasible to probe fundamental cellular mechanisms by which assemblies of neurons communicate.   Principles of flexible neural communication gleaned from the rat model will likely shed light on analogous neural organization in evolutionarily higher organisms including humans.  At the same time, the next generation of undergraduate women will be trained in quantitative analysis and cutting-edge behavioral neurophysiology techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall aims of this project were (1) to characterize flexible neural integration and discover cellular mechanisms of perceptual and attentive functions and dysfunctions in the rat, which may apply to the human brain; and (2) to increase participation of women and minority students in neurophysiology and computational neuroscience.   The major specific goal of the project was to characterize how the two hemispheres of the brain interact during a whisker-guided tactile discrimination task, using multi-electrode brain recordings and targeted temporary inactivation of one hemisphere at a time by micro-infusion of a drug.  We have set up multiple functional training chambers but the whisker-guided task is not yet optimized, so the scientific results we have achieved from this project (outlined below) pertain to the grant?s broad goal to characterize neural mechanisms of perception and attention.  Our publications based on the work funded by this grant represent significant steps toward establishing a rat model of attention- and perception-related neural phenomena that have until recently been studied primarily in humans and other primates.  Our current work using the drug scopolamine with begins to quantify the role of muscarinic receptors in bottom-up and top-down auditory attention and perception, as well as testing whether muscarinic receptors modulate inter-area coherence and correlations.  Imada, A, Morris, A, Wiest, MC (2013).  Deviance detection      by a P3-like response in rat posterior parietal cortex.  Frontiers in Integrative      Neuroscience 6(127):1-11.     This study used local field potential (LFP) recordings to examine potential mechanisms of involuntary (or bottom-up) attention in the frontal and parietal cortex of awake rats.  We quantified enhanced neural responses to rare as opposed to frequent tones in the two areas ("oddball effects"), which might reflect neural mechanisms by which rare stimuli automatically "grab" attention. In addition, we applied a novel experimental design to isolate the contribution of a particular cellular mechanism, stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA), to the oddball effects we quantified.  In this way our results established the existence of "deviance detection" in the rat cortex which cannot be accounted for by SSA, and which might instead rely on a brain comparison of the current stimulus with memories of stimuli in the recent past.  This paper was featured as being of special interest on the Psychology Progress website.   Herzog L, Salehi K, Bohon KS, Wiest      MC (2014).  Pre-stimulus frontal-parietal coherence predicts      auditory detection performance in rats.       J. Neurophysiology 111(10):1986-2000.     This paper quantifies the relationship between synchronization of neural activity in the frontal-parietal network and rats? performance detecting auditory tones.  It represents an initial success in my program to characterize how changes in timing or functional connectivity between brain areas relate to an animal?s attention to and perception of external stimuli, and a step toward establishing a rat model of attention- and perception-related neural synchronization phenomena that have until recently been studied primarily in humans and other primates.   Bohon, K, Wiest, MC (2014).  Role      of medio-dorsal frontal and posterior parietal neurons during auditory      detection performance in rats.  PLoS      One 9:e114064.   This paper describes the results of our multi-site action potential recordings in behaving rats, which characterize neural correlates of auditory perception in the rat cortical areas we sampled.  Importantly, by comparing neural information about different trial types (hits, misses, correct rejections, false alarms), we estimated the contribution of movement-related activity to the responses we observed, so that our results identify putative action potential correlates of auditory perception as distinct from correlates of the movements used by the rats to report their perception.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification of candidate spiking correlates of auditory perception in the frontal and parietal cortex of rats.  We believe our study represents an important contribution to the growing literature establishing rodent models of cognitive functions traditionally studied in humans or non-human primates.  In addition, this report represents a successful step toward my long-term goal to characterize neural correlates and mechanisms of perception in behaving animals.    Thirty eight undergraduate women research students participated in this research in my lab&mdash;conducting behavioral training of rats, neural recordings in behaving rats, data analysis, and brain histology.  They have also assisted me during multi-electrode array brain implantation surgeries.  Most of my students develop Matlab programing ability in order to implement complex analyses of our multi-channel neurophysiological and behavioral data.  My students get scientific writing and presentation experience presenting at annual Wellesley, regional and national conferences, and assignments to draft reports about their projects with references to the research literature.  Five of my undergraduate research students have been co-authors on published research papers.  Several former students (e.g. Neria Douglass ?10, Allicia Imada ?13, Linea Herzog ?12, Kia Salehi ?13, and Jessica Kelemen ?16) qualified for neurophysiology research jobs based on experience in my lab.   Thus this research program has directly advanced my goal to address the under-representation of women among neurophysiologists and computational neuroscientists.
