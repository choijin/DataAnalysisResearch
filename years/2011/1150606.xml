<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Jiong Yang of Texas A&amp;M University.  Professor Yang will develop efficient synthetic approaches to zoanthamines, a family of complex polycyclic marine alkaloids possessing biological properties that are valuable for therapeutic applications. First, a transannular Michael reaction cascade will be systematically explored to elucidate its scope and stereochemical outcome for synthesis of polycyclic molecular structures. Second, the total synthesis of norzoanthamine, an anti-osteoporotic member of natural products of the zoanthamine family, will be completed. The transannular Michael reaction cascade will be employed to synthesize its stereochemically complex and highly functionalized ABC ring system. Other cascade reactions will also be developed for efficient assembly of the complex polycyclic molecular skeleton of zoanthamines. For the final objective, a synthetic route to 28-deoxyzoanthenamine will be developed based on a proposed biosynthetic scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Yang will also initiate educational projects that interweave research and teaching.  The first project involves an outreach program targeting local high school science educators by providing opportunities for professional development through discovery-based research in his laboratory. The second initiative involves outreach to K-12 students through a Chemistry Laboratory Open House program to share the excitement of scientific research/discoveries and encourage these students to consider exploring STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
