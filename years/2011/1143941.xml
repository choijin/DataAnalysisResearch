<AbstractNarration>This project, generalizing mean-field approaches from physics and chemistry for integrated design of scalable, network resource aware, distributed control strategies for multi-agent robotic systems, aims to develop macroscopic models that retain salient features of the underlying multi-agent robotic system and use these models in the design of distributed control strategies. For complex cyber physical systems, this promises to provide a novel design methodology that is potentially applicable to a large class of systems and, therefore, will result in foundational knowledge of use to the community at large. This high-risk, high-reward project integrates ideas from physics, chemistry, control theory, and robotics to develop new theoretical foundations for the design, validation, and improvement of coordination strategies for multi-agent robotic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project?s intellectual merit lies in the ensemble approach towards the design, validation, and improvement of cyber physical systems. Mean-field methods provide a system-level abstraction of the underlying distributed system while retaining the salient features of the various agent-level interactions. The generalization of these models to ensembles of interacting engineered systems provides new methods for designing distributed controllers that are sensitive to changing network resources and whose performance can be predicted and adjusted to achieve both the desired short-term and long-term performance specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this project are twofold. First, the mean-field approach takes into account network resource usage and management, providing an integrated strategy for designing scalable decentralized control and coordination strategies. Second, different from biologically-inspired approaches, the mean-field approach enables the design of distributed coordination strategies whose performance can be systematically predicted and tuned to meet detailed performance specifications. This has the potential to unify various existing multi-agent coordination approaches. The research outcomes will be disseminated through publications in technical conferences and journals and incorporated into the PI?s existing undergraduate and graduate curriculum and K-12 outreach efforts targeted at increasing female participation in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this work was to generalize mean-field modeling techniques often used in physics and chemistry for multi-agent robotics applications.  Specifically, the objective was to extend these techniques to enable integrated design of scalable, network resource aware, distributed control strategies for multi-agent robotic systems.  The project investigated the use of mean-field techniques to provide an ensemble approach towards the design, validation, and improvement of network resource aware distributed control strategies for multi-agent robotic systems.  Mean-field methods were chosen since they provide a system-level abstraction of the underlying distributed system while retaining the salient features of the various agent-level interactions.  We considered the problem of controlling the spatial distribution of mobile sensing resources in a distributed fashion for surveillance or environmental monitoring applications.  We focused on the case where individual robots have finite communication ranges but must ensure that each region of the  workspace is appropriately covered without any knowledge of the total number of robots.  We showed how it is possible to account for the impact of local communications on the team's ability to maintain the desired distribution within the workspace.  This was achieved by expanding the existing models to incorporate the dynamics of estimating robot numbers in different portions of the workspace.  This results in two continuous-time Markov jump process -- one to model the changing robot population distribution and one to model the changing estimates of the numbers of robots in different parts of the workspace.  This, in turn, enabled us to optimize the individual robot control policies to ensure overall system robustness assuming some likelihood of resource failures such as navigation and estimation errors.  The intellectual merit lies in showing how mean-field, ensemble-based  approaches can be used to design, validate, and improve the network resource aware distributed control strategies for multi-agent robotic systems.  This shows the promise of employing these models to develop new methods for designing distributed controllers that are sensitive to changing network resources and whose performance can be predicted and adjusted to achieve both the desired short-term and long-term performance specifications.  The broader impact included the K-12 outreach program Women in Aerospace Technology Program (WATP) in 2012. This was a collaborative effort with the American Helicopter Museum, Boeing, Sikorsky, and the Girls Scouts of Eastern Pennsylvania. The program was a bi-monthly program designed to for grade 4-12 girls. The program developed hands-on STEM related activities for the students. These activities were presented and led by a female undergraduate student majoring in a STEM field. The PI mentored three female STEM undergraduates who participated in theWATP program.
