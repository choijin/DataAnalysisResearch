<AbstractNarration>Many industries use traditional revenue management (RM) systems to forecast demand for products and to determine product prices and availabilities.  However, traditional RM systems were designed before the internet was a dominant distribution channel and during a period in which customers had limited knowledge of all of their product offerings.  Choice-based RM systems use discrete choice models to forecast demand in a way that better reflects today's purchasing environment.  Although much has been done on the optimization of choice-based models, little research has been undertaken on how to estimate the model using demand data from a single firm. This research focuses on estimation of parameters for choice-based RM systems using marginal versus expected log likelihood functions.  The marginal formulation has a similar mathematical structure as limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimators, which have previously been developed in the transportation planning field but have not yet been applied to RM.  Sequential estimation techniques such as LIML show strong promise as a framework that enable researchers to solve open research questions related to the incorporation of more realistic product substitution patterns and competitors product information.  The primary research goals are to: (1) integrate nested logit and choice-based RM models and incorporate competitive information;  (2) understand data requirements for choice-based RM models; and, (3) validate these new models on industry datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will help shape the vision for the next-generation RM systems by advancing theories needed to estimate RM choice parameters.  Through testing and validating models on industry datasets, this research will be able to develop recommendations on data requirements and relevant industry settings needed to successfully estimate choice-based RM parameters. The results of this research will lead to increased profits for firms and better product and service offerings for customers.  Previous research has suggested incremental revenue gains ranging from 1-10 percent may be possible with choice-based RM systems; thus, potential impacts of this research are substantial.  The results of this research will also be applicable to other disciplines that face censored data, e.g., when retail sales are censored due to stock-outs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Firms use revenue management (RM) to forecast demand for products and to determine how many products to sell at a particular price.  Traditional RM systems were created before the internet, and have struggled to adapt to the internet shopping environment, leading to calls for fundamentally new "choice-based" RM systems that forecast demand in a manner more consistent with modern shopping practices.  Choice-based RM systems are based on discrete choice models, which capture how individuals make trade-offs among a set of products.  That is, using the airline industry as an example, discrete choice models seek to answer questions like the following: How much is a customer willing to pay for a morning vs. evening departure?  How much is a customer willing to pay to fly a nonstop vs. connection?   One of the barriers that firms have faced in transitioning to choice-based RM system involves the estimation of choice model parameters &ndash; i.e., how can a firm use its own sales data to determine "how much" individuals are willing to pay for each product attribute.  What makes the estimation of choice models particularly challenging is that the underlying demand model requires predictions of market size, or the number of potential customers in the market, as well as market share, or the number of customers who purchase from a particular firm. However, firms typically have booking data from their own products, i.e., information about market share but not market size.  In RM, the expectation-maximization (EM) approach has been the most widely used method for solving this problem, but is slow and often produces counter-intuitive results. Our approach reformulates the problem so that we can avoid using EM, thereby dramatically improving solution times and providing more intuitive results.   The key outcomes from our grant include the following:  Our estimation approach provides a reliable way for a firm to use their own sales data to estimate how much customers are willing to pay for product attributes. Our estimation approach can be used with flexible discrete choice models that incorporate complex product substitution patterns.  These flexible models help answer questions like the following: If United Airlines lowers its price on an 8 AM flight, will it draw more passengers from its own 11 AM flight or a 9 AM flight operated by Southwest?  This is important, as flexible discrete choice models provide more accurate demand forecasts, which allow firms to better match supply with demand, thereby benefiting both firms and customers. Choice-based RM problems use a "no purchase alternative" to estimate the number of customers who purchase products from other firms.  This "no purchase" alternative represents choices consumers make that are missing from the estimation data.  This is a common problem that occurs in many other applications.  For example, cities (specifically Metropolitan Planning Organizations) are required to forecast demand for transportation modes (e.g., how many individuals will drive, take transit, or bike to work).  Historically, these forecasts have been based on surveys of residents and visitors to the city. These surveys, which may cost more than a million dollars, are typically conducted every ten years. However, new modes may appear before a new survey is conducted: Has a city installed bike rental stations?  Has new express bus service for commuters been introduced?  Has the city passed regulations allowing Uber and similar car services to pick up passengers at airports?  All of these example represent "new" choices that were not present when the survey data was originally collected.  Our estimation approach can be used to estimate market shares for these new alternatives using less expensive data that the cities routinely collect without conducting expensive add-on surveys.
