<AbstractNarration>This project will use a high resolution scanning LIDAR along with visible and infrared imaging to measure the directional distributions of the surface wave field and wave breaking, and use this data to test and develop models of wave evolution and dissipation. The novelty is that it will give the directional wavenumber spectra of the surface waves from the scale of the swell, O(100) m, down to the scale of gravity- capillary waves, O(0.01)m. Similarly, it will give corresponding directional distributions of breaking across the same range of scales. These broadband data are expected to support a greatly improved understanding of the statistical description of wave breaking first proposed by Phillips (1985), based on the length of breaking fronts per unit area of ocean surface moving at around the phase velocity. The measurements of breaking front length in the literature are very limited and have a unimodal structure that is not understood. This program, including the analysis of field data, high-resolution wave breaking kinematics and directional wave measurements from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) Per and airborne measurements during a R/P FLIP experiment and Santa Ana wind events offshore Southern California and Baja California, will allow more thorough testing of the current dissipation source function models in numerical wind wave models and development new models based on an analysis of the data constrained by the radiative transfer equation for the wave field. The data will also permit quantitative exploration of the transition from air-entraining whitecapping to microscale breaking, and the relationship between the kinematics and dynamics of breaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;While the funded effort is focused on investigating hitherto inaccessible aspects of surface wave kinematics and dynamics, improvements in surface-wave and wave-breaking models will have a significant impact on coupled atmosphere-ocean models used for weather and climate prediction. The momentum and energy fluxes from the atmosphere to the ocean are a function of the directional wave spectra and wave breaking distributions. The air-sea transfer of greenhouse and other gases depend on air entrainment due to breaking.&lt;br/&gt;The SIO Pier experiments will be used as a hands-on teaching opportunity in graduate and undergraduate classes at SIO, UCSD. Currently, PI Melville uses the laboratory to provide demonstrations and hands-on experience for students taking classes in fluid mechanics and wave mechanics. The pier experiment will extend this experience for the students from the controlled environment of the laboratory to the uncontrolled environment of the field, thus providing a broader and qualitatively different experience for the students.&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students at UCSD during the academic year and for fellowship programs during the summer sessions. From personal experience during his own undergraduate career, Melville understands the value of these programs in shaping careers and has worked to continue these programs in his laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research and related material will be posted to Melville?s research web site (http://airsea.ucsd.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ocean wave breaking plays an important role in the dynamics, mass trsnsfer and thermodynamics of the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean. Whether it is limiting the height of ocean waves, transferring gases ( including CO2 and water vapor) and aerosols, mixing the upper ocean, or modulating heat transfer, breaking waves play a role. In this project we have used field expertiments, theoretical and numerical modeling, and the results of laboratory experiments, to investigate the fundamental kinematics and dynamics of breakiing waves that contribute to these processes.  Using field data, guided by a classical fluid dynamical argument regarding inertial dissipation of energy, we have shown that the statistics of wave breaking in the field can be scaled by dimensionless wave and wind variables. This result reduces much of the scatter in previous field measurements of breaking statistics. It also opens the way for combining laboratory and numerical models of individual breakers with the statistics from the field to develop improved models of the air-sea interaction processes mentioned above.  In a related piece of field work we developed a new technique using stereo infrared (IR) imagery of the ocean surface temperature field to measure surface waves and currents, and then applied a Helmholtz decomposition to separate the surface velocity field into waves and turbulence; overcoming the usual restrictions in separating waves and turbulence. This permitted a description of measurements of energy dissipation and turbulent mixing in the surface layers of the ocean.  In theoretical work, and again using classical fluid dynamics techniques, we have shown that the underlying vortical dynamics of breaking can be modeled by an impulsive forcing of the surface fluid that generates a surface jet and half vortex ring. This theory leads to a relationship between the energy dissipation due to breaking and its vortical description.  Using a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of breaking (solving the two-phase Navier Stokes equations) we have investigated the role of surface tension and wave steepness in determining the strength of brealing from plunging waves to very weak "breaking" that just generates parasitic capillary waves. Surprisingly, we found that our inertial scaling of the dissipation due to breaking applied across the whole range of breaking strengths, even including parasitic capillaries.  The DNS of breaking also permitted us to model air entrainment and the evolution of the bubble size distribution under breaking waves.We found agreement with the limuted data available and also proposed a model for the evolution based on bubble break-up and the relationship between the work done against buoyancy forces in entraining the air and the energy dissipated by the breaker.  The most recent result from the project combines the vortical model of breaking, confirmed by the DNS, to show that most of the energy dissipated by breaking waves is quickly dissipated locally rather than contributing to the generation of currents.  The avenues of research covered by this project have been very productive in beginning to find answers for some of the fundamental aspects of surface wave breaking that are important for air-sea interaction, and ultimately for improved models of weather and climate that depend so much on the role of the ocean.
