<AbstractNarration>People benefit from the activities of many species. Examples of these benefits, or ecosystem services, include controlling crop pests, pollinating food plants, and removing contaminants from water and soils. If a species lives where it provides an ecosystem service it may be relatively straightforward to link efforts to protect that species to the benefits that it provides. This linkage may be more difficult for migratory species, which may provide more benefits in one part of their geographic range. For example, some migratory bats overwinter in central Mexico and spend summers in US-Mexico borderlands where they consume pests that plague cotton crops. Cotton revenues are greater in the United States than in Mexico, so the value of ecosystem services provided by insect-eating bats may be greater in the US than in Mexico. Disparities in the value of ecosystem services provided in different locations may not reflect the importance of different habitats to the species providing those services. If people in an area that is critical to the species get no direct benefits, they may have few incentives to conserve critical habitat. Further, people in the area that reaps the most benefit may be getting a subsidy from people in the first location. This project will quantify these subsidies for migratory free-tailed bats and establish a framework for implementing a payment system that can incentivize habitat conservation in areas where the species provide less direct benefit to humans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project will include support for a junior female Hispanic faculty member, training of a minority postdoctoral researcher, mentoring of an undergraduate researcher, development of educational tools for use in an undergraduate class on ecosystem services, and development of a framework that should be useful to resource managers.</AbstractNarration>

And sometimes there is a mismatch between the areas where a species provides the benefits and the areas from which it receives support. This mismatch is called a spatial subsidy. Simply put, areas that support the species are subsidizing areas that receive the speciesÆ benefits. This can lead to an economic inequality&mdash;between persons in areas that subsidize the species versus persons in areas that receive the benefits&mdash;and to difficulties for wildlife management and habitat protection.  For example, there may be few incentives for persons to protect a speciesÆ supportive habitat if the benefits of doing so are received by persons elsewhere. A more equitable approach would be for the persons who receive the benefits to pay for all or some of the costs to protect the species and its critical habitats&mdash;even if those habitats are in distant location or across borders.  We examined the spatial subsidies of three migratory species, the Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana), Northern Pintail ducks (Anas acuta), and the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus).            Mexican free-tailed bats spend the winter in central and southern Mexico. Early each spring, females migrate north, forming large roosts in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.

We believe that accounting for spatial subsidies can aid conservation efforts for these bats by identifying, and protecting (through land purchases or easements), habitat areas that are most critical for their long-term ability to provide benefits.
