<AbstractNarration>Quantum information science has yielded deep theoretical insights into the nature of information and communication, while raising the hope of dramatically more capable computers and communication networks. But the achievement of these practical goals is hindered by the inherent fragility of quantum information. Traditional approaches for obtaining reliability through simple redundancy do not work; instead, fault tolerance must, and can, in principle, be obtained through subtler techniques that contrive to measure and correct errors without learning anything about the encoded data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately present methods for fault-tolerant quantum computation require significant overhead, and present understanding of quantum channel capacities remain very limited. For example, no quantum code is known on which arbitrary fault-tolerant quantum computation can be performed without leaving the code space. And only very recently was it discovered that classical information can be sent at rates exceeding the long-conjectured Holevo bound. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will attempt to develop new methods for reliable quantum communication and computation in the presence of noise. First, the research will push the capabilities and boundaries of quantum error-correction techniques, both by extending and delineating the types of correctable errors, and by determining the scenarios under which such error correction is or is not possible. The second goal is to develop the deep but heretofore largely unexplored connections between quantum codes, entanglement, and many-body physics, complexity theory, cryptography and high-dimensional geometry. The objective is to advance our understanding both of quantum codes as well as the related areas of mathematics, physics and computer science. Finally the team will seek to elucidate the subtle differences between quantum communication and its closest classical analog---private communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research endeavors to contribute definitively to realistic embodiments of large-scale quantum computers, which would dramatically improve mankind's ability to process and communicate information. And the research program itself is deeply interdisciplinary, bringing together physicists, computer scientists and mathematicians from industry and academia, and training students and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal discipline of this project is the theory of quantum information and computing.  This field seeks to map out the ultimate limits that quantum physics places on the speed, efficiency, and cost of information transmission and processing.  We focus especially on the role of noise in protocols, studying how to best overcome noise with error-correcting codes and design protocols that are robust to noise.  We have also studied the computational complexity of ground states of physical hamiltonians.  We have made progress on four distinct fronts:  1) Distinguishing Quantum States  A fundamental question in quantum information is how to determine whether a quantum system was prepared in one state or another.  A good classical analogy is the problem of determining whether a coin is either fair or has some bias towards heads or tails.  In the quantum setting this problem gets an additional wrinkle: measuring a system inevitably disturbs its state, so we must be judicious in our choice of measurement.  We made two breakthroughs in this question of quantum hypothesis testing: First, we quantified the rate at which an optimal measurement can drive the probability of error to zero in two-choice (binary) hypothesis tests.  Second, we found the optimal performance for *multiple* hypothesis testing, in which we must determine which of a large number of states our system has been prepared in.  These both have potential applications to designing optimal receivers and codes for transmitting classical information over quantum communication channels.  2) Quantum computation  We studied the theory of quantum computers which, if built, could solve some computational problems that are intractable on classical machines.  We studied two scenarios: First, we found a particular quantum algorithm that degrades gracefully when implemented with noisy gates.  This is important, since quantum computers will inevitably suffer from at least small amounts of noise.  Second, we initiated the study of hybrid classical-quantum computation in the form of virtual quantum bit. This involved finding strategies for using a small quantum computer (with, say, 100 qubits) to simulate having a slightly larger quantum computer (with, say, 101 qubits).     3) Complexity of ground states  Physical systems tend to relax to their lowest energy state.  It is therefore very interesting to understand the structure and properties of these "ground states".  In this direction, we have completed a characterization of the computational complexity of ground states of quantum Ising models.  We have also found a complete classification of one dimensional frustration free hamiltonians on two-level systems.  4) Quantum privacy and coherence  There is a tight but mysterious connection between privacy and quantum coherence and, by extension, entanglement.  Quantum coherence certainly implies privacy of information, but it has recently been discovered that there a quantum states which can supply perfect classical privacy but not quantum entanglement.  These touch on many intriguing phenomena, such as quantum superactivation, quantum data hiding, information locking, and more. We have discovered a situation that achieves the maximal separation between privacy and coherence, which sheds light on this fascinating question and points to new insights about the structure of quantum correlations.
