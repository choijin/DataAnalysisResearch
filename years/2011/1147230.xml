<AbstractNarration>Hierarchical statistical models allow estimation of patterns in complex biological data while accounting for relationships such as temporal or spatial patterns or shared sampling units.  A great variety of analysis algorithms for hierarchical models have been developed by statistical researchers but are unavailable to practitioners such as experimental or field biologists.  These include many types of Markov chain Monte Carlo, as well as sequential Monte Carlo, importance sampling, approximate Bayesian computation, and other numerical methods and approximations.  In addition, there are many higher-level algorithms that use these as components of methods for model selection, model averaging, maximum likelihood estimation, generating predictions, and more.  This project will involve development of an open source, extensible software environment for flexible composition of hierarchical models and algorithms.  The software will include low-level components in which algorithms will be executed for speed, high-level components in which algorithms can be composed and managed from the R statistical software environment, and middle-level components to interface the first two.  Many algorithms will be implemented and disseminated for application using the new software.  Moreover, it will provide a foundation for ongoing development and sharing of new and improved algorithms in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hierarchical statistical models are used in many domains of biology to provide robust conclusions and management guidance that harness all available data.  Areas of application include wildlife conservation and management, ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling, organismal growth and development, and cellular biochemical networks.  In all of these areas, biologists need to use complicated data to estimate the processes and rates of change occurring in their study system.  This project will provide a next generation of software to make available numerous algorithms to many researchers to achieve this goal.  These algorithms will facilitate research workflows by allowing researchers to extract the most information from their data in an efficient manner.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported development of software for computational statistical methods with general hierarchical models.  Many biological research studies involve samples from field locations near each other, or from the same location or organism at different times, or from related organisms, or from other kinds of non-independent study units.  Analysis of such data is complicated by the fact that the data are not all independent, and there may be many explanatory variables or experimental treatments of interest.  Hierarchical statistical models are commonly used as a way to account for such complicated relationships in a data set and thereby attain valid analysis results. Many of the methods to accomplish such analyses are highly computational, involving exploration of many combinations of unknown parameters that might explain the observed data.  The software developed in this project provides a new tool for accomplishing such analyses.  Previously existing packages were limited in the kinds of algorithms they provide to users, as well as limited in their flexibility to be used and extended in new ways.  This project led to development of software that allows such models and methods to be more easily programmed and extended, allowing more efficient and flexible application by users.  The NIMBLE software package is an R package that includes three major components: a new implementation of the BUGS language for writing hierarchical statistical models; a domain-specific language embedded within R for programming algorithms to use with hierarchical models; and an algorithm library including methods for Markov chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo, and Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization, among others.  The package also includes a compiler for models and algorithms that generates and manages C++ code for each model and algorithm.  Together these components enable both applied statisticians and developers of new methods to easily implement and disseminate new analyses and methods.
