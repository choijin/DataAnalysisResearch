<AbstractNarration>The Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) was formed from the merger of three telescope arrays supported by the Division of Astronomical Science's University Radio Observatories (URO) Program: Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) array  of six 10.4-meter-diameter telescopes, the Berkeley Illinois Maryland Association (BIMA) array of nine 6.1-meter-diameter telescopes, and the University of Chicago's Sunyaev-Zeldovitch Array of eight 3.5-meter-diameter telescopes. CARMA currently achieves resolutions as high as 0.2 arcseconds at a wavelength of 1mm and, due to its heterogeneous combination of telescope diameters, provides excellent imaging over a wide range of angular scales.  Science enabled by CARMA covers a broad range of astronomical topics, including star formation and molecular clouds, studies of external galaxies, and the investigation of solar system objects. CARMA is a pathfinder for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and a pipeline for training experts in the field of millimeter interferometry to take full advantage of ALMA's capabilities for US astronomy.   Users outside the CARMA collaboration receive 30% of all observing time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work covered by grant no,1140031 consists of three distinct projects.  The first project, using a technique known as intensity mapping, seeks to detect the emission of the CO molecule at high redshift.  The CO molecule is a tracer of the much more abundant H2 molecule  which cannot be directly detected but is important  because  it is the raw material from which stars are formed. We have sought to look for this gas at high redshift z~ 3 because it tells us something about the star formation when the universe was young. At the large distances of galaxies at z=3, individual galaxies are too faint to be directly detected, However, Intensity mapping makes it possible to detect the volume-averaged emission from an ensemble of galaxies. This technique makes it possible to detect the CO at a redshift  that is too large for the detection of individual galaxies but allows the gas from an ensemble defined by the telescope and instrumentation to be detected. Although no CO was detected with the present observations, our data put important upper limits to the molecular gas at high redshift ruling out some theories of galaxy formation  The second project determined the radial dark matter distributions of a sample of dwarf galaxies by measuring their rotation curves  using the CO molecule, Dwarf galaxies are used because  they are known  to be dark matter dominated. The rotation curve is a  measure of the orbital motion of the gas as a function of distance from the galactic center,  Certain simulations  of structure formation in the universe predict that the radial distribution of dark matter in galaxies should have a particular universal form ( i.e. cuspy) which can be measured by the rotation curves  close to the galactic centers. First, though, one needs to measure the radial contribution of the ordinary matter to the rotation curves by measuring the distribution of the most massive component: the stars. Then one  determines the  rotation curve due to the stars and subtracts it from the measured rotation curve, which is due to the total matter in the galaxies.  We were able to get good rotation curves for fourteen galaxies.  This allowed us to determine the slope of the rotation curves close to the center,   We found that there is a wide variety of slopes (both cuspy and flat) which contradicts the expectation of some of the simulations.    The third project is part of a collaboration with the CALIFA survey, an optical IFU survey of hundreds of galaxies done at  the Calar Alto observatory.  We made observations in CO of 180 CALIFA galaxies  with the CARMA Array, which has allowed us to compare data from both the gas and the stars at the same resolution.  The combined CALIFA and BIMA observations allow us to compare quantities such as star formation rates, molecular gas depletion times, metallicities, extinction, etc. which has not been possible before with such a large sample.  In fact, the CARMA observations are the largest interferometric  CO survey of galaxies in existence.  Using the combined surveys, we have been able to show that the molecular gas depletion time does depend on environment.       Last Modified: 10/30/2017       Submitted by: Leo Blitz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
