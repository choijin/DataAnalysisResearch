<AbstractNarration>This RUI award funds the research activities of Professor Tonnis ter Veldhuis at Macalester College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The start of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operations promises a wealth of new experimental data in the near future. This data is expected to contain important clues that will guide physicists in their quest to solve the puzzle of how Nature functions at ever-smaller scales. The objective of this research program is to design ways in which this new data can be used in order to test and further develop physical theories that have been constructed to explain how elementary particles obtain their mass. The class of theories to be considered includes those that employ supersymmetry, a new symmetry hypothesized to exist in order to explain how large differences in physical scales can be stable in the presence of quantum corrections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parts of this RUI research program will be carried out in collaboration with students at Macalester College. The project will therefore create significant research training in the field of particle physics for undergraduate students. Through their research experience, participating students will develop a toolbox of valuable research skills that are widely applicable, and in particular form an excellent foundation to further pursue a career in theoretical or experimental particle physics in graduate school. The project thus serves as a model for the integration of teaching and research in the environment of a physics and astronomy department at a liberal arts college.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The field of elementary particle physics saw great progress during the lifetime of the grant. The Higgs boson was experimentally discovered by the Atlas and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012. This breakthrough provided further support for the Standard Model of elementary particle physics and the minimal implementation of electroweak symmetry breaking, the mechanism that provides mass to particles.  The research supported by the grant has incrementally contributed to the evolving understanding of particle physics at the fringes of the Standard Model, by interpreting new experimental data to shine light on what is still unknown, and by constructing mathematical models to reflect observed particle properties and interactions.  Specific progress was made in two areas: an improved understanding of the spectrum of masses of particles associated with dynamical symmetry breaking was obtained by applying the duality between strongly interacting gauge theories and weakly interacting gravitational theories, and a better appreciation of the viability of the minimal extension of the Standard Model that accommodates both dark matter and cosmic inflation was gained by a combination of numerical and analytical methods.  Five undergraduate students collaborated on the project, supported by the grant and additional funding from Macalester College. Through their research experience, these students gained disciplinary expertise in the specific realm of elementary particle physics, but also more generally applicable, transferable skills in computation, statistical data analysis, project documentation and management, and communication. Of the three undergraduate collaborators who have graduated at this time, two have enrolled in premier physics graduate programs to further develop careers in theoretical elementary particle physics, while the third entered the workforce in a promising position at a petroleum industry engineering and construction firm.
