<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 May 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1122952&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution&lt;br/&gt;PI:   R. Trask&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests 5 years of support (2011-2015) for the oceanographic Wire Pool managed by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).  This facility is necessary to properly support federally-funded oceanographic research aboard vessels in the US Academic Research Vessel Fleet (www.unols.org).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The Wire Pool provides "the essential link between a surface vessel and specific area of interest [to science] in the deep ocean."  Wire ropes and cables support a wide variety of instrumentation and sampling devices throughout the Academic Research Vessel Fleet from standard equipment such as corers and CTD's to advanced systems from the National Deep Submergence Facility like the DSL-120A to the JASON II ROV.  Maintaining a centralized wire pool that supervises appropriate distribution has proven to be an efficient and cost-effective system that optimizes the availability of oceanographic cables and wire ropes to ships and science as they arise.</AbstractNarration>
