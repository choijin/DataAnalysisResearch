<AbstractNarration>This award will support an observational program to compare various techniques for the determination of ages in several nearby star clusters.  Currently, a number of different techniques are used for cluster ages, and they each suffer from various random and systematic errors that limit their use for finding absolute (as opposed to relative) ages.  This group will investigate the accuracy and size of errors for four different techniques:  (1) comparison of stellar data against theoretical models, (2) the mass-dependence of lithium abundances, (3) the decline of rotation rates with time, and (4) the relation between age and magnetic activity.  The goal is to assess the accuracy of each technique and understand how to translate ages from one technique to the age scale from the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improvements in the accuracy of stellar ages should have broad implications for understanding the history&lt;br/&gt;of stellar populations and the evolution of our Milky Way Galaxy.  This project will provide many research opportunities for undergraduate students, especially through an ongoing partnership with Fisk College.  The data from this project will also be used as calibrating data for future telescope surveys.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All stars rotate, just as the earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours. In general, young stars rotate faster, and as a star ages, its rotation becomes slower and slower. Thus, the rotation speed of a star can be used to provide a clue as to what its age might be.  This technique has been used successfully to determine the ages of stars in a number of different star clusters with a range of ages, as it is especially powerful when the rotation of a whole population of similarly-aged stars can be observed.  However, determining the ages of very young stars is more difficult; at young ages, a star may still show a stronger influence of the conditions under which it formed.  And finding the ages of individual stars is always more challenging than finding the ages of star clusters.   In this research, we have examined the rotation speeds of some of the youngest stars (particularly those with masses less than the Sun, and ages of 1 to 200 million years), to see how their rotation speeds correlate with what we know of these stars' ages determined using other diagnostics. We have found that these stars all rotate relatively quickly, and we find that in fact their rotation speeds do not give a clear indication of the stars' ages. This does not invalidate the overall use of rotation speed as a means of determining stellar ages; it simply means that this tool is not applicable to the youngest stars, which have not yet had time to slow down enough for us to detect the change in their rotation.   This work also had the broader impact of training several women undergraduate students in computer programming, image processing, data analysis, and both written and oral scientific communication.
