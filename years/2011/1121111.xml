<AbstractNarration>This proposal is implementing, testing and disseminating new classroom materials for the Introduction to Materials course within the engineering curriculum. These new materials use an active learning, team-based approach based on a pedagogical method from chemistry, called Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). Rather than sitting in traditional lectures, students work in teams to complete worksheets that guide them through the process of learning. Students are actively engaged in processing information and have the opportunity to use and develop important skills such as teamwork, communication, and critical thinking. The POGIL worksheets for materials science, developed in a prior NSF grant (DUE-0633073),  contain the following components: 1) a model or data set that illustrates a particular concept; 2) guided inquiry questions that guide the students to process the model or data and lead them to an understanding of the concept; and 3) exercises and problems that allow them to practice using the concept. These worksheets are being used at four institutions that represent different contexts for their implementation: a large public research university; a medium-sized public Master's degree granting comprehensive university; an HBCU; and a private liberal arts university. Multiple cycles of implementation occur at each site, and the faculty participants work within a community of users through annual project meetings, participation in regional POGIL meetings, and interaction through an electronic discussion board. The effects of POGIL relative to traditional instruction and the different implementation contexts are determined using both formative and summative assessments. These assessment activities include evaluation of learning and implementation goals set by the students and faculty, focus group discussions of implementation, and quantitative assessment of student learning, student perceptions of learning, and community building among the faculty members.  The intellectual merit of this project focuses on the implementation and evaluation of this new set of research-based classroom activities for both faculty implementation and student performance. The broader impacts that result from this project include the dissemination of these broadly tested materials for use at other institutions and on the initial development of an extensive community of users.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>It is well known that active learning techniques, such as the flipped classroom, lead to improved outcomes over lecture-based classes. It has been reported that students can see significant gains in content knowledge, as well as development of professional skills such as teamwork and communication. However, most of these studies have occurred in settings in which the implementation was well-defined. Actual use of active learning techniques can vary considerably depending on the skill, motivation, and training of the instructor. Thus it is important to understand how variation in implementation may affect student outcomes. Our study investigated this issue for an approach known as Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). In a POGIL class students learn the content through worksheets which guide them through questions leading to an understanding of the material. The students work in groups and the instructor acts as a facilitator, answering questions and probing to ensure understanding. Our study utilized POGIL in an introductory materials engineering class in four different institutions. Faculty were allowed to implement POGIL in any way they wanted. A test, the Materials Concept Inventory, was used to determine how much the students learned in the class, and the results were compared to a lecture class at each institution. Course materials and students&rsquo; written reflections were analyzed to understand how POGIL was implemented and how that implementation affected student outcomes. In general it was found that the use of POGIL leads to statistically significant but small gains in scores on the Materials Concept Inventory. However, student reflections suggest that the importance of using POGIL may not necessarily be in learning of content knowledge but the learning of professional skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. However, a more specific evaluation of those skills would be needed to confirm this conjecture. It was also noted that the benefits of POGIL depend greatly on the manner and skill with which it is implemented by the instructor. Although all instructors attended POGIL training the implementation was still uneven, suggesting that a single workshop is not sufficient. Rather, ongoing communication and interaction may be needed. Overall, our results provide initial guidance into the support instructors need to implement active learning.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Nancy&nbsp;Ruzycki</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
