<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Richard van Duyne of Northwestern University and his postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student researchers will be supported to continue their investigations of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).  Prof. Van Duyne and his research group will work on: (1) developing single-molecule SERS (SMSERS) and applying it to electrochemical measurements and (2) conducting fundamental studies of surface-enhanced femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy.  Professor Van Duyne will continue his wide-ranging activities in education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a molecular species is adsorbed to a metal surface with high curvature, there is a large enhancement of the Raman scattering.  Prof. Van Duyne and other scientists are interested in understanding the mechanism for this enhancements and using it as a means of improving the detection of chemical species in low concentration.  Already, plasmonic sensors have been developed for medical diagnostics and the detection of chemical warfare agents. The goal of work like this is to build more sensitive chemical detectors.  The students working on this project will gain useful experience in developing cutting-edge analytical spectroscopy tools as well as developing a firm understanding of the chemistry and physics behind the SERS effect.  As part of this work, Prof. Van Duyne will continue his broad-ranging efforts in education, and he will continue in his efforts at encouraging students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  Intellectual Merit:  The scientific efforts supported by this grant primarily focus on single molecule (SM) detection and ultrafast time resolution. The keystone of this research is Raman spectroscopy which is the study of the interactions between molecules and light. The light scattered by any molecule is a unique fingerprint, allowing us to determine the identity and monitor the exact shape of that molecule.  By placing the molecules of interest near nanoscopic coinage metal surfaces unbelievable enhancement of the Raman scattered light can occur.  Oscillations in the conduction band electrons of the metal nanoparticles (plasmons) can increase the signal by as much as 100 million times.  This enhancement is large enough to allow us to resolve single-molecules.  A major dream of chemistry is to observe the reaction of a single molecule on the timescale of that reaction, a dream that motivates our development of surface-enhanced ultrafast spectroscopy.  With the support of this grant we have developed new substrates and new models for constructing highly enhancing surface-enhance Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates.  We have proven the existence of single-molecule SERS on lithographically fabricated 2D substrates and applied SMSERS to the study of nanoscale thermometry.  In ultrafast spectroscopy we have investigated the effect of plasmon energy on vibrational line-shapes, as well as the effect of plasmon-molecule coupling on the molecular vibrational coherence lifetime.  Fundamental studies exploring the particle damage mechanism and development of new substrates for femtosecond studies have also been performed.  Additionally, tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) studies have been supported as part of this project since they align well with the goal of single-molecule resolution and femtosecond time resolution.  Brief Summary of Outcomes:  Single molecule detection is possible by SERS. Through support of this grant, we have achieved SM sensitivity on reproducible, lithographically made substrates in lieu of the more traditional, highly polydisperse substrates.  These alternative substrates provide a reproducible platform for SM detection. Further efforts to improve the reliability of SM detection by SERS have involved refining how we prove a single molecule is being detected versus multiple molecules. Lastly, we were able to evaluate the possibility of SMs acting as thermometers for nanoscale temperature measurements. These studies have enabled SM detection to become more reproducible and open the door for new and interesting experiments.  Additional efforts for SERS have focused on developing a new type of large area substrate with amazing single enhancement. Furthermore, our work was successful in expanding the application of SERS to molecules that do not adsorb to coinage metal surfaces by creating a new class of substrates covered with metal-organic frameworks.  Ultrafast time resolution is achievable by a technique called femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy.  Our group applied surface enhancement to this technique and thus developed surface-enhanced femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (SE-FSRS).   SE-FSRS was a major thrust of the scientific effort supported by this grant.  Our group used this technique to prove that plasmonic nanoparticles are coupled to adsorbed molecules by the appearance of Fano-like lineshapes in the Raman spectra.  These Fano features were shown to arise from an interaction of narrowband vibrational coherences and the broadband resonance of the plasmon.  We also investigated the effect of plasmon-molecule coupling on the molecular vibrational coherence lifetime, resulting in lifetimes that indicate little correlation between vibrational coherence dephasing time and coupling of molecular vibration to the plasmon.  Our group has taken further steps towards developing our understanding of the damage mechanism that prevents signal acquisitio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
