<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology.  The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Luisa Cacheaux is "Characterizing changes in calcium channel protein synthesis and its effects on neuronal excitability." The host institution for this research is University of Texas at Austin and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Kimberly Raab-Graham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental property of neurons thought to underlie learning and memory is their ability to alter the strength of their connections with one another. One way by which these connections are strengthened or weakened is by altering the synthesis of new proteins at synapses, the junctions between neurons. There are several proteins that serve as regulators of this process including a protein kinase that is known as the mammalian target of rapamycin and is symbolized as mTOR.  This protein plays an important role in the control of cell growth and proliferation. The functioning of mTOR is not fully understood and the goal of the proposed research plan is to identify targets of mTOR and determine the general mechanism by which it alters protein synthesis. There is preliminary data indicating that a calcium channel protein is a likely target.  Calcium channels play an important role in determining neuronal excitability and therefore characterizing interacting proteins at the synapse advances understanding of how local protein synthesis changes neuronal excitability and ultimately learning and memory processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include the acquisition of new laboratory techniques in molecular biology including advanced microscopy techniques and calcium imaging.  Career development activities include improving writing and public speaking skills. Broader impacts of this project include a plan to mentor undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups as well as scientific outreach to the community.</AbstractNarration>
