<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research award is given to support broadening participation in the Mudd Design Workshop series that advances engineering design education.  Travel supplements are awarded to allow participation by faculty from under-represented groups or who serve at minority serving institutions, and research on the effectiveness of design workshops on changing how design is taught will be conducted.  By broadening participation in the workshops, the engineering design education community may become more able to develop engineering design courses to be more effective to a broader range of schools and students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the technical infrastructure on which we depend has been designed by engineers.  Design is a critical element of educating future engineers; the ability to design new products, services, and processes is a key engineering skill that is much needed to move to an innovation-driven economy.  The Mudd Design Workshops have brought together design education practitioners to network, share best practices, and share advances in teaching design practices to engineering students.  This award will help to understand the impact this workshop series has played in driving design education, as well as broaden participation to a wider range of students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mudd Design Workshop VIII was held May 26-28, 2011, at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California. This was the eighth biennial Workshop and featured "Innovation and Entrepreneurship" as a theme. The Workshop was organized and hosted by Clive L. Dym, the Fletcher Jones Professor of Engineering Design at Harvey Mudd College, with the assistance of an organizing committee of distinguished educators and practitioners.  Eighty-five individuals from US institutions and abroad attended the Workshop and participated in Workshop sessions on innovation and entrepreneurship and their intersection with the undergraduate engineering curriculum. Grant funding from the National Science Foundation was used specifically to support the participation of younger faculty and graduate students, including especially women and members of underrepresented minorities, and for assessment of the Mudd Design Workshop series.  Participants who were contacted as part of the assessment commented favorably on the Workshops' organization and thematic content:  Participants valued opportunities to meet with other design faculty and professionals in an informal setting with many opportunities for discussion. The Workshops have been a productive forum for ideas to enrich design curricula and teaching methods at colleges and universities. Participants commented on the value of attending an academic conference at which faculty and students as well as junior and more senior professionals could meet as peers and share ideas and experience.   The Mudd Design Workshop VIII proceedings appeared in a special issue of the International Journal of Engineering Education, "Design Education: Innovation and Entrepreneurship," Clive L. Dym (Guest Editor), vol. 28, no. 2, February 2012.          Last Modified: 05/16/2013       Submitted by: Clive L Dym]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
