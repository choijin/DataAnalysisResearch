<AbstractNarration>This award is for continuation of the development of the Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER). The focus of PAPER is the statistical detection of HI 21-cm signals from the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) during cosmic reionization, an event corresponding to the transition from a fully neutral IGM to a highly ionized IGM caused by the UV radiation from the first stars and supermassive black holes. Probing this last unexplored phase of cosmic evolution has been called out by the Astro2010 Decade Survey as the primary area with extraordinary discovery potential in the study of cosmic structure formation, and this constitutes the main intellectual impact of this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the previous award period, under AST-0804508 and AST-0804523, PAPER established observing sites with 32 antenna elements at both NRAO Green Bank and in the Karoo Desert of South Africa.  The current proposal will expand the SA deployment of PAPER to 128 elements and will support on-going observations and analysis using both the GB and SA deployments.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the program include advancement of techniques in low frequency radio astronomy, and a strong educational emphasis through training of graduate students and postdocs.    The project is a major stepping stone toward a future Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), as recommended by A2010.   PAPER has directed fabrication funds where possible to local small businesses, thus providing economic stimulus in the US.  Outreach activities have included a number of public talks on the project by graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) was an interferometric array  experiment to extend our understanding of the state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EOR).  During this period, the universe transitioned from a fully neutral IGM to a highly ionized IGM as a result of radiation from the first stars and supermassive black holes.  PAPER was designed to make a statistical detection of the coeval neutral hydrogen gas, or to at least present new limiting conditions on its state. The PAPER project took a carefully staged approach to engineering and data analysis.  On the engineering side, we optimized each component in the array to mitigate, at the outset, any potentially debilitating problems in subsequent data calibration and analysis. Due to the staged build-out of the instrument, each observing season allowed us to refine data analysis techniques and apply "lessons learned" to subsequent observations.  A key goal was the demonstration of a robust technique for suppressing astrophysical and terrestrial foreground emission by some 4 - 5 orders of magnitude in flux in order to reach the faint reionization signal.  The final construction goal of this project was a 128-element array taking data for at least one observing season, which was achieved.  This project progressively expanded the PAPER instrument deployed in South Africa from 32 antennas (2011-12) to 64 antennas (2012-2013), and finally to 128 antennas (2013-2015).  Accomplishing this expansion required manufacturing, shipping, and deploying antennas, ground reflectors, low-noise active baluns, cables, and receiver modules.  It also required developing, testing, and deploying a 64-input correlator (2012), with an F-engine based on FPGA signal processing hardware developed in coordination with the Center for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER), and a novel X-engine based on GPU hardware exchanging data using switched 10 Gb ethernet packets.  In 2013, this correlator was expanded to support 128 dual-polarization inputs.  This final scope of the instrument hardware was approximately a factor of 2 larger than the single polarization instrument originally envisioned.  The expansion was deemed necessary because of new concerns that had arisen relating to polarization leakage in our interferometric data product.  Specific objectives for this proposal included successfully deploying and collecting data with 64- and 128-antenna deployments of PAPER, developing a mitigation strategy for dealing with bright astrophysical foregrounds, determining key principles for the design of an instrument targeting the 21cm reionization signal, and analyzing data to detect or constrain the 21cm power spectrum.  Major progress was made on all of these fronts.  PAPER was successfully expanded and conducted observations on schedule.    We developed a delay-spectrum approach to isolating foregrounds from the 21cm reionization signal and combined this approach with the optimal quadratic estimation formalism established by Liu &amp; Tegmark (MNRAS 2009) .  We discovered a fundamental relationship between the size and spacing of elements in an interferometer and the power spectrum modes of reionization that become corrupted by foregrounds.  On this basis of this relationship, we reconfigured the PAPER array into a compact grid that improved PAPER's calibration through redundancy and improved the ultimate sensitivity of the array while isolating foregrounds from the 21cm reionization signal.  Finally, we published a series of papers successively improving constraints on the 21cm power spectrum of reionization as well as technique papers on the methods.  PAPER's currently provides the deepest EOR HI constraint and additional data are being processed to extend it.  These development have led to a larger collaboration to build the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which is ongoing.
