<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1105700, Principal Investigator: Michael Usher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a variety of methods, mostly arising from Floer theory, to study questions relating to Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of symplectic manifolds.  The goals of the project include: expanding the class of manifolds for which the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group (or its universal cover) is known to admit Calabi quasi-morphisms; investigating global geometric questions about Hofer's metrics on the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group and on spaces of Lagrangian submanifolds (for instance, when do these spaces have infinite diameter?); and developing a new family of relative symplectic capacities that are constructed by using Floer theory in a novel way. To achieve this, the PI will make use of tools coming from the natural real-valued filtrations on Floer complexes, including the well-established Oh-Schwarz spectral invariants and also a newer invariant, the boundary depth, that was first introduced by the principal investigator in 2009.  An auxiliary goal of the project is to obtain a better understanding of the behavior of these two useful invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of symplectic manifolds can be used to mathematically model those classical physical systems in which energy is conserved.  Thus they are relevant in the study of a very wide range of phenomena, from the motion of planets and satellites (with potential applications to lower-cost space mission planning) to the flow of turbulent fluids. A remarkable geometric structure on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold was discovered by Hofer over 20 years ago; despite much effort some basic aspects of this geometry remain poorly understood.  Much of this project is aimed at obtaining new results about Hofer's geometry, and at clarifying how the behavior of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold is related to other properties of the manifold.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded research into the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold, primarily but not exclusively using tools from filtered Floer theory.  Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms are a very general type of geometric transformation that describe how a physical system such as the solar system or a turbulent fluid evolves according to the laws of classical mechanics.  In the 1990's it was discovered that the entire group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold carries a rigid geometric structure (the "Hofer metric"), and much of the work supported by the award concerned this structure.  In particular the project showed that, for many symplectic manifolds, the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms is, from a coarse-geometric perspective, very "large" with respect to the Hofer metric, in the sense that it extends infinitely far in infinitely many independent directions.  Complementing this, various results established during the project illustrated the point that a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism which is small with respect to the Hofer metric can still have a substantial effect: for instance, many subsets of symplectic manifolds have the property that, if they can be moved to some new position by any Hamiiltonian diffeomorphism, then they can be moved there by a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism which, in the Hofer metric sense, is arbitrarily small.  Another notable result of the award was the construction of the first example of a Lagrangian submanifold of a compact symplectic manifold satisfying a technical condition called monotonicity that can be moved completely off of itself by a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism.  In addition to finding new consequences of filtered Floer theory for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, the project also developed the foundations of this theory in novel ways.  Some of the results described above were a consequence of an improved understanding of the "boundary depth," a filtered-Floer theoretic invariant that had been constructed earlier by the PI.  Late in the award, this boundary depth as well as other filtered Floer-theoretic tools were brought under the umbrella of a different invariant called a "barcode."  This notion is borrowed from persistent homology, a tool that originally developed in topological data analysis.  A 2015 paper supported by the award provides the foundations for extending barcodes to Floer theory, and explains how previous Floer-theoretic invariants are reflected inside the barcode, while the barcode also provides new information.  A simple application involving robustness of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms already appears in that paper, and further applications are currently in development.  The award supported the training and development of young mathematicians in various ways.  Some of the projects described above were joint work between the PI and his graduate students, and served as part of their doctoral theses.  The PI also was active in organize graduate summer schools and other conferences oriented toward young mathematicians throughout the award.
