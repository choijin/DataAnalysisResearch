<AbstractNarration>Measurements of the solar neutrino spectrum have already yielded unexpected results of fundamental importance and, as these measurements improve, new results promise to be equally revealing. Neutrino oscillations, coupled with the MSW mechanism, are required to explain the observed neutrino fluxes at Earth. This solution allows an interesting region between vacuum- and matter-enhanced oscillations where additional new physics can be probed. Likewise, recent solar abundance measurements have created conflicts between the Standard Solar Model and helioseismology results, which are most sensitively resolved by measurement of the CNO neutrino flux. Significantly, there also remains the question whether the luminosity of the sun, as determined by photons, accurately matches the luminosity as determined by neutrinos. In this case, a direct measurement of the pp neutrinos is also required. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for this group to continue their participation in the science arena of Borexino in the underground laboratory at Gran Sasso, Italy as the collaboration focuses on measuring the Beryllium-7 neutrino flux. The group actively participated and provided expert manpower to Borexino purification efforts. Results from the first pass of purification have been very successful, and when completed in the coming year, Borexino looks well poised to provide meaningful measurements of the CNO and pep fluxes as well. Future possibilities include measurements of the pp neutrino flux with the LENS experiment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide excellent training of, and experience for, the students and postdocs who work in the program as well as potential applications of these technologies outside of the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Borexino is a large (300 ton) liquid-scintillator neutrino observatory located deep underground in the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso.  The physics program is multi-faceted, and has been on the cover of Science, written about in Nature, was an "NSF Highlight," produced one of the "Top 10 Physics Breakthroughs in 2014," and most recently was honored by its spokesperson winning the 2016 Pontecorvo Prize in Physics.  It is arguably the world?s most radio-pure large-scale detector, contributing world-class results in the fields of solar neutrino spectroscopy, natural and man-made antineutrinos originating from the Earth?s interior, rare processes (supernovas, Beyond Standard Model processes), and radioactive-source-produced neutrinos to search for sterile neutrinos.  This award allowed Virginia Tech to provide internal calibration of the detector, and long-term monitoring of the detector parameters.  The thesis work of three graduate students was completed and a score of undergraduates trained.  The doctoral work was also central to expanding the physics program to an ultimate goal of measuring the elusive CNO solar neutrinos and the consequent resolution of competing claims regarding solar metallicity.  The detector is a large ultra-pure (the equivalent of 10 micrograms of dust in 300 tons of liquid) scintillation detector which detects neutrinos from fusion in the Sun by neutrino-electron scattering.  The scattered electrons produce a small number of photons which are detected by inward looking photomultiplier tubes mounted on a 6.5 m radius sphere, allowing event position and energy reconstruction.  There are two very large thin concentric nylon vessels used to prevent radon from diffusing into the very central soft-ware defined ?fiducial? region.  The large phototube mounting sphere is itself contained in a larger water shield.  An additional novel outcome of this grant is a technique to passively and actively stabilize convective currents in the detector which will allow us to measure the Bi-210 background dominating the CNO neutrino region of the electron recoil spectra.  Large open volumes are indeed very difficult to stabilize and model on the time scale of several hundred days, as is required.  No other neutrino experiment has even begun to reach this low a background and long a stability requirement.  A credible numerical modeling of the detector liquid motion via a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach was undertaken to investigate thermal-fluid dynamical behavior at different conditions.  The results are guiding efforts to obtain the best possible background conditions in the detector.  The hope is to enable the first-ever measurement of an elusive but critical component in the solar neutrino spectrum: CNO neutrinos, with far-ranging impacts in astrophysics: stellar evolution and consequent implications for planet formation.  Experiments with solar neutrinos gave the first evidence for neutrino mass and mixing. The Borexino experiment has recently made the first real-time measurement of the flux of low-energy solar neutrinos from Be-7. The result is consistent with predictions of Standard Solar Models and neutrino oscillations. With better purity and calibration now achieved, the potential for measuring the CNO and pep solar neutrino fluxes in Borexino is now realistic.  The broader impact on science, technology and outreach that is expected from the program includes deployment and utilization of ultra-clean calibration techniques and creating the possibility that, for the first time, one might directly measure the Sun?s energy generation today using neutrinos, versus what is currently seen via the photosphere after a delay of about 50,000 years. The outreach is to astrophysicists, cosmologists, geophysicists and geochemists, chemists and chemical engineers, teachers and students in universities in Virginia and neighboring states and the international scientific community.
