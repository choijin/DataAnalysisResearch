<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Associate Prof. Anne Johansen of Central Washington University (CWU).  Dr. Johansen and her research group will study the chemical mechanisms linking physico-chemical properties of collected atmospheric ultrafine particles (ยกร 100 nm, UFP) to their environmental reactivity and physiological toxicity.  Two main particle characteristics are investigated: (i) the content of redox-active, or bioavailable iron, and (ii) the degree of particle surface carbon oxidation.  In addition, the presence of potential electron donors in the surrounding matrix will be evaluated.  By using model soot and real UFPs, mechanisms will be identified and their relative significance assessed in biologically and environmentally relevant conditions.  Research will be conducted at CWU and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory User Facility (EMSL) with the aid of custom-made and state-of-the-art instruments.  These analytical capabilities will enable the generation of novel results that are likely to increase current understanding of the reactivity and transformation of carbonaceous particles in a variety of settings.  An important educational component of this study is the effective training of undergraduate students from a primarily undergraduate institution located in a rural setting such as CWU.  A large number of underrepresented minority students will gain experimental, critical thinking and communication skills through their hands-on work while collaborating with scientists from the nearby National Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Soot emitted from the incomplete combustion of fossil and biomass fuels adversely affects human health and disrupts natural processes in the atmosphere, soil and waters.  Yet, significant gaps exist in the detailed mechanisms and particle characteristics that control these reactions.  To increase our current understanding, benchtop experiments were performed mimicking biological and environmental conditions involving model and real soot particles while determining their oxidative reactivity in the context of physical and chemical properties.  Results indicate that (i) the total transition metal content, and (ii) an exposed carbon containing particle core, devoid of surface organic molecules, increases particle oxidative capacity that leads to oxidative stress in cellular systems. In the environmental context, soot facilitates a slow dark reduction of ferric (Fe(III)) to ferrous iron (Fe(II)), latter of which plays an important role in the bioavailability of iron and generation of further oxidative species.   In the presence of light, however, soot inhibits the well-known production of Fe(II) and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of naturally occurring organic acids.  All work was performed by primarily undergraduate (18) and a few MS students (3), many of whom are minority and first-generation from rural WA.  Students received valuable hands-on experiences on cutting-edge instrumentation at CWU and user facilities Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory (EMSL) at PNNL and Molecular Analytical Facilities (MAF) at University of Washington.  In addition, students disseminated their own works at regional and national conferences. Finally, this project facilitated a number of community outreach activities, including the yearly engagement of AP Environmental Sciences students from Ellensburg High School through student driven research projects using personal air quality monitors, the PI?s participation in the Kittitas County Air Quality Committee?s and WA Department of Ecology?s efforts to control local air pollution sources, and presentations to the general public.
