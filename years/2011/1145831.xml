<AbstractNarration>This is a small EAGER project to explore alpine cairn structures that exist in Southeast Alaska and which have been described in the historic record as early as the Russian contact period.  Because of the focus on coastal migration theories of early peopling of North American and the development of social complexity among the coastal tribes, no previous research has been done to understand the construction or prehistoric context of these cairn structures that are quite numerous in the region.  This project would support the research team to do preliminary testing of an alpine cairn and will allow PIs to travel to consult and coordinate their research with the tribal communities of Sitka and Angoon on whose traditional territories the project would take place.</AbstractNarration>

What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?   The goal of 2011 project was to inform governmental entities about a proposed project and receive feedback from those entities with regard to cultural and legal concerns.

The intent of the project was to broaden the participation of two ethnic groups, the Sitka Tlingit and the Kootsnoowoo Tlingit in a pilot archaeological project to be proposed to the NSF the following year. To this end, the project will hire liaisons and student crew members appointed by each tribe. As well, the inclusion of oral history in the project design will provide an opportunity for tribal members to bring cultural information to the attention of the investigators, information that may be useful for interpreting any archaeological data collected. Finally, the proposed project will foster integration of research and education by including graduate students and student tribal members. It will also be accomp...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
