<AbstractNarration>CBET-1153476&lt;br/&gt;PI: Frankel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort will initiate the development of a transformative calibration method for estimating surface heat flux in highly hostile thermal environments without requiring surface instrumentation. This concept has substantive merit for investigating: a) the effectiveness of thermal protection systems associated hypersonic flight vehicles or for understanding thermal efficiencies in hypersonic combustors; b) heat transfer on unreachable surface structures such as found in combustion liners, small chambers, and containment walls as a result of a hostile thermal event; and, c) heat transfer on structures emanating from pool fires or explosions. A comprehensive method is proposed that integrates physical, experimental, mathematical and computational principles.  The resulting analytic formulation implicitly possesses full-sensor characterization, probe positioning, host material thermophysical properties, diffusion physics, and mathematical constants required for stable and accurate surface heat flux predictions. The new calibration method leads to a Volterra integral equation of the first kind; and, thus the coupon or specimen can be interpreted as a transducer ready for practical implementation. Further analytical and computational study is required for real-world implementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal centers about critical applications for new material development involving high temperature environments.   Responsive state-of-the-art accurate methods for estimating surface heat flux and temperature that includes sensor characterization still requires resolution for many applications involving highly hostile environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research effort will impact aerospace, energy, fire, combustion, geophysical, defense and national security research and developments in a timely and responsive manner.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  EAGER: Application of Calibration Convolution Integrals to Diffusion Transport   PIÃ†s: Jay Frankel and Majid Keyhani   University of Tennessee Knoxville   Award Number: 1153476  A transformative technology has been demonstrated that accurately predicts surface heat fluxes without requiring surface instrumentation.  The methodology has recently been experimentally verified in the context of low temperature applications. This present study expands the analytical tools to a new level of significance as we now include large temperature variations in the analysis for one-dimensional geometries.  Benefits to the proposed approach include:  The method is a significant improvement to the process of inverse projections. The method enables increased accuracy and quick response for surface heat flux predictions. The method enables accurate measurements of heat flux over wide range of thermal environments. The method is especially suited to harsh surface thermal conditions that do not permit the use of surface mounted heat flux gauges. The method is well suited to numerical regularization for stability. The method appears extendable to a certain class of problems that involve surface recession. This  methodology, as it develops further, can be useful for high-heat flux experiments of extendable time duration.   The universal nature of this transformative approach impacts and supports research in aerospace, energy, fire, combustion, geophysical, defense and national security.
