<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) will study so-called "multiple" or "sympathetic" coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in order to determine the structural properties of the background solar magnetic field in which these eruptions occur, specifically for two well-observed multiple CME events. He will investigate how structural features like separatrix surfaces and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) characterize the sites of magnetic reconnection and field reconfiguration, as well as how they connect individual CME eruptions in multiple events and, in particular, how these features predetermine the sequential order of eruptions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will analyze the evolution of multiple CMEs, using data from ground-based and space-based observatories, along with global potential field source surface (PFSS) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling of the coronal magnetic field. Specifically, he will compute global PFSS and MHD solutions that describe the background magnetic configurations of the multiple CME events of 1-2 August 2010 and 27-28 July 2011. He will also reconstruct the large-scale separatrix surfaces and QSLs in these configurations and identify which of their structural components are model-independent. The PI will then analyze these components and identify among them those that are most likely to affect the CME eruption process in these events, and particularly, those which predetermine the order of successive CME eruptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's new techniques for the structural analysis of magnetic field configurations will be applicable to all studies in solar and heliospheric physics where a detailed knowledge of magnetic field structure and its impact on physical processes in solar plasma is required. The PI will also share his results online with the wider scientific community. This research will result in a fuller description of the basic magnetic topology of the solar corona, and this description is a prerequisite for effectively predicting space weather events like CMEs.</AbstractNarration>

We have accepted this fact as a starting point of our study and henceforth called such eruptions linked. Recent studies suggest that the mechanisms by which one eruption can trigger another one act in the corona and are of a magnetic nature.   Using high-quality observational data from Solar Dynamics Observatory and topological analysis for the 2010 August 1-2 eruptions, Schrijver &amp; Title (2011) found evidence that all involved source regions were connected by so-called separatrix and quasi-separatrix magnetic field lines.  Later we have performed a simplified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a subset of these eruptions, which indicates that two of the successive eruptions on August 1 were supported and partly triggered by reconnection process at a current sheet formed along a separator field line high in the corona. These results strongly suggested an essential role played by structural magnetic features in the generation of linked eruptions.  Employing our newly developed techniques for the structural analysis of the coronal magnetic field, we have performed in this project, funded by NSF SHINE program, a more comprehensive study of the magnetic environment in which such eruptions occurred.  In particular, we have reconstructed for the above period of time the coronal magnetic field from the existing photospheric magnetic data by using, first, the so-called potential field source-surface (PFSS) model and, second, more accurate MHD model.  The comparative analysis of these two models has confirmed and generalized our original simplified model of the two linked eruptions by providing also an explanation for the other three linked eruptions (Figs. 3-6).  The obtained results on the key role of the structural magnetic features, such as magnetic separatrix curtains (Fig. 1) of so-called pseudo-streamers, in connecting successive eruptions are therefore model-independent and likely to be applicable for explaining other similar eruption events.  The scientific objectives of our project were, to a large extent, in the focus of several working group sessions at the 2010-2016 SHINE workshops on CMEs and the origin of the solar wind.  Thus, the work performed in our project is highly relevant to the current, and likely future scientific goals of the SHINE program. More generally, our new techniques for the structural analysis of the magnetic field are applicable to all research topics in solar and heliospheric physics where a detailed knowledge of the magnetic field structure and of its impact on physical processes in solar plasma is required. Understanding the basic magnetic structure of the solar corona and where and how it topologically reconfigures to give us the broad range of physical processes we observe is a prerequisite to eventually predicting space weather effects.
