<AbstractNarration>In this project faculty members from the Biology and Education Departments and their graduate students at the University of Missouri have collaborated to develop a course, "Teach Evolution," offered to future middle- and high-school teachers in the state.  Of particular interest are those who teach in rural or small-town districts, where they are often the only science teacher or biology teacher in the district, and where inadequate preparation and outside pressure combine to discourage them from tackling this fundamental scientific concept.  The teachers are being surveyed to assess their needs, both content knowledge and pedagogy, so that the course addresses those needs as directly as possible.  Using the accepted educational practice of "backwards design," the team specifies the learning goals as drawn from the results of the survey, measures are developed to assess whether the goals are being met, and the structure of the course is then developed to include activities that will develop the desired learning outcomes.  Students in the course include pre-service biology education students, graduate students returning to the University to earn alternative teacher certification, and in-service teachers seeking to strengthen their content knowledge. The diversity of experience generates a rich conversation among them. Included in the course are aspects of the social and philosophical impact of evolution and discussion of the challenges those bring to the teaching of the subject.  Once trained, the new teachers become part of a virtual community, the MoEvolves Network, in which they can share on line their challenges, successes, and teaching tips with others facing similar circumstances.  Because of the influence of effective secondary school teachers on the mind-sets of their students, the Teach Evolution course and its support network will have a disproportionate influence on science literacy in exurban Missouri.</AbstractNarration>

A total of 26 biology education majors (over 95% of our biology education majors) completed the course, which was taught in the spring of 2013 and 2014.     In the second year of the project, we designed a new module using the issue of antibiotic resistance in bacteria to teach natural selection. To ensure the practicality of the module for high school use, we tested the module for two consecutive years in a local high school.  Three teachers and two student teachers were involved in co-designing this module with us and teaching the module to approximately 400 high school students.  After making revisions based on our pilot study in the local high school, we will incorporate the antibiotic resistance module into our new course.     In addition to designing this new evolution course for biology education majors, revisions were made to the existing evolution content course for biology majors.  These revisions included in-depth discussions of the public controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution, addition of several labs in the lecture-based course, and student presentations of different examples of evolution.     A secondary goal of the project was to create a network of evolution educators.  To support this goal, we designed and hosted two evolution education workshops (3 days in duration) for college instructors.  A total of 26 college instructors attended the workshops in which we shared instructional activities from our new course. To support secondary biology teachers in teaching evolution, we presented evolution education sessions for three years at the annual Science Teachers of Missouri (STOM) conferences.  Each year, approximately 25-30 teachers attended our evolution sessions.     In summary, this project impacted our target audience, 26 future biology teachers at the University of Missouri.  Additionally, through revisions made to the Evolution course for biology majors, we also impacted biology majors at our institution. Through our college instructor workshops, we impacted 26 college instructors from Missouri and surrounding states.  Through our pilot project for the antibiotic resistance unit, we impacted 400 high school biology students, three biology teachers and two student teachers at a local high school. Through our Science Teachers of Missouri conference sessions, we reached approximately 75 additional high school biology teachers.
