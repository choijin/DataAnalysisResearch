<AbstractNarration>The relationships among living species can provide valuable information on how evolution has proceeded, but interpretations must carefully account for extinction and shared history within the group. This project will develop mathematical models that incorporate interactions between speciation, extinction, and changes in the traits of species. These models will be implemented in software and applied to the evolution of geographic ranges and plant mating systems, using empirical data from extant species. They will enable tests of fundamental macroevolutionary questions such as: How is trait evolution partitioned between changes within single lineages versus changes during speciation?  How are rates of speciation and extinction determined by diversity, or by the joint effects of many interacting traits?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical advances from this project are useful not only for its immediate study systems (including the nightshade family Solanaceae, which contains such agriculturally important species as potato, tomato, and tobacco), but also for applications to similar questions in many other plant and animal groups.  Developing these more powerful analyses, and training young researchers in computational evolution, will help maximize the scientific gains from ongoing efforts to assemble the tree of life.  The software developed will be freely available and well-supported, facilitating further empirical analyses and consequent collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Major Goals      The focus of this project is to develop and apply methods for learning about character evolution and lineage diversification from phylogenies.  The methods allow investigations of how evolving traits---single discrete characters, and sets of multiple correlated characters---affect rates of speciation and extinction.  The applications are to plant breeding systems and biogeography.  Key Outcomes and Accomplishments  We developed and distributed phylogenetic models to allow for changes in the states of a discrete character at speciation events (cladogenesis), in addition to change within single species lineages (anagenesis). This model can be used to examine evolution in a variety of study systems, including but not limited to evolutionary legacies of traits, linguistic analyses, and pathogenic organisms of medical relevance. Along with contributions to a massive public database associated with (NSF-sponsored) Tree of Sex Project, http://treeofsex.org/, the model(s) have been implemented in Rich FitzJohn's terrific R package diversitree, https://github.com/richfitz/diversitree, and used to uncover the punctuated nature of changes in plant sexual systems.   Training and Professional Development  The broader impacts included a continued aspiration for engagement of women in this strongly quantitative field and distribution of software. On this front, the grant was an unqualified success. The former post-doctoral researcher and co-PI, Dr. Emma Goldberg, completed a stellar body of published research, and obtained a tenure-track position at the University of Minnesota. The REU project resulted in education in computing, and a possible transition into a programming career for Ms. Hutton-Ziegler, an undergraduate researcher presently working on a software and model development at the Field Museum of Natural History.   Graduate student Karolis Ramanauskas was responsible for constructing the pipeline and alignment, with advice from the PIs.  Work on this project has developed his programming skills and introduced him to bioinformatics software and libraries that he will also use for future projects.
