<AbstractNarration>The Engineering Education Expansion Project at Ranken Technical College is increasing enrollment and graduation in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering design programs that are closely linked to workforce opportunities in the St. Louis area. The project strengthens collaborative efforts among Ranken, the St. Louis Public School System, College Summit St. Louis and Better Family Life to recruit high-school students into educational pathways that lead to technical careers and to support their persistence and degree attainment.  Project elements include 1) enhanced recruiting that informs high-school students, as well as their teachers and guidance counselors, about meaningful and well-paying technical careers, 2) accelerated pathways into college through dual enrollment programs and a summer bridge academy, 3) implementation of a new program in Mechanical Engineering Design Technology, 4) enhanced student support services, and 5) opportunities for financial support through internships, including an innovative micro-enterprise program in collaboration with local industry. The project is leveraging collaborative relationships with schools, non-profit organizations and industry in the St. Louis region and using well-established practices to increase engineering degree attainment. In addition to serving local workforce and educational needs, the program is serving students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, including first-generation college students and groups underrepresented in engineering and other STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

The initial goal was to engage a total of 300 new student participants, many drawn from disenfranchised and academically struggling neighborhoods served by the local public school district. This posed challenges as in general they had little exposure to STEM professions, or felt that their gender or ethnic background is an obstacle. In addition, many high school teachers and counselors are simply unfamiliar with STEM-related technical occupations and the career opportunities they represent.  The primary focus of E3 has been the expansion of four existing programs: Control Systems Technology, Electrical Automation Technology, Electrical Systems Design Technology, and Advanced Manufacturing Technology; in addition modifications to the work plan led to the creation of a new Building Systems Engineering Technology (BSET) degree program, with the first BSET enrollments in the fall of 2013. Total enrollments for all five programs exceeded expectations over the course of E3, with 400 new students over the five year period. The total number of graduates from these programs in the same period was over 500, a substantial increase over the rate pre-grant, indicating a successful increase of interest and recruitment in the targeted engineering-related courses of study.  In addition, a number of other activities were undertaken to strengthen the program and better serve participants, described below.  Enhanced recruitment in cooperation with private industry partners was designed to increase enrollment. A notable strategy was the incorporation of Ranken?s microenterprise model, which allows our students to work directly with employers on advanced manufacturing projects, learning job market skills while earning college credit and wages.  Hundreds of area teachers participated in STEP UP, a summer Academy for Educators that helped them incorporate STEM activities into the classroom, including renewable fuels, robotics, and makerspaces. The feedback from participating teachers across the region was exceedingly positive and many immediately took the lesson plans back to their individual schools.  Ranken Technical College also incorporated a special STEM section in our Annual Report and other publications to increase outreach, and project staff provided engineering-related demonstration for numerous area middle and high schools.  The STEP AHEAD component helped expand Ranken?s dual enrollment program, allowing St. Louis Public School high school students to obtain college credit for selected courses. This helped elevate math and science skills; dual enrollment students were also able to get a clear sense of the STEM career paths they felt an affinity for.  In addition, an external advisory committee met with project personnel at least once annually to provide feedback and guidance; the committee was exceptionally diverse with public and private corporations, non-profit organizations, organized labor, utilities, and other area higher educational institutions all participating.  In terms of intellectual merit, by integrating each of the above into a single program, E3 established that these strategies used in conjunction can result in the enrollment and retention of meaningfully greater numbers of students traditionally isolated from STEM post-secondary education and careers. Alone or in combination, any of the strategies can be emulated by other institutions interested in and committed to creating diversity and expanding opportunities for underserved and underrepresented students.
