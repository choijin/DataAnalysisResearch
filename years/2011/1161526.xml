<AbstractNarration> This proposal is to provide travel assistance for U.S. students and young investigators to participate in the Tenth International Conference on Permafrost (TICOP) in Salekhard, Russia.  TICOP will be a rare opportunity for many of the 200 members of the Permafrost Young Researchers Network to meet and develop their own plans for this new generation of permafrost researchers. By sending young researchers to Russia, the PI hopes to open doors for a whole new generation or researchers to begin conducting research in Russia and to develop personal knowledge and personal contacts with researchers abroad, which can be later instrumental to the success of a research program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funds were requested to support travel and registration expenses for young researchers and early career professionals to attend the Tenth International Conference on Permafrost (TICOP) held June 25&ndash;29, 2012, in Salekhard, Russia. The international permafrost conference is organized once every four years by a host country under the auspices of the International Permafrost Association. It is the worldÃ†s premier event for presentation and discussion of all scientific and engineering research related to permafrost. The 2012 conference was the first one to be held in Russia since 1973.  With 15 scientific sessions and poster sessions with over 100 posters, the conference contributions comprised a large field of permafrost research and reflected the recent importance and interest in polar issues. The TICOP focused on Arctic, Antarctic, and mountain permafrost research. The conference theme, "Resources and Risks in Permafrost Regions in a Changing World," referred to the impacts of a changing world on permafrost regions and, in turn, the impacts of permafrost conditions on the changing world.  The funds provided partial travel support for young U.S. based researchers who are actively engaged in research related to topics of the conference theme. Preferences for the travel stipend were given to applicants who have prepared papers and/or extended abstracts for presentation at the conference or for publication.  Availability of the travel grants was widely advertised and directly mailed to the Arctic and Antarctic communities.
