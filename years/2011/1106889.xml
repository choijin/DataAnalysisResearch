Mosquitofish are especially useful for studying the impacts of endocrine disrupting compounds because male and female mosquitofish have different physical characteristics. The anal fin of males is longer than the females, and anal fins grow on females when they are exposed to androgens (the male sex steroid).

The main issue with using mosquitofish for evaluating the impacts of chemicals in field studies is that we do not have a strong understanding of how anal fin growth occurs, both in normal males and in females exposed to androgens.
