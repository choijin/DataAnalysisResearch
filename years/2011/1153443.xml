<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Little is known about ornate box turtles in South Dakota and further research linked directly to defining effective conservation programs are critically needed. This research implements an integrative conservation approach to achieve the following objectives: 1) Assist South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks (SDGFP) in implementing the South Dakota Wildlife Action Plan, 2) Estimate the home range and the geographic range of ornate box turtles in South Dakota through the use of ecological niche modeling, 3) Document macro- and microhabitat use, 4) Describe movements and document daily and seasonal activity periods, and 5) Estimate gene flow among local populations using a landscape genetics approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening Participation&lt;br/&gt;This research will improve the research experience for Native American undergraduate students at Oglala Lakota College(OLC) by providing training in ecological field research delivering hands-on, place-based STEM instruction and will facilitate the advancement of Native American student education by bridging OLC undergraduate students interested in Conservation Biology to the Master of Science in Integrative Genomics (MSIG) at the Black Hill State University(BHSU).</AbstractNarration>

An average of 25 ornate box turtles were fitted with radio transmitters and temperature data loggers.  Turtles were located weekly with a minimum interval of three days during the active season.    Intellectual merit: We were able to achieve the research goals by:  1.1) estimating the home range and the geographic range of ornate box turtles in South Dakota; 1.2) documented the macro- and microhabitat use throughout the active season (April through October); 1.3) documented hibernation; and 1.4) Studied population genetics, conservation and management.  One article was published on box turtle?s reproduction and growth (Quinn et al. 2014), one manuscript on habitat preferences is currently under review and two more are in preparation.  Besides peer review publications, the PI and her students presented partial results of the project on 29 occasions at local and national conferences.  Some abstracts were published.

Broader impacts: The project provided training and research experience in field ecology, conservation biology and genetics to more than 25 OLC undergraduate students delivering hands-on, place-based STEM instruction (goal 2).  As part of goal 3, we recruited 10 OLC undergraduate students interested in advanced degrees (e.g. Master and PhD) and provided financial and academic support to them so they enrolled on Genetics (BIOL 371) and Genetics Lab (BIOL 371L) courses at BHSU.  This is a four-credit course, not offered at OLC. It is required to enter the BHSU Master?s of Science in Integrative Genomics and other programs at mainstream institutions.  Three students started their masters at BHSU, and one student completed.  The other two students are in the workforce, one serving the tribe as natural resources specialist and the other works for a national park.  One student works at the industry applying molecular techniques for quality control of organic products.  One student completed an MS degree in Oregon and two other students started their PhDs (Indiana and Tennessee) this past year.  One student started MS at South Dakota State University.  The PI also received training in molecular techniques and the analysis of genetic data at BHSU (goal 4).  The success of the project was the collaboration between OLC and BHSU.  The PI designed a cohort type of mentoring that helped undergraduate Native American students interested in transitioning into graduate school or enter the workforce.  BHSU, specially the Co-PI and her staff, offered the technical support needed to advance Native American education!
