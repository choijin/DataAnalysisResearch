<AbstractNarration>Long-term measurements of nitrogen oxides at the GEOSummit station: Non-technical abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pollution from fossil fuel combustion is often transported to the Arctic region from nearby continents resulting in an increase in greenhouse gases. The Arctic climate is particularly sensitive to the effects of greenhouse gases. The initial rise in temperature reduces ice cover, exposing the darker oceans below which absorb more radiation leading to further warming. Monitoring these pollutants in the Arctic is important to understand the changes that have occurred and the impact on the future climate. This project will provide long-term measurements of nitrogen oxides at the GEOSummit Station, Greenland. Polluted air from human activities and forest fires can contain relatively high levels of nitrogen oxides.  When transported to the Arctic, these nitrogen oxides can foster the production of ozone, a significant greenhouse gas. &lt;br/&gt;The measurements will provide important information on the concentrations of nitrogen oxides transported to the Arctic, which vary both seasonally and annually and the resulting impact on Arctic ozone levels. The project will contribute to the Arctic Observing Network (AON) and the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH). The data will be made available to researchers for studies to improve understanding of current impacts of transported pollution on greenhouse gas levels and estimates of climate change feedbacks within the Arctic. The data will also be utilized by educators for classroom teaching and support the training of new graduate students by providing a unique opportunity to further their research interests and educational growth in the field of atmospheric sciences, using state of the art technology.</AbstractNarration>
