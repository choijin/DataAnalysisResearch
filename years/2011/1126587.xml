<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Chemistry Division, Professor Geoffrey Strouse from Florida State University and colleague William Cooper will acquire a new console and probes for a 500 MHz wide bore nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer for solids. The award will enhance research in areas such as (a) studies of microenvironments in quantum dots (QD), (b) biogeochemistry of natural organic compounds in surface waters, ground waters and soil pore waters, (c) nanofibers composed of designer peptides, (d) intermetallics and Zintl phases, (e) metal supported catalysts, (f) ferroelectric phase transitions, (g) live-cell metabolite analysis, (h) structural analysis of biomimetic nanotechnologies (i) identification of natural products, and (j) soil organic carbon dynamics in tropical forests. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;NMR spectroscopy is one of the most widely used analytical tools used by chemists to investigate the content and structure of materials and solids.  It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and probe the microenvironments in solid state materials.  The results from these NMR studies will have a positive impact on studies of bio-inspired materials, polymers, and environmentally relevant materials.   The instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.  It will be shared with faculty and students at Florida A&amp;M University and Valdosta State University, and researchers at Tyndall AFB and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama.</AbstractNarration>
