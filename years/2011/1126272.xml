<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to develop an autonomously, deployable, deep-ocean seismic system to provide long-term and near-real-time seismographic observations from sites far offshore. Building upon two proven technologies, autonomous wave-powered surface boats and ocean bottom seismometers, the proposed new generation instrument will, if successful, provide a means of increasing global coverage not only of seismic observations, but also of a variety of ocean bottom observables in an affordable, practical, and sustainable way. Real-time data from stations in oceanic areas will significantly increase the accuracy of earthquake parameters such as location and moment. Such global seismographic data are critical for both national and international agencies in monitoring and characterizing earthquakes, tsunamis, and nuclear explosions. This is particularly critical for tsunami warning systems. This new generation instrument will provide a means of increasing access to not only seismic data, but also to a variety of other ocean bottom observables over the global oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new capability would make it realistic to consider the deployment of seafloor observatories in any remote areas of the oceans. In addition to addressing fundamental questions of Earth structure and tectonics, providing real-time data from stations in oceanic areas will significantly increase the accuracy of earthquake parameters such as location and moment. Such global seismographic data are critical for both national and international agencies in monitoring and characterizing earthquakes, tsunamis, and nuclear explosions. This is particularly critical for tsunami warning systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[We have developed a new technology that can provide near real-time telemetry of sensor data from the ocean bottom without a moored buoy or a cable to shore. The breakthrough technology that makes this system possible is an autonomous surface vehicle called a Wave Glider developed by Liquid Robotics, Inc. of Sunnyvale, CA., which harvests wave and solar energy for motive and electrical power.  The wave glider acts as a communications gateway, hovering above the ocean bottom instrument package and transmitting the sensor data from the ocean floor to the land.  Several deployments of a prototype system demonstrated the station holding ability of the wave glider and the efficiency of the acoustic/satellite communications system.    The current technology can support 880 days of operation with continuous 1 sps sensor data telemetry or two years of operation with continuous 1 sps telemetry plus 1250 hours of 40 sps data telemetry in response to data requests from shore. We have also demonstrated that a wave glider could tow a suitably designed ocean bottom package with acceptable loss of speed.  With further development such a system could be deployed autonomously and provide real-time telemetry of data from seafloor sensors.  This system could help achieve the long sought establishment of about twenty high quality, broadband, permanent ocean seismic stations on the seafloor. An increase in spatial sampling in the oceans will provide the data required to improve tomographic imaging of the structure of the lower mantle (especially in the Southern Hemisphere), the core-mantle boundary, and subducting slabs and plumes in deep mantle circulation.  Studies of regional structure and tectonics of many areas also require observations from oceanic areas. In addition to addressing fundamental questions of Earth structure and tectonics, providing real-time data from stations in oceanic areas will significantly increase the accuracy of earthquake parameters such as location and moment.  Such global seismographic data are critical for both national and international agencies in monitoring and characterizing earthquakes, tsunamis, and nuclear explosions.
