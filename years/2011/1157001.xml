<AbstractNarration>The objective of this three year REU Site program at Missouri University of Science and Technology is to engage ten undergraduate students for nine weeks each summer in advancing technologies that generate useful energy from renewable energy resources, and to train engineers to pursue further research into renewable energy. This REU site will focus on solar, hydrokinetic, and biomass technologies, which all generate power from renewable resources that are abundant in Missouri, as well as much of the nation.  The rising price of fossil fuels and the growing concern over climate change have fostered a myriad of research and development activities in alternative resources. This REU will leverage existing programs, such as the REU activities sponsored by the NSF-funded Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) Systems Engineering Research Center (ERC) and other NSF-funded projects; research projects sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, Department of Energy, and other agencies; and projects within the Missouri S&amp;T Student Design and Experiential Learning Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each participant will be paired with a graduate student who will assist the participant in gaining the key skills necessary for success.  Throughout the summer, students will meet as a group with all of the faculty mentors to discuss research progress, skill development, university resources available, and future plans.  Guest speakers will facilitate workshops on professional development topics, such as technical communication and intellectual property.  Students will also participate in various field trips to engage them in the topics they are researching. The various field trips include: 1) a canoe trip on the local National Scenic Waterways, 2) a visit to the headquarters of AmerenUE, one of the Midwest's biggest energy companies, 3) a visit to Anheuser-Busch, the world's biggest brewery and home of the largest waste biomass energy process in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy usage is fundamental to progress in industry, increase in standard of living, and economic growth. The students who participate in this REU Site will gain the skills and knowledge to pursue a research-oriented career in renewable energy. As energy prices continue to grow, these new engineers will help facilitate a shift away from non-renewable fossil fuels to cleaner, more sustainable sources. The recruitment strategy will expand the participation of women and minorities in energy research.</AbstractNarration>
