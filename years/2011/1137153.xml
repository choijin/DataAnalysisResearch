<AbstractNarration>This research will focus on an investigation of the dynamics resulting in the genesis and maintenance of tornadic vortices. The overarching hypothesis of the study is following: Smaller (subtornado vortex-scale) vortical structures in the vicinity of a primary tornado vortex undergo gyroscopically driven alignment, followed by a generalized merging process. This leads to a natural steepening of the vorticity gradient on the outer edge of the tornadic circulation.  Ultimately, this isolates the vortex from turbulence-induced erosion processes. The isolation process then enables the tornado vortex to achieve strengths not easily simulated with traditional numerical models, even with resolution deemed sufficient to resolve that vortex. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The processes leading to vortex isolation are not well represented in quasi-two-dimensional traditional atmospheric dynamics theory.  Instead, the study adopts a new theoretical framework based on an analogy of the Navier-Stokes equation (hydrodynamics-HD) with electromagnetic (EM) theory.  This framework has been growing in acceptance in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) community, particularly over the last 15 years.  One key point in this new approach exploits the analogous behavior between the alignment of magnetic domains within an external magnetic field, and vortical turbulence being driven to alignment (and merging) with the tornado vortex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is on two fronts: (1) numerical modeling of the isolation process and (2) theoretical development describing three-dimensional scale interaction processes producing that isolation.  A formulation of a vorticity backscatter process based on resolvable vorticity structure will be resulted.  This new framework will then be built into the numerical model used to enable the simulation of a tornado without extreme resolution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The adopted methodologies embracing an EM-HD analogy will likely enhance understanding of all atmospheric vortex dynamics, including those that govern tropical cyclones. While this will result in a more robust comprehension of these complex processes, it will also introduce a simple, intuitive, overarching framework for future investigations.  The two principal investigators plan to take advantage of this simplification to create new teaching tools that articulate the complexities of tornado formation and maintenance in a clear manner to the general public.  Additionally, this work will serve as a catalyst for stressing the importance of a well-rounded physics background (including the fundamentals of electromagnetism), especially for those entering the fields of atmospheric science and fluid dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report &ndash; NSF AGS 1137153     We embarked on this project to further understand the mechanism of tornadogenesis in the context of a new view of fundamental vortex dynamics.  We wished to apply a novel approach to understand how vortex structures interact with each other in a framework analogous to electromagnetism (EM).  There were two main hypotheses in this framework:  that vortex structures will "self-align" to the orientation of the background spin, or vorticity; also, that vortex structures will drift toward stronger vorticity of the same orientation.  These two phenomena are well established in electromagnetism (via the Lorentz Force and derivative concepts).  We were partially successful in establishing the fluid mechanical analog of the second portion of this main hypothesis.  The first portion of the hypothesis was found not to be theoretically feasible due to a fundamental difference between fluids and EM fields:  While EM fields can produce internal torque, fluids, in the absence of viscous effects, cannot.   The general measure of success for a project is the addition of substantial science to the community through publications.  We submitted one major publication that housed both of the above hypotheses, as well as presented preliminary findings at two conferences.  Because the first hypothesis was flawed, progress on the paper languished.  The second part of the paper is now in the process of being refined and augmented.  With new collaboration with a colleague in the physics at Western Illinois University, a more thorough mathematical treatment of the EM analogy with vortex propagation in a background vorticity field has been developed and will be included in the new paper.  Additionally, the work of two undergraduate students will also be included in the paper.  A second manuscript focused on a quantity called superhelicity.  This was found to be related to the development of local maxima of vorticity in a fluid.  Numerical experiments of the interaction of a downdraft with a helical (and superhelical) updraft show that vertical vorticity concentrates precisely in the areas of vertical superhelicity gradient.  Because of these results, superhelical interaction can explain genesis of a misovortex (pre-tornadic vortex) at middle levels along the edge of the mesocyclone.

By viewing the evolution of the vorticity field through the basic tenets of interaction involving coherent structures (vortices), severe-storm forecasters will be able to recognize potential for vortex intensification (tornado formation) more easily and quickly, providing better warning lead times.  We presented these preliminary results at two conferences.  The mathematical derivation showing the relationship involved international collaboration with a mathematician at the Universidad Aut&oacute;noma Metropolitana.  Analyses from Doppler on Wheels (DOW) platforms were obtained from the Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR) and were incorporated into the paper.  Revisions were suggested from co-authors at CSWR, and those are still in progress.   A third (now published) manuscript was the result of collaboration with a physicist at IST, Universidade de Lisboa (Portugal).  While not directly aimed at the focus of this project, some ideas stemming from the EM-HD analogy were helpful in the development of the manuscript.   Another example of international collaboration in this project was the development of scientific ties with Michael Belevich at the Shirsov Oceanographic Institute (SOI) in St. Pertersburg, Russia.  His work was the basis for some of the fundamental tenets of our project.  He also showed interest in our use of superhelicity as a diagnostic.  He prompted an invitation to give a presentation of our work at SOI.  Three undergraduate students were heavily involved in the work at Western Illinois University; they were funded as full-time research assistants over three summers.  These three students had the opportunity to present their work at the American Meteorological Society Annual Meeting on several occasions.  All three are now pursuing graduate research and degrees in three strong programs (U of Illinois, Texas Tech, and SUNY-Albany).  Two smaller manuscripts encompassing their work are roughly complete, but more refinement of the numerical experiments is still needed.  Progress on the above mentioned publications, along with others, were slowed in the middle of the third year of the project due to ongoing health issues and a heavier teaching load.  Work will continue on the project until at least two more manuscripts are produced.             Last Modified: 02/26/2018       Submitted by: Marcus L Buker]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
