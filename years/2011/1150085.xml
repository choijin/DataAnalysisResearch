<AbstractNarration>1150085&lt;br/&gt;Dwyer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological function emerges from a crowded, complex environment in which the exquisite&lt;br/&gt;progression of intra- and intermolecular transformations is choreographed by the energy landscape&lt;br/&gt;between interacting species. Molecular recognition exploits highly evolved molecular sensitivity to this&lt;br/&gt;interaction energy to allow biological systems to respond selectively to low-level molecular signals in a&lt;br/&gt;noisy molecular background. The goal of this proposal is to develop a technique that can probe these&lt;br/&gt;interaction energies, enabling both the fundamental atomic-level understanding of molecular recognition&lt;br/&gt;and its direct application for highly sensitive and selective biosensing. The core of this proposal is the&lt;br/&gt;development and application of nanopore force spectroscopy (NFS), a technique that enables molecular&lt;br/&gt;interactions to be probed on the single molecule level. Nanopores?molecular-scale holes in insulating&lt;br/&gt;membranes?enable single molecule sensing without the cost or complexity of single molecular optical&lt;br/&gt;techniques. While sensitive, nanopores lack robust native chemical selectivity. Aptamer molecular&lt;br/&gt;recognition agents will be combined with NFS to overcome this deficiency. In addition, NFS will be&lt;br/&gt;developed as a tool to probe and exploit broad classes of receptor-ligand interactions.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will progress from NFS-based measurements of fundamental aptamer&lt;br/&gt;properties such as conformational stability in the absence of target to characterizing aptamer&lt;br/&gt;performance enhancements that leverage the unique molecularly-constrained and chemically tunable&lt;br/&gt;NFS sensing environment. Following these initial control experiments, NFS measurements of aptamertarget&lt;br/&gt;interactions will be used to optimize experimental conditions and then to explore the limits of&lt;br/&gt;aptamer-NFS sensitivity and selectivity. The unique opportunities presented by the constrained nanopore&lt;br/&gt;environment will then be explored through nonlocalized surface functionalization in which surface charge&lt;br/&gt;is varied. This will provide the basis for the subsequent development and characterization of site-selective&lt;br/&gt;surface functionalization in the nanopore interior. The insights that will emerge relating to chemistry in&lt;br/&gt;constrained environments will be generally useful to the nanofabrication community. The effect of local&lt;br/&gt;surface chemical modification of the solid-state nanopores on aptamer-NFS will then be explored before a&lt;br/&gt;model drug-screening assay will be tested.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is captured in the following points:&lt;br/&gt;(1) The development and demonstration of nanopore force spectroscopy as a general method for&lt;br/&gt;exploring and exploiting receptor-ligand interactions will (i) introduce a new tool to the force&lt;br/&gt;measurement toolbox?one with unique tunable nanoscale properties and (ii) dramatically extend&lt;br/&gt;the utility of nanopore methods. In contrast to other force methods such as atomic force microscopy&lt;br/&gt;(AFM), NFS constrains molecules in a well-defined, molecular-scale environment allowing tuning of&lt;br/&gt;the nanopore-molecule interactions as done by nature in an enzyme binding pocket.&lt;br/&gt;(2) The development of chemically selective nanopore sensing by using ?artificial antibody? aptamer&lt;br/&gt;molecular recognition agents in combination with NFS will enrich nanopore biosensing capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;NFS, itself, can extend the power and utility of aptamer sensing by providing a real-time, direct&lt;br/&gt;measurement of aptamer-target interactions. Weak, nonspecific interactions otherwise leading to&lt;br/&gt;false positives can be rejected.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Inspired by the performance of site-directed mutagenesis, the development of a site-selective solid&lt;br/&gt;state nanopore functionalization method will allow the extensive prior body of work on protein&lt;br/&gt;nanopore functionalization to be transferred to more robust, tunable solid-state nanopores.&lt;br/&gt;(4) The successful NFS measurement of the interaction between a DNA-bound small molecule and a&lt;br/&gt;protein will serve as the proof-of-principle experiment that NFS is feasible for straightforward drug&lt;br/&gt;screening.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research include:&lt;br/&gt;(1) The expansion of the force microscopy toolkit to include a robust, inexpensive, easy-to-use single&lt;br/&gt;molecule nanopore method in a platform suitable for deployment outside the laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;(2) The training of science and engineering researchers to become skilled science and engineering&lt;br/&gt;communicators. Active outreach to increase the public?s understanding and appreciation of science&lt;br/&gt;and engineering will target:&lt;br/&gt;a. the general public through various media and community activities,&lt;br/&gt;b. public relations students whose careers may include science and engineering communication,&lt;br/&gt;c. K-12 students in a diverse, urban school through informal interactions and hands-on activities,&lt;br/&gt;d. university undergraduates who will learn engineering skills as they fabricate inexpensive&lt;br/&gt;diagnostic devices,&lt;br/&gt;e. the researchers, themselves, through the emphasis on the importance of unifying scientific and&lt;br/&gt;engineering activities to address human needs.</AbstractNarration>
