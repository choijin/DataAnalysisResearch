<AbstractNarration>The project plans to partner with the University of Michigan and adapt activities developed by the University of Michigan ADVANCE program to FIU's primarily-undergraduate, Hispanic-Serving Institution.    The first goal of the project is to increase awareness of campus stakeholders about issues surrounding women STEM faculty.   The second goal is the professional development of STEM women including leadership skills development, assertiveness and communication skills, and strategic career planning.   The third goal is to increase the hiring, retention and promotion of STEM women on the FIU campus.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partnership with the experienced PI of the University of Michigan ADVANCE IT grant is an excellent way to increase the likely success of the program at FIU.  They have provided excellent details of how the partnership will be managed and are poised to test a model of adaptation through partnerships.  The PIs have done a nice job of identifying successful ADVANCE programming and adapting it to their environment.  In addition they have selected programming that is relevant to the circumstances at FIU as identified by previous climate surveys.  The PI team has a strong mix of abilities and significant authority on the FIU campus to spearhead the initiatives.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIU is an Hispanic serving institution and the addition of female STEM faculty has the potential to have a significant impact on the aspirations of their Hispanic students.  The partnership model as suggested in this grant is a novel way to adapt successful programming to a new setting.  If successful, there is great potential for broad impacts across many institution types.  The exceptional evaluation and dissemination plans also bode well for the broader impacts of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Florida International University made significant progress towards the three proposed goals of its NSF ADVANCE PAID grant, Awareness, Commitment, and Empowerment (ACE), 2011-2016. FIU showed a significant and quantifiable improvement in terms of its foremost goal: to increase FIU&rsquo;s commitment to hire STEM women. Over the five-year period, the proportion of women faculty in STEM rose from 14% to 18%. This hiring success was influenced strongly by the effectiveness of the STRIDE committee workshops on Best Practices in Hiring Faculty that were attended by more than three hundred faculty. The STRIDE workshops were based on those developed by our partner institution, the University of Michigan. STRIDE faculty presenters illustrated how unconscious gender bias affects hiring decisions and provided numerous strategies for reducing the influence of unconscious bias. The second goal, to increase Awareness among faculty and administrators about the problems facing STEM women faculty, was facilitated using interactive theater performances offered by the University of Michigan CRLT players. The performances illustrated gender barriers for women faculty and were very well-attended, drawing nearly two hundred faculty, chairs and deans from the arts, sciences, and engineering. The third goal was the empowerment of women faculty through mentorship and leadership skills training. The faculty mentor program attracted from 120 to 170 faculty annually (60-85 pairs) and improved faculty satisfaction with mentoring over a three year period from 10% to 30% on five measures of mentoring. The main leadership activity, an annual Women Faculty Leadership Institute, resulted in several measures of success, including (a) the formation of two interdisciplinary groups that meet regularly (a Women in STEM network and a research and advocacy group focusing on Title IX and violence against women issues), and (b) the establishment of a Council for the Advancement of Women and Minority Faculty that would serve as an advisory body to the Provost. As a result of the success of the NSF PAID activities, FIU&rsquo;s Provost in November 2015 made a commitment to institutionalize the STRIDE and mentor program within the Office to Advance Women, Equity and Diversity (AWED), a newly founded office in Academic Affairs. The mission of AWED is to build and offer effective programs that achieve and sustain faculty equity and diversity as an essential element of FIU's academic excellence. AWED&rsquo;s goals include: placing faculty diversity and gender balance into the center of consideration; expanding faculty mentoring to enhance professional training and progress; interdisciplinary networking; strategic planning for salary equity; policy analysis and development; and initiatives supporting faculty diversity and institutional climate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/31/2016<br>      Modified by: Suzanna&nbsp;M&nbsp;Rose</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
