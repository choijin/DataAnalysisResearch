<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supramolecular chemistry has made great progress in assembling small molecules capable of coordinated, non-covalent interactions into supramolecular structures. However, success in the use of large synthetic macromolecules as the monomer units for supramolecular polymerization has been limited. As inferred from supramolecular polymers from proteins, giant polymeric superstructures can be constructed from macromolecular monomers, and they are expected to have remarkable material performance and superior stability. The objective of this CAREER research is to develop synthetic macromolecules that undergo controlled supramolecular polymerization to form nanomaterials with predictable morphology and physical properties. The approach begins with investigations of synthetic macromolecules bearing grafted polypeptides, and takes advantage of the predictable interactions among grafted polypeptide secondary structures to drive the assembly. The research seeks to: (1) synthesize supramolecular polymers from selected polypeptide-grafted comb macromolecules and characterize their structures, (2) characterize the mechanical properties of supramolecular polymers and elucidate the molecular basis of the properties, (3) conduct kinetic and thermodynamic studies to establish the cooperative assembly mechanisms in the supramolecular polymerization from macromolecular units, and (4) deduce the general principles involved in the design of synthetic macromolecular units for cooperative assembly and polymerizations. The proposed research could ultimately lead to the generation of polymeric systems that will approach the level of sophistication and complexity found in nature?s self-organized supramolecular polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remarkable physical properties of nanostructures assembled from biological macromolecules have long inspired scientists to create synthetic systems that work with similar precision and efficiency. Practical design of biologically inspired synthetic materials has emerged at the interface of polymer science, chemistry and biology, and may find applications in sustainable plastics, biomedical materials and renewable energy. The proposed research will create new macromolecular building blocks for controlled assembly, provide insights into the assembly mechanisms, and develop nanostructured materials with superior mechanical strength and self-healing properties. The growth of polymer research at such an interface provides opportunities to educate students and inspire them to pursue careers in science and engineering. The CAREER award will allow the PI to develop an integrated research and education program on Bioinspired Polymeric Materials at University of Connecticut. The program will address students' major needs for interdisciplinary education and high quality research experiences in this emerging field. The proposed outreach program seeks to: (1) integrate the proposed research with the development of interdisciplinary polymer courses; (2) provide vibrant polymer research experiences to undergraduates and high-school students and (3) promote polymer research and its impact on society through providing lectures for the general public. Emphasis will be given to involve underrepresented students at all levels.</AbstractNarration>
