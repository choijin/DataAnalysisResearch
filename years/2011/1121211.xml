<AbstractNarration>Understanding how developmental mechanisms evolve to generate novel traits in form or disease is a major challenge of contemporary biology. By exploiting the knowledge of developmental mechanisms in genetic model organisms such as the fruit fly Drosophila, this challenge can be addressed in great molecular detail. This proposal takes advantage of a newly established experimental system, the hover fly Episyrphus balteatus (Syrphidae), to understand the genetic mechanism underlying the origin of the amnioserosa tissue, which guides important morphogenetic movements in the Drosophila embryo. The amnioserosa is not conserved but combines characteristics of two distinct tissues commonly found in other insects, the amnion and the serosa. The research goal is to understand how the genetic pathways specifying the serosa and the amnion merged into a single tissue. Episyrphus is the closest relative of Drosophila known to develop distinct amniotic and serosal epithelia and therefore of key importance for understanding this transition. By studying amnion and serosa specification in this species, it is expected to better understand how mechanisms of cell fate specification and tissue formation evolve to generate major novel traits. General benefits of this project to the research community and society will result from a deeper understanding of developmental and evolutionary mechanisms, from developing and promoting new experimental systems, and from inspiring a new generation to pursue a career in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ a)  Intellectual Merit Research supported by this award has shown how the genetic circuit underlying the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) gradient evolved in fly embryos to alter the specification of extraembryonic tissue types.  The specification of different cell fates by morphogens has been a longstanding focus in developmental biology and the developmental dynamics of morphogenetic gradients have received much theoretical attention.  Theory suggests that evolving morphogen dynamics can explain many aspects of organismal diversity.  However, this important prediction has remained speculative, due to the difficulty of obtaining quantitative measurements of morphogen activity in non-model systems.  One of the most intensely studied examples is the gradient of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling in fly embryos.  In flies like Megaselia abdita (Phoridae), the BMP gradient specifies two widely conserved extraembryonic membranes, the serosa and amnion, but in Drosophila melanogaster, BMP signaling specifies a single membrane, the amnioserosa.  We have shown that the BMP gradient of Megaselia broadens during early gastrulation but is static at the corresponding Drosophila stage, and that the later, broad BMP gradient specifies amnion in Megaselia and is driven by a positive feedback circuit that intensifies BMP signaling during early gastrulation at the edge of the germ rudiment.  In Megaselia, this feedback circuit depends on dorsocross (doc) and doc-dependent expression of eiger (egr) whereas in Drosophila, it depends on zerknullt (zen), which activates doc and egr expression, thereby restricting positive feedback to the dorsal midline during gastrulation.  The observed differences between Megaselia and Drosophila suggest that the ancestral use of the positive feedback circuit was to promote amnion specification. In conclusion, research supported by this award provided the first experimentally validated example for how spatio-temporal changes in a self-regulatory morphogenetic gradient can drive morphological evolution.  The mechanisms driving morphological changes during evolution are of considerable interest to the general public.  The discovery of a widely conserved role of BMP gradients in dorsal-ventral patterning of animal embryos has been central to the debate of whether animals as diverse as insects and humans share a common developmental plan.  This study shows that subtle differences in these gradients are sufficient to drive organismal diversity.      b)  Broader Impacts  The award provided training opportunities for one postdoctoral scholar and supported the dissertation work of one graduate student.  Additionally, the award helped to create training opportunities for seven graduate rotation students, five undergraduate students, including students from under represented minorities and one NSF-supported visiting EDEN fellow, as well as two high school summer students, and helped to organize research with 9th and 10th graders of a local high school.  The goal of this successful project was to establish a protocol for collecting embryos of a fly species (Hermetia illucens) and resulted in preliminary data for a new research proposal.  The award also supported the organization of an annual "Evolution &amp; Development Day" for high school student and teacher participants in the DNA Residency Program at the Field Museum of Natural History at Chicago.
