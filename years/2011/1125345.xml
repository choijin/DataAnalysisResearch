<AbstractNarration>The research involves multidisciplinary field and laboratory work conducted in the Woranso-Mille study area of the Afar Depression in Ethiopia. The Woranso-Mille paleoanthropological project is relatively new and has started gathering significant fossil hominid specimens from a time period poorly known previously (3.6-3.8 million years ago). This funding supports collaborative research to be conducted by paleontologists, geologists, geochronologists, and paleoecologists from six institutions in the United States and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists from each institution will coordinate their efforts to understand early hominid diversity between 3.0 and 4.0 million years ago, early Australopithecus paleobiology, taxonomy, and phylogenetic relationships, and establish their paleoenvironments. These will be attained by conducting detailed comparative analysis of the Woranso-Mille hominids enhanced by the use of High-resolution x-ray computed tomography, and isotope analysis in order to test whether morphological differences observed for the Woranso-Mille hominids correlate to isotopic variation that are indicative of behavioral and physiological differences. The paleontologists will further conduct faunal collection directed towards increasing the sample size of all fossil taxa at the site to increase biostratigraphic control, refine paleoenvironmental context of the associated hominids, and identify additional fossiliferous localities. Geologists of the project will establish a refined stratigraphic context for the fossils collected from all of the designated vertebrate localities in the northern part of the study area, establish refined stratigraphy and chronometric ages (using 40Ar/39Ar dating and magnetostratigraphy) for the vertebrate localities and associated fossils, and determine stratigraphic correlations across vertebrate localities within the study area and other paleontological sites in the region. The scientific results from this study will answer questions related to mid-Pliocene hominid diversity, generate new data on the paleobiology of early hominids and their paleohabitat, and increase understanding of mid-Pliocene African vertebrate evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project focus on creating training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  The goals of this collaborative research effort were to expand our understanding of human evolution in Africa 3 to 4 million years ago.  The major components to the project included finding additional fossil remains of our ancestors, putting them into a firm geologic context and then reconstructing the environments in which they lived.  This portion of the collaborative project focused on environmental reconstruction; understanding the conditions in which early humans lived is a critical component to understanding their evolution. Among the outcomes of this work, we showed that early humans started to eat grassy resources as early as 3.76 million years ago at the same time that fossil baboons started to eat these resources as well. Our results show that these dietary changes were not responses to changes in the environment or climate, but instead likely reflect changes in the dynamics among primates at the time and the competition for available resources. These findings provide critical context for understanding the diversity among fossils of early humans 3 to 4 million years ago. Our results were reported in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated in professional meetings, popular media, public lectures and university courses.  Broader impacts  In addition to the research, training students in STEM skillsets was a main outcome of this project.  The project provided training for 3 undergraduates and 1 PhD student at Johns Hopkins University and specifically gave them hands-on training preparing samples for analysis, operation of a mass spectrometer, literature review and data analysis.  Data generated as part of this work was used in university level classes to highlight cutting-edge interdisciplinary research, give the students experience handling real data, and to give students inside look into the whole research process from research design to data generation, literature review and publication.
