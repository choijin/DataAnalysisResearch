<AbstractNarration>This award enables the research team to continue their work on the ICECAP (ICE age Chemistry and Proxies) modeling project whose aim is to explore the utility of delta O-17 isotopes in ice core sulfate as a proxy for past oxidant levels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, the research will investigate the evolution of the atmosphere's oxidation capacity during the Last Glacial Maximum and pre-industrial Holocene through to the present-day.  Specifically, the researchers aim to evaluate the relative roles of emissions and atmospheric dynamics in the variability of oxidants on glacial-interglacial timescales as well as any regional variation in sulfate and nitrate isotopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support two graduate students and a high school science teacher.  Successful completion of the work would improve the understanding of feedbacks between climate and the sources and sinks of methane, which would help improve our understanding of climate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction. The oxidative capacity of the troposphere &ndash; characterized by the burden of the four most abundant and reactive oxidants (OH, ozone, H2O2, and NO3) &ndash; determines the lifetime of many trace gases of importance to climate and human health, including air pollutants and the greenhouse gas methane. Ozone itself absorbs both longwave and shortwave radiation, and is a key greenhouse gas. The oxidants also affect the evolution, lifetime, and physical properties of primary and secondary aerosols in the atmosphere, modulating their radiative effects.  Understanding how these oxidants have changed over time is critical for understanding their chemical, climatic, and ecological consequences. In our project, we introduced a new model framework to improve estimates of the oxidative capacity across glacial-interglacial time scales, and we examined the implications of our results for current understanding of the observed ice core record of methane.  Activities. We developed a coupled climate-biosphere-chemistry framework for determining oxidant levels in the present and past troposphere. This model framework, called ICE age Climate And Proxies (ICECAP), relies on the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model driven by meteorological fields from the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) ModelE climate model. Land cover variables are from the BIOME4-TG global terrestrial equilibrium vegetation model, and historic fire emissions from the LMfire model. We tested uncertainties in biogenic, lightning, and biomass burning emissions across time, and examined the implications of emerging information on the photochemistry of isoprene, a key biogenic species.  We also implemented a simple parameterization describing the sensitivity of isoprene emissions to the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Tai et al., 2013).  Intellectual Merit. Our work has enhanced understanding of the trends in oxidation capacity of the atmosphere over time (Alexander and Mickley, 2015).  Our work has identified the major drivers of the variability in oxidation capacity on glacial/ interglacial timescales: water vapor, overhead ozone columns, and lightning NOx emissions.   In Murray et al. (2014), we found reduced oxidant levels in all preindustrial and paleo climates relative to the present day. Global mean OH changes by -6.7 &plusmn; 11% at the LGM relative to the preindustrial, despite reductions in methane concentrations. Key variables controlling the tropospheric oxidative capacity over glacial-interglacial periods include stratospheric ozone, tropospheric water vapor, and lightning emissions. Our simulations are consistent with ice core records of ?17O in sulfate and nitrate at the LGM, and CO, HCHO, and H2O2 in the preindustrial. Our results imply that the observed variability in ice-core methane is predominantly source-driven, consistent with previous bottom-up estimates of LGM wetland emissions.  In Achakulwisut et al. (2015), we found that global mean OH is especially sensitive to uncertainties in the treatment of biogenic species.  Across our sensitivity simulations, changes in the global mean OH levels for the LGM-to-preindustrial transition range between -29% and +7%, and those for the preindustrial-to-present day transition range between -8% and +17. Consistent with Murray et al. (2014), our results suggest that the observed glacial-interglacial variability in atmospheric methane concentrations is predominantly driven by changes in methane sources.  The large range of oxidant levels in our sensitivity simulations demonstrates the inadequacies in our understanding of drivers of OH.  Impacts.  The oxidation capacity determines the lifetimes of many gases important to climate and human health, and our results have importance for both the science and policymaking communities. We have provided a more complete interpretation of ice core observations of sulfate and nitrate isotopes, an outcome that improves constraints for modeling paleo chemist...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
