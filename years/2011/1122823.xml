<AbstractNarration>The California State University at Fullerton (CSUF) project entitled, 'Native American-based Mathematics Materials for Integration into Undergraduate Courses', further develops mathematics materials based in the mathematical traditions of Native American peoples for integration into undergraduate courses at CSUF, Turtle Mountain Community College (TMCC), and other Western States universities and colleges . Building on NSF-DUE Project 0341346, the researchers are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* further developing and enhancing materials based in mathematics and Native traditions, &lt;br/&gt;* continuing the integration of these materials into existing courses at the CSUF, TMCC and other sites,&lt;br/&gt;* fostering faculty expertise through classroom-ready lessons and previously utilized instructor-training models, &lt;br/&gt;* assessing the materials' effects on student attitude and dispositions toward mathematics by means of an external evaluator,&lt;br/&gt;* conducting research in the STEM affective domain, and&lt;br/&gt;* making these materials available for dissemination to other undergraduate institutions through both traditional and technology-based means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit is demonstrated by 1) its original and transformative nature, 2) advancing knowledge of the relationship between Native American culture and mathematics, 3) a partnership of public and Tribal institutions, and 4) a diversely-staffed framework for project development, implementation, evaluation and dissemination.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project are demonstrated in part by 1) a partnership which includes full-time university and community college faculty, Tribal colleges, graduate and undergraduate students, Tribal members and Elders, and 2) dissemination through professional meetings and publications, and technology-based means to allow all students to 'Think Indian' and have a fuller appreciation of the diversity of mathematics and Native American intellectual and cultural traditions.</AbstractNarration>

(The tabs "Lessons" and "Research" on the homepage should be especially helpful.) This webpage will continue to be hosted, maintained and updated by the Mathematics Department at the PI's site of professional affiliation, California State University Fullerton.)      Outcomes (as related to the Project Proposal's original statement of objectives)  1. The further development and enhancement of materials, both print and instructional technology-augmented lessons, based in Native traditions, mathematics and other intellectual fields has been the primary accomplishment of this Project. It is especially worth noting that we continued to first establish a cultural basis for our lessons, then moved to integration of both culture and content into our existing undergraduate courses.This unique disposition is the foundation of the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact of our overall Project.  2. Participants continued and extended the integration of these materials into a variety of existing courses at the CSUF, TMCC, SCC and other sites, including from new contacts made during national meetings, such as JMM of MAA/AMS and the NCTM Annual Meeting.  3. The PI and CoPIs fostered faculty expertise in the materials' mathematics, methods and cultural bases through our classroom-ready lessons using an established, previously utilized instructor-training model (the CSUF Mathematics Department's CAPI model).  4. The assessing of the materials' effects on student attitude and dispositions toward mathematics was scheduled in the Project timetable and carried out and documented as planned. All of the assessment tools, such as the Student Attitude Questionnaire, the Focus Group Protocol, and all the related user instructions and respondent permission forms were completed, piloted and revised for administration by the CSUF PI, the Project Evaluator and other Senior Personnel under the supervision of the CSUF IRB.  5. Participants conducted research in the Undergraduate STEM Education affective domain and added to that knowledge base through dissemination in formal professional and informal settings. As given in #4 above, all instrumentation for this assessment has been completed.  6. We continue to make these materials available for wider dissemination to other universities, and Tribal and community colleges--especially those serving this underrepresented student population, American Indian undergraduates. This is accomplished during our local, state, regional, and national dissemination efforts, as well as through our uses of technology, such as the CSUF-based webpage and the TMCC-based Facebook site.  Broader Statements Related to Project Outcomes:  1. All twelve lessons from the CCLI Phase 1/ TUES Type 2 have been updated and revised.  New versions were completed for both the paper and the technology-based components of these original lessons. The need for this updating and revising given in our Project Proposal was more of a necessity and an opportunity than we had originally anticipated--and our research and materials team approached the task with continued enthusiasm as we add six additional lessons and related materials to the original twelve lessons.  2. Six new lessons using the same template, formats and protocols as the initial twelve have been completed and have been similar piloted, revised, and assessed before course integration using Project procedures and stated attitude assessment instrumentation.

The participants see this extended scope of STEM-content lesson development, using the same Native-based cultural orientation, as a promising area of further future STEM research.  3. The Solutions Keys/Teachers' Guide was not only a positive and useful resource for instructors using the lessons and materials, but also a guide and impetus for enhancement, enrichment and mathematical/cultural/pedagogical strengthening of all of our lessons. Our research team continues to see these Keys/Guides as a valuable cultural and mathematical scholarly resource.

While still ongoing, findings to date with regard to student and instructor affect are encouraging, and will be further analyzed and disseminated as they become available--and are seen as a productive area for future, more formal research.
