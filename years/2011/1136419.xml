<AbstractNarration>This Type 1 Noyce project aims to produce 39 certified Noyce Scholars teaching in high-needs high schools by the end of the grant period, each of them having graduated as a mathematics or science major in a specific scientific discipline.  The project benefits from the institution's prior experience with a Noyce Teaching Fellows Planning Grant (0934604) and a collaborative project with Cal State University, Chico (0733758).  Other partner organizations include the Sacramento Unified school district, the Los Rios Community College District and The Parent Teacher Home Visit Project, a non-profit organization devoted to helping teachers appreciate the cultural and linguistic background of their students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Unusual features include early field experiences for the Scholars through a summer biotechnology workshop for high school students, scheduled home visits with mentor teachers to expand the Scholars' knowledge of their students' cultural and linguistic heritage, and a year-long highly structured induction period.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  In addition to the project's contribution to the teaching needs of high-needs school districts this project includes an extensive research project.  It follows the Noyce Scholars' development as teachers with the aim of informing future teacher preparation efforts throughout the California State System.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The SacMAST: Sacramento Math and Science Teaching Phase I Noyce project offered scholarships and stipends, and extensive research-based professional development opportunities, to 45 undergraduate or credential year STEM majors over a six-year period. Thirty-six of these Scholars are currently teaching in high-needs middle and high schools, 8 are still completing the teacher certification program, and one is earning a Master?s degree in mathematics before he completes his teaching service requirement. The Sacramento region is a highly diverse, urban area, with a predicted future need for teachers that outstrips almost every other city in the state of California. Therefore, these graduates are highly sought after. Intellectual merit of the proposed activity: Our Noyce Program evaluation plan has produced important new data regarding the effectiveness of the CSU Sacramento and CSU Chico Noyce Scholars Programs. Data from the PACT (Performance Assessment for California Teachers) assessment was combined with data from the CSU Center for Teacher Quality system-wide evaluation of teacher preparation graduates, which is a model for thorough, valid, and reliable post-graduation evaluation of teaching effectiveness. Combining PACT and CTQ data for our Noyce Scholars from the previous collaborative Phase I and this current proposal has resulted in a longitudinal data set that shows that Noyce Scholars in science performed significantly better than non-funded science teacher preparation candidates on the PACT assessment of teaching effectiveness. Broader impacts of the proposed activity: Most directly, SacMAST has impacted the math and science education of thousands of students attending schools in California, especially in the three largest public school districts in our region (predominantly serving urban, low income, socially and linguistically diverse students) through the teaching effectiveness of Noyce Scholars. In addition, Scholars and their future students benefited from our partnership with the Parent/Teacher Home Visit Project, a nationally recognized non-profit program which trains and supports teachers in cultural competency and in connecting with their students' families and communities. Scholars were trained by the project, and some accompanied veteran teachers on home visits during their certification year. Because Scholars were also placed for student teaching in public high schools where Small Learning Communities support Multiple Pathways and Career Academies which prepare students for college and career success, Scholars also learned how to share information with families regarding STEM learning and career opportunities.
