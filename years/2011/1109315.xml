<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the impact of swimming microorganisms on mixing.  As a typical phenomenon, small organisms in the ocean called copepods let themselves slowly sink while agitating the fluid around them.  Copepods form massive colonies and their collective motion helps bringing up nutrients, which are crucial to the organisms' reproduction, from deeper layers of the ocean.  The stirring of a fluid by such swimming creatures is called biomixing. We will investigate biomixing from a variety of directions: we will model specific microorganisms, and use novel mathematical techniques to quantify their impact on fluid mixing.  We will also compare the motion of these organisms as they sink to the dynamics of sedimenting particles, to see which aspects of the accumulated knowledge on sedimenting particles carry over to microorganisms, and which new features are introduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is well known that mixing is greatly enhanced by fluid motion--even the simple task of heating a house would be almost impossible without air convection.  Biomixing has a wide range of possible applications, beyond immediate relevance to the fluid dynamics of microswimmers.  An understanding of the impact of swimming microorganisms on mixing will help understanding phenomena such as oil breakup by bacteria, which is crucial in the aftermath of oil spills, or the life cycle of large colonies of organisms.  The well-being of these colonies has a profound impact on climate change, since they absorb vast amounts of greenhouse gases. In addition, there are potential applications to microfluidics, where stirring by microorganisms can assist mixing at small scales. The inclusion of graduate students into this research, and their interdisciplinary training are an integral part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microswimmers are a broad category of organisms.  They are swimmers where inertia plays a negligible role, due to their small size.  Examples include bacteria, spermatozoa, and some types of motile algae.  Modern experimental techniques have opened up new opportunities for studying microswimmers.  The more we know about them, the more we might be able to predict or control their motion to improve medical or industrial outcomes.  For example, can microbes help us clean up oil spills?  Can they be used for targeted drug delivery?  Intellectual merit: The research supported by this grant tackled a simple but profound question -- how is fluid displaced by these organisms?  It is well-know that we can stir a cup of coffee by moving a spoon, but can the organisms stir their own environment merely by moving through it?  This is important since stirring is very difficult at these microscopic scales, due to the lack of turbulence.  Broader impacts: The key outcome of the research was to characterize very precisely how the collective motion of the organisms displaces fluids.  The fluid motion obeys some striking statistics, called "non-Gaussian" for their deviation from normal behavior.  Surprisingly, a relatively simple model can explain experimental observation with very high precision.  An understanding of these basic observations is crucial if we are to ever exploit the stirring motion for medical or industrial purposes.
