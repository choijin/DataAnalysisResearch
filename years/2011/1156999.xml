<AbstractNarration>This international REU Site award at the University of Virginia (UVA) is partnering with the University of Venda (UNIVEN) located in Limpopo Province, South Africa to host this REU Site program. This program will introduce undergraduate students to the complexities of research at the interface between society, water, and human health disciplines. Undergraduate students will collaborate with faculty and graduate students to develop, design, and test culturally appropriate systems and technologies with regard to technical performance, benefits to human health, and local economic development potential. Research activities will be at multiple scales, including: 1) the molecular and antigenic characterization of Cryptosporidium and Enteroaggregative E. coli; 2) quantification of the effects of silver and copper nanoparticles on Cryptosporidium using a murine model, a conventional live-dead assay enhanced through dielectrophoretic cell pre-construction, and through the development of a new assay based on electro-rotation; 3) randomized community-level interventions (with appropriate controls) for point-of-use water treatment technologies and studies of their economic impact and effects on human health; and 4) development and testing of an agent-based model (ABM) to better understand the complex relations between water, sanitation, and human health with particular consideration of early childhood diarrhea and malnutrition. This research will also leverage a newly awarded grant that focuses on the relations between gastrointestinal infection and malnutrition in the rural communities surrounding UNIVEN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU student recruitment will focus on colleges without, or with only limited, graduate programs, including historically black colleges and universities in the state of Virginia. Students selected for the program will be placed in an interdisciplinary research team under the supervision of one or more of the principal investigators. Students will participate in team meetings via videoconferencing using Elluminate during the Spring and Fall semesters. Each student will participate in research activities during an 8-week period in Limpopo Province, S. Africa. Their summer experience will begin with a series of orientations with UVA and UNIVEN faculty and students. A doctoral student will serve as a coordinator and mentor for the undergraduate students throughout the summer. Student teams will be interdisciplinary by design, and will typically include REU students and UVA and UNIVEN undergraduates. Students will all reside in a gated facility of cottages where they will be able to share meals and experiences. During the Fall semester, students will be responsible for providing a written report of their research and giving an oral presentation via videoconferencing. REU students will be required to complete a 3-credit course at their home institution that is outside their major department but within the theme of the research program. The faculty team is diverse in discipline, race, and gender. Assessments of the overall program and student learning will be conducted for each student cohort.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary objective of this project is to provide an undergraduate international research experience working at the interface of water, societal, and human health disciplines. &nbsp;The project directly supported the research activities of over 30 undergraduate students and three graduate mentors from academic institutions across the USA. &nbsp;Most students conducted field and laboratory research in partnership with the University of Venda (UNIVEN) in Limpopo Province, South Africa. &nbsp;A subset of students had laboratory research experiences at the Univesity of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p> <p>Three student cohorts were supported with this grant in 2013, 2014, and 2015. &nbsp;Each cohort consisted of 9-12 students and were selected from annual applicant pools about approximately 100 students. &nbsp;Student participants received training through online meetings in the Spring, and traveled to South Africa for a 7-8-week period during the North American summer. &nbsp;Student participants were part of a larger cohort of students supported by other research funding of the UVA and UNIVEN faculty. &nbsp;Each summer approximately 30-40 students from both universities collaborated on research activities in South Africa. &nbsp;NSF-supported students were typically paired with a student from UNIVEN for their research experiences. &nbsp;Each year, one or two postdoctoral researchers and several faculty also guided their research experiences.</p> <p>Research activities were diverse, and included testing innovations in point-of-use water treatment technologies (e.g. treating water in the home just before consumption to improve water quality and health). &nbsp;The interventions studied included silver-ceramic water filters made locally in the region, silver-ceramic tablets, silver- and copper-impregnated paper filtes, and filters amended with activated alumina to remove fluoride occurring natural in regional ground water. &nbsp;Other interventions were aimed at providing education to primary and secondary school children on the link between water and health. &nbsp;Other research focused on the economic impacts and social acceptance of water technologies. &nbsp;Another team of students studied developed an architectural design for a ceramic filter production facility. &nbsp;Yet another group began to investigate the reasons for remarkably high teen pregnancy rates in a rural community near UNIVEN.</p> <p>Multiple student publications and conference presentations resulted from this research. &nbsp;In addition, two of the point-of-use water treatment technologies have advanced to broader use. &nbsp;The silver- and copper-impregnated paper filters are now being commercialized through Folia Water and Rorus Inc. &nbsp;The silver-ceramic tablets are now being commercialized through MadiDrop PBC. &nbsp;These technologies will likely bring safe water and improved health to hundreds of thousands of people in the developing world in the coming years.</p> <p>Student participants generally praised the value of their research experience. &nbsp;More than half of the student participants have already gone on to graduate programs. &nbsp;Four have been selected as recipients of NSF Graduate Research Fellowships.
