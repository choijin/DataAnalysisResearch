<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative award to advance mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) science by developing and operating advanced upper atmospheric lidar instruments.  The Consortium of Resonance and Rayleigh Lidars (CRRL) includes six universities:  the University of Colorado (CU) hosts the CRRL director and the unique CRRL Technology Center (CTC); the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in collaboration with Embry-Riddle University operates the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) in Cerro Pach√≥n, Chile; Northwest Research Associates/CoRA Division contributes to the operation of the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR) in Norway; and Utah State University (USU) in collaboration with Colorado State University (CSU) operates a sodium lidar in Utah.  The increasing number of middle and upper atmosphere observing stations around the globe, and the recent increase in data assimilation schemes for numerical models, indicates the growing movement in the community to address the middle and upper atmosphere as a global system requiring studies spanning a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  The Na resonance wind and temperature (Na W/T) lidar technique, central to CRRL, provides fundamental measurements of the MLT region at temporal and spatial resolutions that are difficult to achieve by other means.  As a result, Na W/T lidars have yielded fundamental advances in our understanding of MLT dynamics, thermal structure, chemistry, and microphysics that were previously impossible.  They are, therefore, key instruments for achieving the community goals of whole atmosphere modeling and system science studies.  The effort will consolidate and advance middle and upper atmosphere lidar systems leading to 1) improved coordination, performance, and scientific productivity of the three Na lidars currently at low, middle, and high latitudes, 2) more rapid and more efficient advances in lidar technology developments, implementations, and transfers, 3) active education and training, guest investigator, and outreach programs to educate future researchers and broaden the lidar user base in the upper atmosphere community, and 4) a coordinated vision and plan for the upper atmosphere lidar community.  The expanded measurement capabilities and community involvement anticipated within RRL, especially the ability of the Na lidars to measure both temperature and winds day and night, and the ability of the lidars to support and enhance correlative instrumentation at key sites, will ensure the maximum scientific benefit and the broadest possible applications of these systems.  Finally, CTC technology developments will strive to ensure the most efficient and comprehensive utilization of advancing technologies to the benefit of lidar research within and outside of CRRL.  The CRRL activities will have a broad impact 1) by enhancing the infrastructure for middle and upper atmosphere research and 2) by defining a new means of educating, managing and coordinating correlative research activities.  The greatest research benefits will occur through comprehensive and coordinated studies that merge multiple data sets and diverse scientific interests which will enable the greatest scientific return on the research investment.  CTC technology developments will also benefit from, and be of benefit to, technology developments currently outside the Aeronomy community.  The anticipated CRRL education, training, and guest investigator programs will ensure a group of talented and enthusiastic users to pursue lidar developments and applications in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This multi-year project investigated the boundary layer between the well-mix neutral atmosphere and the charged atmosphere, dominated by ions and electrons (ionosphere). The altitude range of this special layer is ~ 80 km and 110 km above the see surface, where the coldest temperature on Earth occurs and is termed &ldquo;mesopause region&rdquo;. The major scientific questions that this project addresses include:</p> <ol> <li>How does this layer response to the disturbances in the troposphere (below ~ 10 km), where all the weather events occur? </li> <li>How does this layer of atmosphere get affected by the solar activities, which dominate the variations of the ionosphere and above?</li> <li>What is the long-term trend in this part of the upper atmosphere, while the earth is experiencing climate change?</li> </ol> <p>Atationed at Utah State University (USU) at Logan Utah (41.7&deg;N, 111.8&deg;W), a Na lidar, using a pulsed laser operating at 589.16 nm (Orange color), illuminates the sodium (Na) atoms in this part of the atmosphere and measure neutral temperature and wind [Krueger et al., 2015].</p> <p>Managed by Professor Yuan in Center for Atmospheric and Space Sciences, the group has taken more than to 6000 hours of observation by the end of 2017, including ~ 2000 hours of observation under sunlight. Collaborating with more than 20 scientists from various institutes around the world, the group also generated 18 peer-reviewed journal publications since 2012.</p> <p><strong>Important discoveries:</strong></p> <p>The convection events, such as thunderstorms, near the surface of the Earth causes dramatic disturbances in the mesopause region. Large temperature and horizontal wind changes within short amount of time and altitude range, as much as ~ 20 Kelvin and more than 100 m/s within an hour, were observed frequently after the event [Yuan et al., 2016]. The mechanism of such dramatic variations is the gravity waves or buoyance waves generated during such disturbance near the surface. As they propagate upward into the upper atmosphere, their amplitude grow so large that they cannot maintain their wave form anymore and break. During this process, the amount of energy and momentum carrying along with these waves get released in the mesopause region, causing the aforementioned large temperature and wind variations, even causing atmosphere temporarily unstable [Cai et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2014].</p> <p>Similar to the short bursts of thunderstorm, large scale variation in the lower atmosphere also induces considerable changes in the mesopause region. As a case in point, the Sudden Stratospheric Warming in 2009 (more than 50 degree of temperature enhancement in stratosphere within a few days near 30 km altitude near Arctic region) caused ~ 30 degree cooling near the bottom of mesopause region, and the sodium density also dropped 90% compared to the climatological value. This study [Yuan et al., 2012] revealed for the first time that such intensive meteorology event in polar region affects the atmosphere ~ 50 km above in middle latitude.</p> <p>In addition to the disturbances from below, the mesopause region is also affected by the solar activities, such as Coronal Mess Ejections (CMEs) that are large expulsions of plasma and magnetic field. They causes intensive geomagnetic storm on earth where the breathtaking aurora are generated near the poles. At the same time, the Na lidar at Colorado and Utah observed tens of degree temperature increase (as much as more than 50 Kelvin) during the night near and above 100 km altitude [Yuan et al., 2015]. Fortunately, the temperature change becomes less into lower altitudes and noticeable change near 90 km and below is rare. However, there is no explanation what process induces such dramatic heating in the upper atmosphere of middle latitude.</p> <p>This lidar project has the longest temperature record in the upper atmosphere, covering period between 1990 and 2017. The most interesting finding is that, contrary to the warming in the troposphere, the mesopause region is cooling down about 2 Kelvin per decade [She et al., 2015]. This is mostly due to the increasing radiative cooling of CO<sub>2</sub> in the upper atmosphere.</p> <p><strong>Outreach and education</strong></p> <p>USU Na lidar involves students in many different aspects of the project, including &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; operation experience. To date, there have been 8 undergraduates, including a female student, and 3 graduate students working in the Na lidar program. In addition, the involvement of the Na lidar observatory during regular &ldquo;Astronomy Nights&rdquo; offered excellent opportunities for the general public to experience &ldquo;lidars in action&rdquo; and to learn the importance of aeronomy. The lidar facility provided a tour to the Optics and Photonics College Network organized by the National Center for Optics in summer 2017, when more than 50 high school physics teachers visited the USU Na lidar lab.
