<AbstractNarration>Specimen data in the nation's natural history museums are essential resources for understanding biological diversity, including many species of strategic importance to agriculture and national security.  Unfortunately this information is generally available by taxon type rather than integrated across kinds of organisms. This Thematic Collections Network (TCN) project addresses that problem by integrating specimen information and photographs from 14 botanical and 18 entomological collections across the United States.  The data captured will dramatically improve our understanding of the relationships among the more than 11,000 species of North American Hemiptera (scale insects, aphids, leafhoppers, true bugs, and relatives), their food plants, and the wasps that parasitize the hemipterans.  This TCN will utilize innovative technologies, including Web-accessible databases and high-resolution digital imaging, in order to capture and broadly disseminate via the Internet data for more than 1.6 million hemipteran, 200,000 parasitoid, and 6 million plant specimens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hemiptera is a group of insects containing many species of great economic importance in the United States.  The specimen information captured by this TCN project for this group and the groups of plants affected by these insects will be relevant for studies in agricultural sciences, climate change, invasive species, biological classification, conservation, and ecosystems.  It will represent a truly large-scale integration of data from the broadest range of non-federal collection resources in U.S. museums and universities, thereby making a significant contribution to the solution of national priorities by scientists, policy makers, and the general public.  Student participation and training in modern technologies are integral aspects of the project. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource.</AbstractNarration>

The individual project involved 1 lead and 3 collaborating institutions.  Specimen 'digitization' involves using an online database to collect information from and about natural history specimens.  This project is part of a larger effort (by NSF and other organizations) to make these data available to the public via the Internet through the iDigBio and Discoverlife portals.  Such data is useful not only to answer basic questions on the specifics of where and when particular species might be found, but also more derived questions of why such patterns might occur.  This project leveraged prior NSF-funded specimen-digitization efforts and technological approaches developed through the Planetary Biodiversity Inventories award for the study of plant bugs of the true-bug family Miridae as well as digitization of specimens in North American herbaria.  This project has also leveraged additional projects to digitize natural history specimens and make these data available online.  This individual project digitized 420,110 specimens, or 207% of the project goal of 203,000 databased specimens. Data from the whole project included 1,294,951 specimens of herbivore and 38,327 parasitoid insect specimens in 129 families, and 1,907,471 plant specimens in 20 families was captured, exceeding the projected goals in the original project proposal.  Specimen images were captured for approximately 50 percent of the digitized insect species and for all of the digitized plant specimens.  These data offer the most comprehensive digital record of host-plant associations so far assembled, and document a general pattern of close associations between insects and their plant hosts.
