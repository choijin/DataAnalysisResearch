<AbstractNarration>Amazon forests make up a large fraction of all tropical forests on Earth. These forests influence the global carbon and water cycles and, therefore, the global climate system.  In past decades, Amazonian forests have been severely altered or degraded by droughts, logging activities, forest fires, and deforestation.  In the near future, forest fires may increase in frequency as the climate changes in tropical regions.  However, there is very limited capacity to predict the potential trajectories of tropical forests given current and projected trends in land use and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, airborne and satellite remote sensing will be combined with statistical models to predict Amazon tree mortality, an important ecological process that influences total forest carbon accumulation and storage, species diversity, microclimate characteristics, and water flow.  The study will account for disturbances including fires, logging and droughts, as well as soil fertility and plant characteristics in the high diversity region of Madre de Dios, Peru.  While previous studies have attempted to develop tree mortality models for tropical forests, most of them either have been limited by small field-based sample sizes, or they lack geographic coverage and spatial detail. The novelty of this study, therefore, is to map mortality of individual trees across the landscape using airborne measurements, then to scale up to the larger regional level using a combination of satellite and modeling approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will contribute to the US Sustainable Landscape program of the U.S. Agency for International Development that is supporting programs in tropical nations designed to reduce emissions of carbon from deforestation and forest degradation. The project will also train two American doctoral students, three Latin American graduate students, and six undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Amazon forests are changing in response to increasingly severe drought episodes, fire, land use, invasion by C4 grasses, and rising atmospheric CO2. These responses cause globally significant changes in carbon fluxes to the atmosphere, shifts in forest structure and composition, and appear to interact synergistically to drive a wide-spread forest "dieback".  However, major gaps persist in our understanding of these processes.  We combined field work, aircraft-based imaging, and satellite data to better understand trends in Amazonian tropical forests undergoing drought, fire and other drivers of change.  We found that between 1984 and 2013 forest fires burned much larger areas in the eastern than western Amazon. The differences in burned area between those two regions apparently relate to greater sources of fire ignition and drier climatic conditions in the eastern Amazon compared to the western portion of the Basin.  Forest fires peaked during the dry season of drought years across the Amazon Basin. However, those peaks were substantially higher in the eastern Brazilian Amazon than in other regions.  Model-simulated increases in fire intensity and severity were primarily associated with greater fuel accumulation on the forest floor, which resulted from drought-induced changes in forest structure (considered an "indirect" effect). Secondarily, fire intensity and severity increased in response to the direct effect of the droughts on understory air dryness.  Our simulations suggest that future increases in radiative forcing (e.g., IPCC RCP 8.5) could double fire-induced carbon emissions per unit area burned, given projected increases in vapor pressure deficit (particularly after 2070).  We estimate that sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could mitigate these effects, reducing the area subject to "dangerous" fire intensity by 68%.  We also discovered that the effects of understory fires on tropical forests may last several years due delayed post-fire tree mortality. Our results suggest that windstorms could contribute to this pattern of delayed mortality, especially along forest edges.  Additionally, fire-related grass invasion into the forest edge of a forest located into southeast Amazonia was observed six years following experimental fires, suggesting that grass dominance in burned areas may persist for long periods.  Finally, using data across a wide array of lowland Amazonian forest landscapes, we find that upper canopy gaps &ndash; driven by branchfall &ndash; are pervasive features of every landscape studied, and are seven times more frequent than full tree mortality. Forest canopy branchfall comprises a major carbon source on a landscape basis, exceeding that of tree mortality by 21%.  However, forest canopy gaps generated between 2009 and 2011, and associated with the 2010 mega-drought, were dominated by new tree mortality and a pulse of biomass loss.  We demonstrated that remotely sensed high-spectral resolution imaging data can be used to predict forest canopy failure during mega-drought.
