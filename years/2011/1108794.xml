<AbstractNarration>The project focuses on further development of constructive and&lt;br/&gt;rigorous asymptotic analysis of linear and nonlinear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations that arise in a number of important physical&lt;br/&gt;applications. The applications include (a) evolution of small&lt;br/&gt;disturbances superposed on an oscillatory flow in a channel or pipe,&lt;br/&gt;of interest in transition to turbulence, (b) existence and stability&lt;br/&gt;of self-sustaining states in channel and pipe flows, believed to be&lt;br/&gt;omega-limits in intermediate Reynolds number turbulent flow, (c)&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear stability of steadily translating fingers and bubbles in&lt;br/&gt;Hele-Shaw flow for small nonzero surface tension, of interest in&lt;br/&gt;pattern formation, (d) ionization of Hydrogen atoms in time-periodic&lt;br/&gt;dipole fields of arbitrary frequency and amplitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Our understanding of the solutions of equations arising in fluid&lt;br/&gt;motion and quantum mechanics is still very limited.  The present&lt;br/&gt;project develops much needed new methods to study these problems.&lt;br/&gt;Among the immediate applications outside mathematics we note for&lt;br/&gt;instance that understanding turbulent fluid flow can lead to a more&lt;br/&gt;energy-efficient transportation of fluids through pipes. Also, better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of ionization processes has many applications, including&lt;br/&gt;optimal propagation of very intense laser beams through the&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere. Training of students --supported in the project-- will&lt;br/&gt;help maintain the high quality of research in the United States for&lt;br/&gt;the coming generation.</AbstractNarration>
