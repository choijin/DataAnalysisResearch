<AbstractNarration>Despite a ubiquitous distribution, the group of microorganisms known as Archaea still remains the most unexplored of life's domains. Among the Archaea, one organism (Nanoarchaeum equitans) is crucial for deciphering the history of the archaeal domain, yet there is only one characterized representative of this group. This heat-loving microbe grows and divides at the surface of another archaeon suggesting an obligate symbiotic, possibly ectoparasitic, lifestyle. The evolutionary placement of this organism is controversial and provides unique problems in taxonomy for training the next generation of microbial taxonomists. The major goal of this project is to clarify the pivotal position of the Nanoarchaetoa in the Tree of Life.  This information will greatly expand our understanding of the taxonomy and physiology of this group as well as our understanding of microbial systematics. In addition, the project will provide a unique opportunity to address how a symbiotic versus free-living lifestyle has impacted genome architecture, rate of evolution, and gene acquisition or loss in Archaea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project offers research opportunities and training to undergraduates, graduate students, and a post-doctoral research associate in classical and molecular approaches to taxonomy, bioinformatics, phylogenetic analyses, and novel concepts and controversies in modern microbial taxonomy. In addition, the project will provide hands-on experience in microbial taxonomic research to local high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most of the biodiversity on this planet resides in the microbial world. With the genomic revolution, we are discovering new phyla (major branches of life) that have previously evaded our discovery.  One such group is the tiny (200nm, about 7.8x10-6 inches!) Nanoarchaeota, that form the only known symbiotic association with other Archaea (life is classified into 3 domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea and Eukarya).  The first example of this association was reported in 2000 from shallow marine hot springs off the coast of Iceland.  This first small microbe, Nanoarchaeum equitans, has lost many of its genes to survive alone and has to rely on its host, Ignicoccus hospitalis, for all its basic lipids, amino acids and energy.  From gene surveys, we knew there many other Nanoarchaeota in deep-sea and terrestrial hot springs around the world, but we only had this one growing in the lab.  Without others to study, we could not understand the importance and the nature of these novel associations.  Therefore, the purpose of this project was to try obtain more of these host-symbiont associations, to explore if they have the same or different hosts, if their genomes have similar characteristics, and whether new genera and species could be characterized.  Additionally, an overall objective was to train the next generation of taxonomists to grow difficult-to-grow microbes, to describe new species using traditional and cutting edge new genomic technologies.   To this end, we discovered and characterized three new Nanoarchaeota-host systems: two from hot springs in Yellowstone National Park, and one from a New Zealand hot spring.  These represent new genera of Nanoarchaeota and they all have different hosts.  In particular, the host from the New Zealand hot spring, is a new genus as well.  To our surprise, these new terrestrial Nanoarchaeota differ in many ways from the original marine isolate.  In particular, they seem to have more metabolic capabilities and encode and express genes for flagella (see image).   The role of these flagella in the symbiosis is still under investigation.  In contrast to the orgincal marine host, Ignicoccus which is an chemolithoautotroph (uses inroganic carbon and inroganic chemcials for energy), the hosts of these terrestial Nanoarchaeota are all heterotrophs, using organic molecules for energy and carbon.

During the project, we also shared our research and discoveries through talks at several schools in Oregon and Washington. Through this study we have gained a deeper understanding of the evolution, diversification and extent of microbial symbioses and it will ultimately help elucidate how life?s interactions and organelles evolve. Furthermore, studying new lineages of life and their genomes, such as the Nanoarchaeota discovered in this project, can lead to new biotechnological and nanotechnological innovations.
