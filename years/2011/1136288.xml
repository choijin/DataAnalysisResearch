<AbstractNarration>With the support of a Capacity Building Grant, the University of Indianapolis is developing the infrastructure to support a Noyce Scholarship Program. Building on the success of its Woodrow Wilson Indiana Teaching Fellowship Program, which attracts recent graduates and career changers into urban science and mathematics teaching, the university seeks to increase the number of undergraduate chemistry majors entering teaching by 300% and undergraduate biology majors entering teaching by 100%.  The project goals include graduating 8-10 Noyce Scholars per year who are prepared to teach science in grades 7-12.  Specifically, the University of Indianapolis' College of Arts and Sciences and School of Education are developing the Noyce Scholarship Program in collaboration with Christel House Academy, Metropolitan School District of Decatur Township, Metropolitan School District of Perry Township, and Metropolitan School District of Wayne Township, all of which are qualified as high-need, in the state of Indiana.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project planning team, comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders, is creating a science teaching curriculum that is content-rich, requires Noyce Scholars to spend substantial time in partner schools, and includes mentoring support in the first three years of urban or rural high-need teaching.  The team is also creating strategies for recruiting high-ability students into science teaching, particularly those from underrepresented groups; working with University of Indianapolis advisors to recruit non-continuing pre-health students into science teaching; developing new partnerships with corporations and not-for-profit organizations to offer paid summer internships to Noyce Scholars; and devising institutional processes for scholarship selection, disbursement and compliance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes of the University of Indianapolis 2011 NSF Robert Noyce Scholarship Program Capacity Building Project Grant  The University of Indianapolis had the support of a 2-year Noyce Capacity Building Project grant to plan the infrastructure for a Phase I Robert Noyce Scholarship Program.  Building on the success of its Woodrow Wilson Indiana Teaching Fellowship Program, which attracts recent graduates and career changers into urban science and math teaching, the university planned a program that could potentially increase the number of undergraduate chemistry majors entering teaching by 300% and undergraduate biology majors entering teaching by 100%.  The goal was to develop a program that would graduate 8-10 Noyce Scholars per year, well-qualified and prepared to teach science in grades 7-12.  The University of IndianapolisÆ College of Arts and Sciences and School of Education developed the proposed Noyce Scholarship Program in collaboration with Christel House Academy, Metropolitan School District of Decatur Township, Metropolitan School District of Perry Township, and Metropolitan School District of Wayne Township, all of which qualify as high-need.      The project planning team, comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders, designed an integrated education-STEM content 4 + 1 program leading to a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree and licensure.  The science teaching curriculum was content-rich, included an independent undergraduate research experience, required Noyce Scholars to spend substantial time in partner schools, and included mentoring support in the first three years of urban or rural high-need teaching.  The team also researched strategies for recruiting high-ability students into science teaching, particularly those from underrepresented groups, along with ways to recruit pre-health-career majors into science teaching.  The work included developing new partnerships with corporations and not-for-profit organizations to offer paid summer internships to Noyce Scholars and devising institutional processes for scholarship selection, disbursement and compliance.     Intellectual Merit:  The University of Indianapolis Noyce Scholarship Program Capacity Building Grant focused on modeling best practices in program development through authentically collaborative relationships between the university and schools, the university and community organizations, and the College of Arts and Sciences and School of Education.  PI Stickney has presented on CAS/SOE collaboration at the 2012 NSTA National Conference on Science Education.  Co-PI Drake has presented on collaborative program development and authentic partnerships at annual meetings of the American Educational Teacher Association (AERA), the Association for Independent &amp; Liberal Arts Colleges of Teacher Education (AILACTE) and the Association for American Colleges of Teacher Education (AACTE), as well as at a meeting of U.S. Department of Education Teacher Quality Partnership Grant directors and evaluators.  The findings of the Noyce Capacity Building Grant will help to shape the national conversation about strategies for successful teacher education reform, particularly in STEM content areas.     Broader Impacts:  The program planning and development, funded by a NSF Robert Noyce Scholarship Program Capacity Building Project grant, enhanced the universityÆs already-established partnerships with urban high-need districts/schools.  It also helped the university&mdash;and by extension, our school partners&mdash;to develop mutually beneficial partnerships with community-based organizations engaged in STEM education.  Developing stronger networks of organizations and individuals committed to high-quality STEM education will increase the ability of network participants to provide all Indianapolis children with access to engaging and rigorous STEM experiences. Involvement in these networks should also increase the University of IndianapolisÆ opportunities to recruit ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
