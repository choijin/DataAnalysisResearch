<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;1130796&lt;br/&gt;Hosam Fathy&lt;br/&gt;Penn State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives:  This proposal addresses the fundamental problem of optimally controlling battery systems for performance, efficiency, and health.  The proposed research will use electrochemistry-based models for optimal battery management, with application to health-conscious battery charging, grid energy storage, and hybrid underwater vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;Scientific Merit:  The proposed research will add three original contributions to the literature.  First, it will furnish a novel framework for combined order and index reduction in electrochemistry-based battery models, thereby making these models more conducive to optimal control.  Second, it will use boundary control theory to optimize battery charging/discharging for long-term health.  Third, it will address the optimal power and thermal management of a battery pack as a single integrated problem.  Together, these contributions have the transformative potential to bridge the current gap between the electrochemistry and control technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research make a major contribution to battery energy storage and power management. The research discoveries will furnish two new courses on energy system modeling and optimal power management, and support two students in a lab with a solid record of recruiting and training outstanding underrepresented minority students.  The PI will disseminate this research to the electrochemistry and control communities ? as well as existing industrial collaborators ? through an edited textbook and web-based seminar series.  Finally, the research will enable the PI to incorporate a stronger battery energy storage components into existing toy kits for K-12 student education and outreach.</AbstractNarration>
