<AbstractNarration>Austin Community College District (ACC) will lead a planning grant for an Advanced Technological Education  Center for energy-related technician education. This planning grant's results will determine the goals, objectives, activities, and outcomes for a future regional center spanning the State of Texas.  This project will produce a statewide community college mentorship model in which colleges are mentored to become leaders in energy workforce development and education.  This project will also investigate the possibility of cross-mapping existing energy skill standards, determine if new skill standards are needed, and investigate the best ways to constantly review and update standards based on the needs of the industry and changes in policy.  Both cross-mapping and the mentoring model could be adopted and adapted by other states or a consortium of states.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Award #1103578 Expanding Community College Leadership to Meet Rapid Changes in Energy Education (Planning Grant)  Objectives  For this Planning Grant, we determined the need for and feasibility of a National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education Community College Energy Center for the state of Texas.  This study involves various energy stakeholders, including those in education, government and industry to perform the following:  Assess the demand for technicians in various energy fields and the training qualifications needed for each field. Assess the capability of Austin Community College (ACC) and its partners to meet the demand in those energy fields and meet the training qualifications for each field.  Perform a gap analysis that determines the strengths and weaknesses of the coalition to address the energy technician demand and qualifications.  Make recommendations that address any weaknesses found and determine whether a proposal for such an Energy Center is appropriate at this time.   Data Study  We studied regional workforce hiring trends for future industry energy needs. This included commissioning a study by SkillsNet, a company that combines a quantitative orientation with theories and methods available in the behavioral and social sciences.  Since Oil and Gas Technology is mature and is addressed across the state of Texas, particularly in the Houston / Beaumont area, we will not address Oil and Gas as one of our targeted occupations for study. The six occupations that we studied were:   Solar Photovoltaic Installers Solar Thermal Installers  Wind Turbine Service Technician  Biofuel &amp; Biomass Plant Technicians  Electrical Power-Line Installers  Electrical Equipment Repairers (Powerhouse, Relay, Substation)           Project Outcomes  The gap analysis that we performed shows that the industry demand for these selected occupations is strong only for Electrical Power-Line Installer. At this time, demand for the other occupations studied is either flat or premature for educational program development. Therefore, the existing program at ACC for the Lineworker specialization, which offers certificates and the associate degree, addresses the requirements listed in the Detailed Work Activity (DWA) and Knowledge, Skill and Ability (KSA) profiles for this occupation. In addition, Austin Community had already performed a joint analysis of this program with other programs within the Electronics and Advanced Technologies department.  Austin is one of the leading cities in the U.S. with respect to green energy and would be well positioned to expand and enhance the Renewable Energy Technician program when the demand increases. Also, the state of Texas is unique in that it has its own independent energy grid and employs a variety of energy sources. As the various energy technologies mature, Texas is also well positioned to host a regional energy center.  The network of colleges willing to partner in the various energy areas have existing curricula to address each of the occupations studied as well as strong programs focused on Oil and Gas Technology.   Recommendations   Given that the regional demand for Solar Technicians is low and that the Wind Turbine Technician demand is rather localized to specific areas of the state, the most promising programs for curriculum development are our Power Technology and Utility Lineworker programs. ACC is partnering with Texas State Technical College to analyze these programs under the auspices of a Perkins Grant to provide Learning Outcomes Alignment using detailed occupational skills.  It is our conclusion that given the results of our data study, industry input and gap analysis, a Texas Regional ATE Energy Center, as originally described, is not justified at this time.
