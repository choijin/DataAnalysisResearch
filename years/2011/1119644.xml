<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 July 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1119644&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Scripps Institute of Oceanography&lt;br/&gt;PI:   B. Appelgate&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  Z. Kelety&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests Shipboard Scientific Support items for the vessels operated by Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) namely; the R/V REVELLE, MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON, and SRPOUL.  Requests include: (1) a quick-acting emergency escape hatch for NEW HORIZON, (2) new RADAR and refrigerator for SPROUL, (3) a Doppler speed log for REVELLE.  All items requested will either enhance safety, bring vessels into current regulatory compliance, or provide greatly improved science support capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   SIO vessels support federally-funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans and routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  SIO participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events, student tours, and hosting of government officials, dignitaries, and science communities while in foreign ports.  All told, Scripps vessels are scheduled to complete nearly 400 NSF sponsored days in 2011.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scripps Institution of Oceanography OCE-1119644  Project Outcomes Report  The Scripps Institution of Oceanography was funded for multiple items under this grant.  The Scripps Institution of Oceanography replace obsolete radars onboard research vessel Robert Gordon Sproul.  The shipÆs radar was replaced with a up-to-date maritime application x-band radar.  The radar has an easy to use multi-color format and ability to perform automatic target tracking of up to ten contacts.  This radar will increase the navigational safety of the vessel and improve the science mission performance of the vessel by preventing interfering vessels from getting close to the vessel without warning. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography replaced speed log onboard research vessel Roger Revelle.  The shipÆs Doppler speed log was aging and has been replaced with a Furuno DS80.  This unit was chosen to comply with the latest IMO, IEC and ISO standards and the rules of the classification societies.  This speed log will increase the navigational safety of the vessel and improve the science mission performance of the vessel by providing an accurate means to evaluate shipÆs speed over ground and allow fine control of dynamic positioning operations.  Science users often desire to maintain a fixed position in the water.  Having a source of speed to vital to these operations.   The Scripps Institution of Oceanography replaced the refrigerator/freezer onboard research vessel Robert Gordon Sproul. The old refrigerator was removed and replaced with a Cospolich modular upright refrigerator/freezer. Exterior and interior of all standard cabinets, including front, sides, doors and louvered grill are constructed of heavy gauge stainless steel.  The door unit was designed to withstand the continuous use and abuse that is common in food service applications. Resilient vinyl gaskets which are pre-formed in frames with welded corners greatly inhibit bacterial growth.  This refrigerator allows the ship to safely handle food without fear of spoilage and increases the likelihood of successful science operator through safe food sources. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography replaced escape hatches onboard research vessel New Horizon: The new hatches improving ingress and egress to the after-steering compartment and dry stores room, ensuring the safety of personnel in emergency situations.
