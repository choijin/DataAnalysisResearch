<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation will support the research program of Professor Wilfred Tysoe of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  Dr. Tysoe and his students will explore oxidative reaction pathways on model gold-palladium alloy catalysts, using a combination of surface science spectroscopic probes and computational modeling of the reaction processes.  The work focuses on developing a molecular level understanding of reaction pathways for vinyl acetate monomer synthesis, direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis, and CO and alcohol oxidation reactions.  The nature of the surface oxygen displaying catalytic activity will be probed in these studies.  Fundamental insights obtained in these studies will aid in the design and development of active catalysts for commercial application.  The work also provides a training ground for students in this technologically important field.  Women and underrepresented minority students make up a large portion of the research team.</AbstractNarration>

Here, acetic acid (the basis of vinegar) reacts with the surface of the catalyst by losing a hydrogen atom to form adsorbed acetate species. Ethylene (C2H4) then couples to the acetate species to form a short-lived intermediate that then loses a second hydrogen to form VAM. The hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce water.  We also investigated the effect of alloy structure on the catalytic activity and found that alloying palladium with gold produces a more active VAM formation catalyst, as found commercially. The catalytic activity of alloys is conventionally described using two effects; "electronic" and "ensemble" effects. As "electronic" effect implies, the activity is proposed to improve by one metal in the alloy (here, gold) modifying the electronic structure of the second metal (palladium) to influence its reactivity. In the "ensemble effect", a particular arrangement of atoms at the surface influences the ability of adsorbates to bind to the alloy.

Curiously, we also found that the alloys with large amounts of gold (more than 50%) on the surface, which had been found to be the most active for VAM formation at high pressures, were completely inactive under our ultrahigh vacuum conditions. However, exposing model alloy catalysts to high pressures of oxygen caused palladium atoms in the bulk of the s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
