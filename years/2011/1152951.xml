<AbstractNarration>Professors Ursula Mazur and K. W. Hipps of Washington State University are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct research that employs a combination of experimental and synthetic methods for studying the molecular and submolecular scale chemical, electronic, and material properties of porphyrin and phthalocyanine nanostructured aggregates.  The overall goal of the proposed research is to attain an in depth understanding of: (1) the driving forces behind molecular ordering, dimensions, and morphology in the nanostructures, (2) the nature of electronic communication between the molecules comprising different aggregate structures, and (3) the impact of (1) and (2) on the conductivity (transverse and longitudinal) of aggregates in contact with a metallic surface under different environmental conditions. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research provides new insights about the structural and electronic changes associated with the formation of nanostructures from electroactive organic monomers.  A fundamental understanding of the morphology-structure-function relationships enables rational design of nanostructures for a particular electronic, photonic, or sensing application.  The results from this research would impact several important areas of modern technology, including chemical and light sensors, photocells, catalysis, and molecular electronics.  This project provides an exceptional training environment for students (graduate, undergraduate, and high school) by integrating cutting-edge nanoscale energy related research with training in scientific integrity, teamwork, and leadership.</AbstractNarration>
