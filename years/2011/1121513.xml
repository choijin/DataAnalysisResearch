<AbstractNarration>In most organisms, including humans, estimating rates of mortality and the causes of death is critical to understanding their ecology.  Unfortunately, for phytoplankton (the microscopic photosynthetic organisms at the base of food chains in lakes and oceans) we do not know why and how they die.  This lack of knowledge is a problem because phytoplankton death may be a critical factor in understanding harmful algal blooms, and responses to pollution or changing climate.  The investigators will adapt cell biology techniques commonly used in medicine (including microscopy and flow cytometry - a specialized technique for rapidly measuring living cells), to study death in phytoplankton in the laboratory and in freshwater ponds and lakes.  They will determine the key environmental factors (e.g. temperature, light or availability of nutrients) that trigger death in phytoplankton, and when and how phytoplankton die in nature.  This information will be used to develop a mathematical model of how individual phytoplankton cells grow, divide and die, depending on environmental conditions.  The techniques and the model will improve the ability to monitor aquatic ecosystems to detect environmental threats, predict the effects of environmental change and inform management decisions.  The research will promote training of undergraduates, integrating them into interdisciplinary research experiences through programs in biology and mathematics at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) and environmental science and engineering at Northeastern University (NEU).  Participation of under-represented groups will be facilitated through UWM?s McNair scholars program and NEU's Opportunities for Undergraduate Research on the Charles River program.  A portable flow cytometer will enhance infrastructure for research and education, and enrich undergraduate limnology classes at UWM by introducing a new technology.  Broad dissemination of results and improvement of public understanding of science will be facilitated through a series of public seminars, and continuing development of web-based educational materials.</AbstractNarration>

For example, while we know a great deal about what makes them grow, we know very little about how they die.  Such understanding is important because phytoplankton are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions (e.g. climate), and this can lead to occurrences such as nuisance or toxic blooms.  Our project studied the diverse phytoplankton in a small, freshwater pond throughout the seasons over several years to determine when and how they died.  We used a flow cytometer (an instrument capable of rapidly counting and characterizing algal cells) to classify and sort living from dead cells.  Our work showed that different species of phytoplankton grew and died over the course of the year in a generally predictable pattern.  We developed a mathematical model to help predict these changes.  Although we had suspected that seasonal extremes of sunlight or temperature, or the depletion of the nutrients the algae require would cause them to die, this did not to be the case.  Instead, we found that death occasionally coincided with appearance of viruses, suggesting that these pathogens are sometimes responsible for death.  In many other cases, the death of one phytoplankton species was associated with the rise of another, suggesting interactions among the species, which we believe may take the form of a sort of "chemical warfare" called allelopathy.  Our research has helped a number of graduate and undergraduate students to develop abilities in field biology, technical skills in flow cytometry and polish their education in quantitative biology and mathematical modeling.  We have presented our work, not only in the scientific literature and at national and international conferences, but also to the local high school and in collaboration with a local park user group.
