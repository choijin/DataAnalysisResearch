<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports integrated research, education and outreach activities in theoretical condensed matter physics.  The goal of this project is to study and model: 1) carrier-carrier, 2) carrier-phonon and 3) carrier-photon interactions in narrow gap compound semiconductor heterostructures such as indium antimonide/aluminum indium antimonide quantum wells and carbon based nanostructures.  These materials are promising for our next generation of high speed transistors and detectors.  Although seemingly very different, they share common features, 1) an energy-wavevector relationship that is linear for large wavevector, and 2) high room temperature mobilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves calculating and modeling the time-dependent optical and transport properties of semiconductor nanostructures.  Foci include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.) Single-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene.  While the unusual DC transport properties of these materials have been previously studied, their dynamical properties are proving to be equally interesting. Coherent phonons in carbon nanotubes,  graphene and graphene nanoribbons will be modeled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.) Narrow gap InSb heterostructures.   With their small effective masses and large g-factors, these materials are excellent candidates for fast transistors or novel spintronic devices. The time-dependent optical properties of these materials will be calculated and modeled to gain information about the electronic and magnetic states and transport properties.  Close coupling between theory and experiment will provide an understanding of the carrier, spin, and phonon dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students on this project will be trained in forefront research topics in the nanosciences including the fields of semiconductor physics, quantum optics, nanotube and nanoribbon physics, and transport theory. The students will get a chance to participate and interact with researchers both in the U.S. and also internationally.   Results of their work will help determine which materials are optimal for future high speed nano-electronic devices and detectors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award integrates research, education and outreach in theoretical condensed matter physics.  The motivation of the project is to study and understand properties of two new classes of nanostructured materials that are promising materials for the next generation of high speed transistors, and optical sources and detectors.  These materials are: 1.) structures made of carbon that resemble ribbons or tubes of nanoscale dimensions - some ten thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair - called carbon nanotubes and carbon nanoribbons, 2.) graphene which is a single layer of carbon atoms which resembles chickenwire on the nanoscale with carbon atoms arranged at the vertices, and 3.) nanoscale structures made of a compound composed of elements indium and antimony, called indium antimonide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While these materials at first seem may seem very different, they share several common properties. In particular, their electronic properties are very similar and at room temperature, electrons in graphene and indium antimonide nanostructures can move faster and more easily than electrons in almost any other material including silicon and gallium arsenide.  This offers hope that transistors based on these two materials may one day replace transistors based on silicon technology, currently used in today's computers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate how electrons in carbon and indium antimonide nanostructures interact and scatter with 1.) other electrons, 2.) atoms that are moving in the nanostructures and 3.) electromagnetic radiation.  The interaction with electromagnetic radiation is particularly intriguing since results suggest that these materials might be used to generate and detect electromagnetic radiation in the tera Hertz part of the spectrum which lies between microwaves and infrared light.   Tera Hertz radiation is non-ionizing; one day sources of this radiation may replace X-rays in medical imaging with fewer harmful side effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students on this project will be trained in forefront research topics in the nanosciences including the fields of semiconductor physics, quantum optics, nanotube and nanoribbon physics, and transport theory. The students will get a chance to participate and interact with researchers both in the U.S. and also internationally.   Results of their work will help determine which materials are optimal for future high speed nano-electronic devices and detectors.</AbstractNarration>

Graduate students on this project were trained in forefront research topics in nanoscience and nanotechnology including the fields of semiconductor physics, quantum optics, nanotube and nanoribbon physics, and transport theory. Training of the students and researchers has enhanced our future workforce in a high technology field. Research Highlights:    1.  Chirality dependence of coherent phonon amplitudes in single-wall carbon nanotubes.    We simulated the ultrafast dynamics of laser-induced coherent phonons in single-wall carbon nanotubes photoexcited by ultrafast laser pulses.  We found that the RBM coherent phonon amplitudes are very sensitive to changes in excitation energy and depend strongly on the nanotube chirality and can start coherent RBM vibrations by either expanding or shrinking their diameters. A guide for experimentalists is shown in Fig. 1.    2. Ultrafast Generation of Fundamental and Multiple-order Phonon Excitations in Highly-Enriched Single-Wall (6,5)  Carbon Nanotubes.    We investigated coherent phonons generated in highly enriched (6,5) single-wall carbon nanotubes. We found that many coherent phonon modes were present apart from the dominant coherent RBM mode. A total of 14 such modes were clearly resolved and identified as shown in figure 2a.   The observed modes were compared with our theoretical calculations to identify the observed peaks and determine the frequencies of individual and combined modes (figure 2b.)    3.  Electron and Hole Active Cyclotron Resonance in Graphene.    Graphene provides an ideal arena for studying interactions between phonons, electrons, holes, and spins in two-dimensional systems. Dynamical quantities such as circularly polarized cyclotron resonance can have unusual properties, which result from the linear                                                   E  vs. k electronic dispersion relation.   We calculated the cyclotron resaonance and  compared with experiment  to find:     i) Even  an undoped sample will exhibit      cyclotron resonance due to the presence of both electrons and holes in the      lowest Landau level.    ii) In a doped system,      the cyclotron resonance is present for both e-active and h-active circular polarization. The asymmetry between the two peaks allows one to accurately determine      carrier density.  Results are shown      in figure 3.       4. Cyclotron resonance in ferromagnetic InMnAs and InMnSb.    We investigated magneto-optical properties of  In1&minus;xMnxAs and In1&minus;xMnxSb ferromagne...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
