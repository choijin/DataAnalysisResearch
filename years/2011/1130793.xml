<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to develop an integrated instrument package including a polarized imaging sensor capable of measuring all Stokes parameters of the optical field with high temporal and spatial resolution. This instrument package will be deployed underwater and will be programmed to automatically record measurements of the near-surface polarized optical field at regular time-steps while re-orienting over the full solid angle. These measurements, used in combination with measurements of the associated water's Inherent Optical Properties and Monte Carlo based radiative-transfer modeling, are expected to lead to enhanced understanding both of optical radiative transfer relevant to remote sensing, and also of the adaptation mechanisms employed by biological organisms, either to enhance their contrast for communication or to conceal themselves against the polarized optical background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the PIs will have developed an underwater polarimetric camera that can be deployed in variety of ocean conditions. This could lead to new discoveries in engineering, oceanography, biology, geology, and physics. The instrument itself may also lead to advancements in biomedical imaging, where polarization has shown significant promise. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will certainly appeal to a large number of groups, and is prime for educational outreach for all age groups. All three PIs are actively engaged in educational and community outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The near surface underwater light environment contains dynamic patterns of polarization, a property of light that is undetected by human eyes yet is detected by many other animals and manmade satellites.  The polarization light fields are a significant part of the structure of the near surface open-ocean environment and the use of these light fields in animal communication and camouflage has been previously neglected because of a lack in technological capacity to examine this dynamic light field. The technology developed from this grant has allowed for major impacts in the fields of communication, camouflage, and polarization biology in aquatic environments because it provided the capability to dynamically monitor organisms and the polarization environment for longer periods of time than was previously possible.  We have deployed high resolution grey scale polarization cameras in custom built underwater housings that are tethered to surface computers via underwater Ethernet cables.  These cameras have been outfitted with sensors capable of measuring depth, temperature, compass angle, and inclination angle.  This video-polarimeter system has enabled the completion of an intensive study measuring and quantifying the polarization and intensity camouflage of open ocean fish species from the Carangidae family.  Carangid fish that were native to the open ocean environment were shown to outperform nearshore carangid fish in terms of camouflage as well as other reflective strategies (e.g. mirrors) in this complex light environment.  We have used the camera system to identify the polarization altering properties and the structural mechanisms by which these fish accomplish polaro-crypsis.  We have successfully used the camera system to characterize the first evidence for vertebrate use of polarization in communication.  Specifically, we have conducted a polarization-manipulating mate choice experiment with swordtail fishes and found that female swordtails prefer polarization-ornamented males, and that males socially modulate their polarization signaling based on social context.  We have used the camera to identify habitat-specific differences in polarization properties of the ocean and paired that with polarization reflectance measurements of different fish species inhabiting those different ocean environments.  We have used this camera with the underwater housings to measure the polarization reflectance of fish species in different social contexts and of octopuses in varying polarization environmental assays.  The results of our measurement system have been cited in many popular news and media outlets, educating the public about polarization camouflage and the possible applications of these biomimicry models for camouflage. The Cummings lab has engaged local underrepresented middle school students in polarization research targeted and worked with local education groups (e.g.  GirlAdvocates!) to use education to empower young girls in the Austin area.
