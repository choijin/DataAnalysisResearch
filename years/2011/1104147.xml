<AbstractNarration>This grant is to help support costs for a conference on air quality and climate for the Asian-Pacific region.  The conference is scheduled to be held March 14-19, 2011 in Kona, Big Island, Hawaii.  The objectives of this conference are to (1) discuss the research issues at the nexus of air quality and&lt;br/&gt;climate with particular concern for the Asian-Pacific region, and (2) assess practical research needs and opportunities in areas of, but not necessarily restricted to, air quality trends of megacities, air pollution and weather modification, accelerated regional pollution exposure with climate change, and multi-pollutant air&lt;br/&gt;quality/climate management.  The current science and technology outlook for East Asia and the Pacific Rim, as related to climate and&lt;br/&gt;air quality, will be explored at the conference. Discussion will also identify the depth and coverage of current knowledge, as well as its limitations, and the probable need for sustained investigations in the future to fill knowledge gaps and improve capability for applications to environmental management.  The conference will be arranged so that the sessions will occur in series with discussion of each major topical area. Each session will be co-chaired by leading scientists in the field, and will include a 30-minute presentation followed by 10 to 15 minutes of summary views presented by a panel of several discussants. An open discussion will follow for each topic. Papers in poster form are encouraged to complement the invited speakers and invited discussants, so that participants can develop a broad view of ongoing topical research. The invited lead-in presenters are encouraged to provide a broad but brief summary of research carried out in East Asia and the Pacific Rim since the 1990s, and present a hypothetical discussion guide to ?important? future research in the topical areas.  The conference will explore long-term theoretical, field, and laboratory research opportunities in the conference topical areas: How does research and development inform policy makers in, for example, the energy and transportation sectors? What are the questions in the next twenty-five years that can be addressed by long-term science and technology in the Asian-Pacific region? Can energy transportation and other actions be moderated or modified by long-term research and development results? Research initiatives may emerge that can serve as the basis for future collaborations in the Asian-Pacific region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the ENG Environmental Sustainability program, the GEO Atmospheric Chemistry program, and OISE-China.</AbstractNarration>

Award Title: Air quality and climate conference, March 14-19, 2011 Kona, Big Island, Hawaii  Award number: NSF 1104147  PI Name: David Shaw  Intellectual Merit: Rapid economic growth in East Asia has required increased demand for electricity and transportation, with their concomitant pollutants and adverse effects. Domestic and international needs for low&ndash;carbon energy are central to priorities in technology development for Mainland China and Taiwan. At the same time, the food supply in East Asia is increasingly vulnerable to the influence of climate change, especially in Northern China where the water supply is erratic and potentially limited.  Domestic and regional economic development issues blending energy and other human needs with undesirable pollutant byproducts create motivation to advance climate related sciences. These requirements are being met by the Asian science community with support from the rest of the world.   The Conference on Air Quality and Climat held in Waikoloa, HI, March 14-19, 2011, explored air quality climate relationships for countries around the Pacific Rim. The meeting attracted more than 50 delegates from Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, Ethiopia, and the United States. Research topics were posed within six areas related to climate and air quality interactions: (1) the technological outlook for Asian energy production and use, (2) weather and precipitation modification, (3) air quality and megacities, (4) multipollutant air quality management, (5) regional pollution and long-range pollutant transport, and (6) mercury as a global and regional pollutant.   Broader Impact: Among the key research questions discussed were:  What are the critical issues at the nexus of air quality and climate with respect to atmospheric gases and particles at the process level? What are the projected changes in precipitation patterns that could be ascribed to air quality influence, especially relevant to emissions from power plants and transportation vehicles? How will the evolution of rapid large-scale economic development affect air quality and regional climate in the East Asia&ndash;Pacific Rim region? How will the impact of emissions from industrialization and urban development in the region change the patterns of drought and flood? What are the projected changes in precipitation patterns that could be ascribed to air quality influences, especially relevant to emissions from power plants and transportation vehicles? Can a major research program, complementing existing work and conducted cooperatively in the Asia&ndash;Pacific Rim region, lead to efficient and effective options for combined air quality/ climate/energy policies?     Discussions from the Hawaii conference affirmed the potential importance of interactions between climate and air quality. The delegates envisioned a comprehensive program to facilitate the development of long-term multinational cooperative research embodying the elements discussed below.  Integration of Energy/Air Quality/Climate Policies Aerosol&ndash;Cloud Interactions Atmospheric Chemistry Integrated System Model Improvement, Application, and Validation    Until recently, research, regulations and development of management strategies in the areas of air quality and climate have developed separately. This conference has confirmed that air quality and climate change are overlapping and inter-linked challenges indicating that both air quality and climate should be addressed in a coupled manner.
