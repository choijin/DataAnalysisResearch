<AbstractNarration>The project aims to create a personalized student learning environment by blending emerging Internet technology, software, computer interfacing, cutting edge graphical user interface, effective pedagogical designs, and assessment and evaluation schemes. The developed environment will have five major features: a) live faculty presentation for a laboratory session; b) provision of integration with a range of STEM courses; c) video, audio, text messaging capability; d) provision of collaboration with frequent student feedback; and e) faculty/facilitator monitoring of student progress and activities. The remote laboratory entails physical (real) laboratory equipment being controlled remotely. The developed environment will be validated by using it in an undergraduate level laboratory course (control systems laboratory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this project will be instrumental in bringing a transformation from a production-line style laboratory delivery system, where every student goes through the same treatment irrespective of their level of knowledge, learning style, and pace of learning, to a personalized and individualized approach with a level of collaboration. This will help students with diverse background to progress toward their learning goals and thus increase retention and graduation rates.  The approach will also be widely applicable to other areas such as distance learning, skill development, and corporate and workforce training.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project blends emerging Internet technology, software, computer interfacing, cutting edge graphical user interface, effective pedagogical designs, and assessment and evaluation schemes.  It was accomplished with several major features: a) live faculty presentation for a laboratory session; b) provision of integration with a range of STEM courses; c) video, audio, text messaging capability; d) provision of collaboration with frequent student feedback; and e) faculty/facilitator monitoring of student progress and activities.  The remote laboratory entails physical (real) laboratory equipment being controlled remotely.  The developed environment will be validated by using this for offering an undergraduate level laboratory course (control systems laboratory).  The project investigates a radical approach for delivering laboratory courses while utilizing the benefits of emerging computer and web technology (software and hardware) in education.  The remote laboratory entails the operation of real hardware systems over the web from any location.  The research from this project bring advances in cross discipline integration while addressing unique challenges posed by an unpredictable arena of human learning and utilization of emerging technologies to materialize one?s potential to achieve the highest possible performance.  The activities within the project are based on the PI?s earlier NSF grant and explores the gathered knowledge so that the remote laboratory can move to the next level by making it flexible and more effective for a range of STEM subject areas.  The outcome of this project is instrumental in bringing a transformation from a production-line style laboratory delivery system (where every student goes through the same treatment irrespective of their level of knowledge, learning style, and pace of learning) to a personalized and individualized approach with a level of collaboration.  Finally, it is hoped that this project will be widely applicable to other subject areas including distance learning, skill development, and corporate and workforce training.  The environment will offer a much more engaging and flexible laboratory system and thus play an important role in popularizing the use of the remote laboratory as a standalone or to complement traditional laboratory courses.  The strategy will maximize students? learning, while ensuring the proper use of available laboratory resources rather than allowing laboratory equipment to lay idle most of its working life.  Capacity developed from earlier projects as well as the outcome from this project will help the PI to institutionalize the remote laboratory.  This will stimulate new partnerships between various STEM disciplines that will take this initiative to the next level.  As an additional benefit, the engaging laboratory will have the potential to attract women and minority groups toward the STEM disciplines.  It has been generally difficult for these groups to benefit from the traditional form of laboratory course delivery.  The project has attained highly impressive results.  The project is well grounded in science education, psychology, and new technologies.  Its design may widely represented in future projects that can benefit from well-designed laboratory experiences.  The results of the weekly surveys administered to students revealed that high percentages of the students regarded the course and their experiences in it favorably. Between 75% and 88% agreed with such statement as "Support materials provided for the Internet laboratory were useful" (88%) and "The navigation through the Internet laboratory environment was user friendly (87%).  On average, even higher percentages of students reported favorable agreement with statements presented to them while they were using the laboratory.  Close to 90 percent agreed with course laboratory enjoyment and how important the experience was to their future goals.
