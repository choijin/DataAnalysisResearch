<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will optimize and pilot test the &lt;br/&gt;patent-pending Exogen system for the generation of biogas during wastewater &lt;br/&gt;treatment. Based on a newly discovered process called electromethanogenesis, ExogenTM &lt;br/&gt;uses applied voltages and bio-electrodes to increase wastewater treatment rates and &lt;br/&gt;methane fraction compared to competing fixed-film anaerobic digestion processes. Phase &lt;br/&gt;I R&amp;D demonstrated (1) 30% - 50% increase in chemical oxygen demand removal rate, &lt;br/&gt;(2) 30%-60% increase in biogas production, (3) 5 - 18% increase in methane &lt;br/&gt;concentrations with both artificial and real-world wastewater, resulting in a payback &lt;br/&gt;period of 1.7 - 3.7 years. Further benefits include reduction in start-up time and the &lt;br/&gt;potential for real-time automation via direct electrical feedback. During Phase II R&amp;D &lt;br/&gt;Cambrian Innovation will optimize the technology and build a scaled demonstration plant &lt;br/&gt;at a customer site &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to help alleviate the conflicting &lt;br/&gt;demands for water and energy in the United States and across the industrialized world by &lt;br/&gt;enhancing the process of generating energy from wastewater treatment. Anaerobic &lt;br/&gt;digestion can generate energy from wastewater. A recent AgSTAR report has highlighted &lt;br/&gt;the potential for this technology in the U.S., identifying over 8,000 livestock facilities &lt;br/&gt;and numerous industrial sites suitable for the technology. Cambrian's ExogenTM platform &lt;br/&gt;aims to decrease the costs and increase the benefit associated with deploying anaerobic &lt;br/&gt;digestion in key industry segments, resulting in faster diffusion. Eventually the &lt;br/&gt;technology could open up new industries for anaerobic digestion processes. Exogen  &lt;br/&gt;further has the potential for carbon sequestration via the direct reduction of CO2 to CH4. &lt;br/&gt;As such, ExogenTM technology offers a broad range of applications with significant &lt;br/&gt;societal benefit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  EcoVolt&reg;: Enhanced Anaerobic Digestion using Bio-electrodes  NSF Phase II Award:  1152409  June 29, 2015  Cambrian Innovation has successfully completed Phase II and Phase IIB SBIR research under award number 1152409 entitled: EcoVolt&reg;: Enhanced Anaerobic Digestion using Bio-electrodes.  The purpose of the project was to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel anaerobic wastewater treatment process to produce renewable biogas while simultaneously treating high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) found in industrial wastewater.  EcoVolt&reg; technology leverages biologically-catalyzed electrochemical reactions at electrodes. At the anode, microbes consume pollutants comprising BOD while generating an electrical current; at the cathode, different microbes utilize the electrical current along with carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions to form a high methane-fraction biogas.  The Phase II project built upon Phase I results, demonstrating the proof of principle of this wastewater treatment concept.  Phase II laboratory experiments focused on evaluating and optimizing the components, operational conditions, and treatment system architecture.  Phase II concluded with pilot testing of the technology in the field on an actual industrial wastewater stream.  Phase IIB efforts focused on demonstrating the system in the field at an industrial scale.  Cambrian Innovation tested the system for a period of 16 months at a Sonoma County winery.  The demonstration treatment system exceeded target performance objectives under dramatically fluctuating wastewater loading characteristics.  As a direct result of research under this Award, Cambrian Innovation has officially launched the EcoVolt&reg; product line for sale to industrial customers in the food and beverage market.  This unique product offering is the first commercially available wastewater treatment system to feature bio-electrochemical technology.  The EcoVolt&reg; product is a modular, containerized, energy-positive wastewater treatment system designed for stable, automated operation.  A typical installation is a turn-key solution which includes: a headworks unit for pre-treatment of the wastewater stream, EcoVolt&reg; reactor modules for BOD removal and biogas production, and a combined heat and power (CHP) system to covert the biogas into usable heat and electricity for the customer facility.  EcoVolt&reg; has been enthusiastically received in the market and full-scale commercial installations are already operational at customer facilities.
