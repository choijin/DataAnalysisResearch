<AbstractNarration>To understand the evolutionary diversification of animals, the applicants will investigate the variation of phenotypes and their genetic basis in multiple species of fruitflies in the genus Drosophila. The connection to diverse phenotypic features has been mapped to protein-coding changes, cis-regulatory changes and lineage-specific genes. The applicants' recent discoveries showed that many young genes played essential roles in organism development. This research will (1) investigate the reproductive contribution of young genes using the evolutionary genetic analysis and gene silencing techniques, (2) detect their interactions with other genes in the genome using the gene-chip based techniques of experimental genomics, and (3) study their roles in the species divergence by comparative analysis of related species. These efforts will advance the understanding of fundamental problems of gene evolution and phenotypic evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will bring conceptual innovations in the understanding of biological systems. The applicants will also create new data and share with the public.  Furthermore, the applicants will train undergraduate students, visiting students from other schools and different disciplines, to encourage more talented undergraduates to enter graduate schools and nurture cross-disciplinary investigation. The applicants will purposely initiate more collaborate with multiple research groups in various institutions both nationally and internationally. The knowledge on gene origination is important to the understanding of human evolution. The proposed project will be of general interest to the broad audience including scientists and non-scientists and the discoveries from this project will play a role in scientific education for the general public.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, the genetic bases for brain evolution are widely debated, yet whether or not newly evolved genes impact the evolution of the brain and behavior is vaguely understood. In this project, we investigated this scientific problem by experimentally examining recent gene evolution and its impact on the brain of Drosophila and we found that new genes frequently acquired neuronal expression, particularly in the mushroom bodies, the criticial components in the information processing of the brain. Using expression analysis techniques , e.g. the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), we found that a large proportion (49%) of the 330 young genes aged younger than 25 million years were expressed in Drosophila brains. The tissue-specific expression of new genes detected by enhancer-trapping and RNAseq revealed the non-random distribution of new genes on the mushroom body and antennal lobes (the brain neurons which received information input from the antenna).
