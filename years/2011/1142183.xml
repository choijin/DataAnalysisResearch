<AbstractNarration>Accumulating observational evidence suggests that major mature faults, which tend to produce large, destructive earthquakes, are "weak", i.e. produce earthquakes at average stress levels much lower than expected based on typical static friction coefficients of 0.6 to 0.8 and fault-normal stresses of the order of overburden minus hydrostatic pore pressure.  Two classes of models have been proposed to explain such low-stress behavior: (I) chronically weak faults, both during slow (quasi-static) and fast (seismic) slip, and (II) quasi-statically strong but co-seismically weak faults, for which static resistance is high on average, but weakens substantially at seismic slip rates.  In this project, the investigator proposes to build fault models representative of the two classes of low-stressed faults, simulate long-term slip histories on such faults that include sequences of earthquakes, and explore similarities and differences in both seismic and aseismic behavior between the two classes of models, and between the models and natural faults. The project aims to determine the set of models that can reproduce a range of robust observations about mature faults in various settings. As a part of the study, they plan to investigate the role of earthquake nucleation in overall fault behavior, explore the relation between seismic and long-term behavior, and test the ability of simplified, quasi-dynamic, methods of earthquake simulation to capture the results of the fully dynamic models.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lead to better understanding of potential earthquake scenarios on mature faults, including the role of nucleation and heterogeneity.  Such understanding would contribute to developing algorithms for early warning and formulating suites of scenario earthquakes for use in earthquake engineering.  Combined with codes for wave propagation and site and building response, the methodology for simulating earthquake sequences can become a vital ingredient of physics-based simulation capability for seismic hazard analysis in densely populated areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Accumulating observational evidence suggests that major mature faults are "weak", i.e. produce earthquakes at average stress levels much lower than the ones suggested by their static strength as measured in the lab.  Yes many aspects of the behavior of mature major faults are explained through models that require much high level of stress, for example, the observations of supershear rupture propagation in several well-recorded large strike-slip earthquakes. Our hypothesis is that models of mature well-developed faults with high frictional resistance statically and at low slip rates, and much lower, near-zero, frictional resistance at high slip rates (aka enhanced dynamic weakening), together with fault heterogeneity, can explain the full array of available observations.      In this study, we have continued to build such models that incorporate state-of-the-art laboratory-motivated constitutive laws of fault behavior, study their spontaneous response in terms of earthquake sequences and aseismic slip, and determine how a number of seemingly contradictory observations in the field and in the lab can be reconciled.  We indeed find that the models are capable of reproducing several key observations about the earthquake source, including magnitude-independent stress drops.  Our modeling of the areas of recent large events indicates that faults may be both somewhat chronically and dynamically weak.      Overall, our findings indicate that earthquake source models based on the laboratory-derived rate-and-state friction framework supplemented with co-seismic weakening can reproduce a range of observations about earthquake-producing faults, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively.  This suggests that earthquake science is getting closer to understanding the basic physics of the earthquake source.  We are on track to constructing earthquake source models in which all parameters can be either measured in the lab or inferred from field observations, at least in principle.  Such models will be able to assimilate all available laboratory and field observations.  One can then conduct many computer simulations spanning the range of parameter uncertainty and uncover the range of potential earthquake scenarios that a given region can produce.  Such information would be quite helpful, since large earthquakes occur rarely and we cannot rely on the past history alone.     One of our major findings, based on the formulated models, is that large events can penetrate below the so-called seismogenic zone, resulting in deeper seismic slip, and that microseismicity patterns may reveal places where such penetration has occurred in the past. This result will aid in understanding seismic hazard and long-term behavior of such segments.  Such behavior implies overlapping areas of seismic and aseismic slip at the bottom of &ndash; and right below &ndash; the traditionally defined seismogenic zone, which affects the geodetically determined locking depths and creeping rates.  Accounting for such behavior should improve the geodetic inferences and contribute to resolving the discrepancies between geodetic and geologic fault loading rates.     The work has involved two postdoctoral fellows and four graduate students. All of the participants received advanced training in the research work that combines numerical developments and simulations with keen understanding of laboratory findings that the modeling incorporates as well as field observations that the modeling aims to reproduce. All of the participants intend to continue their careers either in academia or research labs, thus contributing to human resources in science and engineering.     Building models of earthquake sources that produce large destructive events will help increase the resilience of our society.  Such models are especially important since many regions do not have well-recorded history of large events.  The developed earthquake-source models will contribute to developing algorith...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
