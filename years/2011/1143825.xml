<AbstractNarration>The Software Design and Productivity (SDP) Cross Agency and National Needs Summit will be held at the NASA Ames Conference Center, September 20-23, 2011. The summit is organized and sponsored by SDP Coordinating Group within the National Coordination Office (NCO) for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD). The purpose of this summit is to inform a crosscutting SDP research and technology agenda. It will provide a forum for bringing together policy makers, stakeholders, visionaries, and R&amp;D leaders for software design and productivity research. The summit will focus on the key issues of the SDP mission: to advance software engineering concepts, methods, techniques and tools that result in more usable, dependable, cost-effective, and sustainable software-intensive systems. This grant will reimburse academic participants for travel and accommodations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The increased dependence of industry, manufacturing and the government on software means that improved technology must be made readily available to the software developers that serve them.  This travel grant reimbursed academic participants for travel and accommodations to the Software Design and Productivity workshops held at NASA Ames, Sept. 20-23, 2011, and in Arlington, VA, Sept. 25-26, 2013.  Workshop invitation criteria supported efforts to include individuals from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, as well as to achieve breadth in geographical, institutional, federal agency and industrial participation. Researchers in software fields such as requirements engineering, software architecture, science of design, safety and reliability, testing, usability, and product lines attended the workshops.  Participants in the workshops worked to identify the gaps between current research and development, and the future needs of industry.   They also worked to determine the research and development advances required to respond to future productivity and quality challenges described by the invited industrial speakers.  Participants in the workshops discussed and recommended strategic priorities for software research and development to improve the future technology available to software developers for industry, government and business. Workshop results were reported back to the cross-agency Software Design and Productivity Coordinating Group to inform their research and technology plans.
