<AbstractNarration>Through gifts, the Community Environmental Scholars Program was launched in 2010 in the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the university. This need-based scholarship program is for undergraduates either from an underrepresented ethnic group or who are first-generation college, veterans, disabled, or returning adults. In its inaugural year, the program served a cohort of 28 students who were dedicated to working with real people on real environmental problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on the Scholars Program and adds new features. Over a 5-year period and using similar selection criteria plus an additional one of academic excellence, the university is awarding 35 or more scholarships averaging $8000 to undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors pursing an environmental studies certificate or major, or pursuing an environmental science major. These scholarships support a cohort of students in STEM fields, primarily science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The program models a real-world setting in which people trained in STEM work with people from other backgrounds to accomplish a common goal. Linking learning in STEM with real-world environmental issues has been shown to be effective for all students, but especially for women and underrepresented minorities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The current generation of undergraduate students faces unprecedented environmental challenges in their future lives as professionals and citizens. This project supports students as they train to meet these challenges. Campus networks are being used to recruit and retain a wide diversity of students for the scholarships. For all students who participate, this project represents a triple win: for the students themselves, for those in the STEM disciplines in which they enroll, and for the environmental health and well-being of the communities in which they one day will live and work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project, "Together for the planet: Community Environmental Scholars Program and S-STEM," launched with a simple but ambitious goal: to assist 35 junior and senior STEM majors with financial need to successfully complete their degrees at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. At the end of our grant, we exceeded this goal. We supported 44 students with a diverse group of STEM majors who simultaneously were pursuing a major or certificate in environmental studies. As of January 2018, 39 had graduated and 5 were on track to graduate on time.  Background When we wrote our S-STEM proposal, we recognized that the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies could offer a unique home and support structure for STEM students. Why?  In the Nelson Institute, all environmental studies majors are required to have another major. The same is true for students completing a certificate in environmental studies; that is, they must have a major in another field.  Currently, about 30% of our environmental studies undergraduate majors have STEM disciplines as their primary major. For students who receive a certificate in environmental studies, the percentage is even higher.  Thus, the Nelson Institute offered a large pool of students from which to draw, one that guaranteed both a diverse set of STEM majors and a common interest in the environment.   Our university has over 40,000 students. While programs exist to provide assistance to freshmen, fewer opportunities are available for students to build a close community when they become juniors and seniors. Our S-STEM project aimed to provide that community, particularly for students with significant financial need. We recognized that 1) environmental studies would attract STEM students from a wide range of disciplines, 2) these students were concerned about the pressing environmental problems of today; and 3) an undergraduate program built on engagement and public service could give these students immediate opportunities to work with groups in our local community.  Research on student outcomes shows that learning science in the context of real-world issues, such as those tackled in environmental studies and environmental science courses, has been shown to be effective for all students but especially so for women and those from minority groups. We also knew that community service can serve a "contextual scaffold" for learning in the sciences. We built our Community Environmental Scholars Program around a 1-credit weekly seminar that utilized the best practices in community service learning, provided students with regular professional development opportunities, and gave them a cohort-based learning experience that linked community, environment, and their chosen major.  Merit Our S-STEM project, the Community Environmental Scholars Program (CESP), models a real-world setting in which people from STEM fields work with those in other disciplines to accomplish common goals. Our theme of environmental concern linked to community service allows us to attract students from a diverse group of majors: environmental science, chemical engineering, biochemistry, wildlife ecology, geoscience, and horticulture (to name but a few).

Our approach has proven successful over a span of the five-year grant. On average, our S-STEM students graduated in 4 years with a GPA of 3.4.  Broader Impacts With a scholarship program like CESP S-STEM, the broader impacts stem from the long-term successes of our students: our students will make significant contributions in their professional and personal lives. Of the 44 students we supported with scholarships, six are enrolled in PhD programs in STEM disciplines. Nine others are enrolled in, or have completed Master?s programs: five in STEM disciplines with others in STEM-related fields such as energy policy, public health, or science education. In 2017, 20 of our 44 S-STEM recipients were working in STEM-related jobs.  In CESP, students were challenged to apply community-building skills in their personal and professional development. The classroom environment reinforced best practices in community engagement: reciprocal relationships, power sharing, leveraging strengths and assets to address needs and challenges, and recognizing that all people have valuable knowledge and expertise through a variety of ways of knowing. Students reflected upon their role in communities, while observing externally through service and experimenting internally with the CESP community itself. Over 20 outside organizations partnered with our students to cement this learning.  Our students see themselves as part of a network of professionals dedicated to both environmental knowledge and community service. They are connected on social media and have constructed an online map to share their current location, job, and willingness to serve as mentors. This community of scholars is a lasting legacy of the support we have received from the NSF.          Last Modified: 03/23/2018       Submitted by: Robert B Beattie]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
