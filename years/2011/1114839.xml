<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title:  2011 Laser Diagnostics Gordon Research Conference&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Sick, Volker    &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Gordon Research Conferences&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: CBET- 1114839  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this award is to support U.S. students and researchers to participate in the 16th Gordon Research Conference on Laser Diagnostics in Combustion to be held on August 14 -19, 2011 at Waterville Valley Resort, Waterville Valley, NH.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This biennial conference, first held in 1981, has served as the off-the-record forum for scientists from all over the world interested in using laser light to understand combustion problems. Each meeting has been essentially a workshop, and the interdisciplinary discussions of major research issues are a highlight of the meeting. The Gordon Research Conference format brings together approximately 135 scientists for a week of intense interaction and scientific discussion.&lt;br/&gt;As is tradition, the conference proceedings will not be published to encourage participants to present unpublished, new data; this is a major strength of the Gordon conferences. Much emphasis will be placed on the requirement for speakers and poster presenters to discuss their latest "cutting-edge" research. This is not a conference for reviewing previous research, but rather to concentrate on novel, exciting, and often controversial advances of today and tomorrow. This is encouraged by the "off-the-record" rule of all Gordon Research Conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The 2011 Gordon Conference on Laser Diagnostics for Combustion Program features twenty-one presentations that provide updates on the latest advances in laser-based diagnostics and sensor activities important in combustion efficiency and emissions for combustion systems relevant to the NSF mission. Many different laser-based techniques have been and continue to be at the focus of our investigations to meet these demands, including Raman and Rayleigh scattering, non-linear Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence, multi-photon and pump-probe approaches, four-wave mixing and holographic grating techniques, and advanced laser absorption schemes. New techniques will be discussed such as high-speed laser imaging, coherent x-rays, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, and other surface diagnostics such as XPS. The design and application of laser-based diagnostics and the interpretation of the obtained data requires a thorough fundamental knowledge of laser physics, of spectroscopy, and of combustion chemistry. The transfer from a concept, an idea of a laser diagnostic approach to the application for experiments is often more difficult than initially envisioned. Concepts of how to develop the best experiment and examples of how laser diagnostics is used in a wide range of environments will be shown - from laboratory reactors to aircraft gas turbines. This is the only scientific forum with an interdisciplinary focus on laser-based diagnostics of combustion; therefore, it is crucial for us to aim to support as many young and emerging US scientists and other participants, providing sufficient funds are received from all sources, to attend this meeting.</AbstractNarration>

There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field. Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
