<AbstractNarration>The mutual interaction between eddies (such as those associated with midlatitude weather systems) and the mean flow (midlatitude jet streams, in particular) is a longstanding topic in atmospheric general circulation.  It is clear that jet streams and eddies interact strongly, but traditional theories to account for their interaction are limited because, for mathematical reasons, they assume that the eddies are small-amplitude perturbations of the mean flow.  The Principal Investigator (PI) has developed a theory of eddy-mean flow interaction which works for large-amplitude eddies, and work conducted under the award seeks to explore the implications of this new theory.  The new theory will be applied to 1) evaluate nonconservative driving of the climate state (radiative forcing, friction, mixing, etc.) by carefully documenting and analyzing the slowly varying reference state; 2) quantify the stabilizing effects of baroclinic eddies ("baroclinic adjustment") by comparing the linear stability of the observed zonal-mean time-mean state and that of an eddy-free reference state derived from the theory; 3) characterize annular mode variability as co-variation of the zonal-mean zonal-wind and wave activity density, and in turn associate it with the variation in the zonal phase speed and energy of the eddies; 4) generalize the criterion for the onset of Rossby wave breaking and testing this theoretical prediction with numerical simulation and meteorological reanalysis; and 5) further generalize the wave breaking criterion for zonally varying mean flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this activity are that the eddy-mean flow theory and the diagonstic tools derived from it can be applied to a wide class of flows, including the stratosphere, troposphere, and the oceans.  In addition, the project will support and train two graduate students, thereby developing the scientific workforce in this area.  Results of the research will also be incorporated into demonstrations performed by the PI in his fluid dynamics laboratory, for audiences at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Jet streams are a prominent feature of the Earth's atmosphere and they play central roles in defining the weather and climate of the midlatitude.  A jet stream marks the boundary between the cold polar airmass and the warm tropical airmass and it generally blows from west to east, steering weather systems in that direction.  However, there is considerable variation in the jet stream over a wide range of time and spatial scales: it meanders and changes its position constantly, and occasionally produces a persistent, large excursions that bring about anomalous weather (see Fig.1).  The wiggles in a jet stream (troughs and ridges, or eddies) not only bring about weather but also help exchange heat between the cold polar region and the warm tropics and redistribute angular momentum of the atmospheric circulation across latitudes.  For example, the eddies themselves help maintain the jet stream in high latitudes against friction by concentrating angular momentum into the jet.  Understanding the interaction between the west-east (main) component of the jet stream and the north-south component (embedded eddies) is an important step to advance our understanding of the behavior of our climate.    Our NSF funded research applied a modern theory of the interaction between the zonal-mean flow and eddy to meteorological data and to computer simulations to further our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the jet variation.  In fact, the development of the theoretical framework itself was a main undertaking of the research.  Traditionally, the interaction between the zonal-mean flow and weather-producing eddies has been analyzed in terms of the energy cycle.  While the cycle describes how the energy is exchanged between the mean state and eddy, it does not necessarily explain why such exchange is happening.  We introduced angular momentum-wave activity cycle as an alternative diagnostic framework.  In a nutshell, this theory predicts that when the meandering of the jet stream is large, the eastward speed of the jet becomes week.   We found that the data corroborates the theory.  For example, during the Southern Hemisphere summer, there is a clear pattern in which the meandering of the jet is stronger when the zonal wind is weak and vice versa, and furthermore, this relationship flips like a seesaw at a fairly regular interval (~20 days) (see Fig.2).  This means that the jet changes from a straight flow to a meandering flow in a predictable fashion.  This is very interesting because, apart from diurnal and seasonal cycles, very few things in our atmosphere are periodic and that makes weather forecast challenging.  According to our analysis, this slow periodic behavior may be understood as æinterferenceÆ of a few (rather than many) fast moving waves, just as superposition of carrier wave and sidebands creates amplitude modulation (AM) of radio waves.  Further investigation is necessary to understand the processes that give rise to the small number of fast moving waves, but once we do, we may be able to extend the range of the weather forecast of the Southern Hemisphere summer beyond the typical 10-14 days.   We have also developed a theory to understand the wavy vs. straight states of the jet stream on a regional basis and successfully demonstrated that a persistent weather pattern is ubiquitously accompanied by the slowing down of the jet.  This suggests that some large weather events (such as blocking) grow into a persistent phenomenon because it slows down the jet and hence the eastward steering of themselves, causing accumulation of wave activity from upstream.
