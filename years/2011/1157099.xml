<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to the Center for Research on Invasive Species and Small Populations (CRISSP) at the University of Idaho.  The project will provide training for 10 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2014.  The program focuses on 1) threats posed by invasive species to natural and agricultural resources; 2) conservation challenges confronting small or declining populations of native species; and 3) connections between these two issue areas.  Student research takes an interdisciplinary, team-based approach with faculty mentors representing diverse disciplines from multiple departments and two colleges. Projects facilitate development of critical laboratory, field and data analysis skills while providing opportunity for interaction among students from different disciplines working under shared research themes.  In addition to conducting research, students will participate in weekly seminars and workshops designed to enhance understanding of interdisciplinary research, career/graduate school preparation, critical thinking, natural resource economics, and ethics.  Students have access to the laboratories of faculty mentors as well as many shared facilities such as the Geospatial Laboratory for Environmental Dynamics, the Idaho Stable Isotopes Laboratory, and the Laboratory for Ecological, Evolutionary and Conservation Genetics.  Recruitment is through NSF-REU and UI websites, as well as direct contacts with institutions serving diverse student bodies.  Faculty encourage applications from students from underrepresented groups through close collaboration with colleagues at Native American colleges and by working directly with the University Office of Multicultural Affairs, Native American Center, and Tribal Liaison.  Students are selected based on academic record and potential to successfully complete research in a team-setting.  Students' progress in academic programs, applications for graduate school or other professional opportunities, and preparation of scientific papers or presentations is monitored.  Facebook is used to facilitate communication among faculty and REU alumni.  Progress towards the project goals is assessed through metrics such as student degree completion, number of graduate school applications in STEM fields, as well as use of an REU common assessment tool.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for Research on Invasive Species and Small Populations (CRISSP) at the University of Idaho developed an interdisciplinary program for training undergraduate students (REU Site: Interdisciplinary Approach to Challenges posed by Invasive Species) that supported 30 undergraduate student researchers from across the country and Puerto Rico.  In addition, we leveraged our program success to enroll 3 additional students with funds from Idaho EPSCoR and other agencies, bringing the total number to 33 REU students mentored during the summers of 2012-2014.     Broader impacts of the CRISSP REU Site included contributing to diversity in the science workforce: 21% of the students in our program were from ethnic groups that are under-represented in the sciences, and 73% were women.  In addition to encouraging women and students from under-represented groups, we also successfully emphasized recruitment of students from small colleges and universities where research opportunities are limited: 70% of the CRISSP REU interns were from institutions that do not have advanced degree programs.   The CRISSP REU program was designed to help students from diverse backgrounds excel in careers in the natural sciences.  The REU interns not only conducted independent research guided by faculty mentors, but also participated in series of training activities aimed at 1) enhancing success in preparing for and completing graduate programs, 2) developing an appreciation and skills for participating in interdisciplinary research, and 3) exploring ethics and social dimensions of science, natural resource management, and conservation.  The REU interns also learned about science communication and then practiced these skills during a "Science Saturdays in the Arboretum" program that engaged GK-12 students and parents through outdoor educational activities.  Our aim was to help prepare these students to become leaders and effective science team members tackling complex environmental issues.  Intellectual merit of the CRISSP REU program was closely tied with the Center (CRISSP) where the REU interns were mentored.  Faculty in this multi-disciplinary Center work on basic and applied aspects of invasive species ecology and threatened species conservation.  Current and future natural and agricultural resource challenges are and will increasingly require scientists working across disciplines.  An explicit goal of the CRISSP REU program was enhancing the ability of students to address natural resource challenges by introducing the concepts and practice of interdisciplinary research.   The CRISSP REU program supported research conducted by students and mentors addressing emerging problems associated with invasion of non-native species and conservation of native plants and animals in both aquatic and terrestrial systems.  For example, students conducted surveys and evaluated of control methods for invasive aquatic species including New Zealand mud snails, Asian clams, non-native freshwater shrimp, and Didymosphenia geminata (also known as didymo or rock snot).  These non-native organisms are changing aquatic systems that support not only populations of native fishes, but also water resources for human and agricultural uses.  Students also worked with faculty to study invasive plants and to evaluate methods for their control, including use of native biocontrol agents (for example, insect predators like the tiger moth).   Because native plants and animals can be compromised by invasive species, CRISSP REU research also focused on native species of conservation concern.  Our students worked with Native America managers from the Nez Perce aquatic habitat restoration program to evaluate impacts of habitat changes and restoration on native steelhead trout populations on tribal lands.  Widespread conversion our local terrestrial ecosystem, the Palouse Prairie, has threatened several native plants and animals.  Student-led research in this ecosystem developed a predicti...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
