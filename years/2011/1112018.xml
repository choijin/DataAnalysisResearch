<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Daniel Falvey of the University of Maryland- College Park, for the development of new molecular systems with controllable photochemical release of one or more functional groups. The goal of the project is to develop donor-acceptor systems that will undergo electron transfer sensitized reactions that release stable molecules such as carboxylic acids. An innovative feature of Professor Falvey's approach is that the molecules will be designed to undergo these reactions after absorbing two photons, so that low energy visible light can be employed. These reactions are important to many fields as they allow for both temporal and spatial control of the movement of molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include the potential for improved control of 3D nanofabrication processes, and for imaging and biomedical applications. Professor Falvey is recognized for his breadth of knowledge across several disciplines (organic synthesis, spectroscopy, kinetics, and computational chemistry), which makes his laboratory effective in tackling difficult research problems. He has been successful in recruiting and mentoring underrepresented groups to his laboratory at the University of Maryland, and he is an advisor to the International Chemistry Olympiad.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded basic research into the mechanisms of photochemical reactions that cause chemical bonds to break. Photochemical reactions can produce high-energy intermediates, strained ring systems, etc. often in ways that defy both intuitive expectations as well as state-of-the-art theoretical predictions These fundamental considerations motivate research in this area.

Generally speaking, photochemistry finds uses in situations where it is desirable to remotely manipulate molecular phenomena in a spatially or temporally controlled manner. For example, it is often desired to introduce a specific molecular species such as a drug, neurotransmitter, hormone, or other active species in a precisely controlled time, location and concentration in a given cell, tissue or organelle. This is achieved using tools called "caged molecules". One major goal of this project was the development of useful bond-breaking reactions that result from sequential two-photon excitation of a substrate that could be used to release such caged molecules.  One benefit to the use of two photons to effect photorelease, if they are of different wavelengths, is that the desired reaction can be localized in 3-dimensions, occurring at the intersection of two low-power laser beams.    A combination of organic synthesis, laser flash photolysis, and computer modeling of key chemical reactions was used to acheive these objectives.  Key results from the project include the following.  (1) We synthesized and characterized the photochemistry of 2,2,2-tribromomethyl ethers. It was hypothesized that photochemical reduction of these species would effect the release of carboxylic acids. Our photochemical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that these esters have fascinating and complex chemical outcomes.  (2) The 9-phenyl-9-tritylonyl (PTO) group was developed as a strategy for caging and releasing simple alcohol using visible light. Our mechanistic studies show that the PTO group, when reduced by an excited state photocatalyst, cleanly releases alcohols in high chemical yields and within 100 microseconds following photoexcitation.  (3) We have applied related photochemical electron transfer methods to the release of caged Ca2+   using visible light and inexpensive biocompatible reagents. High wavelength exposure of excited state oxidants, including flavin, quinones and Ru(bpy)&shy;3 in the presence of EDTA-Ca complexes results in the decomposition of the EDTA chelating ligand and release of free Ca2+ into solution. In this way it is possible to generate millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ in a short period of time using visible light.  (5) In an earlier phase of this project, the N-alkylpicolinium (NAP) group and been developed as a caging group for carboxylic acids. Under the current award further mechanistic characterization of NAP was carried out. It was found that NAP could be photochemically activated without a sensitizer and using visible light.
