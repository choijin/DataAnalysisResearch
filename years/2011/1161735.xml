<AbstractNarration>This project will focus on a number of topics in complex analysis and related geometric theories.  These topics include the study of variational problems connected with Fefferman's measure for real hypersurfaces in complex Euclidean space; the exploration of a new biholomorphically invariant metric based on Fefferman's Szego kernel;  the development of the Mobius-invariant differential geometry of real hypersurfaces in complex projective space; and the study of a generalized Cauchy transform known as the Leray transform, with special attention to the information it provides about pairing of Hardy spaces on dual hypersurfaces in complex projective space.  The last topic has potential implications for the study of constant coefficient holomorphic partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Functions of complex variables play an essential role in many parts of mathematics, including partial differential equations, Fourier theory, and integral geometry. These topics in turn provide vital infrastructure for physics and engineering.  For example, the study of complex analysis in projective space and related settings contributes to the understanding of the integral transforms used in tomography.  The proposed project is focused on natural topics with potential for opening up new directions within complex analysis and for strengthening the connections between complex analysis and other parts of mathematics.  The project will involve students and younger investigators and thus will help to ensure that expertise in this important subject is available in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In work of the principal investigator progress has been made on the geometry of real hypersurfaces in complex euclidean space; on finding straightforward differential-equation based characterizations of various natural function spaces (such as the space of pluriharmonic boundary values and a related space arising from projective duality) arising in the study of such hypersurfaces; on developing relations between norms of key integral operators in complex analysis and related analytic and geometric problems (such as the study of Poincare inequalities for Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions); and on the construction of projection operators onto holomorphic function spaces with desired regularity properties.     Work of graduate students supported by the award has lead to progress on relating the asymptotic rate of polyhedral approximation of certain regions of complex euclidean space to a key geometric invariant of the boundary of the region; on general methods for constructing Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions on regions with non-smooth boundary; and on spectral theory of non-smooth projective varieties.     These developments should play a significant role in the further evolution of the subject, in particular by opening up new topics for the research agenda. Moreover, the activity funded by the award has contributed to human resource development within complex analysis and mathematics more generally by helping to propel the careers of mathematicians at the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral stages.
