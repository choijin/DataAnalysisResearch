<AbstractNarration>1151033&lt;br/&gt;Henry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Biosensing program supports the development of novel carbohydrate biorecognition molecules that could be used both for in vivo and in vitro detection of structure specific forms of beta amyloid, the primary protein component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease.  The work will contribute to the development of new methods for diagnosing and following disease progression in Alzheimer's patients.  The need for good quantitative clinical measures is needed for successful development of new drugs to treat this progressive neurological disease.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   AlzheimerÆs disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects almost 5.4 million people. As human life expectancy increases, the number of AlzheimerÆs disease patients is increasing exponentially because of the deficiency in the early diagnosis and effective treatments for AlzheimerÆs disease. A major hallmark of AlzheimerÆs disease is dementia is believed to be caused by plaque formation in the brain.  Amyloid-beta (A&beta;) is a peptide that is known to be a major constituent of these plaques, so this work sought to find ways to inhibit A&beta; activity with the goal of lessening plaque formation and hopefully dementia in AlzheimerÆs disease patients.   This studyÆs approach was to design biocompatible smart materials that either sequester A&beta; or interfere with A&beta; interaction with/binding to cells. If successful, these biomimetic materials would mimic the cell surface of typical brain cells, effectively baiting A&beta; to adhere to the smart materials rather than actual brain cells.  Such smart materials were synthesized and their effects on A&beta; toxicity were measured.  Certain chemical structures were found to be especially effective in reducing the harmful effects of A&beta;.  This work will contribute to the ultimate therapeutic design of smart materials that will ideally overcome the shortcomings of current AlzheimerÆs disease treatments and reduce the effects of this debilitating disease that is known to harm so many.
