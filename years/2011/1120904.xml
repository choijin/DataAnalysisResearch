<AbstractNarration>Theory predicts that geographically complex regions should harbor exceptional biological diversity, and that past Earth history events such as climatic fluctuations will affect the diversification and maintenance of genetic variation.  The island of Madagascar represents one such complex region.  Only four groups of native terrestrial mammals exist on Madagascar; each colonized Madagascar a single time and then diversified to exhibit spectacular morphological and ecological variation.  This proposal focuses on the small insectivore-like mammals, especially on those species distributed throughout Madagascar's mountainous, humid-forest belt.  The project will use DNA sequences from multiple genes to determine how many genetically distinct sets of populations exist within each species, and to provide an estimate of how long ago they diverged.  The researchers will use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to model the niche of each species using climatic data sets to estimate the species' current ranges and to reconstruct their distributions during past glacial cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the forces that shape regional biodiversity is one of the key goals of modern biology.  This project will illuminate the importance of past climatic events in shaping present-day patterns of biodiversity.  It will reveal the extent of small-mammal diversity in Madagascar's humid forests and identify areas containing unexpected genetic variation, providing critical information for designing protected areas and conservation strategies in one of the world?s foremost biodiversity hotspots.  The researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students in DNA sequencing and analysis and GIS, including students from groups underrepresented in science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The island continent of Madagascar is renowned for its unique flora and fauna, much of which is found nowhere else in the world. This has made it both a popular study system for evolutionary biologists and a global conservation priority. All of its native mammals are endemic, meaning they only occur on Madagascar. In addition to a diverse assemblage of bats, Madagascar is home to four groups of native terrestrial mammals: lemurs, carnivores, rodents, and tenrecs. Tenrecs comprise a family of small- to medium-sized, primarily insectivorous mammals that have become a textbook example of an island adaptive radiation (much like Darwin&rsquo;s finches). In the absence of other small-mammal competitors, tenrec species superficially resembling shrews, moles, hedgehogs, and otters as well as a variety of novel forms have all evolved from a single colonizing ancestral lineage. In the past two decades, several new species have been recognized, and prior to this study it had become clear that many more awaited discovery, description, and interpretation in a broader evolutionary context. With funding from this grant, we first determined the evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) among all 32 currently recognized tenrec species using multiple genetic markers; this was the first published study to determine the phylogeny of all living species of any mammal radiation on Madagascar and confirmed that all Malagasy tenrecs evolved from a single ancestor that colonized Madagascar from Africa ca. 40-60 million years ago. Our study was also the first to demonstrate higher rates of speciation in Madagascar&rsquo;s humid forest than in its drier habitats for any vertebrate group on the island. We also tested for a common geographic pattern of recent genetic divergence within tenrecs and other vertebrates to see if the island&rsquo;s montane regions have served as refugia for forest taxa during past episodes of forest contraction brought on by glacial cycling worldwide. We demonstrated conclusively that the three major high-elevation massifs along the island&rsquo;s eastern escarpment did indeed act as refugia for small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, isolating populations of previously widespread species long enough for genetic distinctiveness to evolve before subsequent episodes of forest expansion allowed these sundered populations to come back into contact. To test whether this isolation was sufficient to allow speciation to occur in tenrecs, we assembled a database of &gt;6,000 museum specimens, personally examined &gt;3,500 of these, measured the skull (and, when available, skeleton) of &gt;2,700, and sequenced a mitochondrial DNA gene from &gt;1,000. When combined and analyzed, these data strongly suggest the existence of at least 20 undescribed species of tenrecs, many the apparent result of past isolation in these montane refugia. This staggering 62% increase in species diversity has profound implications for understanding recent patterns of diversification as well as the prioritization of conservation areas. We are now in the process of comparing rates of species discovery in all of Madagascar&rsquo;s terrestrial vertebrates over time and into the near future with those of other biodiversity hotspots, with preliminary results strongly suggesting a globally unprecedented ongoing rate of new species discovery on Madagascar that began in the early 1990s and has remained constant ever since.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ten young U.S. researchers received training over the course of this project, including one female PhD student, one female master&rsquo;s student, five female undergraduates, and two female technicians. Twenty-nine Malagasy college students from the University of Antananarivo were provided training in statistics using funds and personnel from this grant. Collectively, this project yielded data and publications with broad relevance to conservation, evolutionary biology, and even biomedicine in addition to providing relevant training to a large number of future scientists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/10/2017<br>      Modified by: Link&nbsp;E&nbsp;Olson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1120904/1120904_10122656_1510349126174_KatieVahatraStudents--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1120904/1120904_10122656_1510349126174_KatieVahatraStudents--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Statistics workshop in Madagascar"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1120904/1120904_10122656_1510349126174_KatieVahatraStudents--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Statistics workshop in Madagascar"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">University of Alaska Fairbanks PhD candidate Katie Everson (center) designed and taught a workshop on the statistics package R to students from the University of Antananarivo at the Vahatra Association in December 2016</div> <div class="imageCredit">Steven M.
