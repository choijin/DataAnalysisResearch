<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Patrick J. Walsh of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania will examine general methods for the chelation-controlled addition of organometallic reagents to alpha or beta silyloxy and alpha or beta halo aldehydes, ketones, and aldimimes.  These substrates typically do not chelate.  The central hypothesis of this project is that Cram-chelation can be achieved with substrates that strongly resist chelation by employing mild nucleophiles in combination with zinc Lewis acids.  There are three specific objectives:  1. Developing chelation-controlled additions to chiral alpha and beta silyloxy aldehydes and ketones; 2. Assessing the ability of zinc reagents to chelate alpha or beta halo aldehydes and ketones; 3. Assessing the ability of zinc reagents to chelate alpha or beta halo imines and to promote Cram chelation additions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project could lead to general methods for highly diastereoselective additions to alpha or beta substituted aldehydes, ketones, and aldimines.  These methods are highly useful for the preparation of a large number of substructures commonly seen in biologically important molecules, including syn-1,2- and anti-1,3-diols, syn-1,2-halo hydrins, cis-epoxides and allylic epoxides, and anti-1,2-amino alcohols.  The successful results of this work could positively impact the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and specialty chemical industries.  In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Medications are molecules and they contain bonds between carbon atoms.  Thus, it is very important to be able to make such bonds, especially for the synthesis of new medications.  In this proposal, entitled "Changing the Paradigm: Chelation-Control with Silyloxy and Halo Carbonyl Compounds," we develop new ways to form bonds between carbons, including with very high selectivity.     Specifically, the objective of this research was to develop Lewis acid promoted-carbonyl additions that proceed via chelation-control with alpha or beta-chiral aldehyde, ketone and imine substrates bearing Lewis basic groups (OSiR3 and halogen) that result in formation of carbon-carbon bonds. These substrates rarely or never undergo carbon-carbon bond formation via a chelation-controlled mechanism. We used organometallic nucleophiles (carbon containing groups bound to metals) with these substrates to furnish chelation products, thus solving the long-standing problem for the chemical community.  The results of these studies have been communicated to the public through a series of publications.    The Broader Impacts of this work include:  1) Most of the results were obtained by an outstanding African-American graduate student, 2) Five undergraduates and two visiting students were involved in this project. 3) In addition to the above-mentioned societal benefits, the new methods introduced herein will have a positive impact on quality of life if they are used in the preparation of medications or agricultural products, 4) The PIÆs outreach program with Mexico, which is focused on the education of graduate students from Mexico, has now generated 18 publications, and  5) The PI has taught high school students about the results of this NSF supported research to encourage them to pursue science careers.
