<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to determine if an integrated circuit sensor can combine the benefits of fluorescence intensity imagers and fluorescence lifetime sensors.  The approach is to compare three competing technologies for high-speed photon detection (traditional pixels, photomixing pixels, and single photon avalanche diodes) at the pixel, imager, and application level.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The inclusion of fluorescence lifetime data in fluorescence intensity measurements can improve the signal-to-noise ratio, increase the number of imaging channels, and even allow the development of low-cost fluorescence imagers that do not require filters.  This fluorescence lifetime data is only rarely collected because existing sensors are expensive and slow.  The work proposed here will either demonstrate that integrated circuit detectors can overcome these hurdles or point the way to research on integrated circuit detectors to reach that goal.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Fluorescence instruments are critical in medical diagnosis, drug discovery, and pathogen detection.  This project will enable creation of new instruments that are more sensitive, more portable, faster, and cheaper.  The development of these sensors is also an opportunity to train students in the classic area of circuit design and the emerging area of bioelectronics.  In particular, a graduate student will be prepared for a career in mixed-signal circuit design and a team of undergraduates will gain experience in interdisciplinary engineering developing the systems for testing these integrated circuits with realistic fluorescence assays.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             In this project, we developed a special camera that can dramatically simplify a technique biologist use to measure the changing shapes of molecules within cells.  The technique, known as Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), uses special molecules called fluorophores that absorb one color of light and emit a new color.  This is similar to the process by which black light posters absorb ultraviolet light and emit visible light.  Fluorophores are widely used in biology to label cellular components because they are small, available in a variety of colors, and can be designed to attach to a wide variety of biological targets.              Flourophores enter an excited state when they absorb a photon.  Within a few nanoseconds, i.e. billionths of a second, the fluorophore decays back to its base state often emitting a photon when it decays.  Like nuclear decay, the rate of this decay can be defined by a half life, but to avoid confusion the term fluorescence lifetime is used to describe this rate.  FRET occurs when a fluorophore is very close (within a few billionths of a meter, nanometers) to another fluorophore or a molecule called a quencher.  In this case, the excited fluorophore, called the donor, can transfer its energy to the second fluorophore or a quencher, called the acceptor, rather than releasing a photon.  The distance between the donor and acceptor can be determined by measuring the fluorescence lifetime of the donor.  Traditional methods of measuring the fluorescence lifetime have involved adding a large box to a microscope that contain optics, a photomultiplier tube, and multiple computer boards containing custom hardware to measure the arrival time of each of the photons.  This hardware measures the fluorescence lifetime of one point at a time to create an image of the lifetimes at each pixel in an image.  This grant allowed us to develop an alternative solution that simply requires replacing one chip in the camera already attached to most commercial microscopes.  This imager chip is where photons are converted into electrons on the camera.  By designing the circuits on that chip, we built a system that can capture an entire image at one time.  Using three of these images, we can calculate the fluorescence lifetime of all the pixels in the image.
