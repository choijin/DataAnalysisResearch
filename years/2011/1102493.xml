<AbstractNarration>Infection of hosts by multiple parasite species is the norm rather than the exception in most natural populations, yet studies of parasite dynamics largely focus on single parasites interacting with single hosts. Fundamental principles of immunology suggest that co-infection of hosts by microparasites (bacteria, viruses, protozoa) and macroparasites (helminths) should have important effects on disease dynamics. For example, exposure to macroparasites may increase host susceptibility to and progression of important microparasitic diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in humans. The central goal of this study is to investigate the consequences of microparasite-macroparasite interactions for patterns of disease at three distinct levels of biological organization: individuals, populations and species. To achieve this goal, African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) co-infected with bovine tuberculosis (BTB, Mycobacterium bovis) and gastrointestinal nematodes will be used as a model system to investigate individual-level patterns of infection and parasite population dynamics. Specifically, a combination of field and captive studies and mathematical modeling will be used to assess patterns of infection and immunity in these free-ranging animals, understand the effects of nematode treatment on BTB transmission, and examine the reciprocal effects of BTB on nematodes. Scaling up from this system, a comprehensive database of parasites and pathogens infecting wild mammals and humans will then be used to investigate the effect of helminths on the distribution of microparasitic diseases across populations and species. In combination, these analyses will reveal how within-host immunological interactions between micoparasites and macroparasites shape patterns of disease in natural host populations and among species. Broader impacts of this study include training of multiple graduate students, undergraduate students and paraprofessionals; application of study results to the management of an ecologically and economically important wildlife disease; and active collaboration with the public health community to understand the utility of using helminth control as a tool for combating microparasitic diseases in humans.</AbstractNarration>

This project studied interactions between gastrointestinal worms and bovine tuberculosis (<em>Mycobacterium bovis</em>, TB) in wild African buffalo, with a goal of understanding the consequences of worm-microbe co-infection for: (i) individual host responses to microbial infection and (ii) the population-level spread of microbes. A first component of the project developed a testable framework for predicting microbial population responses to worm co-infections. This study coupled epidemiological theory with current understanding of the mammalian immune system to explore the potential outcomes of worm co-infection on microbial dynamics when all relevant epidemiological parameters are considered simultaneously. The framework generated important new hypotheses about how population-level disease outcomes of worm co-infection can vary depending on key aspects of microbe biology, including the chronicity and severity of infection, and showed that under some conditions public health interventions aimed at controlling worm infections may exacerbate, rather than moderate, the population-level spread of microbes. Next, using a combination of cross-sectional and experimental studies, a second project component explicitly tested the effects of anthelmintic treatment on TB. The results of these studies showed that anthelmintic treatment enhanced the buffalo immune response to <em>M. bovis</em>, but the change in immunity was not associated with reduced incidence of TB disease. In contrast, treated buffalo were more likely to survive TB infection than untreated individuals. However, this extended lifespan of TB-infected individuals &mdash;a positive outcome for individual buffalo&mdash;poses a population-level problem because estimates of the fitness of<em> M. bovis </em>in the presence vs. absence of anthelmintic treatment suggest that TB can spread faster as a result of treatment. This result reveals an important unanticipated consequence of anthelmintic therapy on non-target microbial diseases like TB, highlighting the importance of parasite interactions in shaping disease outcomes at the population level. A third project goal focused on extending the work in African buffalo to other mammals. To do this, phylogenetic comparative methods were used to examine associations between worm infection and intracellular pathogen diversity across 70 primate species using data derived from the Global Mammal Parasite Database. Results of this aspect of the project showed that worm prevalence explains as much variation in intracellular microbe richness in primates as well-studied life-history and ecological traits such host body mass and geographic range size. This result suggests that interactions among parasites occurring within hosts can play an important role in structuring parasite communities. Finally, additional empirical studies in buffalo, focused on interactions between different worm species and interactions between <em>M. bovis</em> and <em>Brucella</em>/Rift Valley Fever virus, suggest that co-infection also has important consequences for host fitness. Taken all together, the results of this project extend our current understanding of the complex outcomes of parasite co-infection for both hosts and parasites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs...]]></DRECONTENT>
