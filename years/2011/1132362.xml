<AbstractNarration>Computational creativity is a young, highly interdisciplinary field incorporating insights and results from cognitive science, artificial intelligence, design, human computing interaction, mathematics, art and linguistics among others.  As a result, there is still a significant communication gap amongst contributors to the field.  The International Conference on Computational Creativity seeks to bridge this gap by creating a unified forum for discussion and exchange of ideas, and the workshop session is designed to foster broad participation and act as a forum for new participants in the conversation.  The award will facilitate this participation by providing travel support for participants that would like to join the conversations who will not present peer reviewed papers, but who would be benefited by exposure to established computational creativity researchers.  In addition, it will further this cooperation by funding mentoring activities that pair established researchers with workshop participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award was intended to support and strengthen the newly created International Conference on Computational Creativity by broadening participation in the event.  This was accomplished by providing travel support to a mix of new attendees/students (mentees) and experienced researchers (mentors), both to increase conference attendance and to provide mentoring and networking opportunites.  Mentors spent time formally and informally with new participants answering questions, critiquing research ideas and giving career advice.  We were able to offer travel support for both the second conference, held in Mexico City, Mexico in 2011 (16 travel stipends granted), and the third, held in Dublin, Ireland in 2012 (11 travel stipends granted) [Note: tthe first conference was a smaller affair, held in Lisbon, Portugal before the beginning of this award period].  After three iterations, the conference is beginning to mature and is attracting more interest (especially in the US, where we have been historically behind the EU in this field).  The support provided through this award has played a significant role in that growth.  The fourth iteration of the conference (sans NSF support) was very recently held in Sydney, Australia, and the fifth is scheduled for Ljubljana, Slovenia in 2014.  We plan to submit a bid for 2015 to host the sixth iteration of the conference for the first time in the United States.
