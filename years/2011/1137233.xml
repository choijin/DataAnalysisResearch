<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to promote student participation in the long-running ER conference series, to be held in Belgium in Oct-Nov 2011. This will be the thirtieth ER, which is promised to continue the tradition of promoting collaboration among multiple areas. ER is a leading international forum for conceptual modeling, which is an important issue for information management and integration. ER provides a unique forum to promote multi- and interdisciplinary research and education in Conceptual Modeling. The proposed activities include recruiting a diverse group of US students to participate in ER, and will use the grant to help cover the cost of travel, subsistence, and registration to the ER 2011 conference for the students. Students participation of international scientific discussion forums is always an important part of their education and a great way to build a mature work force in scientific research. The project will also emphasize on recruiting under-represented groups of students in this effort.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The NSF grant "ER 2011: Fostering Interdisciplinary Research and Education in Software Engineering" supported selected students from US-based institutions to participate in the ER conference to help them cover the cost of travel, subsistence. We identified eligible candidates who are either undergraduate, graduate students, or postdoctoral researchers from US-based institutions who are presenters or attendees in the scientific program, workshops, panels, or poster sessions. Priorities were given to under-represented groups in science and engineering, including ethnic minorities, women, individuals with disabilities.  The PI and co-PIs specifically aimed to support junior researchers who can advance the field of Conceptual Modeling by participating in ER 2011, the most prestigious conference in conceptual modeling, and exchanging them ideas with other participants.  Not only providing students with the financial support, but also bringing them in the research community to be active players, the PI is very pleased to observe that the travel grant played a truly important role in deepening as well as broadening the field.     Before explaining the outcomes of the project, the PI briefly describes the field of conceptual modeling.  Conceptual modeling is an established discipline for more than three decades. Indeed, the very first database course at the bachelor level throughout the world contains a chapter in the Entity-Relationship model, the first conceptual model proposed in the 1970s. Obviously, conceptual modeling addresses nowadays challenging application domains, ranging from business process modeling to molecular biology. This wide range of application domains makes the Conceptual Modeling conference an ideal venue for science and technology students.  Since 1979, the International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER) has successfully brought together leading researchers and developers from database and software engineering, communities. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future research directions through the publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings.  The thirtieth ER (ER 2011, http://er2011.ulb.ac.be/) continues the tradition of promoting collaboration among multiple areas.

Topics of interest span the entire spectrum of conceptual modeling including research and practice in areas such as theories of concepts and ontologies underlying conceptual modeling, methods and tools for developing and communicating conceptual models, and techniques for transforming conceptual models into effective implementations. ER provides an open and interactive forum to promote multi- and interdisciplinary research and education in Conceptual Modeling, facilitating the cross fertilization of ideas and bridging knowledge gaps.  We have supported four PhD students to participate in the ER conference.  Those four students are: Kee Jung Lee from Drexel University Scott Britell from Portland State University Said Bleik from New Jersey Institute of Technology Kevin Marth from Illinois Institute of Technology  They participated in the ER conference (PhD colloquium) and they had also an accepted paper to give a presentation at the conference.     Findings:  We have observed that the ER conference received the increase research attention from many institute all over the world and junior students who will continue to develop the field of conceptual modeling rigorously get involved in the research collaboration provided by the conference.
