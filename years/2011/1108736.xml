<AbstractNarration>In this collaborative project the Principal Investigators (PIs) will&lt;br/&gt;investigate mathematical models for topological phases of matter and their&lt;br/&gt;application to the nascent field of quantum information.  Examples of&lt;br/&gt;topological phases of matter include Fractional Quantum Hall liquids and&lt;br/&gt;topological insulators: materials subjected to extreme physical conditions&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. near zero Kelvin, under large magnetic forces) which appear to&lt;br/&gt;exhibit topological behavior.  The main objectives of the project are to&lt;br/&gt;better understand the taxonomy of these exotic states of matter through&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models, address physically and computationally motivated&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems, and apply topological and algebraic methods to&lt;br/&gt;study them. For example, the issue of quantum computational power&lt;br/&gt;(universality) may be analyzed by finding the images of the braid groups&lt;br/&gt;under representations associated to a particular model. Moreover, the&lt;br/&gt;extant hypothesized models for topological states of matter do not capture&lt;br/&gt;all of the subtleties (such as fermionic topological order) so the PIs&lt;br/&gt;will develop new models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classical states of matter of solid, liquid and gas have more refined&lt;br/&gt;classifications: for example, solid crystals may be differentiated by&lt;br/&gt;their symmetries.  Newly discovered topological materials have yet to be&lt;br/&gt;fully understood, but potentially can be used to build (quantum)&lt;br/&gt;computational devices out-performing standard micro-chip based computers.&lt;br/&gt;The most commonly encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum&lt;br/&gt;circuit model, requires challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the&lt;br/&gt;hardware to be of practical value due to local interactions of the system&lt;br/&gt;with the surrounding environment. The topological model based on exotic&lt;br/&gt;states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in&lt;br/&gt;tolerance for such interactions. The PIs will mathematically study these&lt;br/&gt;exotic states of matter focusing on their application to new computational&lt;br/&gt;paradigms with potentially significant benefit to society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Solid, liquid, and gas are all familiar states of matter. But by a more refined classification, each state consists of many different states of matter. For example, within the crystalline solid state, there are many different crystals distinguished by their different lattice structures. All those states are classical in the sense they depend crucially on the temperature. More mysterious and challenging to understand are quantum states of matter: states of matter at zero temperature (in reality very close to zero). The modeling and classification of quantum states of matter is an exciting current research area in condensed matter physics. In recent years, much progress has been made in a particular subfield: topological phases of matter.   A physical system is in a topological phase if at low energies the observable quantities are invariant under smooth deformations, that is, topologically invariant. The prototypical example is fractional quantum Hall liquids&ndash;effectively two dimensional systems of highly correlated electrons producing quasi-particles with non-trivial braiding statistics called anyons, which can be neither bosons nor fermions.  Besides their intrinsic scientific merits, another motivation comes from the potential realization of fault-tolerance quantum computation using non-abelian anyons. Inspired by those developments, the Principal Investigators work on three related projects: the localization of braid statistics, the mathematical modeling of topological phases of matter, and the application of topological phases of matter to quantum computing.  In this project the Principal Investigators codify localization of braid statistics, classify and analyze computational power of anyon models, and design Hamiltonian models for 3D topological phases of matter, which is used to generalize topological insulators.  A breakthrough is the proof of the rank-finiteness conjecture for anyon systems: for a fixed number of anyon species, there are only finitely many anyon systems. The number theoretical tools that are developed for the proof is also used to advance several directions such as the classification of low rank anyon systems. The interdisciplinary nature of the project leads to immediate impacts within the scientific community from the construction of a useful quantum computer to the mathematical classification of quantum symmetries.
