<AbstractNarration>Moist deep convection organized on planetary to synoptic scales in the tropical atmosphere evolves together with extratropical Rossby waves that extend from the tropics and across high latitudes as well as from the extratropics into the tropics. This convection is organized in part into the 30-60 day eastward-moving Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and higher frequency convectively coupled atmospheric equatorial waves. Both the MJO and these convectively coupled waves interact with extratropical waves. This project endeavors to explain how these convectively coupled equatorial waves and extratropical waves might interact with each other and the wave breaking process in a manner that causes some of the major attributes of the MJO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MJO profoundly influences extended range (4+ days) prediction of extreme weather events around the globe ranging from tropical cyclones to excessive heat, cold, floods, and droughts.  The study will provide insights into the mechanisms whereby the MJO interacts with extratropical waves that are associated with such extreme events.  Thus the work has substantial broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Thunderstorms organize over the warm oceans of the tropics in clusters as large as the ocean basins are wide. These clusters often move slowly eastward and get replaced by regions of abnormally quiet thunderstorm activity. These events typically take 30-60 days to move eastward around the world, although a few events move more rapidly or more slowly. These events have become known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, or MJO. The MJO interacts with many different parts of the climate system, including weather patterns around the world and climate phenomena such as El Ni&ntilde;o. The scientific community does not yet agree on what causes the MJO. One school of thought is that the MJO develops internal to the tropics and that the weather around the rest of the world responds to it, but that that weather does not subsequently influence the organization of the thunderstorm activity across the tropics. Another school of thought is that the associated global circulation patterns are part of the anatomy of the MJO itself, and that the present state of the mid latitude weather influences the upcoming MJO event. This project analyzed details of how the tropical rainfall patterns interact with waves in the atmosphere that propagate eastward around the world both in the tropics and the middle and higher latitudes. This project analyzed satellite and model data to analyze the mechanisms whereby the global atmospheric waves might influence the winds in the tropics, which then influence the organization of the MJO. Results show that waves moving across the middle latitudes in response to the MJO farther west move into the tropics of the Western Hemisphere, where they break and deposite momentum into the tropical atmosphere. This momentum then subsequently influences the organization of new thunderstorm activity over the Indian Ocean. Thus results suggest that the observed MJO shows coupling between mid latitude weather and the MJO convection in the tropics. Results have already been used by government organizations and private sector companies to help predict the likelihood of development of new MJO events in the coming weeks, along with insights about the chances of transitions in mid latitude weather states that tend to follow new MJO events.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2015<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;E&nbsp;Roundy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
