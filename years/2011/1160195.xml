<AbstractNarration>This research program investigates the nucleation and growth of metal nanoparticles and ultra thin metal films on amorphous substrates. Chemical growth methods will be studied that include chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition. The research will focus on measuring the concentration and elucidating the chemical nature of defect sites on amorphous substrates were nucleation is initiated or where stable metal clusters are trapped. The program will probe the chemical nature of inherent defects and defects that are purposefully generated on the substrates. Fluorescent probe molecules designed to chemically titrate different proposed defect sites will be used to measure the concentration of the defects and possibly also their spatial distribution. The way the different defects affect nucleation and metal adatom trapping will be established. The research will also explore approaches to inhibit/block the growth of established metal islands and force a higher nucleation density as a route to smooth and ultra thin continuous films. The program will involve ruthenium, cobalt and tungsten metals, and silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, and titanium dioxide as the supports. The overall objectives are to understand and describe the surface chemistry that allows metal nucleation to occur, and to determine if it is possible to control the growth of particles to maximize the nucleation density on the oxide substrate. Bonding and reactions at the substrate surface and at the film interface will be explored. Film composition and chemical bonding will be followed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low energy ion scattering spectroscopy. A full complement of characterization facilities will be used to study the films, including fluorimetry, atomic force microscopy, X-ray scattering spectroscopy, and high resolution electron microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Metal films find applications in sensors, optics and microelectronics, and as the critical dimensions or size of the applications and systems decrease, the metal films thickness also must decrease to tens of atomic diameters at most and must have a specific microstructure. Nanoparticles are used in advanced computer memory design, catalysis and quantum computing architectures; in all cases, there is a need to maximize the particle density and uniformity. This research is expected to develop a general understanding of how metal films and metal nanoparticles nucleate on amorphous oxide surfaces and initiate island growth. Nucleation and growth concepts are common to nanoparticles and polycrystalline films. The nucleation and growth issues explored transcend the material systems selected for this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research is motivated by the central role ultra thin metal films and nanoparticles on amorphous substrates have in applications such as electrodes, sensors, optics, thermal barriers, catalysts and diffusion barriers. There is an extensive literature pointing to the possible role of defects in nucleation and growth, however, there are few studies on amorphous surfaces that have measured and characterized the nature of these defects. This program seeks to use chemical probes designed to titrate the different defects. The fluorescence signal intensity suggest a sensitivity to 0.001 and possibly 0.0001 monolayers with these probes. If successful, the probes could be used to explore oxides more generally. Further this program addresses and seeks to describe the interfacial and surface reactions that affect the evolution of a film as it transforms from adsorbed adatoms to nucleated islands to a coalesced, continuous film.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Metal films find applications in sensors, optics and microelectronics, and as the critical dimensions or size of the applications and systems decrease, the metal films thickness also must decrease to tens of atomic diameters at most and must have a specific microstructure.  Nanoparticles are used in advanced computer memory design, catalysis and quantum computing architectures; in all cases, there is a need to maximize the particle density and uniformity.  As nanoparticles grow in size they merge into films so controlling the nucleation processes is key to particle density and uniformity, and in turn to the growth of ultra thin metal films.  This research developed a general understanding of how and where metal nanoparticles nucleate on amorphous oxide surfaces and initiate island growth.  The nucleation and growth concepts explored in this project transcend the material systems that were selected for study.     Metal films and nanoparticles can be grown in chemical or physical processes.  At the heart of both processes atoms are deposited on a surface where they migrate around until they form a stable cluster of atoms, called a critical cluster, with finite size or by getting captured by a reactive center on the surface.  Generally when the surface is an amorphous material, which lacks crystalline order, the nucleation event involves trapping at a reactive center.  As more atoms are added to the surface they can incorporate into the critical cluster and increase its size or they can form more critical clusters.  These processes proceed at different rates with critical cluster formation being so much slower that it rarely happens once the initial trapping events have happened.  This research program explored the number and chemical nature of the reactive centers so chemical methods could be discovered to increase the density stable clusters.  This research program also explored chemical approaches to slow down or stop the rate of particle growth so that more nuclei can form as a way to influence the particle density and the uniformity of the ultra thin metal films.      The number of active centers per unit of surface area is exceedingly small &ndash; so small that most analytical techniques are incapable of measuring their concentration or chemical properties.  This research program designed fluorescent molecules that were expected to bind in a very specific manner to the possible active sites and that also had a unique ability to be detected at low concentrations.  The nucleation work discovered a site-specific titration method to detect strained siloxane sites and oxygen vacancy defect sites &ndash; and their relative concentrations &ndash; on silicon dioxide surfaces.  Studies showed oxygen vacancy sites with a concentration equivalent to 100 parts per million are the inherent active defect sites for nucleation of germanium nanoparticles on silicon dioxide and that strained siloxane sites with a concentration equivalent to 1000 parts per million are the inherent active defect site for trapping ruthenium atoms as the first step in ruthenium film growth.      The studies explored simple molecules that could adsorb on a ruthenium metal surface and block continued growth as long as these molecules were added to the gas phase over the metal particles.  With the particle growth stopped or slowed, new critical clusters could form.  Carbon monoxide adsorbed reversibly as a molecule, blocked nanoparticle growth and allowed new critical clusters to form.  Ammonia, consisting of one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen, decomposed on the surface and the resulting nitrogen blocked nanoparticle growth and allowed new critical clusters to form.  When carbon monoxide or ammonia was removed from the reactor, nanoparticle growth on the new critical clusters and the formerly-blocked clusters resumed as the clusters merged into a film.  The research teaches the community how to control nucleation and growth of thin ruthenium films and more generally how the chemical methods work so they can be applied to additional metal systems.
