<AbstractNarration>Christopher Bardeen of the University of California-Riverside is supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Division of Chemistry to carry out research to probe how exciton structure impacts excited state dynamics in molecular crystal systems, with an emphasis on processes relevant for organic photovoltaic materials. The research plan is designed to accomplish three objectives. First, the team will continue their collaborative work on using time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy and theory to characterize delocalized exciton states in polyacene molecular crystals. Second, the dynamics and reaction mechanism of singlet fission, a process whereby a absorption of a single photon leads to the creation of two excitons, and potentially two electron-hole pairs, will be studied.  Crystalline tetracene will be a model system for clarifying how this unique relaxation process works.  Third, energy migration in organic systems, which plays an important role in determining solar cell efficiencies, will be studied using a modified version of the optical transient grating experiment.  The goal will be to measure exciton diffusion lengths of 20 nm or less by using a combination of standing waves and high dynamic range detection.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall thrust of this research is to generate fundamental insights into how exciton properties like delocalization can affect singlet fission and exciton diffusion, thus providing a way to assess the ultimate potential of crystalline organic materials for photovoltaic applications.  This understanding in turn could aid in the design of improved materials for solar cells and address an important societal problem: the need for clean, inexpensive, and renewable energy. Graduate students and postdoctoral associates will be trained in technologically vital areas. Outreach activities to local elementary schools which enroll a majority population of students from underrepresented groups in science will also be initiated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Global climate change due to CO2 emissions has made the development of solar energy sources a priority.  One way to increase the efficiency of solar cells (and lower their net cost) is to use multiexciton processes to reshape the solar spectrum.  For example, a high energy photon can be absorbed and then be split into two lower energy packets or excitons, each of which can generate photocurrent.  It turns out that this process can happen with very high efficiency in organic materials, where it is called singlet fission.  Singlet fission has the potential to boost solar conversion efficiencies by as much as 30%, making it a candidate for next-generation solar technology.  Our research addressed several key issues concerning the mechanism of this process and how it might eventually provide clean, renewable sources of energy.  We surveyed different organic molecules to determine if they show singlet fission in the solid-state.  We examined how singlet fission depends on molecular packing and morphology, i.e. how the sample is prepared.  The excitons produced by singlet fission have unique spin properties that makes them responsive to a magnetic field and may enable new applications of this phenomenon.  The quantum mechanics of this process is still being understood.  In addition to addressing fundamental science questions, we also began to look at ways to harness the low energy triplet excitons that are produced by this process, which is necessary if they are to contribute to electron production in a solar device.  This aspect of the research involved combining organic molecules with inorganic semiconductors.  While studying this process, we found that these inorganic materials could actually generate triplet states themselves, which could fuse together and generate high energy photons.  This is the reverse of the fission process, and can take low energy "junk" photons in the infrared and upconvert them to the visible or ultraviolet regime.  Exciton fusion provides another route to improved solar cells, and also opens the door to new display and imaging technologies.  A patent based on this new technology has been filed.  Broader Impacts:  The graduate students received training in experimental techniques like sample preparation, crystal growth, electron microscopy, optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and spectroscopy.  This training will allow them to contribute to the science and technology fields in both academic or industrial settings.  The project also supported outreach activities to grades 1-5 at Taft Elementary school, a Title I school whose population consists of a majority of underrepresented groups in science.  These activities impact over 500 students in the course of one year.  One such activity was a visit by the 4th grade class from Taft to UC Riverside that introduced both the students and their parents to the possibilities of college.
