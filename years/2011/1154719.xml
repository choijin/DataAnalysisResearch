<AbstractNarration>This award will enable an international collaboration for software development in computational chemistry between researchers in the United States and the United Kingdom. This international collaboration arose from a joint NSF/EPSRC workshop on Software Development for Grand Challenges in the Chemical Sciences held in Oxford, United Kingdom in June 2011. This award will fund planning and community building workshops, and exchange visits to catalyze projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will lay the foundation for the development of new community software that will impact all quantum chemistry programs. The resulting improvements will subsequently benefit the array of computational chemistry and physics software (e.g., solid-state physics and molecular dynamics codes) that depend on quantum chemistry models, and will ultimately provide a path to solving grand challenge problems such as large-scale ab initio simulations of metallic systems, the spectroscopy of solvated systems, or photoactive biological processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project facilitated the development of new collaborations towards the development of shared open-source software for quantum chemistry, stemming in part from a workshop held on the Virginia Tech campus November 9th and 10th, 2012, that included more than 20 participants from the US and UK.  These scientists represented numerous major software packages &ndash; both open-source and commercial &ndash; in the electronic structure community, such as PSI4, ACESSIII, Onetep, Molpro, GAMESSUK, GAMESS, Castep, MPQC, Q-Chem, Terachem, Gaussian, NWChem, and MADNESS.  These discussions identified a number of key themes of common interest to the community codes represented at the workshop, including new developments in high-performance computing platforms, the emergence of CPU/GPU and other heterogeneous systems, petascale and future exascale supercomputers, the abstraction of parallelism away from scientific code constructs, general scalable algorithms, tensor libraries and domain-specific languages, code and data interoperability, and re-usable components for generic chemical operations.  The long-term goals noted by the workshop participants led to a number of short-term software targets, including the extension of a powerful parallel runtime library current within one community code for use in other packages, the exploration of more general domain-specific language formalisms for greater levels of abstraction, the use of tensor contraction libraries in other codes, and the development of new data schema for sharing between packages.  The workshop also led to the establishment of a specific collaboration between Virginia Tech and the University of Southampton (UK) for the sharing of solvent models between the PSI4 and Onetep codes &ndash; a particularly challenging task given the subtantial differences in data representations between the code programs.  While the initial form of the code interoperability was based on direct data transfer, more recent efforts have resulted in the extraction of a solvent library from the Onetep code for potential use in other packages, such as PSI4.  The foundations laid by this project may yield much greater collaboration and collective effort by numerous community code developers, not only in the US and the UK, but globally.  Through the improved software interoperability promoted by this work, which will allow both developers and users to deploy a wider array of scientific tools on a broader spectrum of computing hardware, the worldwide molecular sciences community will be able tackle problems of greater size and complexity i the years to come.
