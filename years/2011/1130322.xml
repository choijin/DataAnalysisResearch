<AbstractNarration>The objective of this activity is to provide support for five students from U.S. universities to attend the 22nd Annual IEEE/LEOS Workshop on Interconnections within High-Speed Digital Systems and participate in the academic poster session.  The workshop will be held May 8 - May 11, 2011 at the Eldorado Hotel &amp; Spa in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  The workshop agenda includes tutorials, invited talks, interactive problem solving sessions, and an academic poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The exponential growth in data traffic and ever increasing demand for high bit-rate communications and e-services has accelerated research and development in the area of interconnection technology. The paradigm shift in computing towards parallel multicore processing requires an integrated design approach to address interconnect bottlenecks from chip-scale to system-scale architectures in networking, communications, and high performance computing. This workshop addresses the multi-disciplinary nature of these interconnection challenges by bringing together key researchers and industry experts from a variety of fields, including semiconductor devices, computing architectures and algorithms, 3D packaging, and opto-electronic integration. An academic poster session includes contributions from a selected number of high quality student papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This workshop will have significant impact on high-speed interconnection technology discussing novel approaches to break bandwidth bottlenecks in computing networks and communication systems. Junior researchers from the U.S., including graduate students and post-docs, will benefit from the interdisciplinary and interactive workshop format, training them to provide the next generation of high performance interconnection solutions. The workshop includes a strong outreach component through interactions with academic organizations and minority-serving institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[22nd Annual Workshop on Interconnections within High-speed Digital Systems:  Support for Student Participation  Grant #: 1130322  Z. Rena Huang  Project Outcome Report     1 Project Goals and Objectives:  The goal of this proposal is to broaden the participation of junior researchers at the 22nd Annual IEEE/LEOS Workshop on Interconnections within High-Speed Digital Systems to be held in Santa Fe, NM, 8 to 11 May 2011. The award provided travel support for junior researchers from the U.S. selected to participate in the Academic Poster Session at the High Speed Workshop.   The purpose of the Workshop is to determine the interconnection requirements of emerging and future computer and communications systems and to disseminate information about state-of-the-art optical and electrical interconnection technologies at the component, packaging, and systems level. The Workshop is "invited talks only," and is attended by experts from leading companies and academia in electrical and photonic interconnects field. Through this format junior researchers are given a chance to network with, learn from, and showcase their own work to the top experts in the field.  A unique feature of the High Speed Workshop is the workshop problem, which is intended to promote an overall focus to the meeting and promote interactions between the participants. The attendees are divided into smaller working groups to discuss and design a conceptual solution to a predefined design problem. The topic for 2011 workshop is Web Knowledge Search.    2. Educational Activites and Outcomes   The exponential growth in data traffic and ever increasing demand for high bit rate communications and e-services has accelerated research and development in the area of interconnect technology. This Workshop addresses the multi-disciplinary nature of interconnect challenges by bringing together key researchers and industry experts from a variety of fields including semiconductor devices, computing architectures and algorithms, 3D packaging, and opto-electronic integration. The Workshop is comprised of tutorials, invited talks, interactive problem solving sessions, and an academic poster session including contributions from a selected number of high quality student papers.     A total of five graduate students were selected to participate in the Academic Poster Session. These students were from various institutions, including Princeton University, University of California at Davis, and University of Delaware. All junior researchers working on research related to high speed interconnects were encouraged to submit their work to be considered for this session. Travel grants to support junior researchers to attend the workshop were awarded based on a competitive judging process. Without financial assistance many young scientists and engineers selected to participate in the Academic Poster Session would not have been able to attend the Workshop. An outstanding benefit of this workshop was the close personal interaction between the participants. It is important that those new to the field be present at the workshop with fresh and innovative ideas to discuss their work with those who have more experience.  In addition to the Poster Session, the unique format of this Workshop allows junior researchers to interact without formalities and brainstorm with top names in the field. Aside from the regular invited talks that comprise the presentation part of the workshop, two afternoons are set aside for problem solving sessions, in which the whole workshop community is given one tough application problem and task groups are formed that brainstorm about different aspects of the problem. The Workshop culminates with a final set of presentations from all sub-groups, proposing a complete system solution.  This is a great format not only to bring electrical and optical interconnect people together to brainstorm and understand the language and solutions that each side can offer, but also for junior parti...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
