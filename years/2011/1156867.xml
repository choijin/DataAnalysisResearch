<AbstractNarration>This award by the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense's (DOD) "Awards to Stimulate and Support Undergraduate Research Experiences" (ASSURE) Program supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of North Carolina - Charlotte for the summers of 2012-2014. Nine students will be selected for the REU program each year.  Participants will join interdisciplinary research teams which focus on ongoing collaborative projects with faculty members from the Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Nanoscale Science.  Targeted student participants will range from rising freshmen through rising seniors and include students who belong to undergraduate populations where research opportunities are limited, or who are from underrepresented groups.  Activities include a 10-week undergraduate research experience, workshops and seminars, outreach training and activity, and various social/cultural activities.  The primary broader impact of the NanoSURE program is the advancement of nanoscale science research opportunities at the undergraduate level and the development of a diverse workforce able to meet the multi-disciplinary challenges of the nanotechnology field.  The REU site will provide a mentor-guided research experience to students from underrepresented groups (women and minorities) and students from institutions in which access to research training is limited; Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Principally Undergraduate Institutions (PUI), and community colleges.  The direct involvement of rising freshmen in the research experience will stimulate this group of students to pursue college degrees in STEM disciplines.  The NanoSURE REU site will partner with the Discovery Place Museum in Charlotte, NC to provide training in scientific outreach and an opportunity for REU students to disseminate science to the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UNC Charlotte NanoSURE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site provided interdisciplinary training in nanoscale science for a total of 35 undergraduate students during the period 2012 - 2015.  This project was designed to respond to the national need to advance nanoscale science research at the undergraduate level and contribute to the education and training of the nanotechnology workforce of the future.  Participants worked with faculty mentors from the Departments of Chemistry, Physics and Optical Science, and Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science on research projects that created opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations that are relevant to the field of nanoscale science.  The objectives of the program were: (1) to actively recruit a  diverse population of undergraduate students to participate in on-going research experiences in nanoscale science and engineering with faculty members committed to undergraduate mentoring; (2) to introduce students to a variety of nanoscale science research methods, breakthroughs, and challenges early in their college experience to direct their career paths into nanoscale science related fields of study; (3) to engage students in interdisciplinary research opportunities that encourage communication and cooperation across traditional discipline boundaries; (4) to enhance the student experience by providing workshops, seminars, and social activities that will positively impact their professional development and encourage their participation in graduate studies; and (5) to develop scientific communication skills by providing many opportunities to disseminate results to each other in team meetings, to the public through a collaboration with a local science museum, and ultimately by submitting a summary paper in a peer-reviewed journal format and participating in an annual undergraduate research symposium.    The scientific merit of this award includes the publication of 5 manuscripts in the area of nanoscale science with REU participants as co-authors.  Undergraduate students from a range of experience levels were selected including rising freshmen (9/35 = 26%), rising sophomores (7/35 = 20%),  rising juniors (7/35=20%) and seniors (12/35 = 34 %).  This program was unique in that special emphasis was placed on recruiting undergraduate students who were early in their college experience in order to retain their interest in fields related to nanoscale science. Of the 9 rising freshmen participants, 8 (89%) are completing degrees in or have recently graduated from a field related to nanoscale science.  At this time, 20 of the 35 students have graduated or will be graduating this Spring.  Overall, 70% of all graduating participants have entered a post-baccalaureate degree program in a STEM, STEM education, or health field (14/20 = 65%).  Eleven have accepted positions at Ph.D. programs in STEM programs.  One student is now an NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholar pursuing her MAT:  Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education - Comprehensive Science.   Another one has entered a graduate program in Exercise and Sport  Science, and one has entered a Pharm. D. program.  In addition, many of the REU participants went on to receive national awards/recognitions including an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, an ORNL GEM fellowship, a New England Institute of Chemistry Fellowship, and an ACS Scholar.   A significant broader impact of the NanoSURE REU program has been the success in expanding the access to research opportunities to participants that traditionally lack such opportunities, with 30 out of 35 participants (86%) meeting at least one of the following categories: traditionally underrepresented minorities &ndash; African American or Hispanic (14/35 = 40%), rising freshman (9/35 = 26%), PUI or community college student (15/35 = 43%), and female (18/35 = 51%).
