<AbstractNarration>This project concerns the development, analysis and application&lt;br/&gt;of numerical linear algebra tools for the quantitative study of&lt;br/&gt;important properties of large-scale complex networks, such as&lt;br/&gt;centrality, betweenness and communicability measures. Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator and his collaborators study efficient algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for the fast approximation of the entries of matrix functions&lt;br/&gt;such as the exponential and the resolvent of adjacency matrices&lt;br/&gt;and graph Laplacians, as well as their traces. While these&lt;br/&gt;matrices are quite sparse, in the case of complex networks&lt;br/&gt;they behave very differently from the matrices associated with&lt;br/&gt;regular lattices (grids), such as those arising from discretizations&lt;br/&gt;of partial differential equations. Hence, there is a need to&lt;br/&gt;develop new methods, both computational and analytical, to deal&lt;br/&gt;with these very large-scale problems. The investigator brings&lt;br/&gt;together expertise in classical numerical analysis and approximation&lt;br/&gt;theory, as well as methods from spectral graph theory and modern&lt;br/&gt;network analysis, to enable efficient computations involving large&lt;br/&gt;graphs. Potential applications include the analysis of social networks,&lt;br/&gt;the study of biological and neurological networks, applications in physics&lt;br/&gt;and operations research, and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last decade or so, the emerging field of network science&lt;br/&gt;has had a profound influence on such different domains as physics,&lt;br/&gt;chemistry, biology, operations research, engineering and the social&lt;br/&gt;sciences. A deep understanding of network structure and dynamics is&lt;br/&gt;of great importance also for Homeland Security and for many businesses,&lt;br/&gt;including financial institutions and e-commerce. Detailed, quantitative&lt;br/&gt;models of massive and complex networks are now pervasive owing to the unprecedented availability of data on just about any conceivable topic. Extracting useful information from these massive data sets and networks requires fast and accurate algorithms. Such algorithms can be used, for instance, to rank the `importance' of elements of a network, i.e., to determine which nodes are essential for the proper functioning of a network. They are also used to determine bottlenecks in a network, and critical connections in a graph. The importance of these notions for crucial parts of the infrastructure of a country, such as power or transportation grids,&lt;br/&gt;cannot be overstated. The investigator and his collaborators develop fast computer techniques to solve these and related problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project concerned the development of novel mathematical and computational tools for the analysis of large, complex networks.  Networks, or graphs, provide models for a wide variety of  physical, biological, engineered or social systems.  For example: molecular structure, gene and protein interaction, anatomical and metabolic networks, food webs, transportation networks, power grids, financial and trade networks, social networks, the Internet, the WWW, Facebook, Twitter ...  Network Science is the study of networks, both as mathematical structures and as concrete, real world objects. It is a growing multidisciplinary field, with important contributions not just from mathematicians, computer scientists and physicists but also from social scientists, biologists, public health researchers and even from scholars in the humanities.  Networks arising in the real world have a highly intricate topology and can be very large.  Analysing these networks requires a large amount of mathematical ingenuity and computational resources.  In this project we have introduced new techniques, concepts, and algorithms for the analysis of large, complex networks. A new notion of "total network communicability: has been introduced, together with fast algorithms for its computiation and manipulation. This concept amounts to a new measure that can be used to quantify how well-connected and robust a network is. Network robustness/vulnerability is very important in areas such as power grid design and analysis and  Homeland security.  Other researchers have already been able to apply the notion of total communicability in their own research, showing the usefulness of this new tool.  We have also developed fast algorithms for problems arising in applications to Physics, as a byproduct of our main line of research on matrix functions for network analysis.  Our results have been disseminated  in 15 peer-reviewed papers and a large number of invited seminars, colloquia, lectures, and presentations at national and international conferences.  Moreover, three PhD students (all female) have been supported in part under this award, with two dissertations been already completed so far.
