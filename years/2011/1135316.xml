<AbstractNarration>The Innovations in Data-Intensive Astronomy workshop, to be held in Green Bank, WV, will be a cross disciplinary meeting to bring together computer science experts in data intensive computing and infrastructure, and leading astronomy researchers motivated by the need to analyze and curate massive astronomical data sets. The workshop will focus on discussions devoted to the development and deployment of next generation data intensive software applications and infrastructure to satisfy the science goals of the 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will facilitate discussion and foster the establishment of collaborations for data intensive scientific computing across a number of disciplines, including all branches of astronomy as well as computer science.  The workshop is timely with regard to the topic of data curation. There is much discussion and debate surrounding the decision of what data to archive long term. Complimentarily, the idea of software as an instrument is gaining popularity and shows promise for enabling science to a wider audience. That is, by retaining unreduced data indefinitely, we enable future reuse and reanalysis of the data in new, unanticipated ways, perhaps even by researchers outside the field of astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Project Report &ndash; "INNOVATIONS IN   DATA-INTENSIVE ASTRONOMY WORKSHOP       (1135316)         The "Innovations in Data Intensive Astronomy" workshop was held on May 3-5, 2011 in Green Bank, West Virginia.  Thirty-nine attendees, representing 23 unique institutions, attended.  The workshop format included a series of keynote talks followed by a period of 10 minute "lightening" talks with panel discussions each evening.     The primary topic areas covered included &ndash; Current and Future Challenges (science and technology perspectives), Data Understanding, Data Mining and Knowledge Extraction, Data Processing, Dana Management, and Moving Forward.  To keep the size of the workshop down, participants were chosen to be representative of their fields of expertise and the conference itself was webcast to an additional ~50 persons who were also able to post questions throughout the workshop.  The workshop was extremely successful at bringing a variety of people, and ideas, together to work on the issues related to data intensive astronomy.   A number of follow-on projects are now underway and more are planned, including a number of mini-workshops which will be held in 2012-2013 to continue the dialogs and work first started with the workshop.  All talks, as well as the conference agenda and participant list are posted online at http://www.nrao.edu/meetings/bigdata.  The agenda is also attached to this report.  While the cost of the webcasting was higher than expected, the overall meeting cost was kept low due to both donations from external groups (e.g. IBM) and most participants successfully covering their own travel costs.   A final budget is attached.       Last Modified: 05/30/2013       Submitted by: Karen L Oneil]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
