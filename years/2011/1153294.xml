<AbstractNarration>The investigators will build a Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) and install it near the southern crest of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) initially at the Mercedes Observatory (for a ~ 3-6 month campaign observation) and later at El Leoncito Observatory, where additional ionospheric instrumentation already exists. Neutral winds and temperatures are key parameters needed to understand upper atmosphere processes. Most of our knowledge of neutral parameters in the upper atmosphere comes from observations obtained by FPIs. The measurement of winds and temperatures at ~250-300 km and at ~95 km will be combined with other parameters obtained with co-located optical and ionosonde instrumentation. The main objective of the study is to improve understanding of ion-neutral coupling processes in the region. Different experiments will be carried out, e.g., the latitudinal comparison of neutral winds using other FPIs, the comparison of zonal winds and zonal plasma drifts (inferred from the motion of airglow depletions), and the study of high latitude midnight temperature maximum (MTM) effects. The study will also contribute to research on the dynamics and electrodynamics of the upper atmosphere.  The effort includes the organization of a mini-workshop on multi-instrument studies of the upper atmosphere to foster the collaboration between U.S. and Argentine researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supports collaborative research between Clemson University (PI, Dr. John Meriwether) and Boston University (PI, Dr. Carlos Martinis) regarding the question of the propagation of tidal waves that move upward from the lower atmosphere into the thermosphere in response to the Sun&rsquo;s daily forcing of heating within the stratosphere. The ozone layer together with atmospheric water vapor absorb the Sun&rsquo;s infrared radiation and releases the energy absorbed as a long period tidal wave that moves upward into the upper altitudes of the atmosphere modifying the temperature and wind fields. Consequently, the collisional interaction of the ionospheric plasma with the neutral species of the atmosphere above 100 km will modify the behavior of the ionospheric F-layer according to the meridional direction of the neutral wind&nbsp; whether poleward or equatorward. This phenomenon is called the midnight temperature maximum because the thermal component of the tidal wave may be as large as 100 to 200 K so increasing the temperature by this amount above the typical nighttime thermosphere temperature of 600-700 K. This award provided the resources for the fabrication of a Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) that is able to measure the speed and direction of the neutral wind as averaged over the altitude range of 225 to 275 km. This region is located where the nightglow layer is emitted by atomic oxygen as a result of dissociative recombination of O+ with O2 giving rise to an excited species, O(1D), that emits the 630-nm photon observed by the FPI instrument. Analysis of the spectral line shape of this emission in regard to Doppler motion determines the line-of-sight wind relative to the observing direction chosen, whether zonal or meridional. The intent of the project is to deploy this instrument to the Argentina Astrophysical Observatory at El Leoncito Argentina where there is also installed an all-sky imaging system capable of obtaining images of the 630-nm nightglow distribution that provide a photographic context to the dynamics observed by the FPI instrument measurements of the zonal and meridional wind components of the thermospheric wind vector.&nbsp; The machine shop of the Clemson University Physics Department constructed a SkyScanner, the instrument frame, and the etalon and camera mounts. The PI provided the data collection and data taking software for the analysis of the observations.&nbsp; Boston University purchased the etalon, 630-nm filter, the objective lens, frequency stabilized laser, and the SkyScanner digital stepping motors. The instrument was integrated and tested at Boston University. Unfortunately, the deployment to Argentina was delayed as a result of the change in government that held up the production of a memorandum of understanding. It is anticipated that deployment will take place in the fall of 2017.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/09/2017<br>      Modified by: Mark&nbsp;D&nbsp;Leising</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
