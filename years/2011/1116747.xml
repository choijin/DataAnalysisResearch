<AbstractNarration>Title: Modeling and Analysis of Multidimensional Shapes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The media world can be classified into one-dimensional media, like text and sound, and multidimensional media. Among these latter, digital shapes are characterized by a visual appearance and by a geometric nature. Examples of shapes are pictures, images, 3D models of solid objects, videos, animations, etc. The general goal of the project is defining and developing innovative tools for modeling and analyzing shapes that evolve over time, such as animations of 3D objects, or descriptions of time-varying phenomena arising from scientific simulations. Application areas benefitting from this research include medicine, biology, earth sciences, physics, and chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large amount of research has been done on modeling and analyzing 2D shapes in image processing and vision, 2.5D and 3D  shapes  in computer graphics and geographic data processing, and 3.5D shapes (representing  the graph of volume data sets) in  scientific visualization. Most of this research has been focused on a geometric representation of a shape. More recently structural representations based on topological tools have been developed. This project is developing geometric and structural representations and algorithms for modeling and analyzing 4D shapes, which describe the evolution of a shape over time, and 4.5D shapes, which represent the graph of 4D scalar fields.  Examples of the latter are time-varying dynamic three-dimensional scalar fields, examples of the former are animation sequences or isosurfaces of 3D scalar fields varying over time.  Specifically, the project is developing effective multi-resolution geometric representations for 4D scalar fields and 4D shapes, new approaches to the segmentation of such shapes based on Morse theory and a generalized notion of curvature, and multi-scale structural modeling of 4D and 4.5D shapes based on segmentation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project has been in enhancing the representation power of current tools for shape analysis and understanding by designing and developing new  models and algorithms rooted in computational geometry and topology.  To this aim, we have defined and developed innovative geometric and topological representations as well as efficient algorithms for modeling and analyzing discrete multidimensional shapes.  Such shapes are characterized by points in a low-, medium- or high-dimensional space, can be static or varying over time, can be endowed with one or more attributes. Examples in low dimensions  are terrains, or urban scenes acquired through LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) technology, and volume data sets deriving from physical simulations. The former are specified through massive clouds of points in 3D space, often endowed with attributes like texture or color, while the latter are defined by points in 3D space with one or more scalar value associated (e.g., temperature or pressure for atmospheric data), which can vary over time. We also deal with higher-dimensional shapes, since several  application problems consist of characterizing shapes from points in a (high-dimensional) feature space, or of understanding the shape of networks, such as the clique structure in social networks.     In the project we have been dealing with discrete multidimensional shapes, defined by point clouds, by developing effective geometric data structures which scale both with the size of the input data and with their dimensions, and are suitable for parallel and distributed implementations. Since shapes are simply defined through  scattered points, a mesh connecting them needs to be built, called a simplicial complex, which is  a mesh formed by simplices, e.g., triangles, tetrahedra and their higher dimensional counterparts. Shape analysis and understanding has been performed  by devising new topological descriptors and algorithms rooted in topological data analysis. Since the objective of the project has been developing scalable algorithms which can be  successfully used in real-world scenarios, our attention focused on entirely discrete approaches. We  have thus based our work on discrete Morse theory, a discrete counterpart of Morse theory, and we have developed efficient algorithms for computing topological segmentations based on such theory.     Major outcomes of the project are:  -       New data structures for simplicial complexes in arbitrary dimensions  and software libraries based on them  made available in the public domain.  -       A new approach for reducing the size of a simplicial complex while maintaining its topological properties.  -       Efficient topology-based algorithms for computing segmentations of multidimensional shapes, discretized as simplicial complexes.  -       A distributed algorithm for the homological analysis of multidimensional discrete shapes.  -       Multiscale structural shape models based on discrete topological structures.  -       A combined geometric/topological model for representing and analyzing triangulated  surfaces.     Software tools developed in the project have been applied to tree crown mapping from airborne LIDAR data, to the analysis and visualization of multifield data in atmospheric and oceanographic data, and to social network analysis.
