<AbstractNarration>This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is to develop novel biomaterials and cell culture techniques that modulate the reactivity of astrocytes. Astrocytes formed in the scar tissues after spinal cord injury create a barrier, and this barrier prevents the regeneration of axons and recovery from spinal cord injury. This proposal aims to develop biomaterials that attenuate astrocyte response following spinal cord injury and construct novel biomaterial approaches to support axonal migration through glial-scar interfaces. To attenuate astrocyte response, different peptides and proteins will be doped within aligned polymer fiber substrates. Astrocytes will be seeded onto the nanofiber substrates and the following parameters will be assessed: 1) dynamic and static astrocyte migration; 2) astrocyte activation/reactivity using molecular biology techniques; and 3) astrocyte stiffness using atomic force microscopy. Polymer spheres containing iron oxide nanoparticles with the chemo-attractants such as cyclic adenosine monophophate and brain derived neurotrophic factor will be developed to create magnetically moveable chemo-attractant gradients.  These moveable gradients are expected to foster the directed extension of axonal growth cones through astrocytes or the inhibitory proteoglycan aggrecan.  The proposal supports the education of undergraduate and graduate students in developing novel biomaterial scaffolds, isolation and culture of astrocytes and neurons. In addition, students will be trained in the assessment of cellular behavior using molecular biology and advanced microscopy techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individuals with spinal cord injury lose body functions below the site of injury leading to life-long paralysis. At present, no FDA approved biological, pharmacological, and/or biomaterial treatments exist to restore the lost functions. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel biomaterials to attenuate or eliminate the reactivity of astrocytes, a glial cell found in the scar tissues of the spinal cord that are known to produce factors inhibiting the nerve regeneration. Additionally, magnetically inducible polymer spheres will be developed to guide axons through inhibitory domains.  It is believed that these biomaterials can reduce the inhibitory nature of astrocytes and help promote directed migration and regeneration of nerve axons. The experiments proposed within this proposal will provide the framework for developing novel strategies and treatments for spinal cord injury.  In addition, the proposal supports the education of undergraduates and graduate students in the areas of spinal cord injury research and biomaterial fabrication.  Further, the proposal supports initiatives to educate students from elementary, junior high school and high school, and the general public about spinal cord injury and the field of biomaterials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to better understand the ability of fibrous materials to influence astrocyte (glial cell found in the central nervous system) behavior.  Astrocytes, following traumatic injury to the central nervous system, become reactive and migrate to the lesion edge where they form a glial scar. The glial scar, while protecting nervous tissue from injury caused by infiltrating macrophages, does not permit axonal or neural regeneration through the lesion site.  Fibrous materials implanted into models of spinal cord injury encourage white matter tract regeneration.  However, their design focuses on promotion of axonal regeneration and not on promotion of astrocyte biocompatibility.  In 2011, our group published a report suggesting that fibrous materials can change astrocyte response within models of spinal cord injury.  This discovery led to the creation of the aims presented in this research proposal.  Mainly, we wanted to: 1. Develop procedures for improving astrocyte biocompatibility to fibrous materials and 2. To further explore how fibrous materials biologically alter astrocytes.  Primary cortical astrocytes were placed onto electrospun fibers modified with fibronectin, laminin, or collagen (extracellular matrix molecules commonly used to improve cell adhesion to materials) coating.  We observed that astrocytes adhered most strongly to fibrous materials containing fibronectin.  Following this discovery, we explored the ability of fibers to influence astrocyte production of glutamate transporters.  Extracellular glutamate levels increase following central nervous system injury and can lead to glutamate induced excitiotoxicity.  Interestingly, we discovered for the first time that astrocytes increase their production of glutamate transporters on fibers.  Thus, fibrous materials not only have the potential of directing axonal regeneration, but also can change astrocyte physiology in ways not previously examined.  This work was published in our leading journal (Zuidema et.al., Biomaterials, 35:1439, 2014).  The project also helped fund other projects examining astrocyte biocompatibility.  We used fibers to create a culture model of spinal cord injury (Zuidema et.al., Biomaterials. 46:82, 2015).  Several other studies examined astrocyte response to biomaterials.  While the above paragraph summarizes intellectual merit, several activities were developed to increase awareness of spinal cord injury and biomaterials.  The most significant outreach activity occurred in May of 2012.  The Gilbert Laboratory at RPI developed an art/science collaboration titled: "A Walk Through the Nervous System".  The event facilitated by artist Dr. G. Washington involved graduate students and faculty and took students (high school, undergraduate) and adults through a tour of the central nervous system represented by several different modalities of art.  The local newspaper, the Troy Record, covered the event.  In addition to facilitating this event, the Gilbert Laboratory also hosted high school and undergraduate students in our laboratory.
