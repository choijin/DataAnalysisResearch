<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop photon-based quantum information technology for transmitting and processing information in ways not possible using classical-physics-based techniques. This project is developing a new technique for quantum frequency translation?a noiseless form of wavelength conversion operating at the single- or few-photon level, which is important for several reasons: 1) for interfacing between quantum memory operating at visible wavelengths and infrared photons for long-distance fiber transmission, 2) for interfacing between different quantum memories operating at distinct but nearby wavelengths, and 3) for shifting telecom-band photons into the visible where higher-efficiency single-photon detectors are available. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is in developing four-wave mixing in highly nonlinear optical fibers as a means to implement dynamic Bragg scattering. Using this new capability there is a wide range of important processes to pursue experimentally, including: 1) entanglement swapping in the spectral-temporal domain; 2) two-color, two-photon interference, 3) spectral-temporal transformation of single-photon states, 4) spectral-temporal transformation (including frequency translation) of states other than single-photon states, 5) spectral-temporal mode filtering and multiplexing of single-photon states.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are in quantum information technology and developing the technical workforce, as well as educating the general university student population in communications science. Nonlinear optics offers excellent opportunities to integrate research with science education, by connecting the research materials and personnel with course teaching. The PI helped start a new Science Literacy Program at the University of Oregon, and developed a course called The Physics Behind the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Communication technology typically rests on methods for generating and detecting radio or light waves. Each information-carrying æbitÆ is encoded on a pulse of such waves that contains a significant amount of energy in order that it may be detected with little effects of background noise. Our understanding of these methods relies on discoveries made in the arena of classical physics many years ago. As the energy of such electromagnetic pulses is reduced in order to make the system more energy efficient or for other reasons, the classical theory breaks down because quantum effects become evident, in which the discreteness of electromagnetic fields plays a role. The goal of this project is to study means for improving information technology in this quantum regime, focusing on the use of weak light pulses that contain only one or two photons&mdash;the elementary, discrete constituents of light. A single photon is the minimum amount of energy that light of a given color (frequency) can have.  Transmitting information by using a single photon for each bit (which represents a 0 or a 1) brings some inherent advantages, including the ability to ensure near-perfect security from eavesdropping. In addition, in the context of computing, when bits are represented by single photons, electrons, or other elementary objects, certain computing tasks can in principle be performed far faster than can be done by conventional computers, which are based on classical physics. Machines for doing this are called quantum computers.  An important goal that this project addresses is how can separated quantum computers communicate across an optical-fiber network? This would be useful as a secure communication system as well as allowing distributed computing to be enhanced. While these goals are still in the future, necessary groundwork is being laid now.  Specifically, this project studies the questions: 1. When representing bits by photons of various colors, how could these be transformed from one color to another, while maintaining the information encoded on each? This is important for two reasons: An individual fiber in an optical fiber network can carry many different channels of information if each has a distinct color, and transferring information from one channel to another increases the flexibility of the network. Also, in a distributed computing scenario, each computer may send and receive information-bearing photons with disparate colors; so converting their colors becomes necessary.  2. When two photons come together, their fields may interfere in a wave-like manner, changing their probabilities to arrive at one fiber or another or to arrive at one detector or another. Can two photons having different colors undergo such interference?  To study these questions, we have constructed an experimental system that is capable of transforming a photon of one color to a photon of a different color. A single photon (call it red) enters an optical fiber along with two strong laser light pulses of distinct colors. Depending on the brightness of the laser pulses, the red photon is observed to have a known probability to have its color altered to be green. During such a process, a small amount of energy is gained by the photon, at the expense of one of the laser pulses. (The other laser pulse also gains some energy in order that overall energy is constant.) In a prior funding period our laboratory was the first to observe such an effect in optical fiber. Our setup can easily reach a 50% probability for converting the color of the photon from red to green. The process works equally well in the other direction: green-to-red. The question we posed is what will happen if one red and one green photon enter the fiber at the same time in the presence of the two laser pulses? Four outcomes can be imagined: they both will convert color resulting in one green and one red; neither will convert color resulting in one green and one red; the green only will convert color...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
