<AbstractNarration>Animal behaviors are composed of movements that are coordinated across broad time scales. For example, human speech involves very rapid movements that control articulation of phonemes coordinated with slower movements of the respiratory musculature. The goal of this project is to understand how the temporal complexity of behaviors is generated by the nervous system. To this end, neuronal mechanisms underlying complex vocal behaviors of male African clawed frogs will be investigated. The central vocal circuit of Xenopus is an ideal model to achieve this goal because it remains functional in vitro (the brain can 'sing' in a dish), such that intensive physiological experimentation can be conducted during behavior, a feature that is not available in most other vertebrate species.  The results of the study are expected to reveal cellular mechanisms by which the nervous system organizes and coordinates a functional sequence of motor programs.  In addition, the project will provide opportunities for a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow to be trained in the inter-disciplinary field of neuroscience, and outreach efforts will be made to recruit students from underrepresented groups and educators in local secondary institutions to participate in the research program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Behavior is the most salient product of brain function.  However, the neural mechanisms underlying behavior are poorly understood.  We used calling behavior of African clawed frog as a model to understand how neurons function to generate behavior.  Adult male African clawed frogs generate advertisement calls.  One part of the call (named fast trills) contain a series of click sounds (a brief burst of noise) that are repeated at ~60 times a second for ~500 millisecond.  A single pair of laryngeal muscles involved in the production of sound is dedicated for the calling behavior.  This simplicity makes the analyses of neural circuitry underlying calling behavior simple and straight-forward.  In addition, we developed an isolated whole-brain preparation from which fictive vocalizations (neuronal activity that would have produced vocalizations had the brain be attached to the rest of the body) can be elicited.  Using this "singing brain in a dish" preparation, we can assess the electrical activity of the neurons (nerve cells) while the brain is engaged in calling behavior.   Previously, we have identified a type of neuron (nerve cell), called fast trill neurons (FTNs),that determine the click rates and the duration of the fast trills.  The activity of neurons can be characterized by their membrane potentials.  During advertisement calling, the membrane potential of the FTNs is depolarized during the fast trills (long-lasting depolarization), and spikes (a brief period of membrane depolarization that act as a communication signal to be transmitted from one neuron to the other) are generated at fast trill rates.   In this project, we explored how these two types of activity (depolarization and spikes) are generated by the FTNs.  Although FTNs provide signals to the laryngeal motoneurons, the final output cells that drive the muscles, we discovered that FTNs also receive feedback inputs from the laryngeal motoneurons.  In the absence of this feedback, the firing activity of the FTNs become erratic.  These results suggest that the signal within the vocal pathways does not flow in one direction.  Instead, the feedback signal from the motoneurons to the premotor FTNs plays an important role in shaping rhythmic calling behavior.   In addition, we discovered that the long-lasting depolarization of the FTNs that coincide with the onset and offset of the fast trills are mediated by the activation of NMDA receptors (glutamate receptors and ion channels) expressed by the FTNs.  These results suggest that we can now explain the duration of the fast trills in terms of the activation and deactivation of NMDA receptor molecules expressed by FTNs.  What is exciting about these results is that they will allow us to bridge the gap between neuroscience and evolutionary biology. If female preference for male fast trill duration changes, for example, the most economical way of matching preference is to change the ionic conductance of the FTNs so that the long-lasting depolarization will change its duration. In this way, our research not only accounts for the behavior of an animal from cellular and molecular perspectives, but will allow us to understand and predict how behavior can be engineered through evolution.  Through this project training opportunities were provided for one postdoc, two graduate students (one rotation student), two research technicians, and four undergraduate students (five out of nine are female students).  The postdoc was successful in obtaining a faculty position, two technicians went on to become graduate students, a graduate student went on to become a graduate program coordinator, and all the other students remain in current institution to complete their degrees.  Thus, the training helped students to advance their career in science successfully.   The results of the projects were presented at scientific meeting, invited talks at other academic institutions, published or submitted for publication, or summarized as a senior thesis.  In addition, the results were disseminated to the general public through the PI and students? appearance at local schools in Salt Lake City area, seminars for nonacademic employees at the University of Utah, and Brain Awareness Week.
