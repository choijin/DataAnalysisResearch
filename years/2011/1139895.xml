<AbstractNarration>This project supports an international symposium to promote the participation of women and girls in science, including participants from countries that do not have significant collaborative activities with the US, developing countries in Africa and the Middle East, as well as countries that seek to advance women's roles in STEM research.  Participants will gain skills, establish virtual networks, and bring back knowledge to their communities that will in turn increase future collaborative opportunities for US scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Committee on Women in Science, Engineering and Medicine (CWSEM) in collaboration with the Policy and Global Affairs Division of the National Research Council organized the participation of fifteen women scientists and engineers from Africa and the Middle East in the 2011 US State Department's Changing Mindsets to Promote Women and Girls in Science Conference held in Washington, DC. CWSEM's responsibility included the provision of the logistical support to the women scientists and engineers as well as encouragement of their development as a cohort of women scientists that could become a support network for each other beyond the 2011 conference and training activities. Taking full advantage of the talent and ability of all men and women is a critical component in addressing the global challenges that currently confront all societies.  The US State Department conference Changing Mindsets to Promote Women and Girls in Science was structured to focus on topics that are relevant to all scientific and engineering disciplines and it was envisioned as a catalyst in encouraging greater collaboration among US federal agencies and non-profit organizations on their global efforts for girls and women in science, engineering, and medicine. Participants had an opportunity to learn about:  Cutting edge practices that are helping to attract girls to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and support women in STEM, both in the US and internationally;  Ways in which societies can help empower women and girls through STEM; How institutions in the developing world are working to overcome barriers to involvement in STEM, and how this makes a difference in the lives of women and girls; and How the US government is helping women and girls in the developing world engage in STEM.   The women scientists and engineers also participated in a training program at the Fogarty International Center of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This program focused on skills that facilitate career progression in science and engineering and included sessions on mentoring, networking, and grant writing. In addition to the events at the US State Department and NIH, CWSEM organized a welcome event during the participants' time in Washington, DC in order to facilitate collegiality within the cohort and to begin the process of creating a sense of community for these participants.  Theinternational participants for the Changing Mindsets to Promote Women and Girls in Science project included:  Judith S. Satoguina, Benin  Ana Lucia Stival, Brazil Hassanata Millogo-Kone, Burkina Faso Fatou E. Bah-Baldeh, The Gambia Sudha Nair, India Mais Abdul Hakim Mohammed Mohammed, Iraq Rawia Tahrir Salih Salih, Iraq May George Amin Kassir, Iraq Sherine Butros Nabih Rahil, Jordan Baatar Munkhtsengel, Mongolia Omolola C. Betiku, Nigeria Robina Shaheen, Pakistan  Epiphania Kimaro, Tanzania Salome Kokushubila Mutayoba, Tanzania Ansam F.D. Sawalha, West Bank   After the 2011 conference and training activities CWSEM worked within its established channels of engagement (including other national academies of sciences and international groups that support women in science) to disseminate information and lessons learned from the project.  In particular CWSEM worked with the InterAmerican Network of Academies of Sciences (IANAS) and its Working Group on Women for Science (WfS) as well as with the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC) Working Group on Women for Science (WfS).  CWSEM has shared the knowledge acquired in this project with these organizations in an effort to increase regional engagement (with a focus on Africa and Latin America) of women scientists in training and mentoring projects as well as an enhanced understanding of needs and challenges facing women and girls in science globally.  This project also facilitated increased interaction with other  entities such as the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World (TWAS) and the Organization for Women ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
