<AbstractNarration>This proposal is aimed at continuing and strengthening the regional workshop series `Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and their Representations.' The express purpose of the Workshops is to provide research level lectures for advanced graduate students and post doctoral students working in areas related to Lie groups, Lie algebras and their representations. Lie theory is a fundamental part of modern mathematics and plays a key  role in harmonic analysis, differential geometry, number theory, algebra, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops supported by this proposal take place over weekends three or four times a year in California and other parts of the Western US. They provide novel and stimulating research and study opportunities  for graduate students and junior researchers to become acquainted with research and researchers in the  US and visitors from other countries who are working in Lie theory and associated areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the time period of the grant, nine workshops on Lie theory and related  topics were held at six different universities, namely the University of California,  Berkeley (two); University of California, San Diego (one); Stanford University (one); University of Southern California (two); University of Oregon (one), and Louisiana State University (one).   This was the first time a workshop was held in Oregon, as we are trying to increase the number of western univeristies involved.   More explicit topics of the workshops were quantum groups, Hopf algebras, representation theory and analysis on homogeneous spaces, Lie gruops, tensor categories and categorification, and representation theory and K-theory, a very broad spectrum of related areas. At least one of the (co)-Pi's attended each workshop.   The workshops were very well-attended, by established mathematicians as well as by many mathematics graduate students and post-docs. The junior people were then able to interact with senior mathematicians who are leaders in the field as well as learn about the latest work being done. Many new research projects have started at these workshops.    The funding was used to support travel expenses as follow: first, the speakers; second, graduate students, and finally post-docs and other beginning mathematicians. This policy encouraged yong people to attend.        Last Modified: 10/06/2014       Submitted by: Susan Montgomery]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
