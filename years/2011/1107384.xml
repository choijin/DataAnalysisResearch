<AbstractNarration>In the Arctic, the arrival of spring is sudden. The abrupt onset of Arctic spring  comes with the development of high pressure over Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea and shifts in the jet stream and storm tracks. These changes are important for the Arctic climate and environment and have critical influences on Arctic peoples and ecosystems. This project will test the hypothesis that the spring Arctic transition is a dynamical phenomenon, driven by the downward influence of the springtime stratospheric final warming, abrupt changes in the flow over and around Greenland and in atmospheric waves over the North Atlantic, and shifts in the frequency and tracks of storms entering the Arctic. The spring transition effects the surface climate and is likely modified by feedbacks from surface processes. The implications of the dynamical onset of Arctic spring for future changes in the Arctic will be explored, through analyses of atmospheric and Arctic surface data,  experiments with a global atmospheric model, and analyses of 20th Century and future climate simulations. This project will develop a dynamical understanding of the Arctic spring transition and its interactions with the Arctic environment. It will use this understanding to evaluate climate models based on their ability to simulate the spring transition, and it will examine model projections of future changes in the Arctic environment resulting from changes in the timing, strength, and structure of the spring transition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      A comprehensive diagnostic study of Arctic spring onset (ASO) has been pursued.  Major scientific goals include (1) a complete characterization of the timing, regional structure and time evolution of ASO events and (2) a detailed assessment of the physical mechanisms for ASO and the implications for the representation of ASO in global climate models.  A robust measure of ASO, based upon the time evolution of surface air temperature at high latitudes, was first developed.  We discovered that the timing of ASO varies considerably from year to year with events most frequently occurring around either March 1 (early events) or April 1 (late events).  Unexpectedly, no evidence was found for long-term trends in the annual timing of ASO.  Synoptic analysis reveals that virtually all ASO events exhibit prominent warming signatures over Northern Siberia (referred to as the "critical region").  In addition, however, ASO exhibits several different regional varieties (or "flavors") with distinct secondary warming signatures over East Asia, Greenland-North America and Alaska, respectively.       Although we expected that ASO would be related to major large-scale atmospheric phenomena such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic (or Arctic) Oscillation or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, no significant relationships were discovered.  This likely limits our ability to use atmospheric models to provide accurate long-range forecasts of individual ASO events.  On the other hand, ASO is related to short-term changes in semi-permanent weather patterns including continental high-pressure systems (such as the Siberian High) and oceanic low-pressure systems (such as the Icelandic Low). Thus, the representation of ASO in global climate models hinges upon the ability of the models to properly represent the behavior of such semi-permanent features.  Ancillary research additionally revealed that the seasonal evolution of such high latitude climate features is sensitive to short-term variations in the winter stratospheric polar vortex.  As such, an accurate simulation of polar climate (including ASO) may require climate models with well-resolved representations of stratospheric variability.       ASO is dynamically driven by anomalous heat transports associated with synoptic-scale and large-scale atmospheric waves. These results are scientifically reassuring as global climate models are thought to represent such atmospheric phenomena quite well.  Conversely, neither surface boundary forcing (associated with variability in sea ice, sea surface temperature or snow cover) or internal diabatic heat exchange processes (latent heat release or radiative processes) are implicated as being important during ASO. Again, this is reassuring from a modeling standpoint as there is greater uncertainty in the model fidelity of representing the physical impact of surface forcing and diabatic processes. This indicates a high potential for accurately predicting likely future changes in overall nature of ASO behavior (but not individual events).       Our research results provide a baseline understanding of the nature and physics of ASO that serves as important guiding information for the atmospheric modeling community in improving climate and weather forecast models. Any model improvements obtained will benefit the geoscience community at large with potential ultimate indirect contributions to improving public welfare. The project provided direct graduate student training in atmospheric diagnostic analysis, Arctic system science and atmospheric dynamics.  Project resources have been used in performing updates to the existing computational infrastructure used for research and educational activities in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech.
