<AbstractNarration>Akylas&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1107335&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A theoretical investigation is made of the propagation and interactions of nonlinear internal wave beams in density-stratified fluids.  These are fundamental time-harmonic disturbances that derive from the non-isotropic nature of internal gravity-wave motion.  Attention is focused on the following specific problems: (i) the instability of wave beams to short-scale subharmonic disturbances, a prominent mechanism of breakdown and turbulence generation according to recent experimental and numerical studies; (ii) three-dimensional reflections of nonlinear beams from a sloping boundary, including the case of near-critical reflection, that occurs when the angle of incidence to the horizontal nearly matches the boundary slope; (iii) three-dimensional collisions of nonlinear beams and the associated scattering of energy.  These physical phenomena are tackled by formulating mathematical models that are analyzed by asymptotic and numerical methods.  The theoretical predictions are compared against related laboratory experiments and field observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Internal wave beams play an important part in natural fluid bodies, like the oceans, lakes, and the atmosphere, where density stratification is mainly caused by temperature variations; there are numerous observations of internal wave beams in the atmosphere due to thunderstorms, as well as in oceans due to the interaction of tidal currents with the continental shelf and sea-floor topography.  This project is motivated by the need to understand and model quantitatively the mechanisms responsible for the transfer of energy from tide-generated internal wave beams to deep-ocean mixing, which in turn affects ocean circulation, climate change, pollutant dispersal, and nutrient cycles.  Moreover, the results of this study would be of basic value in geophysical fluid dynamics and applied mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Density-stratified fluids support internal gravity waves (IGW) due to the restoring force of buoyancy.  Although not as familiar as free-surface waves, IGW in fact are ubiquitous in oceans, lakes and the atmosphere.  In these natural settings, stratification is caused by temperature variations as well as changes in salinity (in oceans) and pressure (in the atmosphere).  Internal wave motion is inherently anisotropic because gravity provides a preferred direction.  As a result, energy is transported in the form of internal wave beams (IWB), which are the analogues of the familiar circular wave fronts in isotropic media.  IWB are of great geophysical interest as they form the backbone of the oceanic internal tide; moreover, in the atmosphere, IWBs frequently arise due to thunderstorms.   The main objective of this project was to shed light, from a fundamental perspective, on possible instabilities of IWBs which may cause wave breakdown, leading to momentum deposition, material transport and deep-ocean mixing.  These processes affect climate dynamics, pollutant dispersal and nutrient cycles.   Specifically, a mathematical model has been developed for the parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) of locally confined IWBs, such as those encountered in the field.  In sharp contrast to infinite periodic wavetrains, which have been studied in detail before and are known to be generally unstable, thin IWB with localized profile are not affected by PSI, except near certain critical latitudes where the Earth's rotation causes a resonance phenomenon.  In addition, it has been shown theoretically based on a novel mathematical model that the three-dimensional propagation of IWBs is accompanied by the generation of a strong circulating horizontal mean flow which extends far from the beam vicinity; moreover, due to interaction with this induced mean flow, an IWB can be unstable to three-dimensional variations.  These theoretical predictions point to the key role of three-dimensional effects, often ignored in modeling the internal tide and thunderstorm-generated IGWs.  The methodolgy developed and results obtained in this project, apart from applied mathematics, are also expected to impact physical oceanography and the atmospheric sciences.  In addition, this project had significant impact on the education of a graduate student, who completed his Master's and PhD theses at MIT, with partial support from this grant.
