<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Methylmercury is a well established health concern for humans, thus it is very important to become skilled at techniques which help to unravel the fate and transport of mercury.  Measuring natural variations in stable mercury isotopes presents a way to discern pathways of mercury through physical processes and biogeochemical reactions.  Once the movement of mercury has been established, we can use that knowledge to attempt to reduce the burden of mercury to the environment.  Through this collaboration I had the opportunity to learn analytical mercury techniques at one of JapanÃ†s first-rate facilities, the National Institute of Environmental Studies (NIES).  One of the primary goals of this research was to learn the techniques for measuring mercury isotopes in the environment.  There has been very little research done on mercury isotopes, as it is a relatively new area of research.  Thus, having a chance to learn the techniques for this measurement will be valuable for future research in my doctoral thesis and beyond.  The second goal of this collaboration was to measure mercury isotopes in sediment cores and fish samples from a pristine lake in Japan (lake Mashu) in order to assess the differences between natural levels, and more recent inputs from man-made sources, such as coal-fired power plants.  We were able to reach our first goal, as I had the chance to work on many of the mercury isotopes techniques, which will help me with my doctorate research on mercury.  However, the second goal remained elusive because we had two looming issues; limited time and delicate, sensitive equipment.  With scientific research there is always the chance that there will be unforeseen problems and issues that arise which we have no control over, and which interfere with research and results.  That was the case for my project, as the primary machine which I required to partake in mercury isotopic research (the Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer; MC-ICP-MS) was not operable for a lengthy duration of the 10 weeks.  That delay was undeniably frustrating as we were unable to follow through with all of our proposed research.  However, this fellowship still provided to be a wonderful experience for both culture and research, and I am extremely grateful and glad that I got the opportunity to participate in it and learn valuable techniques for isotopic mercury research.  Though we have no solid results to present from this alliance, we were still able to work on the methods and multiple extraction techniques which will prove to be valuable for future scientific studies and collaborations.
