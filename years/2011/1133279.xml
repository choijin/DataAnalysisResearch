<AbstractNarration>1133279&lt;br/&gt;PI: McKenna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental investigation of the aging, dynamics and rheology of thermo-sensitive colloidal dispersions near to the glass and jamming transitions is proposed. The investigation brings the PI's expertise and experience in glassy physics, aging and rheology to bear in a novel and transformative approach to the understanding of colloidal glasses. While the relevant behaviors have been extensively studied in experiments in which the suspension has been subjected to shearing deformations at a fixed concentration, there are very few works in which the response is followed after rapid, constant volume concentration changes. The advent of thermosensitive particles, such as the poly(n isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAAM) systems that swell and deswell in water with temperature variation have changed this situation and offer the promise of an experimental route to investigate the glass-like behavior, and specifically, the structural recovery based behavior of colloidal dispersions near to the glass or jamming transition. In addition to the thermo-sensitivity of these particles they are also barosensitive, i.e., application of pressure can change the particle swelling, hence isotropic stresses (pressure changes) impose concentration changes. The proposed research offers a transformational outcome as it promises to validate or invalidate a frequent underlying hypothesis in colloid physics that the colloidal glass is a model system for molecular glasses. Furthermore, independent of the specific outcome of the hypothesis validation, highly novel experimental results will be obtained that are relevant to the behavior of colloidal systems in the range of concentrations that are related to glass-like or jamming behaviors. It is specifically proposed to perform the temperature- and pressure-jump experiments using responsive PNIPAAM and PS/PNIPAAM core/shell particles to cross the concentration phase boundary (liquid-to- glass) along a two different paths (T and P) using diffusing wave light scattering to probe the aging dynamics of the non-equilibrium colloids. These experiments will provide the first extensive cataloguing of the structural recovery behavior of colloidal glasses in the Kovacs catalogued signatures of structural recovery, viz., intrinsic isotherm, asymmetry of approach, and memory effect. The results will provide insights to effects of particle "hardness" or "softness?"and colloidal glass fragility on the aging dynamics. Classical physical aging experiments using torsional rheometry will also be performed in the thermosensitive response regime following the methods originally proposed by Struik for molecular glasses. While there is much work in the literature that addresses the dynamics of concentrated colloidal systems in the context of the equilibrium dynamics and their divergence with concentration, the present work is transformative in that it applies concepts related to the non equilibrium behavior of molecular glasses explicitly in concentration-jumps induced by the thermo- and baro response properties of the PNIPAAM-based colloids. Thus, new understanding of the dynamics of colloidal systems will be created. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide research training and experience to students at all levels in the methods of characterizing and synthesis of colloids and the physics of glassy colloids. The PI and his graduate students will also be involved in outreach activities of middle-school girls.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The phenomenology of the glass transition in complex fluids, especially molecular liquids, is reasonably well understood.  At the same time, there is a significant amount of work on the "nominal" jamming transition in colloids that make a strong link between the glass transition in colloidal systems and the glass transition in molecular systems.  The question that is relevant to the present investigation is "what are the limits of validity for this analogy between the two systems?" To address this question, we have undertaken a series of experiments on aqueous dispersions made of PNIPAM particles that are thermos-responsive, i.e., upon changing the temperature one changes the particle diameter.   Hence, at constant number fraction of particles, one can change the concentration of the dispersion by changing the temperature.  Because the volume fraction is the control variable (in equilibrium) of the dynamics of the colloidal dispersion, this makes possible to carry out concentration jumps in the neighborhood of the colloidal glass transition to mimic the classical experiments performed by Kovacs in the characterization of the structural recovery of glassy materials in the neighborhood of the glass transition temperature. The "Kovacs signatures" are: 1) the intrinsic isotherms; 2) asymmetry of approach; and 3) memory effect that result from performing temperature jumps near to the glass temperature.  The three important effects evidenced by these experiments are a) the volume (or structure) of the glass varies with a kinetics that slows rapidly with distance below the glass transition (intrinsic isotherms); b) the structural recovery is nonlinear as evidenced in the asymmetry of approach experiment; c) the response to complex histories is additive in the Boltzmann sense of linear superposition of the responses in reduced time (memory effect).  By carrying out temperature-jumps using the thermos-responsive particles we can perform concentration-jumps in the vicinity of the glass concentration and we have been able to establish points of similarity and difference between the behaviors of the colloidal glasses and molecular glasses in terms of the Kovacs signatures.  Of importance is that the intrinsic isotherm type of experiment, while showing rapid divergence of the relaxation time of the material, does not show the same divergence of behaviors for the structural recovery times to achieve equilibrium.  This is unlike molecular glasses where the times for both increase rapidly (at least exponentially if not super-exponentially) as the temperature below the glass transition decreases.  Furthermore, while the asymmetry of approach occurs in the colloidal glass, the asymmetry is qualitatively different especially in that the time for the approach to equilibrium is the same for both the up-jump and down-jump conditions, whereas for molecular glasses the up-jump condition takes upward of one order of magnitude in time to achieve equilibrium.  Also, we find that the memory effect in the colloidal glass is different from that of the molecular glass and, in some colloidal systems is even missing.  As a result, we suggest that the differences demonstrate a need to revisit the view of the colloidal glass as a model for the glass transition event in molecular systems.  The work had a major impact on Ph.D. students working on the project. One student received his Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering in 2014 and one other student should receive a Ph.D. in 2016 for work on the project. In addition several manuscripts were written for archival journals and the students had the opportunity to present their work at major national conferences such as the Society of Rheology and the American Physical Society.  Also, the Department of Chemical Engineering also actively supports the participation of graduate students and PIs in both the Science-Its a Girl Thing (SIGT) and Super Saturdays activities that provide outreach to middle school (SIGT) and yo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
