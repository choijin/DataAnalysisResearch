<AbstractNarration>Development of professional skills is essential for success in the new global economy.  Equally important is the assessment of the degree to which these skills exist in the future STEM workforce.  This Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) research and assessment project is a joint effort among Pennsylvania State University, University of Maryland, Florida Atlantic University, and Auburn University.   A multi-disciplinary team is developing and testing a set of standardized instruments designed to assess four professional skill areas: Ethics, Teamwork, Global Awareness, and Creative Problem Solving.  The basis for this project is the Model of Domain Learning (MDL) that posits three factors (interest, knowledge, and strategic processing) that cross three developmental stages of learning (acclimation, competency, and proficiency).   Incorporated into the design and implementation phases of the project is a series of four experimental studies designed to test: (1) the validity and robustness of the MDL framework for assessing professional skills across STEM disciplines, course levels, and instructors; (2) the sensitivity of the instruments to document changes in the development of professional skills; (3) the viability of tracking the development of professional skills using the MDL framework; and (4) the adaptability of the framework with respect to students' progress through their degree programs.  The project combines both cognitive and affective dimensions of learning with skill development and is initially focused on engineering, business, information science and technology, and entrepreneurship.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project puts forward a novel assessment framework based on a pedagogical theory, the Model of Domain Learning (MDL), to assess student development in various professional skills across multiple disciplines.  We were able to develop and validate the following assessment tools in various course levels and disciplines"  Teamwork              Global Awareness                    Ethics  In addition, we developed a software called Peer and Self-Assessment Resource (PEAR) to peer and self-assess teamwork.  We did not plan on developing the PEAR software but it evolved with the project and became one of the most significant contributions.  PEAR has received favorable feedback, during the dissemination at conferences.  The following screenshot (Figure 1) illustrates the dashboard of PEAR.  Instructors can create rubrics, assign them to assessments, send assessment emails, and download assessment results from the dashboard.  PEAR provides feedback about how many questions are selected in each MDL component and stage.  Instructors can use this information to customize the rubric to the class level ((Figure 2).  Figure 1  Figure 2  In addition to using PEAR at Penn State campuses for different courses, other institutions also adopted PEAR.  For example, Lehigh University adopted using PEAR to assess their Entrepreneurship Capstone projects every semester and a faculty member coordinating the capstone projects prepared the following video about it: https://youtu.be/J63Dbwt4IrE  Our dissemination, especially presentations in conferences, was so effective in getting the word out and making others more interested and eager to try our PEAR Software; therefore, we continued our dissemination efforts in national conferences and workshops (12 workshops).

These students were co-authors for many conference proceedings papers and they made presentations:  Intellectual Merits: We developed and validated an MDL-based assessment framework for the acquisition of professional skills so that 1) students' development of the intended professional skills can be tracked and documented throughout their education, and 2) as a result of this learning acquisition, educators can get feedback on how to improve the curricular content.  Broader Impacts: Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of this project, the assessment instruments resulting from this work are poised to have a remarkably broad impact.  Information Sciences and Technology, Business, Entrepreneurship, and Engineering students, as well as their related economic sectors, will be directly impacted by this work.  Academia benefit from this project because the assessment instrument is used by instructors, administrators, and students to measure outcomes and monitor the development of professional skills throughout students? academic life.
