<AbstractNarration>This research project will uncover neuronal network mechanisms that allow animals to recognize, and learn to recognize, different odors in their dynamic environment. The early stages of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta's olfactory system generate odor-specific responses which are spatiotemporally complex. Electrophysiological experiments, in conjunction with conditioning trials, will be carried out to determine which features of the complex response are in fact relevant to the moth's adaptive encoding of its olfactory environment, and how these features are resculpted when the moth learns to appreciate a new odor. Specifically, we will direct experiments measuring (a) high-order dynamical structures associated with odor-response in the hawkmoth's antennal lobe and other synaptic centers including the lateral protocerebrum and mushroom bodies, and (b) the plasticity-induced shift in these structures following a conditioning paradigm. These experiments will facilitate development of both computational and theoretical models of neuronal networks. Specifically, we will develop (c) a large-scale spiking network model of the hawkmoth olfactory system which will be benchmarked using the experiments mentioned above, and (d) a theoretical framework capable of analyzing the rich dynamics found in these networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An abundance of recent experiments indicate that insects as well as other animals such as mammals, primates and humans, exhibit brain states that are incredibly rich, some directly induced by stimuli and some born from learning processes, all possessing dynamic properties on a variety of scales. The intricacies of these dynamic regimes are still a mystery. We currently do not know what these brain states are capable of, nor how they are used to drive decision making or learning. The hawkmoth -- "Manduca sexta" -- has a brain which is considerably simpler than a human's, but nevertheless has an olfactory system not too dissimilar from our own. By investigating the link between neuronal network dynamics, behavior and learning within this animal, we will draw conclusions relevant to some of our basic cognitive functions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report:  The major goals of our project were to:  Characterize the high-order dynamic patterns within the primary olfactory (i.e., smell) center and higher odor-processing centers of the moth Manduca sexta; and Understand how these dynamic patterns are determined by interactions among the network elements of the mothÆs brain.    Both of these goals involved a combination of electrophysiology and modeling &ndash; i.e., an interplay between experiment and theory.  Intellectual Merit:  Over the course of 3 years we have investigated several aspects of the mothÆs olfactory system, and have published several papers encompassing both the experimental observations we have made as well as the theoretical and computational modeling we have done to try and better understand these observations.  One such example involves the mothÆs antennal lobe, or "AL", which is the first stage of sensory processing in the mothÆs olfactory system. In its natural setting, the moth typically flies back and forth, encountering sporadic burst of odorant as it flies through odor plumes borne on turbulent winds. At each such encounter, neurons within the mothÆs AL typically respond vigorously for about a 20th of a second, and then fall silent for a relatively long period of time &ndash; usually 1-2 10ths of a second &ndash; before reassuming their normal responsivity. This silent-period &ndash; dubbed the æafter-hyperpolarization-phaseÆ, or "AHP-phase" &ndash; is caused by a concert of different intrinsic and synaptic currents within the AL neurons. We performed a series of electrophysiological experiments to study these different currents; using various pharmacological agents to modify the efficacy of neurotransmitters in the mothÆs brain. In order to better understand our experimental results, we developed, benchmarked and analyzed a computational model &ndash; i.e., a computer simulation of the AL.  The combination of our experiments and modeling work led us to conclude that the moth AL includes (a) heterogeneous recurrent inhibitory connectivity and (b) persistent inhibitory intrinsic currents. These conclusions carried with them several strong predictions, which we verified by performing further experiments &ndash; further validating our methodology. Using this work as a stepping stone, we conjectured that the AHP-phase of the olfactory response serves a functional role; effectively resetting the high-gain state of the mothÆs AL after each encounter with an odor filament and preventing any runaway synchrony that might result from the extreme sensitivity of this system. As hinted at by our theoretical studies, the Manduca may have evolved to balance the two mechanisms that contribute to its AHP-phase. Specifically, the mechanisms of (a) heterogeneous recurrent inhibition and (b) persistent inhibitory intrinsic currents may play the roles of (a) feedback and (b) feedforward suppressive adaptation, respectively.

Examples include (i) developing protocols to reliably train the moths to perform an odor-detection task, (ii) determining how to appropriately stain and record from the protocerebrum, and (iii) developing a protocol for measuring the mechanosensory response of antennal lobe neurons. This last experimental technique allowed us to recently investigate a very surprising phenomenon: namely, that antennal-lobe neurons initially thought to respond only to odor actually encode both olfactory and mechanosensory stimuli. This is a new direction aiming to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying how the brain...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
