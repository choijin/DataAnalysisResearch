<AbstractNarration>In order to address the critical need for Earth and environmental science professionals within Tribal communities, where American Indians remain severely underrepresented in the geosciences, the University of California, Irvine is organizing two-week residential American Indian Summer Institutes in Earth System Science (AISESS) for high-school students (grades 9-12) from throughout the nation.  The specific objectives of the AISESS program are: 1) to encourage and empower American Indian high school students to pursue higher education; 2) to increase the number of American Indian students who pursue degrees in or related to the geosciences; 3) to increase retention and graduation rates of American Indian college students in the geosciences; 4) to encourage American Indian college graduates to pursue geoscience careers, in particular those available in Tribal communities; and 5) to enhance public literacy of Earth System Science, especially within American Indian Tribal communities.  The first week of the AISESS program is spent camping and conducting field projects on the reservation of the La Jolla Band of Luiseño Indians and the second week is spent on the University of California, Irvine campus learning about Earth System Science through lectures, discussions, and laboratory activities.  The scientific curriculum is designed by faculty members from the UCI Department of Earth System Science in partnership with the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals at Northern Arizona University, the La Jolla Band of Luiseño Indians, and the Acjachemen Nation. The science curriculum is closely woven together with appropriate cultural activities, Native studies, and communication skills coordinated through the UCI American Indian Resource Center.   The program culminates with a closing ceremony in which students present poster projects on Earth and environmental science issues that are particularly relevant to Tribal communities.  Through key partnerships with the Louis Stokes California Alliance for Minority Participation, the UCI Center for Educational Partnerships, and Santa Ana College, the project is conducting extensive follow-up and mentorship activities that will increase the likelihood of recruitment and retention of Native students to the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>

In addition to successfully recruiting talented Native American students to participate in the summer program, we have worked to retain them at the high school and undergraduate student level via mentorship and tracking student outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp; While full results are not yet available, at least 80% of participants who have graduated high school are now enrolled in or have recently graduated from a 2-year or 4-year college or university.&nbsp; Previous participants are pursuing degrees in a wide range of STEM fields including Geology, Environmental Science, Environmental Engineering, Biology, and Math at universities such as Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Virginia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, Arizona State University, and University of Washington.</p> <p>The effectiveness of the AISESS program was evaluated utilizing surveys delivered before and after each two-week program aimed at capturing student background, attitudes, and knowledge about completing high school, attending college, and interest in Earth System Science and other STEM fields. Significant positive gains resulting from the program include strong increases in Native American identity, college preparedness, peer support, and knowledge of and interest in Earth System Science.&nbsp; Furthermore, focus groups were conducted with participants immediately after the Institute to capture qualitative data about their experiences in the field and at the University.&nbsp; These results indicate that students strongly feel like AISIESS has provided them with a support-system of attentive staff and peers that care about every student&rsquo;s academic and professional success, as well as their personal well-being.&nbsp; Students describe their sentiments about AISIESS using words such as &ldquo;special bond&rdquo;, &ldquo;inspiring&rdquo;, and &ldquo;imprint on my life&rdquo;.&nbsp; Typical student statements during focus groups include,&nbsp; &ldquo;The faculty has always been there for us&hellip;they&rsquo;ve sparked an interest..in a ton of students on what they want to do&rdquo; and &ldquo;this program catapulted me to&hellip;all these different doors I would not have known about had I not attended&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the fact that I am going to college, I credit a large part to this program&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the AISIESS program is on hiatus, at least temporarily, we are committed to supporting prior AISIESS participants moving forward and intend to build on our model for future Native American outreach programs at UCI.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2017<br>      Modified by:

Our program was designed with this in mind, and involved immediate immersion in field-projects on tribal lands, frequent interaction with the tribal community and tribal environmental professionals, inclusion of native educators, and completion of a capstone project on a specific Earth or environmental science issue that is particularly relevant to their own tribal communities.
