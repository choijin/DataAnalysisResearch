<AbstractNarration>Ad-hoc networks hold great promise, but there is a vast array of competing proposals for organizing such networks. Unfortunately it is unclear, in general, how to choose among the various proposed designs in any given deployment. In response, this project is asking a fundamental question: how should a collection of nodes decide what basic architecture to adopt in organizing into a network?  Candidate basic architectures include those that organize via traditional routing protocols, employ epidemic protocols, or use delay-tolerant networking protocols. This project approaches the question as one of deciding what state should be maintained, and how long that state should be maintained, in the network.  Relevant state includes both control state (properties of the network) and data state (the data in transit). The project is connecting dynamic properties of the network with the nature of control and data state to be maintained. A key project output is an identification of the network and traffic characteristics that can be used to determine an appropriate level of control and data state maintenance. The effect of these characteristics on the different classes of communication strategies is being rigorously evaluated. Using the characteristics that are identified, the project is developing signaling mechanisms to ensure that communication strategies optimally adapt to changing network conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result of the project will be more robust and broadly effective methods for creating ad hoc networks in new environments. Such environments can include battlefields as well as post-disaster deployments, where networks must be created quickly under unanticipated conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project has developed new methods for understanding the structure of networks.   One question that it has focused on in particular is how to analyze a set of paths that use a network. A network, such as the set of streets in Manhattan, may offer many different ways of getting from a starting point to a destination. Different paths may be used at different times. For example, the kind of data this project analyzes could be the paths of all taxicabs in Mahattan over a one-year period. The project has developed quantitative measures of how a set of paths evolves -- for example, when are the paths concentrated along corridors, and when are they dispersed throughout the network? This is in fact an important question in the case of the Internet, where nodes are Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and paths are the routes that data takes when flowing from a source (like YouTube) to a destination (like a user's laptop).  The question is important because over the past decade or so, large content providers have made dramatic shifts in the paths they take to deliver data to consumers. These shifts have had consequences for the economics of the Internet and for the quality of service experienced by end users. Before the results developed in this project, there was no formal way to study this effect globally and quantitatively.  Understanding how this is happening, and which service providers are responsible, helps society understand why the Internet delivers the quality of service that it does, and how the Internet's structure in general is changing over time.
