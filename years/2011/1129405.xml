<AbstractNarration>The Computer Science Department at James Madison University is supporting three cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students in Information Security and Digital Forensics via the Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) in Information Assurance program.  The undergraduate students are earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a thorough Information Security certification while the graduate students are earning a Master's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Digital Forensics, a combination of core computer science concepts and a technical study of digital forensics. The curriculum is system-oriented but also includes core digital forensics components such as the forensic process, relevant laws, analysis techniques, and report writing. The CS Department has already graduated over 200 graduate students with IA concentrations and over 150 undergraduate students with CNSS 4011 certificates. Future security professionals are given opportunities to be involved in research activities, especially in the area of Digital Forensics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is having an immediate impact on the Information Assurance and Computer Security capabilities of the federal workforce by providing Bachelor of Science graduates with general computing and security skills to the agencies that employ them. The graduates from the Digital Forensics concentration are valuable assets for federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, bringing with them the skills needed to investigate complex incidents and attacks to the national infrastructure. The PIs are focusing strongly on recruiting students from minority institutions.</AbstractNarration>
