<AbstractNarration>Metamorphic processes that take place deep in the earth's crust or in its upper mantle cannot be observed directly, and they span time scales much longer than human lifetimes, so knowledge of them must come from study of the rocks they produce. To reconstruct geologic histories -- to learn, for example, how long it takes for a mountain belt to form, how ancient it is, how rapidly it arose or was eroded -- we must be able to read the record of those processes that is encoded in minerals that formed at great depth and have been brought to the surface by tectonic processes. The central goal of this research is to learn better how to read such records in garnet, a mineral with a remarkable ability to capture details of its history in its chemical composition. Garnet, during growth, commonly develops differences in the concentrations of constituent elements from the cores of crystals out to their rims, and these variations are modified by diffusion, the movement of atoms through the solid crystal structure. Diffusional modifications occur to varying degrees, reflecting the various lengths of time that the crystals spent at different temperatures and pressures during their post-growth histories. The key to transforming these diffusional modifications into detailed information on geologic processes is quantitative knowledge of the rates and mechanisms of diffusion of different elements through the garnet structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior work has produced robust measurements of diffusion rates for elements that are abundant in garnet, but a much more nuanced interpretation of geologic history would be possible if comparable data were available for trace elements, those with very low abundance. Some progress toward this goal has also been made, by measuring and modeling the effects of diffusion in garnet crystals that have been partially resorbed at very high temperatures.  But data are needed at lower temperatures, and for a broader suite of trace elements than have so far been investigated.  This project will obtain those data by developing and deploying high-spatial-resolution methods of chemical analysis that will extend prior work to crystals in which the effects of diffusion span a narrower range of distance because they have been resorbed at lower temperatures. The research will investigate various means by which trace elements are incorporated into the garnet structure, and how different means of incorporation may affect diffusion rates, both for individual elements and for pairs of elements that may diffuse together in order to maintain local balance of electrical charges in the crystal. New data on trace-element diffusion in garnet should add rigor to applications as diverse as high-temperature heating/cooling histories and timescales of high-temperature thermal and metasomatic events, Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf garnet geochronology, understanding of metamorphic equilibration between garnet and accessory minerals, and interpretation of rare-earth patterns of mantle minerals and melts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed new techniques for high-spatial-resolution analysis of trace elements in garnet, and applied those techniques to determine new diffusion rates; it verified, by means of lattice-dynamics calculations, the prior inference that the menzerite and alkali substitutions are the lowest-energy and therefore most probable means of incorporation into garnet of yttrium and the rare earth elements (Y+REEs); and it produced a new explanation for the coupled diffusion of Y+REEs.  Most notable among the new techniques was development of an analytical method for laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry that uses a rectangular aperture together with a data-reduction protocol that removes the convolution effects of overlapped analysis regions and washout times. Analysis of radial concentration profiles in garnet, with the long axis of the aperture oriented perpendicular to the direction of the analytical traverse, yields a fivefold increase in spatial resolution with no reduction in signal-to-noise ratio. Application of these new techniques to stranded diffusion profiles in partially resorbed garnets permitted acquisition of new data on diffusion rates, at lower temperatures and for previously unmeasured elements. To give one example: for the first time, rates of lithium diffusion were measured; lithium diffusion was found to be coupled to that of yttrium, which implies that lithium profiles in garnet should be a uniquely robust indicator of fluid-rock interactions during garnet growth (Fig. 1).  Lattice-dynamics calculations demonstrated that the lowest-energy modes of incorporation of Y+REE species in garnet involve dodecahedral Na or Li components, and components of the menzerite-type (Fig. 2).  Binding energies for these complexes are large, on the order of 200 kJ/mol, which means that in order to maintain local charge balance, ions will tend to remain strongly associated as they diffuse through the structure.  Energies for partial dissociation of the ions (into second-, third-, or fourth-nearest distance sites) are on the order of 10-30 kJ/mol, which means that at high temperatures (e.g., 1000 K, at which the thermal energy RT is 10 kJ/mol) these ions can be transiently partially dissociated from one another, as would be required for their independent motions while diffusing as a charge-coupled pair.  Advances in theoretical analysis as part of this project yielded novel understanding of previously inexplicable observations of uphill diffusion for light rare earth elements in stranded diffusion profiles for partially restored garnets. Measured profiles were quantitatively replicated in numerical simulations that coupled the flux of all rare earth elements to that of yttrium (Fig. 3); this coupling is a consequence of the dominance of the menzerite substitution for incorporation of these trivalent cations.
