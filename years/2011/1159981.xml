<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:   The proposed research addresses the outstanding need for an integrated approach to dissolve cellulosics, an abundant and renewable resource, as an essential step for their processing into functional polymers, specialty chemicals, and biofuels. While several approaches have proven useful for activation of crystalline cellulose, the search is still on for solvents that can effectively dissolve cellulose. The few known solvents that are capable of dissolving cellulose do so under strict and often conflicting composition and temperature conditions, and fundamental understanding is lacking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team bases the proposed research program on the premise that fundamental understanding of cellulose-solvent molecular interactions (nanoscale), coupled with knowledge of the dissolution mechanism of semicrystalline cellulosic (microscopic) particles, can lead to the rational selection and (macroscopic) optimization of solvent processing conditions for cellulosic biomass.  To this end, the team aims to (1) advance fundamental understanding of intermolecular interactions acting in select solvent systems that appear promising for dissolving cellulose, and express these interactions in terms of appropriate parameters, (2) identify and quantify the transport phenomena and kinetics governing the dissolution of solid cellulose, e.g., solvent penetration, transformation from crystalline to amorphous domains, specimen swelling, and polymer chain untangling, and (3) guide scale-up from the lab to industrial production by modeling the dissolution of polydisperse cellulose particulates (employing parameters determined in 1 and 2), exploring synergisms in mixtures of solvents and additives, and testing the dissolution of biomass specimens. In the above the team will target aqueous NaOH-based and ionic liquid solvent systems that exhibit a potential for process integration and are compatible with cellulose functionalization chemistry and biocatalysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main novelty of the proposed research resides in the team's concerted effort to rationally integrate cellulose dissolution information from the fundamental, (supra)molecular level to the practical, large-scale. This would have a transformative effect on what is mostly an empirical approach. Further novel aspects include (i) a unified approach for understanding molecular interactions in different solvent systems, including testing a recent hypothesis on the importance of hydrophobic effects which defies current wisdom; (ii) quantification of the dissolution mechanism, based on real-time monitoring of cellulose swelling and mass loss coupled with phenomenological modeling; (iii) characterization of cellulosic biomass structural evolution during dissolution; and (iv) experiments and population balance modeling on dissolution of polydisperse cellulose particulates. Each of these research topics will be new in the literature, and addressing all in tandem should prove powerful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In summary, this research will have a positive and timely impact on efforts directed toward the utilization of cellulosics as starting material for the synthesis of high value-added functional polymers and chemicals and also for biofuel production. The team's findings will be beneficial to nano/bio-applications where well-defined cellulose surfaces or nanoparticles are desired, and for the analytical characterization of cellulose and its derivatives; also to the solvent processing of difficult-to-dissolve liquid crystalline polymers and carbon nanotubes. Collaborations will be pursued with researchers in industry and in Europe. This project will integrate research and education by incorporating lectures and projects related to biomass, solvent selection, and dissolution modeling in the various courses that the PIs teach at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Several students will contribute to this research, resulting in U.S.-based scientists who have both advanced technical training and sensitivity toward efficient resource utilization. The team will work with the AIChE student club to develop and offer outreach activities geared toward middle-school and 1st year college students.</AbstractNarration>

The recalcitrance of semicrystalline cellulose microfibrils provides a major barrier to cellulose dissolution. Despite research efforts, important aspects of cellulose dissolution such as solvent-induced decrystallization and chain disentanglement are not well-understood. We address these fundamental issues with the practical goal of gaining insights into the swelling and dissolution of cellulose that cannot be obtained from macroscopic experimental data.  Our research is founded on the premise that fundamental understanding of cellulose-solvent molecular interactions, coupled with knowledge of the dissolution mechanism of semicrystalline cellulose, can lead to the rational selection of solvent processing conditions for cellulosic biomass.     Key outcomes:   (1)  A novel comprehensive phenomenological model for the dissolution of semicrystalline polymer particles has been developed and has been validated for the case of the important biopolymer cellulose. This model accounts for solvent and polymer diffusion in the solid/gel particle and in the solution, and for polymer decrystallization and disentanglement kinetics. The results from the model include parameters both macroscopic (e.g., particle size, degree of crystallinity, decrystallization time, dissolution time, dissolved fraction) and microscopic (concentration profiles inside the particle).  (2)  A novel population ensemble model has been developed in which the dissolution behavior of a polydisperse population of polymer particles is obtained from an ensemble of individual particle dissolution models. Novel results on the evolution of cellulose particle size distribution and polydispersity over the dissolution time have been obtained, and the impact on dissolution of the size distribution width and the mean particle size has been examined at different conditions.  (3)  Properties of cellulose and solvents that are key in facilitating biomass dissolution have been identified through concerted experiments and modeling. Various solvents have been evaluated and ranked in terms of their dissolution efficiency toward cellulosic biomass.  (4)  An outreach activity (workshop) targeted to middle-school students has been developed and has been offered annually throughout the project at the "Tech Savvy" conference for female middle and high school students organized by the American Association of University Women (AAUW) in Amherst, NY. This workshop, titled "It Starts With the Sun", introduced cellulose as a nanostructured polymer, renewable resource, and essential ingredient in several products, and also introduced chemical engineering as a profession that makes several contributions to society and economy.     Broader impact:  The insights obtained from this study improve the understanding of cellulose dissolution and facilitate the selection of more efficient solvents and processing conditions for biomass. Specific examples of solvents are provided where cellulose dissolution is limited due to decrystallization or disentanglement.The dissolution model developed in this project would facilitate the design of efficient solvent systems and processing conditions for the dissolution of a variety of semicrystalline polymers, including polyglycolic acid and polyesters.The findings from this study would be useful for the rational design and optimization of pretreatment processes to reduce the particle size, leading to enhanced woody biomass utilization.
