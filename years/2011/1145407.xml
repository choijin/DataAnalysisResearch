<AbstractNarration>In this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division, Dr. George I. Makhatadze, from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the stability of proteins and enzymes. This work is the first step in understanding quantitatively the relative contributions of changes in volumetric properties (volume and thermal expansion coefficient) on protein unfolding.  Site-directed variants of model proteins (eglin c, ubiquitin, acylphosphatase) with large-to-small non-polar substitutions in the protein core will be studied using the novel method of pressure perturbation calorimetry, which allows direct measurements of volume changes upon unfolding.  The results of these experiments will be combined with structural and computational methods to provide quantitative estimates of the contribution of cavity formation and non-polar hydration to volume changes upon protein unfolding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed experiments will provide the first systematic study of the detailed mechanism of the effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein stability using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and a variety of biophysical and computational tools.  It is expected that the knowledge accumulated as a result of these experiments will lay the foundation for future studies of these fundamentally important issues, with broad implications for the use of proteins and enzymes in biotechnology, including renewable energy, green catalysts, and new biomaterials.  Dr. Makhatadze is actively involved in graduate and undergraduate education and curriculum development.  In addition, students at all levels (high-school, undergraduate and graduate) are participating directly in both the computational and experimental aspects of all research efforts in the his laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pressure is an important environmental variable that plays an essential role in biological adaptation for many extremophilic organisms, so called barophiles.  On Earth these organisms are generally populating the deep ocean floor where hydrostatic pressure can reach 110 MPa (~1,100 atm).  This research project is aimed at understanding how proteins and enzymes from these organisms can withstand high hydrostatic pressure.  Considering recent findings of deep oceans on potentially habitable regions on Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus this research has immediate impact not only on microbiology of extremophiles but also on astrobiology.      INTELLECTUAL MERIT  In this research we have used an integrated multidisciplinary approach that combines high performance computational modeling and bioinformatics with biochemical and biophysical experiments.  Using over 20 different proteins, peptides and enzymes we performed experimental characterization of volumetric properties as a function of temperature, protein conformation and protein sequence.  We also performed computational modeling of over 200 different proteins that represent a majority of known protein structural domains.   We have established experimentally the role of protein conformation in defining the thermal expansivity of proteins and enzymes.  We interrogated the volume changes upon unfolding of several proteins and enzymes and have shown that cavity and hydration are important determinants that define volumetric properties of proteins and enzymes. We have also shown experimentally that backbone has little contribution to the expansivity and that the hydration of side chains is a major contributor to this parameter.  Based on these experimental data we developed a comprehensive thermodynamic formalism that provides in-depth analysis of the contribution of various molecular determinants to the volume changes upon protein unfolding.  We did it explicitly modeling the folded and unfolded states as structural ensemble rather than one static structure.  We derived an empirical model to account for the changes in volume of hydration upon protein unfolding.  We also developed a computational tool to accurately compute volumes of different structural ensembles.  This tool was made available to the broader community free of charge via web-based interface.     BROADER IMPACTS  Initial results are very promising and we plan to apply our computational platform to comparative analysis of proteins from mesophilic and barophilic bacterium using the genomic information and structural modeling.  We also plan to use the computational framework formulated during this research in developing approaches to engineer enzymes that can function under high hydrostatic pressure. These engineered proteins and enzymes will have many potential applications in biotechnology, manufacturing and food processing.  The research has been integrated into teaching curriculum at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  It also provided summer research opportunities to high school students many of which went on to college majoring in STEM disciplines.  The PI and his lab have been actively involved in outreach to local urban and rural communities.  This involved mentoring elementary school students, and lectures given by graduate students in the local schools.
