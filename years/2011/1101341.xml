<AbstractNarration>Objective. Evaluate the efficacy of phosphorous-based MBE-grown layers and quantum dots for quantum-limit strong coupling between a single quantum dot and a photonic crystal slab nanocavity (solid-state entanglement on a chip).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Following demonstration of strong coupling in 2004 in Tucson, worldwide progress toward improving the ratio of vacuum Rabi splitting to linewidth, as needed for practical applications in switching and quantum information, has been disappointingly slow. Since the limitation on linewidth is cavity Q, reported values as high as 700,000 for GaAs-slab/GaInP-sacrificial-layer empty cavities compared with typically 30,000 in GaAs/AlGaAs motivate this project to optimize the growth of P-based layers and dots for strong coupling. Success could transform the whole field of semiconductor cavity QED. Much of the P-based growth has been by MOCVD (apparently adequate for electronics and lasers), but the surfaces are too rough for fabrication of high-Q cavities. This project would first grow flat layers for empty high-Q cavities and then grow dots within the center of the slab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The principal impact of success would be much more robust semiconductor quantum devices, much less susceptible to dephasing caused by photon escape from low-Q cavities. This would make the devices much more useful for single photon switches and for quantum state transfer between internal states of separated cavities. Training of graduate students in quantum optics and the required experimental skills of cryogenics and spectroscopy is another important impact. Mentoring RET teachers and REU students helps attract bright students into scientific and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past three years this project concentrated on the growth of quantum wells and quantum dots very close to the surface (around 5nm).  Obtaining quantum wells and dots close to the surface is essential to maximize coupling to any type of cavity fabricated on the surface, specifically metallic cavities.  One method of improving the quality of near-surface quantum dots that was explored was the deposition of a passivation layer of aluminum nitride by atomic layer deposition.  Using this method we saw an improvement in quantum dot photoluminescence of more than 4 times when depositing 1-2 nm of aluminum nitride.  More stable growth of semiconductor samples was obtained during the duration of this grant by the purchase of an arsenic cracker cell.  This cell uses a mechanical valve rather than temperature to control the flux of arsenic during semiconductor growth.  This allows for fast, accurate, and reproducible control of arsenic flux during the growth of samples, which is especially essential for near-surface semiconductor quantum nanostructures.  Particularly in the last year we discovered using a sophisticated high resolution x-ray diffraction technique that our aluminum indium arsenide buffer layer is not lattice matched to the indium phosphide substrate.  Iterating between semiconductor growth and x-ray diffraction we were able to correct this mismatch and improve the optical quality of our quantum well samples.  We have performed extensive studies on these samples using atomic force microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and time-resolved differential transmission measurements, allowing us to identify useful samples for future fabrication of nano-cavities.
