<AbstractNarration>Current information technology enables many organizations to collect, store, and use massive amount and various types of information about individuals.  Governments and other organizations increasingly recognize the critical value and enormous opportunities in sharing such a wealth of information.  However data privacy has been a major barrier for such information sharing, bringing much attention to privacy preserving data publishing and analysis techniques.  Differential privacy is widely accepted as one of the strongest unconditional privacy guarantees. While many effective mechanisms have been proposed for the interactive model with differential privacy, non-interactive data release with differential privacy remains an open problem with the recent years only see negative results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to build a data-driven and adaptive framework for differentially private data release.  It circumvents the hardness of differentially private data release in the non-interactive setting by novel and sophisticated use of the differentially private primitives exploiting the characteristics of the underlying data.  The specific research objectives include: (1) design adaptive query strategies for releasing data with differential privacy, including traditional relational data and high dimensional and sparse set-valued data, (2) design statistical inference technique to accurately answer user queries using the released data, and (3) design algorithms to model and incorporate potentially dynamic workload characteristics in the framework.  In addition to formal analysis and experimental evaluations, the project will evaluate and integrate the developed solutions in real health applications at Emory University to support health research while providing rigorous privacy guarantee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success of the proposed research will help overcoming barriers for large scale data sharing and will have broader impacts to large societies beyond the field of data privacy and information management.  The proposal also includes a set of closely integrated educational activities including new course development on data privacy and security emphasizing a strong interdisciplinary aspect, continued involvement of undergraduate students in research, and encouragement of women and minority for participation. The project also closely aligns with Emory's university-wide strategic initiatives in Predictive Health and will help develop the new Ph.D. program in Computer Science and Informatics at Emory University.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this project is to develop privacy preserving data sharing solutions that simultaneously provide rigorous privacy guarantees and high utility of shared data.  The outcomes of the project include a set of data-driven, adaptive data release algorithms for sharing various types of data under the state-of-the-art differential privacy including: 1) relational data, 2) set-valued data, 3) sequential data, and 4) dynamic data streams.   For sharing relational data (e.g. patient records), we have developed data-driven partitioning algorithms for releasing differentially private histograms which can be used for a variety of data analytical tasks.  While histogram methods work well for single or low dimensional data, they are less effective for high dimensional and large domain data. We developed a novel differentially private data synthesis method using copula functions.  Empirical studies demonstrate that it significantly outperforms histogram methods in terms of utility, particularly on high-dimensional and large domain datasets.  For sharing set-valued data (e.g. transaction data), we are mainly interested in preserving frequent itemset patterns (e.g. items purchased together by each customer). We proposed a top-down partitioning algorithm for releasing frequent itemsets from set-valued data, one of the first studies on sharing set-valued data via differential privacy.  For sharing sequential data (e.g. genome sequences), as with set-valued data, the goal is to preserve sequential patterns while satisfying differential privacy.

For general patterns, we proposed a frequent sequence mining algorithm which builds candidate sequences directly from frequent subsequences and uses candidate pruning and sampling for improved utility.    For dynamic data streams (e.g. hourly traffic or daily flu counts), standard differential privacy schemes do not work well due to the temporal correlations of the data.  We developed a novel framework with model-based filtering and adaptive sampling for releasing aggregate time-series.  Applying and extending the framework, we developed solutions in combination with spatial partitioning techniques, process modeling, and sensitivity analysis, and showed their effectiveness for traffic monitoring, web browsing activity monitoring, and disease outbreak detection.

This important statistic can be used to detect surprising trends in time-series data (e.g. finance).  A final outcome of the project is our empirical findings in evaluating the developed algorithms in real settings such as the healthcare domain where sharing health information for research while preserving patient privacy is a critical challenge.  Our studies validated the feasibility of applying differential privacy for biomedical data sharing but also suggested open challenges to make it a reality.    ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
