<AbstractNarration>This project addresses open questions and challenges in search theory, energy-efficient networked robotics, and fish biology.  A network of robotic boats which can track many fish in shallow waters over extended periods of time are deployed in invasive carp infested waters. Provably correct cooperative search and tracking algorithms are developed, energy efficiency is studied at multiple levels including navigation, sensing, communication and complete system, communication protocols for controllable mobile entities are studied, and data analysis algorithms are developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides a means to sustainably reduce invasive carp populations in US lakes without impacting other wildlife, thus solving a major environmental problem.  Robots are shown to serve as a major scientific instrument for environmental scientists.  The educational activities promote the results of this research to high school, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as educators across the country.  A summer research experience is offered which blends mathematics, computer science and biology.  Participation of students from under-represented groups is ensured through collaborations with predominantly Native American schools, as well as Central State University which has a 96% African-American student population.  The project simultaneously raises awareness of environmental issues and attracts students to science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project was to develop the hardware and software to support a robotic sensor network with applications in marine biology. Specifically, we have designed a low cost and low power sensing platform that has a long range wireless radio that can be used on the robotic boats that Dr. Isler from UMN is building. Furthermore, we are designing a networking stack for the sensing platform. This stack is customized for mobile sensing networks since it does not require a routing protocol to deliver packets. This feature is important because routing protocols have a difficult time adapting to the time changing network topology of a mobile network.   After the departure of Dr. Terzis to Google, the project was refocused on improving and modifying the TinyOS-based mobile wireless sensor platform for environmental sensing, derived from the software stack of the original grant.   In particular, we have solved several important problems related to a practically usable wireless sensing platform:  We completed the design and implementation of timekeeping system for low power wireless sensor networks and made it scalable so we can initialize a large number of nodes accurately and quickly.  We have augmented the hardware platform with dedicated real-time-clocks (RTC) in each node, using an Arduino compatible, therefore inexpensive RTC module. We added support for new nodes and platforms for experimentation to test these timekeeping and other services in the low-power wireless networks.  We performed rigorous testing of the system we built. Finally, we completed the hardware and software documentation for the project        Last Modified: 01/26/2017       Submitted by: Alexander S Szalay]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
