<AbstractNarration>The PI requests support for a two day workshop on October 25-26, 2011, in St. Petersburg, Florida. The purpose of this meeting is to bring together academic institutions, private research institutes, state and Federal agencies, and other important stakeholders active in the Gulf of Mexico to review the results of research started a year ago as a result of the Deepwater Horizon Mississippi Canyon 252 (DWH) oil spill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordination between academic institutions, state and Federal agencies, and other important stakeholder groups active in the Gulf of Mexico will promote the efficient use of the collective pool of resources; help to ensure that the data and information generated and the knowledge gained from research activities is utilized to understand the impact of the DWH oil spill; better prepare us to respond to similar events in the future; and advance the long-term restoration, recovery, and sustainable use of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific Findings, Observations, and Recommendations  When reviewing the findings of the plenary and breakout sessions, it is clear that significant progress has been made in understanding the oil spill, its fate in the marine environment, and the broad scale impacts to multiple sectors.  Moreover, it is possible to break these findings into three distinct categories:  scientific findings overarching observations, and recommendations for the future.     The scientific finds is drawn from the combination of science accomplishments presented in the plenary session, breakout session discussions, and in the submitted abstract, presentations, and posters.  These findings are examples from the workshop that are representative of the many findings presented and discussed by the group as a whole and should not be considered the only findings from the workshop.  Additional details on theses findings can be found along with additional findings in each of the session summaries supplmenetal session information the supplemental abstracts and speaker information, and in the presentations provided on the meeting websited (http://www.marine.usf.edu/conferences/fio/NSFCSOST-PI-2011/).     In addition to the more specific scientific observations and recommendations identified by the breakout groups relevant to their thematic areas, a number of more general, overarching observations were also identified.  When reviewing these findings, it is important to consider that the primary objectives of the workshop were to brig together scientists from academic institutions, private research institutes, industry, state and federal agencies, and stakeholders active in the Gulf of Mexico to report recent scientific advances, explore scientific date and information needs, and further develop collaborative partnerships.     Finally, the workshop discussions also led to a number of observations about gaps and need for continued research and possible avenues the scientific community could explore together to further our scientific partnerships and understanding of Gulf of Mexico science issues.  These recommendations include:   Establishment of an ecosystem-wide baseline is critical to future success:  It is important to recognize the scientific community, academinc, and Federal and state partners efforts to establish baseline information on select species (e.g., commercially important fish species) but that more emphasis needs t be place on establishing ecosystem-wide baselines to thelp support future management in the Gulf of Mexico.  Timely access to information is needed for response, restoration and research efforts:  The need for detailed response plans, trained personnel, and access to information when and where it is needed is critical to not only the response teams but also the research community routinely called upon to support response and restorations efforts and connect the college of observations with model based results and on-the-ground response efforts.  Improving understanding of impacts requires complete knowledge of the ecosystem:  There is still a need to evaluate the Gulf of Mexico at the ecosystem level to gain a holistic understanding of impacts from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the potential for restoration of target species like turtles, important open water habitats like Sargassum, and species that form the base of the food web like ichthyplankton.  Research is needed to improve understanding of health and economic impacts:  We still lack a broad assessment of the health impacts on organisms (e.g. plankton, marine mammals, humans) resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; an understanding the acute and chronic effects of oil and dispersants on individual species and the overall ecosystem; and the overall economic impact to the communities served by the ecosystem.  Improved understanding of the fate of oil in the marine enviroment is needed:  Notable gaps identified in the meeting included:  understanding how dispersed...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
