<AbstractNarration>This project develops and evaluates the effectiveness of two interventions on strengthening student understanding of prerequisite knowledge required for learning biochemistry and integrating this understanding into new knowledge gained.  The two interventions are: (1) pre-class activities that review prerequisite material and (2) process-oriented guided inquiry case studies that incorporate both new and review materials to strengthen the understanding of prerequisite knowledge and to integrate new knowledge.  Cognitive neuroscience and science education studies demonstrate that students retain less than half of the material presented in class. Developments in learning theory show that regularly recalling previously learned concepts reinforces connections and conceptual understanding.  These two interventions to enhance student learning and critical thinking are implemented sequentially so that their separate effects can be determined. Their effects will be evaluated through pre- and post-testing of prerequisite concepts, conceptual questions embedded on unit exams, and surveys of students' self-evaluation of understanding. Long term retention is assessed on comprehensive exams given a year later. This work impacts educational delivery strategies, including textbook organization and classroom delivery methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        Biochemistry is built upon core concepts from General and Organic Chemistry. Many students do not completely and correctly recall these core concepts, which makes learning the new material difficult if not impossible. This study examined two different strategies for reinforcing these prerequisite concepts: pre-class exercises, completed either as homework or as recitation activities, or the pre-class exercises in combination with in-class reinforcement of the concepts.  The experiment was conducted at a small liberal arts college (SLAC) and at a large R1 institution. The pre-class activities were written to both review key concepts and to show how they integrate with biochemical concepts. The in-class reinforcement questions were administered either as clicker or discussion questions, and connected the pre-requisite concepts to the Biochemistry content being taught.  Students completing just the pre-class activities did not show improvement in their performance on a foundational concept assessment; however, the pre-class activity plus in-class reinforcement group showed statistically significant improvement on the assessment. At the SLAC, long term learning was also measured with an exit examination given to the Chemistry and Biochemistry majors almost a year after completion of the biochemistry course. Students who completed the pre-class and in-class activities performed better on both the Biochemistry and prerequisite portions of the exit examination. However, the number of students completing the exit examination was small, and this result is not statistically significant.    The broader impacts of this work are that embedded review of pre-requisite concepts in upper level courses can improve student understanding of both the old and the new material they are learning.  This has the potential to alter how upper level courses, especially Biochemistry, are taught, and has ramifications for text book organization.
