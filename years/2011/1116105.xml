<AbstractNarration>The current state and future fate of the 'High Asian water towers' (i.e., freshwater reservoirs at high elevations) are of central importance for water, food, and power supply of densely populated regions in south, east, and central Asia. In addition to the highly seasonal summer rainfall, winter precipitation is important for snowmelt and discharge in the pre-monsoon season. Runoff from snow is especially significant in the central Asian and western Himalayan regions, where hundreds of millions of people reside. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to advance our current understanding of climate processes on regional-to-continental scales and how they affect the water balance in the High Asia Mountains. It focuses on multiannual-to-decadal variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and winter western disturbances (WD) and their impacts on rainfall, snow and runoff variability in High Asia. The investigators will: 1) characterize and investigate multi-annual-to-decadal variations in the ISM and WD and their regional impacts on the surface water budget, 2) examine the spatiotemporal variability of the surface water budget including changes in rainfall and snow and their relative roles in driving runoff variations in High Asia, and 3) develop case studies to investigate changes in ISM and WD and their influences on the long-term variability of snow and associated runoff in the High Asia Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project involve scientific and educational components. This work will characterize and analyze the physical and dynamical processes associated with multi-annual-to-decadal variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon, winter western disturbances, rain, snowfall and surface runoff in the High Asia Mountains. It will produce unique observational and modeling data and validation results that will be available to the climate, hydrology, and geomorphology research community. Further understanding of the physical processes associated with rain, snow, glacial and snowmelt waters in the High Asia will bring significant benefits for society. The nature of this problem requires scientific expertise and educational training in different disciplines: meteorology, hydrology, and geomorphology. The project will support and involve two Ph.D. graduate students and broaden graduate classes in the Department of Geography at the University of California in Santa Barbara.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The current state and future fate of the &lsquo;High Asian water towers&rsquo; (i.e., freshwater reservoirs at high elevations) are of central importance for water, food, and power supply of densely populated regions in south, east, and central Asia. The regional climate in the Himalaya is dominated by two major climatic systems that control water supply: the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) that extends approximately from June to September and winter western disturbances (WD) from November to February. The interplay between these systems results in two climatic regimes with distinct characteristics in water supply and storage. The main goal of this project was to advance our current understanding of climate processes on regional-to-continental scales and how they affect the water balance in the High Asia Mountains. The project investigated the following basic scientific questions: 1) were there significant spatiotemporal changes in snowmelt and runoff in the High Asia Mountains in the recent climate? 2) What are the relative roles of rainfall and snowmelt in driving runoff in the High Asia Mountains? 3) How do multiannual-to-decadal changes in the Indian summer monsoon and western disturbances control the variability of the surface water budget in the High Asia Mountains? 4) How important are teleconnections (e.g. Madden-Julian Oscillation-MJO, El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation) in altering the characteristics of Indian summer monsoon, western disturbances and their influence on multiannual-to-decadal changes in the surface water budget in the High Asia?</p> <p>The project performed diagnostic analysis based on Climate Forecast System reanalysis from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. The main research outcomes from the project include the following. El Ni&ntilde;o related changes in tropical diabatic heating induce a Rossby wave response over southwest Asia that is linked with enhanced dynamical forcing of WD and available moisture. Extreme orographic precipitation events are more frequent during El Ni&ntilde;o than La Ni&ntilde;a or neutral conditions. A similar spatial pattern of tropical diabatic heating is produced by the MJO.</p> <p>The research characterized the ISM as a subset of the Asian Monsoon System (IMS) and proposed a new multivariate largescale monsoon index, named Large-scale index for the Indian Monsoon System (LIMS) that is continuous in time and can be used to characterize the onset, withdrawal and intraseasonal-to-interannual variations in the IMS. LIMS can be useful to characterize fluctuations during the Post-monsoon season that are often associated with an increase in precipitation and extreme rainfall.</p> <p>The project additionally developed 35-year high resolution (6.7 km horizontal grid spacing) downscaling with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. WRF shows similar diurnal and inter-seasonal cycle of precipitation, from extratropical cyclones to monsoon precipitation, satellite and station data. In winter months, WRF compares better in time series of daily precipitation to stations below than above 3-km elevation, likely due to inferior measurement of snow than rain by the stations, highlighting the need for reliable snowfall measurements at high elevations in winter. In summer months, the nocturnal precipitation cycle in the foothills and valleys of the Himalaya is captured by this 6.7-km WRF simulation. The research indicates that WRF provides skillful simulations of precipitation relevant for studies of water resources over the complex terrain in the Himalaya. The data sets of 35-year high-resolution WRF simulations are available to the research community interested in investigating the climate of the High Asia.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/26/2017<br>      Modified by: Charles&nbsp;Jones</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1116105/1116105_10120982_1493185477710_fig.1.clim_inf--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1116105/1116105_10120982_1493185477710_fig.1.clim_inf--rgov-800width.jpg" title="High Asia Climatic Influences"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1116105/1116105_10120982_1493185477710_fig.1.clim_inf--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="High Asia Climatic Influences"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic diagram showing main climatic influences in High Asia</div> <div class="imageCredit">Carvalho</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Charles&nbsp;Jones</div> <div class="imageTitle">High Asia Climatic Influences</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1116105/1116105_10120982_1493185609593_fig.3.precip_ism--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1116105/1116105_10120982_1493185609593_fig.3.precip_ism--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Precipitation High Asia"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1116105/1116105_10120982_1493185609593_fig.3.precip_ism--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Precipitation High Asia"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Precipitation distribution across Himalaya</div> <div class="imageCredit">Bookhagen</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Charles&nbsp;Jones</div> <div class="imageTitle">Precipitation High Asia</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1116105/1116105_10120982_1493185742023_fig.5.jess_pap_fig--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1116105/1116105_10120982_1493185742023_fig.5.jess_pap_fig--rgov-800width.jpg" title="WRF model simulation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1116105/1116105_10120982_1493185742023_fig.5.jess_pap_fig--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="WRF model simulation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Comparison of WRF model and TRMM data</div> <div class="imageCredit">Norris</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Charles&nbsp;Jones</div> <div class="imageTitle">WRF model simulation</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
