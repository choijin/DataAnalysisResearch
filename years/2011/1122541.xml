<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on modeling and validating the macromolecular assembly of viral capsids.  &lt;br/&gt;Rigorous, mechanistic explanations and predictions are lacking for many milestone processes  that occur during self-assembly of symmetric macromolecular structures. This is despite  the fact that numerous representative structures of self-assembled viral capsids are available.  In  this project, we are specifically interested in:  a) nucleations, b) autostery, conformational switches and c) scaffolding removal,  all of which are processes driven by configurational and combinatorial entropy, a stumbling block for commonly used computational molecular simulation paradigms including molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods. Multiscale Geometry and Symmetry Constraints (MGSC) is a versatile and computationally highly efficient new modeling paradigm developed by this PI team during a prior NSF project: it complements and integrates with former paradigms while addressing key shortcomings. The project will use the MGSC paradigm to translate key questions about biological processes driven by configurational and combinatorial entropy into diverse mathematical and algorithmic questions that elucidate the influence of geometry and symmetry upon these processes. These questions are independently interesting and are related to longstanding open problems in combinatorial rigidity, algebraic geometry of configuration spaces, algebraic combinatorics, and complexity. Moreover, using MGSC, we will obtain a  systematic modeling procedure not only for extracting the minimal, relevant data (model input) for answering focused questions about these processes (Occam?s razor), but also for interpreting the answers (model output) biologically.  Finally, the project will use existing experimental results (in vitro and in vivo, performed at a co-PI?s lab) on representative families of viruses (such as the Murine Parvovirus (MVM),  Maize Streak Virus (MSV),  Adeno associated viruses (AAV4) to validate its predictions,  for instance, on crucial  inter-molecular interactions whose removal disrupts assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viral capsid self-assembly from its constituent protein molecules is a phase of the viral lifecycle that is relatively independent of the structure and processes of the host cell. Yet, the self-assembly phase has not been targeted in the design of drugs or vaccines for treating viral infections, nor has it been leveraged in the design and use of viral vectors in gene therapy. This is because the rapidity, efficacy, robustness, spontaneity and mathematically complex orchestration of  viral capsid self-assembly, occurring at the nano-scale,  is extremely difficult to understand. This project aims at bringing new insights into the viral capsid self-assembly process by combining the expertise of two mathematicians, a computer scientist and an experimental structural biologist. &lt;br/&gt;The project will build upon these results to continue the development of  an open source software suite EASAL (Efficient Atlasing and Search of Assembly Landscapes). This has the potential to be used by a wide variety of  disciplines that are interested in isolating the  crucial inter-atomic interactions that drive macromolecular self-assembly. Hence the project will provide outstanding interdisciplinary research experience not only to the graduate students and postdocs involved, but to the PIs as well.  The project will  provide research experience for STEM teachers at local schools and will additionally involve Tertl Studos - a game-based learning software company that is interested in working in the public domain - to creatively incorporate geometric constraint solving algorithms into a wide variety of math and science benchmarks in grades 4-12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was submitted to the DMS programs in Mathematical Biology and Computational Mathematics, to CCF/CISE and to MCB/BIO in response to the Dear Colleague Letter: Unsolicited Proposals at the Interface of the Biological, Mathematical and Physical Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;It is co-funded by sevral NSF programs: Mathematical Biology/DMS/MPS, Molecular and Cellular Biology/BIO, Algorithmic Foundations CCF/CISE as well as by the DMS Cyberinfrastructure for the 21st Century (CIF21) fund.</AbstractNarration>

The overall goal was to mathematically predict various aspects of this process and validate them biologically.   INTELLECTUAL MERIT The biological goals were the following. (A) Given  a high fidelity (X-ray) or relatively low fidelity (cryo-EM) structure of an assembled viral capsid, determine the crucial pairs of interacting residues whose disruption would result in disruption of assembly (B) Elucidate which stage of assembly is affected. (C )Understand short-term stability of capsid assembly intermediates. (D) Explain the mechanism of conformational switches mid-to-late assembly and predict how genomic material bestows advantage in assembly  and at what stage by understanding configuration space restriction. (E) Test whether interface assembly behaves the same whether small or large assembly components assemble at that interface. i.e., whether a local rules assumption for the microscale can be extracted from the nanoscale and whether scale separation is possible.

(II)  Give structure theorems and algorithms for exploring  interface configuration spaces (III) Give structure theorems  and algorithms to enumerate and count possible assembly pathways based on stability, symmetry and other factors extracted from (II).    To answer (A), for 3 viral systems with known Hi-res X-ray structure, we ranked residues using our newly developed mathematical and computational model and validated the predictions using mutagenesis results (we were unable to do this with Lo-res cryo-EM structure). Two papers were published and one is in preparation. Towards  (B), we were able to develop a relatively precise theory based on progress in (D) and (I), but unable to validate. Towards (C ), we were able to define precisely the geometric difference between stability  (low potential energy) and binding affinity (low free energy) and how to compute them using our configuration space algorithms in (II). Towards (D), we were able to obtain a clearer understanding via (I), of the vast and abundant variety of structures where linked pair transmission can occur.  Towards (E), we have a better understanding from (II) of the multiple candidate interfaces and configuration space restriction factors involved in the assembly of larger intermediates, but were unable to determine a definitive answer. Towards (I), we were able to give better bounds on the rank and better understand the transmission of linked pairs. One paper was published and one is in preparation. Towards (II),  we have obtained a thorough understanding of sphere-based assembly under short-range interactions. We published  2 papers, with 3 in preparation. Towards (III), 3 papers were published.     The unanswered questions from this project, as well as many new questions that arose during the work on this project concerning not only biological systems, but also soft-matter in general and material design and manufacturing are being investigated in 2 current NSF projects and a DARPA project.   BROADER IMPACT The project deepened interactions between not only the PIs but between mathematicians, biologists and computer scientists, adding  computational physical chemists definitively into the mix.
