<AbstractNarration>In this proposal, the investigator studies and develops a new, emerging generation of discontinuous Galerkin methods characterized by being easier to implement, by having enhanced stability and convergence properties, and by displaying an improved flexibility for handling arbitrarily-shaped domains. The investigator will focuses his effort in four particular problems. The first is in the area of fluid flow and consists in establishing a general theory of very competitive numerical methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The second is in the area of continuum mechanics and consists in the study of optimally convergent methods for fourth-order problems in order to pave the way to the devising of numerical methods for non-linear shells. The third is in the area of non-linear conservation laws and consists in the introduction of new techniques geared towards overcoming the two main difficulties that have dragged down for more than a decade the development of efficient, high-order accurate methods for these useful equations. The last is in the area of techniques for handling curved boundaries and consists in replacing the traditional paradigm of meshing the domain with high accuracy by the new approach of using a very simple mesh of a box containing the domain and employing special approximation techniques near its border.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer simulation of physical phenomena is a highly valued tool of practical interest in a wide variety of applications in Engineering and Physics. The investigator studies an emerging and promising technique of carrying out these simulations with highly accurate and more efficient algorithms for a wide range of problems of practical interest. They include many applications to Aerospace and Mechanics (incompressible fluid flow, subsonic and supersonic flow) as well as to Civil Engineering (solid structures).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The P.I. believes that the completed research funded by this grant has resulted in putting in firm mathematical ground already known and in the devising of new, state-of-the-art numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear partial differentical equations arising in several areas of practical interest.  These methods, called the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods, are high-order accurate, robust and quite versatile methods whose distinctive feature is to be more efficiently implementable as well as more precise (superconvergent) than all other previously known discontinuous Galerkin merhods for steady-state problems or implicit time-marching methods.   The P.I. believes that these methods will be have a positive impact in the Engineering communities interested in simulating physical phenomena by using computational  means, especially the aerospace and the solid mechanics communities. For example, the results on the methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations will be of interest to Engineers working on fluid dynamics. The results for the methods for the equations of linear elasticity, to Engineers working on solid mechanics.  Finally, the P.I. has trained three PhD students, one postdoc, and has continued to foster strong academic collaborations with three former PhD students and two former postdocs. The P.I. has also nurtured collaborations with other computational mathematicians and civil and aerospace engineering colleagues thus exposing the above-mentioned group to multidisciplnary research.
