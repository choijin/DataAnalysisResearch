<AbstractNarration>OISE 11-04344&lt;br/&gt;Jorge Pullin&lt;br/&gt;Louisiana State University &amp; A&amp;M College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides support for a 3 US postdocs and 7 US graduate students to participate in a two-week school on School on Quantum Gravity in Zakopane, Poland (February 28 ? March 12, 2011).  The school will be held within the framework of the European Science Foundation?s research network on Quantum Geometry and Quantum Gravity.  The Polish organizer is Professor Jerzy Lewandowski from the University of Warsaw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the school is to provide the students with an introduction to the main research topics of the network, namely:  loop quantum gravity, spin foam models, dynamical triangulations, matrix models, and the application of non-commutative geometry and quantum groups to quantum gravity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the courses taught at the school are not taught at US universities.  Attendance at this school will be a formative event in the preparation of a new generation of US researchers in the field.  This project fulfills the program objectives of providing US  junior researchers and students with a global perspective and access to unique expertise.</AbstractNarration>
