<AbstractNarration>This project concerns development and analysis of mathematical models of several complex biological processes, each with major importance to the fundamental and health sciences: cellular blebbing and its role in cellular locomotion through extracellular matrix, platelet deposition and fibrin gelation in arterial blood clotting, mucin secretion and its role in acid transport in the stomach, protein sorting and trafficking by the Golgi apparatus.  Although the details of the biology of these processes are vastly different, a common theme is that each involves a complex viscoelastic material mixture whose behavior is determined by the dynamic interplay of mechanics, flow, physical structure, and chemistry.  The mathematical description of these processes requires equations describing multiphase flow, the evolution of composition, structure and chemistry, and the relationship between stresses and composition/structure.  The solution and analysis of sophisticated models that combine these elements will pose substantial mathematical and computational challenges.  To meet these challenges, the investigators will develop and apply advanced numerical algorithms to gain fundamental insights into the mechanisms of function of these important physiological processes.  This work will lead to novel and important advances in understanding the essential role of the mechanics and dynamics of complex materials in the function of biological systems.  This, in turn, will support improved diagnosis and treatment of a range of serious medical disorders including coronary artery disease, cancer, and metabolic disease.  The work will also lead to better understanding of complex materials in general and contribute to the design of novel new materials for meeting pressing technological challenges.  Furthermore, the design of new computational algorithms will lead to new capabilities in the use of high-performance computing in science and engineering.  The highly interdisciplinary nature of the project will provide many opportunities for training young scientists in the new multi-disciplinary approach to science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many important physiological processes involve interactions between materials of different types (for example, water and cells or water and polymer gels) and which move relative to one another.  The physical interactions between the materials can be strongly influenced by chemical reactions, and the chemical reactions in turn are influenced by the materials' motion and other interactions.  Better insight into how such complex systems work and are regulated is critical to understanding these important processes and how they can be manipulated to improve human health.  Because these processes are governed by physical and chemical principles and properties, and because these principles and properties can be expressed mathematically, mathematical tools can be brought to bear on these problems. Through mathematical analysis and computational simulations, new insights into the materials' behavior can be developed and a wealth of data can be obtained that complements the data obtainable from traditional laboratory experiments.  Hence the combination of mathematical and experimental investigators brought together in this project is expected to lead to significant new insights in important physiological and pathological situations including blood clotting, metabolism, and cancer metastasis.  Further the mathematics and computational tools developed in the project will impact the development of non-biological complex materials to meet pressing technological challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         We developed a new method to simulate materials that consist of a two-phase gel in contact with a viscous fluid. The method tracks the interface between the two materials implicitly, and it uses a regularization procedure to solve the same set of equations in both materials. This formulation allows for fast and robust solvers on simple computational domains, which means that the method could be applied to a wide class of problems such as simulating fibrous blot clots in contact with the blood or the layered structure of mucus which lines the respiratory tract.   We developed novel methods based on radial basis functions for numerically solving partial differential equations on general surfaces.  In particular, we developed a method for solving reaction-diffusion equations on surfaces, which arise in a multitude of applications from biology to material science to pharmaceuticals.  We demonstrated that the method is competitive with existing methods, but has the added benefits that it does not require a grid or mesh and does not use surface based coordinate systems. These are important for problems where the surface moves as it greatly simplifies the implementation and reduces the computational cost.  We also developed the first method that is free of any tuning parameters for solving purely hyperbolic problems on surfaces, such as chemical transport in biological cells.  This makes the method robust over a wide range of flow configurations.  We developed a new numerical method for problems where a reaction-diffusion processes on a surface is linked to diffusion processes in the bulk medium. Our specific focus was on modeling platelet aggregation where diffusion of chemicals in the blood signals reaction-diffusion processes of chemicals on the platelet surfaces. The new method is based on a forcing method, but overcomes some of the difficulties traditionally associated with these methods.  For example, our method allows immersed structures to come very close to one another without leading to computational difficulties.  This allows these structures to naturally form links to one another, which is again important for platelet aggregation problems.  Many of the fluid-structure models that were the focus of the grant are based ideas from the classical immersed boundary method.  One issue with this method is that the geometric models of the structures (cells) immersed in the fluid are low-order accurate and often do not allow sophisticated constitutive models to be applied in a straightforward manner.  We developed a new hybrid immersed boundary method that uses radial basis functions to model the geometric structures.  The method is high-order accurate and more naturally allows complex constitutive models to be applied.  We applied this method to simulating platelets in hemodynamic flows and demonstrated an improvement in accuracy and computational cost over more traditional immersed boundary methods.  We also made advances in general numerical methods for spherical and polar geometries, which are pervasive in science and engineering applications.  For example, we developed a new method for doing numerical integration over a sphere based on samples of a function at scattered points over a sphere.  We also developed a new method for computing with functions defined on a sphere or disk. The method is based on "iterative Gaussian elimination" and produces low-rank, spectrally accurate approximations of functions on the sphere or disk.  These approximations are designed to explicitly conform to the symmetry of the sphere.  The form of the approximants allows for fast and stable algorithms to be applied to functions in these geometries, such as differentiation and integration.  It can also be used for developing optimal complexity solvers for some simple differential equations.  We implemented all the algorithms for this new method in the open source software package Chebfun.   Finally, this award partially supported one PhD student, two MS students, and one undergraduate student. All of the trainees worked on interdisciplinary projects and gained experience in numerical analysis, scientific computing, mathematical modeling, and communicating across disciplines.
