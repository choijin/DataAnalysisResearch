<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1105871&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Mark Gross&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to study the geometry of mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry for Calabi-Yau manifolds. This will be done from the&lt;br/&gt;perspective of a program developed jointly with B. Siebert, which&lt;br/&gt;"tropicalizes" Calabi-Yau manifolds, using an algebro-geometric&lt;br/&gt;version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture.  In particular,&lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator proposes to resolve a number of the&lt;br/&gt;remaining key steps of this program; these steps should be the&lt;br/&gt;component pieces of a complete conceptual proof of mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry at genus zero. These steps include a general gluing&lt;br/&gt;formula for the theory of logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants&lt;br/&gt;and a generalization of the tropical vertex of the PI,&lt;br/&gt;Pandharipande and Siebert to all dimensions. In addition, the&lt;br/&gt;program with Siebert has led to the construction of canonical&lt;br/&gt;theta functions for lines bundles on (degenerating families) of&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau manifolds. The existence of such theta functions is&lt;br/&gt;expected to have various applications, such as geometric&lt;br/&gt;compactifications of the moduli space of K3 surfaces (being&lt;br/&gt;pursued with P. Hacking and S. Keel) and a tropical approach to&lt;br/&gt;homological mirror symmetry (being pursued with Siebert and&lt;br/&gt;M. Abouzaid).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work described in this proposal lies at the intersection of&lt;br/&gt;string theory and geometry. String theory replaces the&lt;br/&gt;traditional notion of the point particle with a small loop of&lt;br/&gt;string, moving through space-time.  To make string theory&lt;br/&gt;compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must be&lt;br/&gt;ten-dimensional. Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one&lt;br/&gt;expects six of these dimensions to be a very small "curled up"&lt;br/&gt;geometric object.  These geometric objects are called Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. In the early 1990s, string theorists proposed a&lt;br/&gt;remarkable association between completely different Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;manifolds: certain calculations extremely difficult to perform on&lt;br/&gt;one Calabi-Yau manifold could be completed by performing&lt;br/&gt;completely different, and much easier, calculations on a&lt;br/&gt;different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry.  Since this time, many geometers have been trying to&lt;br/&gt;understand the mathematics behind this miraculous&lt;br/&gt;observation. New insights and explanations for this phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;are developing rapidly, and these insights are leading to new&lt;br/&gt;approaches to old problems in algebraic geometry. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;work aims to both further understanding of mirror symmetry and&lt;br/&gt;apply this understanding to produce new developments in algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry.</AbstractNarration>

The general goal of the work during the award period was to develop further the correspondence between the tropical world and the more classical geometries described above. Indeed, I have made much progress in this direction over the last three years.  As well as funding the research described above, the award also provided support for the doctoral training for four Ph.D. students, one of them female.
