<AbstractNarration>The Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative (CCURI) www.ccuri.org is a national consortium of community colleges, four-year schools, government agencies, and private organizations dedicated to the development, implementation, and assessment of a sustainable model for integrating an undergraduate research (UR) experience into community college biology curriculum. In partnership with the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR), CCURI has developed a fully-integrated model for integrating undergraduate research at a community college. This project aims to 1) Expand a modified version of the CCURI model to 16 additional community colleges; 2) Implement a comprehensive evaluation of the CCURI model on student learning, competency, and retention in STEM; 3) Measure the impact of the CCURI model on developing institutional capacity at the 16 additional community colleges that are committed to developing an undergraduate research program; and 4) Disseminate the modified CCURI model of integration and the customized versions of the model as they exist at the institutional partners within CCURI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is responsive to the recommendations for biology education reform called for in both Vision and Change: A Call To Action (NSF/AAAS) and the BIO 2010 report (NRC). CCURI is working toward a fully validated strategy that community colleges can look to in understanding how to initiate reform. The CCURI model is novel in that it was developed from a Root Cause Analysis of the unique barriers that community colleges face in sustaining UR programs. The proposal includes economic impact metrics as a tool for evaluating a Community College Faculty Model, and leverages a partnership with Tennessee Tech and their CAT instrument to capture gains in critical thinking skills - an outcome with implications beyond biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is creating and sustaining a national network of Community Colleges committed to bringing the UR experience into biology curriculum. The model is helping community colleges overcome the unique barriers that have prevented them from employing the power of the UR pedagogy in the education of approximately 45% of all U.S. undergraduates including underrepresented groups and students who are the first generation of their family to attend college. The results from the extensive evaluation plan is being widely disseminated and used to refine the model for integrating the UR experience at a community college.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant (NSF DUE 11-18680) provided support for the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) to collaborate with the Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative (CCURI), funded through another CCLI III award (11-18679) to Finger Lakes Community College (James Hewlett, Principal Investigator).  The main CCURI grant aims to create and support a national network of more than thirty (30) community colleges in their adaptation and implementation of undergraduate research activities into formal courses, summer undergraduate research experiences, and other opportunities for engagement of two-year college students in research. CUR's goals were to provide CCURI with logistics support for professional development events, publications and other information about undergraduate research, and to connect faculty and administrators active in the CCURI program with CUR's members and the CUR organization. During the course of four years of collaborative engagement with CCURI (September 2011-August 2015), CUR aided substantially in launching and sustaining CCURI.  During the first year of the grant (September 2011-August 2012), CUR assisted with six (6) separate professional development events, providing logistics assistance, and publication and information packets to CCURI-affiliated faculty.  During the second year (September 2012-August 2013), CUR served more of a consultative role with CCURI, and provided more opportunities for CCURI faculty and administrators to participate in CUR events, such as Posters on the Hill and the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR). During the grantÆs third year (September 2013-August 2014) CUR continued support of and participation in CCURIÆs activities, and provided substantial infrastructure support and coaching to achieve the first-ever community college undergraduate research poster display on Capitol Hill.  During the last year of the grant (September 2014-August 2015), CUR staff participated in the September 29, 2014 CCURI poster display event on Capitol Hill, served on the advisory committee for sustainability of grant outcomes, and co-designed and published a monograph highlighting the achievements of community college faculty and their students. Intellectual Merit: The monograph "Investing in Impact: The Power of Undergraduate Research &ndash; Community College Perspectives" serves as a substantial legacy of the project, and advances our knowledge of the quality and extent of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) undergraduate research conducted in a community college setting.  The publication is freely available at:  http://www.cur.org/publications/publication_listings/investing_in_impact_power_of_UR/ .  Broader Impacts:  Broader societal benefits of this project include improved STEM education and faculty development within the two-year college environment, as the project fostered increased inclusion of undergraduate research in early undergraduate STEM curricula.  In addition, the project enhanced the research networking and information resource infrastructure afforded to two-year college faculty engaged in the CCURI project.  Through the funding to CUR, CCURI faculty members were connected with the broad and diverse CUR membership and the abundant professional development opportunities and publication resources provided by the CUR organization.
