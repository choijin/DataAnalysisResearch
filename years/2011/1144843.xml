<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award establishes a new integrative model for graduate research and education to enable meaningful and measurable improvements in the global sustainability of electronic products. Through a partnership between Purdue University and Tuskegee University the Sustainable Electronics-IGERT will be carried out in close collaboration with the global electronics industry and academic partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The IGERT will focus on establishing the scientific foundation for a new model of consumption for electronics that avoids the traditional design-manufacture-use-dispose approach: faculty and student expertise from business, social sciences, and materials, product, and process engineering will come together to re-envision the electronics consumption paradigm, while maintaining a focus on simultaneously benefiting people, planet, and profit. Research themes addressed by this IGERT are 1) polymers from nature for fabricating electronics; 2) product design and manufacturing approaches with a reduced environmental footprint; and 3) system, supply chain, corporate and consumer behaviors, and the role of regulatory frameworks. Trainees will develop depth in their disciplines as well as breadth in the context of sustainable electronics, enabling them to become innovators and change leaders in society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This IGERT project will develop new cross-disciplinary graduate courses to form a core sustainable electronics curriculum, establish an interactive, international, team-based community to break-down barriers to solving problems that limit sustainability, and ensure that each trainee has an integrative international experience with industry or academic partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated to innovations for societal benefit.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NSF Purdue-Tuskegee IGERT: Global Traineeships for Sustainable Electronics&nbsp;provided the framework to create an innovative, interdisciplinary program to turn students into effective leaders in improving the global sustainability of electronics.&nbsp; Sustainability has multiple dimensions: economic, environmental, and societal. Scientific breakthroughs are necessary but not sufficient to improve electronics sustainability: it requires understanding and working with supply chain partners, recognizing the importance of societies and cultures in adopting new technologies, integrating new technologies into the existing manufacturing and economic infrastructure and working with others to make long-term changes in products and organizations. The IGERT program - education, research, and training was designed by the Purdue-Tuskegee 14 faculty member team&nbsp;(11-Purdue, 3-Tuskegee) to educate and empower the trainees to become innovators in this domain through authentic experiences in working with sustainability leaders from industry, government, and NGOs. Key partners in the program were iNEMI, a global electronics industry consortium, the Indian Institute of&nbsp;Management - Udaipur, Seagate, the Green Electronics Council, Nokia, and Dell.&nbsp; Trainees learned to be valuable members in team-based, cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural partnerships that dominate electronic product development and manufacturing. Through the IGERT, the graduate students - 28 NSF-supported trainees and 8 non-funded associates -demonstrated their ability to&nbsp;work and act globally by incorporating principles of partnership (among national and international academic institutions, government regulators, and industry experts), teamwork (among students, faculty and partners), and interdisciplinary breadth. The three 2-year cohorts included trainees and associates from Anthropology, Chemistry, Engineering (Materials, Civil, Mechanical, Industrial, Environmental &amp; Ecological), Forestry &amp; Natural Resources, Management, &amp; Political Science.&nbsp; The Purdue-Tuskegee team served as role models for the students in terms of creating a community focused both on making electronics sustainable and on guiding the trainees' education. training, and research to become innovators in STEM as well as in the global electronics eco-system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A key feature of the&nbsp;NSF Purdue-Tuskegee IGERT in Sustainable Electronics&nbsp;was the International Research Experience in&nbsp;India, a two-week long, intensive research visit designed and hosted by Prof. Janat Shah and Dr. Mohit Srivastava of the Indian Institute of Management - Udaipur in collaboration with Prof. Ananth Iyer, co-PI from Purdue. They developed a highly integrated plan for the IGERT team to learn about India and its people in the context of social justice, mining, global electronics manufacturing and supply chains, water supply, waste management and energy, and Indian culture and philosophy.&nbsp;What made this two-week research experience so valuable was the nine months of integrated education and training that the IGERT faculty used to prepare the trainees in each cohort for the experience. The IGERT education and training program was designed so it both deepened the trainees? understanding of the issues and made them capable of learning at a more sophisticated level during the trip.&nbsp;</p> <p>One major outcome of the Research Experience in India was in internationalization: trainees gained global awareness and perspective through engagement with those we visited. Another was in having the opportunity to be leaders. The trainees interacted with a wide range of people at the organizations we visited ? from CEOs and engineers to workers on the assembly line and in the NGOs. The trainees saw that leaders in these organizations welcomed us, took the trainees seriously, and engaged them in substantive discussions of issues related to sustainability, manufacturing, and culture.&nbsp; All of the trainees described this experience as "life changing" with continuing impact on the ways the students viewed the world. This transformation started with themselves and continued in deepening their understanding what future roles they may have in creating the conditions where sustainable electronics can flourish.&nbsp; The close collaboration between Purdue and Tuskegee trainees, associates, and faculty provided a unique education and research opportunity for the whole team, which is continuing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Carol&nbsp;A&nbsp;Handwerker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572369934287_TeamphotoinUdaipur2015--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572369934287_TeamphotoinUdaipur2015--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Team photo in Udaipur"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572369934287_TeamphotoinUdaipur2015--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Team photo in Udaipur"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">IGERT team spending a free afternoon together in Udaipur.</div> <div class="imageCredit">IGERT team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carol&nbsp;A&nbsp;Handwerker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Team photo in Udaipur</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572369542654_india5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572369542654_india5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2015 trip to electronics manufacturer in Delhi"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572369542654_india5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2015 trip to electronics manufacturer in Delhi"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">IGERT trainees learned first hand the diversity of manufacturing processes needed for manufacturing electronic capacitors.</div> <div class="imageCredit">IGERT team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carol&nbsp;A&nbsp;Handwerker</div> <div class="imageTitle">2015 trip to electronics manufacturer in Delhi</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572369314379_atthemine--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572369314379_atthemine--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2017 trip to Hindustan Zinc"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572369314379_atthemine--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2017 trip to Hindustan Zinc"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">IGERT trainees and faculty team prepare to travel into the Hindustan Zinc mine as part of an International Research Experience in Sustainable Electronics in India</div> <div class="imageCredit">IGERT team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carol&nbsp;A&nbsp;Handwerker</div> <div class="imageTitle">2017 trip to Hindustan Zinc</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572370110652_assemblyline--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572370110652_assemblyline--rgov-800width.jpg" title="IGERT team observes electronics assembly line in operation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1144843/1144843_10177134_1572370110652_assemblyline--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="IGERT team observes electronics assembly line in operation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Indian companies welcomed our students and faculty into their facilities and engaged our students in a wide range of discussions, from culture and workforce development to products and supply chains.</div> <div class="imageCredit">IGERT team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carol&nbsp;A&nbsp;Handwerker</div> <div class="imageTitle">IGERT team observes electronics assembly line in operation</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
