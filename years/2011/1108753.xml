<AbstractNarration>This project will use sophisticated theoretical methods to determine the fundamental properties of neutron stars and black holes.  Dr. Ozel and her graduate students will model the mass distribution of black holes and neutron stars, simulate accretion onto black holes and neutron stars, perform relativistic calculations of the spacetime near neutron stars, and investigate the properties of nuclear matter in neutron stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project are expected to have an impact in the areas of stellar evolution, nuclear physics, and gravitational wave physics.  In addition to her theoretical work, Dr. Ozel will continue her interactions with physics teachers in the Tucson area, and will engage popular outreach on the subject neutron stars and black holes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported groundbreaking studies on the properties of neutron stars and black holes. One major outcome was the determination of neutron star radii, which are useful for understanding the composition and interactions of matter at very high densities that are not accessbile to laboratories on Earth. Theoretical studies on how to make optimal radius measurements were supplemented by the anaysis of data for twelve sources to obtain the first tight constraints on the size of the densest objects in the Universe.   This project also supported major developments on black hole accretion, which determines their masses and observable properties. These studies have implications for understanding their event horizons and how they exist in our Galaxy and in the centers of galaxies throughout the Universe. New technologies were employed, including the development of the first ray tracing algorithms on the GPU platform. These breakthroughs were coupled with general relativistic accretion flow simulations in order to produce the most realistic multi wavelength light curves of accreting black holes for the first time. The understanding we obtained from these simulations were also incorporated into cosmological simulations and led to the proposal of a different mechanism for black hole growth in the universe.  The theoretical understanding of neutron stars and black holes enabled by this award also provide direct support for other NSF funded efforts, such as LIGO and the Event Horizon Telescope.
