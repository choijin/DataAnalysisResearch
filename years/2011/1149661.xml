<AbstractNarration>Future systems based on nanoscale transistors will offer significant boosts in information gathering and processing capabilities.  However, the reliability and scalability challenges mandate a transformation in the system-level approaches.  A number of fundamental assumptions will change with nanoscale transistors: the fabrication processes will be highly defective due to the random nature of nanoscale self-assembly; system reliability cannot be guaranteed in the field because nanoscale transistors are extremely susceptible to intermittent faults; system scalability demands the interconnection between components to be strictly localized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims at forming a new paradigm to construct reliable and scalable nanosystems, which will open up new application domains currently held back by the size and power limit.  This research focuses on three life-span stages of future nanosystems: (1) defects discovered during manufacturing are treated through chip reconfiguration; (2) dynamic faults are treated in the field with built-in redundant elements under the strict constraint of local interconnections. The approaches and analysis for these two stages will provide guidance for the (3) system design stage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project includes a strong educational component for undergraduate students to participate in a number of competition projects to gain research experiences. These projects are also joined by graduate students to learn to convey research outcome to a general audience. Such an integrated research and educational effort aims at bridging the gaps between state-of-the-art research and the teaching of engineering approaches, many distinct knowledge bodies of EE, CE, and CS, and between systems research and device research in the academic community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcome of this project can be summarized from the following aspects.  The main research outcome includes new models, proof of system properties, and design methodologies to address the defect and fault tolerance challenges for future systems based on nanoelectronic devices, which will be highly unreliable.   These research outcomes are developed at multiple design hierarchical levels.  At the lowest level, we look at the crossbar based logic building blocks, which is an architecture that can support various nanoelectronics devices. We provide new methodologies for such crossbars to tolerate more defects, and analysis models to precisely predict the yield of such crossbar systems, at a given defect rate, with a given level of redundancy.  At the middle level, we focus on adders, the most fundamental arithmetic building block of computer systems. By looking into the structure of parallel-prefix adders (a generic form to design various adders), we come up with novel schemes of inserting redundant components into a parallel-prefix adder in an efficient way. This not only opens up the possibilities to design a plethora of defect-tolerant adders, but also yields new classes of new adder designs, in a systematic way.  At the highest level, we examine how a multi-processor system, with limited interconnect and a few spare components, can be made flexible to self-repair, by replacing faulty processors with spare ones, dynamically.  Our new model and proof of property of such a system underline the development of a system analysis algorithm and a repair scheme with guaranteed fault tolerance capabilities. Furthermore, it is shown that for such a system, the repair can be done in a low cost manner, such that it is possible to perform on-the-fly dynamic replacement without a re-evaluation of the entire system. The broader impact and educational outcome include advising PhD and Master students, new curriculum development, involving undergraduate students in research projects, and outreach to local high school's career day. This research project has supported three PhD students, one Master student, and several undergraduate students. While the PhD students carried out the main part of the research progress, the Master student has independently achieved significant results, which constitutes a conference publication and a Master Thesis. One of the undergraduate students was involved as a second author for two of the publications and was encouraged to continue with graduate study in a different institute.  Based on the project topic of reliability in nanoelectronic systems, a new course has been developed as a Computer Engineering technical elective for both senior undergraduate and graduate students. This course is cross-linked between the ECE and the CS department, and has been well received during the past five years. The topic of reliability and nanoelectronics systems has also been introduced to various other classes that I have taught, such as computer organization, which is a required course for all EE and CE majored students. In addition, I have presented it during an outreach activity to a local high school (Victor J. Andrew Highschool), on their career day.  The extended research outcome, beyond the core topic of reliability in nanoelectronic systems, includes a broadening of research vision and activities into other areas, including hardware security, general combinatorics, and inter-disciplinary collaborations with colleagues in the areas of information theory and education. Reaching beyond reliability, we have looked into the area of hardware security, with the specific focus of how to come up with effective obfuscation schemes to prevent piracy from occurring. Another research direction in the more general theoretical computer science is the problem of fairly distributing resources in a bipartite graph. On this front we have achieved some major results with regard to the attributes of the fairest semi-matchings that can be obtained for any given bipartite graph.
