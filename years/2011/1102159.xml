<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine is a variable speed wind turbine widely usedin the modern wind power industry. Presently, commercial DFIG wind turbines primarily usetechnology that was developed a decade ago. However, due to the rapid transition for managementand generation of wind power toward the smart grid, research is neededto enhance energy harvestingfrom the wind in more efficient and reliable ways due to the following reasons: 1) Recent studiesindicated that an existing power converter control technology used in a DFIG wind turbine has a competing control deficiency. 2) The present design of DFIG wind power control system does not support the needs for optimaland smart control of the system. 3) Recentresearch on DFIGcharacteristics showed that optimal and artificial intelligence technology is favorable for efficient DFIG control and integration.    This project developedan optimal vector control technology based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and artificial neural networks for a DFIG wind turbine, an advanced neural network training algorithm, and state-of-the-art simulation and hardware experiment facilities and mechanisms. This is the first-ever application of ADP to vector control of power electronic converters and induction generators. Compared to conventional vector control methods, the neural network control approach produces the fastest response time, lowest overshoot, and, in general, the closest to ideal performance.   The specific outcomes and findings of the project include:  1) We have successfully completed the training and testing for both grid-side and rotor-side controllers for a DFIG wind turbine.  2) The neural network vector controller can track the reference d- and q-axis currents effectively even for testing trajectories and reference currents that are far away from the training data.   3) Compared to conventional vector control methods, the neural vector control approach produces the fastest response time, lowest overshoot, and, in general, the best performance.   4) In noisy, disturbance, and power converter switching environments, the neural network vector controller demonstrates strong capabilities in tracking the reference command while maintaining high power quality.  5) The neural network vector controller also showed excellent performance in more practical nested-loop control structure.  6) Under a fault in the grid system, the neural network controller for a DFIG wind turbine exhibits a strong short-circuit ride-through capability.  7) We integratedourneural network vector controller design with energy system principles and conventional control techniques. We found that this interdisciplinary neural network design approach can significantly enhance the performance and ensure the reliability and adaptive capability of neural network controllers under practical conditions and physical system constraints. We also found that it is very hard to train such a neural network, indicating that an advanced training strategy is needed.  8) We conducted research of nested-loop neural network controllers for electric machines. The results showed that  the inner current-loop neural network controller gained the most benefit. The conventional outer-loop PI controller can still be used with an inner current-loop neural network controller to achieve good control performance.  9) We built a hardware experiment system and conducted a series of tests to examine the performance of the neural network vector controllers in challenging hardware experiment conditions. The experimental results were very encouraging. Even in highly noisy and distorted laboratory conditions, the neural network vector controller demonstrated excellent performance. Compared to the conventional controllers, the neural network controllers showed very fast tracking speed, low oscillations and harmonics, and strong stability and reliability.      Beyond the proposed project scope, we conducted preliminary resea...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
