<AbstractNarration>Although stable-isotope ratios inform a wide range of environmental processes and are used increasingly in earth-system research, effective strategies for learning about challenging stable-isotope concepts has lagged in the undergraduate curriculum. Recent advances in instrumentation for rapid, high-precision, and more-affordable measurements of stable isotope ratios provide an opportunity to address this challenge. The project is developing, implementing and evaluating student-led investigations of stable-isotope systems in upper-division geoscience courses.  The active, inquiry-based approaches are engaging students in this important but abstract content area and leading to deeper conceptual learning of stable-isotopic systems, with specific applications to watershed processes and to oceanic records of ancient climate change. Hands-on investigations, combined with concept-mapping and jigsaw approaches to pedagogy, are being assessed through a comprehensive and multi-faceted effort, involving both quantitative and qualitative methods. The curricular and pedagogical approaches, as well as relevant isotopic data for teaching, are being shared with other institutions through a web portal and conference workshops.</AbstractNarration>
