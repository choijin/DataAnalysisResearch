<AbstractNarration>This project will aid understanding of the emergence of computer security.  It will examine key computer-security concepts and approaches in the domains of government, universities, industry, and criminal justice.  Project activities include: [A] Conducting 30 detailed Òresearch gradeÓ oral histories with key figures in the field.  Transcripts will be publicly available on the website of the Charles Babbage Institute.  [B] Collecting and archiving valuable documentary materials, including reports, correspondence, and grey literature, again to be accessible at CBI.  [C] A knowledge networking wiki will describe and discuss key computer-security concepts, approaches, institutions, and frameworks, with input from experts in the computer-security field.  The wiki will benefit computer security professionals, policymakers, scholars, students, and the broader society.  [D] Publication of peer-reviewed scholarly articles will stimulate further historical attention of this vital area of computing.  Collectively these four components will create a much-needed research infrastructure for computer security history.  Work has been planned and will be done in close cooperation with an Advisory Committee of recognized leaders in the computer security field.  With regard to training, we will carefully mentor a GSRA in the craft of conducting research-grade oral histories.  The project team is attuned to documenting and analyzing the role of underrepresented groups in computer security, and disseminating narratives of role models to inspire future scientists.  The chief result of the project will be the creation of a public, accessible, and permanent infrastructure of historical materials for better understanding the emergence of computer security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computer security is a "hard problem": it involves the application of advanced concepts from computer science, together with diverse organizational human centered processes; and it has changed profoundly and continues to change as computing platforms and computing applications evolve.  This project provides deep insight into how the field of computer security emerged and evolved.  Some concepts created in the 1970s, such as "covert channels," are as applicable today as ever, whereas industry-wide computer-security standards have been difficult to implement.  This project interviewed more than 30 computer-security specialists about their work and careers.  The resulting oral-history transcripts provide detailed information about how computer scientists think and how they work as well as about how they relate to government, industry, and the wider professional world.  The project also collected rare and one-of-a-kind documents to help practitioners, academics, and members of the public better understand the origins and dynamics of this challenging field.  The project also created a specialized knowledge-networking wiki platform with profiles of key people, descriptions of key concepts, and discussion of influential programs.  Educators have been using these resources to help train the next generation of computer-security specialists.  Academic publications -- including a special issue of IEEE Annals of the History of Computing -- help clarify and document key computer-security concepts, institutions, and people.  In terms of Intellectual Merit, the potential to advance knowledge, our project generated new knowledge about the origins and evolution of computer security.  Originally, computer security was strongly shaped by military and intelligence agencies seeking to build secure "multi-level systems."  Technical efforts were in several instances quite successful, but economic considerations made it difficult to enroll the computer industry in manufacturing highly secure systems.  Understanding of several security concepts, including "capabilities" and "type enforcement" may help researchers to realize computer systems with greater inborn security.  Two lines of research we documented let to the innovation of firewalls, a widely used security tool.  Greater awareness of the origins and evolution of computer security -- both for professionals in the field and members of the general public -- clearly benefits society.  Such Broader Impacts contribute to realizing the desirable societal goal of designing, building, and using secure computer systems.  Awareness that challenging technical, organizational, and economic constraints shape the environment of and expectations for secure computer systems suggests that computer design teams draw on persons with appropriate technical knowledge, including awareness of security.
