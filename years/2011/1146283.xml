<AbstractNarration>Streams occupy a small part of Earth's surface, but are disproportionately important for transport and processing of nutrients and for maintaining global biodiversity. Logjams in streams increase retention of nutrients and fish production. Human removal of logjams is pervasive in forested ecosystems, creating "dam-impoverished" streams with limited capacity to store nutrients and produce fish. A prime example is streams of the southern Rocky Mountains, where a legacy of wood removal has greatly reduced logjams. This project asks: Does the loss of jams reduce the productive capacity of headwater streams? It is hypothesized that the loss of jams makes streams more leaky of nutrients, with subsequent decreased nutrient processing and fish production. This project will examine logjams and jam-associated processes across a gradient of streams, including streams in old-growth forests, unmanaged younger forests, and intensively managed forests.  This work will provide the first landscape-scale assessment of the effects of jam removal on stream ecosystems. This research can transform current understanding of wood effects on stream ecosystems by combining estimates of logjam historical distribution with intensively measured geochemical and biological variables in contemporary jams, allowing extension of local-scale observations to entire steam networks.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Understanding how the loss of jams affects streams will inform resource management of headwater streams in forested landscapes. The National Park Service and the US Forest Service oversee vast tracts of forested lands in the American West and are attempting to restore some of the inferred historical characteristics of the Rocky Mountain landscape. By enhancing understanding of changes in jams, as well as the biogeochemical and ecological influence of these structures, the proposed work will provide much-needed context for these management actions.  This project will also provide training for one post-doctoral scholar and four graduate students. It will also provide research experiences for several undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Humans pervasively modify river geomorphology in ways that we are beginning to understand.  For example, by harvesting and managing forests, wood inputs to streams and rivers can be lowered, which can cause streams to shift their geomorphology between high wood to low wood states.  This project examined these alternative geomorphic states and the ecological ramifications of these state shifts in streams in the Southern Rocky Mountains.  We found that streams either had very high wood loads with complex anastomosing channels or streams had simple, single thread channels. Complex, anastomosing channel forms only occurred in remnant old growth forests.  High-wood streams had much higher rate of exchange of water in to storage zones than did single channels streams.  However, we did not find that these streams had higher rates of nitrogen uptake or denitrification rates relative to all other streams.  High wood streams had very high storage of terrestrial organic matter and were hotspots in mountain landscapes for organic matter storage.  High wood streams had similar insect secondary production to low wood streams on a area-specific basis.  But because these high wood streams had much larger channel area due to many small channels, they had much higher insect production than single thread channels per unit change in valley length.  High wood stream had much higher trout densities and production, likely because of deeper pools provided suitable fish habitat.  Our overall findings are that streams can show the legacy of human disturbance to the forest long after cutting or fire, and this disturbance manifests itself variably in ecological processes, and was most evident in higher rates of animal production.     This project created a significant platform for innovative training of talented undergraduate (4 students) and graduate (2) students. All of these students added knowledge to aquatic science through their independent research. These students remain productive and active researchers in their discipline.  This project also contributed to the development of open-source software for analysis of stream metabolism.             Last Modified: 04/09/2017       Submitted by: Robert O Hall]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
