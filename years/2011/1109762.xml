<AbstractNarration>This project involves an integrated program to study the process of tectonic escape in Central Anatolia. This is the location where this process was first recognized in the 1970s and the PIs make a strong case that this is good place to investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of this process in the context of a continent-continent collision. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research builds on previous geophysical and geological studies by many of the PIs in other parts of Turkey (both to the east and west of the planned study area). The  research will investigate modern structure through a combination of geophysics and geology. Past history will be reconstructed through studies of elevation, drainage and volcanism. Studies of the Central Anatolian fault are important as this is a major feature that is poorly understood in Anatolian tectonics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PIs will address the questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? What are the plate dynamics from the mantle to the Earth?s surface, the transition from distributed to localized strain in large strike-slip faults, the origin and consequences of magmatism, and the evolution of relief and landscape during development of escape tectonics?&lt;br/&gt;? What are the effects of boundary conditions (collision of Arabian plate to the east, extension of Aegean to the west, subduction of African plate to the south) on the driving forces of tectonic escape?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will integrate results of passive seismic experiments; magnetotelluric profiling; geomorphic, structural, and stratigraphic-sedimentological analysis of surface geology and exhumed orogenic crust; geo/thermochronometric determination of temperature-time histories of magmatic, metamorphic, and fault zone rocks and geomorphic features; isotopic fingerprinting and dating of magmatic rocks; and 2D and 3D numerical modeling.</AbstractNarration>

A change from deposition to erosion occurred very rapidly across Central Anatolia about 5 million years ago. Lake deposits cut by rivers show that major changes occurred in the river systems across Central Anatolia, driven by the faults that formed as the tectonic escape system developed, particularly between 5 and 3 million years ago.    The current system of tectonic escape developed with the inception of the East Anatolian Fault as a through-going structure about 3 million years ago. The change from pre-escape to full-escape is tracked in the history of magmatism and uplift. We obtained new ages for volcanic rocks, and coupled these ages with data and interpretations from CD-CAT geophysical data and historical information from faults and basins to understand the most recent phase of the tectonic history of the region.  Another, related aim of the project was to determine the location and behavior of an oceanic tectonic plate that is today below parts of Anatolia: it has been imaged with seismic waves below western Anatolia and has been shown to be absent below eastern Anatolia, leaving the question of where the eastern edge of the plate is, and what the consequences of the sinking and tearing of this plate have been for the Anatolian crust and surface.  Integrated results of this project showed that the edge of the sunken and torn plate is marked at the surface by the Central Anatolian Fault Zone, a region of high topography (eastern Taurus Mountains), and volcanism focused in and near the fault zone.
