<AbstractNarration>The core of this project is the development of a methodology (software&lt;br/&gt;and hardware) to produce synchronized visual and sonic representations&lt;br/&gt;of seismic wave fields in the Earth. Coupling these senses enables&lt;br/&gt;people, from the general public to seasoned seismologists, to&lt;br/&gt;appreciate and perceive an enormous richness in the patterns of&lt;br/&gt;seismic wave fields. The aim is not to simulate the experience of an&lt;br/&gt;earthquake, but to render the physics of wave propagation in the globe&lt;br/&gt;and the nature of earthquake physics into a completely tactile&lt;br/&gt;experience, unlike anything anyone has ever perceived. The working&lt;br/&gt;group is comprised of earth scientists, astrophysicists, sound and&lt;br/&gt;graphics engineers and educators, from the Lamont Doherty Earth&lt;br/&gt;Observatory (LDEO), Princeton University, and the American Museum of&lt;br/&gt;Natural History (AMNH).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The images and sounds are generated from both USArray and GSN data, as&lt;br/&gt;well as from simulations generated with the spectral element method&lt;br/&gt;(SEM), using the SPECFEM3D software.  Sounds are generated by shifting&lt;br/&gt;the frequency of the seismic signal into the range of human hearing,&lt;br/&gt;and are filtered and stretched in time to optimize the coupled visual&lt;br/&gt;and sonic effects. Once the methodology is in place, it will take two&lt;br/&gt;general forms:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, a web-based format that allows people to choose earthquakes and&lt;br/&gt;seismic data to listen to, with images produced by either a dense&lt;br/&gt;array of seismometers (i.e. the ground motion visualizations (GMVs)&lt;br/&gt;produced by IRIS of the Transportable Array data) or a simulation of&lt;br/&gt;the seismic wave field (i.e. by SPECFEM3D). This format will be useful&lt;br/&gt;for classroom and laboratory purposes, and interactive museum&lt;br/&gt;exhibits, as well as for exploratory observation of raw data by&lt;br/&gt;seismologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, a version will be developed for the Hayden Planetarium at the&lt;br/&gt;American Museum of Natural History, in New York City. The images,&lt;br/&gt;projected on the planetarium dome, will include the surface of the&lt;br/&gt;Earth rendered as a membrane and also a volumetric rendering in which&lt;br/&gt;the observer will see 3D wave fronts propagating throughout the globe.&lt;br/&gt;The sounds will be tuned to the large speaker array in the&lt;br/&gt;Planetarium.  Within the context of this project, several Public&lt;br/&gt;Programs will occur in the Planetarium, in which the immersive&lt;br/&gt;experience of listening to the Earth will be guided by the production&lt;br/&gt;team.  These Public Programs are the essential first step towards&lt;br/&gt;developing a full planetarium show on the dynamics of the Earth at&lt;br/&gt;AMNH.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
