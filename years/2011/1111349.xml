<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: 8th The International Workshop on Piezoelectric Materials and Applications&lt;br/&gt;(IWPMA) 2011 meeting is scheduled to be held from August 7 - 11, 2011, in Roanoke, Virginia. This&lt;br/&gt;meeting will be held in conjunction with 6th Annual Energy Harvesting Workshop, and 3rd Annual&lt;br/&gt;Center for Intelligent Material System and Structures (CIMSS) Conference.  The focus of the meeting is on energy. The workshop will provide in-depth information on the application of smart materials with a focus on energy related issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The support from NSF will be mostly used for (i) enhancing student participation&lt;br/&gt;targeting underrepresented minority participants, women, and high school teachers and students, (ii)&lt;br/&gt;registration and travel support for lecturers providing tutorial and plenary speakers, and (iii) registration&lt;br/&gt;fees for returning veterans to enhance their educational experience. The participation of small business&lt;br/&gt;companies at this meeting will be supported through NSF I/UCRC: Center for Energy Harvesting&lt;br/&gt;Materials and Systems (CEHMS). The meeting will serve as both a recruiting tool and as graduate&lt;br/&gt;leadership training. The tutorials provided at the meeting will have strong emphasis on the involvement of&lt;br/&gt;high school African-American students in higher research and education in Blacksburg, Virginia.</AbstractNarration>

About 150 participants from 16 diferent countries attended the meeting. The co-location of these three meetings brought a large audience from around the world. The focus of the meeting was on &ldquo;energy&rdquo;. The workshop provided in-depth information on the application of smart materials with a focus on energy related issues. Presentations for IWPMA concentrated on following topics: (i) Piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and multiferroic materials, (ii) Piezoelectric<br />actuators and motors, (iii) Piezoelectric transducers and applications, and (iv) Piezoelectrics in bio-inspired autonomous systems. Presentations for the 6th Annual Energy Harvesting Workshop concentrated on following topics: (i) Energy harvesting (piezoelectric, inductive, photovoltaic, electret, and thermoelectric), (ii) Micro batteries and ultracapacitors, (iii) Wireless networks for structural health monitoring, and (iv) Bio-inspired energy generation and conversion. In-depth research discussions included current progress and challenges in vibration harvester design and fabrication, thick and thin film materials synthesis, 3D deposition techniques, energy conversion devices, micro/nano electronics, electrochemical storage systems, sensor development, integrated hybrid architectures, computational and theoretical modeling, and nanoscale fabrication techniques. Six plenary talks were held to cover the fundamentals and provide information on state-of-the-art in many of energy related research areas. The plenary speakers were: Dr. Ray Baughman, UT Dallas; Dr. John Blottman, Naval Undersea Warfare Center; Dr. John Prater, Army Research Office; Dr. Dwight Viehland, Virginia Tech; Dr. Donald Silversmith, Defense Threat Reduction Agency; and Roger Nessen, ITT. This collective group of leading academic and industrial researchers made a significant impact on the learning experience of attendees. The participation of small business companies at this meeting was supported through NSF I/UCRC: Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems (CEHMS). It can be expected that new collaborations between academia and industry were formed, which will support the transition of invented technologies and materials into applications through robust partnerships and spin-off&rsquo;s, creating job opportunities and also enhancing the knowledge-base in the community. The meeting served as both a recruiting tool and as graduate leadership training. The tutorials provided at the<br />meeting had strong emphasis on the involvement of high school African-American students in higher research and education in Blacksburg, Virginia.</p> <p>We are implementing an integrated research and education plan based on education pyramid.
