<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) provides funding to study the confined self assembly in nanofibers of fully conjugated rod-rod diblock copolymers. Nanofibers will be fabricated via a process called electrospinning that uses a strong electric field to elongate and thin a polymer solution jet enabling the formation of fibers with near nanoscale diameters (50-500 nm). Rod-rod block copolymers combine the physics of liquid crystalline ordering of rod-like polymers (at the length scale of 1-10 nm) and microphase-separation of coil-coil block copolymers (at length scale of 10-100 nm) with the potential of forming hierarchically ordered materials. The effects of solvent evaporation rate and extensional deformation (during electrospinning) on self assembly structures at both length scales will be studied. The assembly in nanofibers will be characterized using transmission electron microscopy as well as small and wide angle x-ray scattering. Similar studies on self assembly in solution-cast films will be conducted as reference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work will provide a novel active material for the design of high efficiency organic solar cells. In particular, self assembly of conjugated polymeric blocks (with appropriate electronic properties) will provide periodic interfaces of electron donor and electron acceptor materials in the light absorbing active layer of solar cells. This will ensure timely disassociation of bound electron and hole (created on photo-excitation), necessary to produce photocurrent efficiently. Confining fully conjugated rod-rod diblock copolymers within nanofibers will have two benefits. First, it will provide the opportunity to develop a new class of materials, namely, wearable fabrics of organic semiconductors.  Secondly, the strong extensional deformation and fast solvent evaporation during electrospinning combined with the physical cylindrical confinement in nanofibers will provide access to novel self assembled structures that may not be possible in equilibrium systems or films.</AbstractNarration>

Summary of Results  In this project, three different material systems have been investigated within nanofibers (with diameters of few hundred nanometers) as well as within films &ndash; 1) oligthiophene-block-oligophenylenevenylene (OT-b-OPV), 2) poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly(g-benzyl-L-glutamate), and 3) poly(3-hexylthiophene)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester  (P3HT/PCBM) blend. While the first two are block copolymers, wherein two distinct functional polymers are chemical linked (covalently bonded), the third material is a physical blend of the two functional materials. In each of these material systems, the two components serve to provide distinct functionalities necessary for a successful solar cell operation. While the block copolymers provide enhanced control over the molecular structure, the blend system provides a cheaper alternative. In each of these systems, we showed successful development of hierarchically ordered structures at the molecular level. The structure size and shape varied as a function of material chemistry, polymer molecular weight, composition and processing conditions. In figure 1, we show a typical nanofiber image fabricated in this project. In figure 2, we provide an example of the hierarchical structure formed in OT-b- OPV in this work. While the smaller structures allow improved transport of charges, the relatively larger structures allow the separation of negative and positive charges needed to successfully produce electricity (from solar energy).     Broader Impact:  Educational Impact: This project provided three undergraduate students (2/3 are female) and three graduate students (3/3 are female) (including one via collaboration with UT Dallas) with an inter-disciplinary experience in nanomaterials and alternate energy along with an opportunity to enhance their presentation and technical writing skills via several conference and group meeting presentations and paper and report writing.  This work facilitated the collaboration of PI with Prof. Mihaela Stefan at UT Dallas and her PhD student, K.E Washington (both are co-authors in one of the publications listed under Intellectual Merit).  In addition, this project facilitated the organization of a symposium by PI on 'Novel Materials for Sustainable Energy' at Drexel University in May, 2012 (funded by Drexel University's career development award awarded to PI). As part of this symposium, PI invited 5 experts...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
