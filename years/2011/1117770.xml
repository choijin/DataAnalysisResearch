<AbstractNarration>One of the most critical challenges in todays nanoscale VLSI design is the lack of predictability in analysis and optimization. As VLSI technology continues scaling in the nanometer domain, VLSI systems are subject to increasingly significant parametric variations coming from not only the manufacturing process but also the system runtime environment. Increasingly significant parametric variations lead to increasingly significant variations in IC timing performance, power consumption, and other product metrics. Existing VLSI statistical analysis techniques cannot accurately and efficiently capture such variations; this greatly compromises design optimization and design convergence, affecting product quality and time-to market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this work the PIs plan to develop techniques for signal probability-based statistical timing analysis (SPSTA), which would achieve accurate performance estimates for different inputs, rather than input-oblivious pessimistic delay bounds. In this project, the PIs propose to build on the foundation of SPSTA to enable a new, predictive and less-pessimistic VLSI implementation methodology. Core techniques will span VLSI statistical analysis, delay test ATPG, and optimization techniques that exploit improved predictability. Specifically, there are three thrust areas in this project, and it is expected that that these techniques will outperform existing alternative techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this project is critical to the cost-effective continuation of semiconductor technology scaling (i.e., Moore's Law), and to maintaining growth of the semiconductor industry's economic engine in the coming years. The broader impacts of the proposed project can be further measured by a strong education program including curriculum development and research training which incorporate statistical VLSI analysis and optimization techniques into the computer engineering programs at the PIs? institutions, and into course infrastructure that is broadly and openly available to others online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following their established practices of well over a decade, the PIs will broadly disseminate their research results by publication, industry collaboration, and online posting of open-source software. This project will also allow the PIs to broaden participation of students from under-represented groups based on the minority institute status of UT San Antonio; it will help educational initiatives that are aimed at preparing the San Antonio regional economy to transform into a technology-oriented one.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main research results achieved in the project are on the topics of (1) learning-based prediction of embedded memory timing failures during initial floorplan design (2) improved prediction of outcome of physical implementation using ILP-based optimal placement and routing.     1. Learning-Based Prediction of Embedded Memory Timing Failures During Initial Floorplan Design     The floorplan of IC design has significant influence on chip design quality. On the other hand,  embedded memories are critical to success or failure of complex system-on-chip (SoC) products.  They can be significant yield detractors as a consequence of occupying substantial die area, creating  placement and routing blockages, and having stringent Vccmin and power integrity requirements.  Achieving timing-correctness for embedded memories in advanced nodes is costly. Further, multiphysics  (e.g., crosstalk, IR, etc.) signoff analyses make early understanding and prediction of  timing (-correctness) even more difficult. With long tool and design closure subflow runtimes,  design teams need improved prediction of embedded memory timing failures, as early as possible  in the implementation flow. We propose a learning-based methodology to perform early prediction  of timing failure risk given only the netlist, timing constraints, and floorplan context (wherein the  memories have been placed). Our work appearing in ASPDAC-2016 can be used to identify  which memories are "at risk", guide floorplan changes to reduce predicted "risk", and help refine  underlying SoC implementation methodologies. Experimental results in 28nm FDSOI technology  show that we can predict P&amp;R slack with multiphysics analysis to within 253ps (average error less  than 10ps) using only post-synthesis netlist, constraints and floorplan information.     2. Scalable Detailed Placement Legalization for Complex Sub-14nm Constraints           Technology scaling to 10nm and below introduces complex intra-row and inter-row constraints in     standard-cell detailed placement.  Typically, these rules are too complex for the normal global-detailed placement flow to fully     consider. On the other hand, guardbanding the library cell design so that arbitrary cell placement     adjacencies are all "correct by construction" has increasingly high area cost. This motivates the     introduction of a final legalization phase for standard-cell placement tools in advanced (particularly     10nm and 7nm) foundry nodes. In [2], we develop a mixed integer-linear programming (MILP)-     based placer, called DFPlacer, for final-phase design rule violation (DRV) fixing. DFPlacer finds     (near-)DRV-free solutions considering various complex layout constraints including minimum implant     width, drain-drain abutment, and oxide diffusion jogs. To overcome the runtime limitation of     MILP-based approaches, we implement a distributable optimization strategy based on partitioning     of the block layout into windows of cells that can be independently legalized. Using layouts in an     abstracted 7nm library, we find that DFPlacer fixes 99% of DRVs on average with minimal impacts     on area and timing.      3. Evaluation of BEOL Design Rule Impacts Using An Optimal ILP-based Detailed Router           Emerging constraints     such as unidirectional patterning or increased via spacing will decrease achievable density of the     final place-and-route solution, worsening die area and product cost. However, no methodology     exists for accurate assessment of design rulesÆ impact on physical chip implementation.      In [3], we provide a framework for evaluating how prospective sub-20nm design rules &ndash; as well as     back-end-of-line (BEOL) stack choices &ndash; will affect chip implementation metrics such as density     or wirelength. Our framework is based on optimal detailed routing that is correct with respect     to advanced design rules. We describe OptRouter, an ILP-based optimal detailed router which...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
