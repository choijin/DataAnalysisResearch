<AbstractNarration>During database query processing, data migrates across different system components each of which may offer different levels of security guarantees and may be susceptible to different attacks. If the underlying data (or part of it) is sensitive, data migration, especially from secure components to those that are relatively insecure could increase risk of data loss. This proposal takes a "risk-based" approach to security wherein instead of designing approaches to prevent attacks, the proposed research controls flow of data during query processing through various components in such a way to strike a balance between risk of exposure and system performance. Risk-aware query processing techniques is explored in two settings: (a) A stand-alone database server where data on disks is stored encrypted (and is hence secure) but is loaded in plaintext into memory during query processing. (b) Cloud computing environment where, during peak load queries (and corresponding data) are shipped from (relatively secure) private storage to be processed at (relatively insecure) public cloud infrastructure, a phenomena known as cloudbursting. In both these settings, techniques to co-optimize query execution to simultaneously minimize both disclosure risks as well as performance costs are explored. The research offers a complementary approach to traditional techniques based on preventing attacks to support practical security in the context of database systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to help launch a new direction to database security research that explores techniques to limit risks (instead of only preventing attacks). The research, if successful, will make cloud-based data management solutions more secure increasing the rate of their adoption even for applications that have substantial data confidentiality concerns. Finally, the planned research, system development, and educational activities are expected to significantly enhance the educational experience of students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Despite decades of work on cryptographic techniques such as searchable encryption, order-preservingencryption , deterministic encryption, partially and fully homomorphic encryption, and bucketization technique, as well as, several related efforts to build secure data outsourcing systems based on advances in cryptography, secure data outsourcing and query processing remains an open challenge.

For instance, recent studies have shown that when order preserving and deterministic encryption techniques are used together (as in CryptDB ), an attacker might be able to construct the entire plaintext by frequency analysis, if the entropy of the dataset is low. Likewise, another study  shows that functionally complete data out-sourcing mechanisms wherein outsourced server computes the encrypted representation of the complete answer to the the queries that are then decrypted by the client, can lead to full disclosure of the database in the worst case.  This project (entitled Radicle) explored  radically different approaches to secure data processing in the context of clouds. The project explored principled approaches to partition data and computation to accomplish competing goals of secure computing and efficient processing in the cloud context. The project explored partioned computing as a security mechanism under two distinct design goals.      The first such design goal was to achieve semantic security. We developed the theoretical principles  to guide design of partitionee based solutions that do not leak any information to the public cloud and based on those theoretical principles we designed two distinct systems that support efficient processing while supporting semantic security. The first of which was SEMROD - a map reduce (MR)  framework for secure MR processing in hybrid cloud. The second was a SQL query executor that exploits SQL semantics to partition work between private and public cloud achieving high performance while guaranteeing security.     The approaches for secure computing in hybrid cloud described above are intended for situations where the amount of sensitive data is limited (as if often the case with organizational data). The efficiency of the technique degrades as the percentage of data increases. For such situations, we extended the work using a technique entitled hybridizer that allows designers to incur limited risks (by allowing some sensitive data to be leaked) while optimizing system performance. To our knowledge, this is the first project to  attempt at explicitly model and reason with risk of exposure and to support tools using which users can achieve a tradeoff between risk and performance.

Of course, current cryptographic mechanisms leak information, but future development in the area may address that challenge, or possibly exploit risk based approaches to limit exposure.  The project raised an interesting question -- while a semantically secure general solution to query processing in the cloud has proved elusive, can one design a semantically secure solution in the context of partioned computation. Future work inspired by th outcome of this project will explore such an approach.  The findings and research in Radicle Project directly led to an inclusion of hybrid cloud as a focused area of research in the recent report generated as a result of the "Beckman Database Research Self-Assessment Meeting" held at Irvine in which the PI participated.
