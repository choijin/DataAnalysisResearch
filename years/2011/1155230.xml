<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project outcomes report represents projects that are funded by the Hanscom Air Force Base and are awarded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Cooperative Agreement to the University Corporation of Atmospheric Research (UCAR) for the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). This research is aimed at enhancing the ability to make safe, accurate, and more cost-effective airdrops for military and humanitarian purposes, improving the nation's security, and lowering risk to people and property. The Airforce Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) is the military's system for supporting drops of material from aircraft. The system uses numerical weather predictions and observations as input to software runs on an onboard computer that calculates release points in the air and impact points on the ground. The purpose of this project was to study and improve the atmospheric data assimilation component of the JPADS with more advanced deterministic data assimilation strategies and the possible incorporation of ensemble data assimilation strategies. As part of the Air Force's upgrades to the JPADS software, they engaged NCAR to work with other organizations to improve JPADS weather-related code, including the weather analysis software and methods of data assimilation. Specifically, NCAR developed and tested code that applied forms of a Kalman filter for data assimilation, which  improved upon the simple objective analysis approaches  in JPADS. NCAR  also developed ways to incorporate the Air Force Weather Agency's mesoscale ensemble to expand JPADS ability to produce probabilistic forecasts, and to provide guidance on the confidence that can be inferred from the weather forecasts used by JPADS and the airdrop predictions it calculates.  NCAR contributions to the project have reduced the workload and increased the safety of on-board crews during airdrops, partly by making it more likely that airdrop missions will not require multiple passes over what could be hostile territory.  In addition, more accurate airdrops will likely reduce the waste and risk that occur when cargo is dropped off target.  Results of research and development have been presented to the sponsor, collaborators, and stakeholders during teleconferences, at project meetings, and through written documentation. Computer code has also been provided the sponsor.         Last Modified: 10/02/2019       Submitted by: Everette D Joseph]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
