<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Organizations are increasingly challenged to leverage big data to improve actionable decisions. To address these, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and Drexel University established the National Science Foundation Industry University Cooperative Research Center (NSF IUCRC) Center for Visual and Decision Informatics (CVDI) in February 2012. During Phase-I of the NSF funded grant, the center expanded to include Tampere University of Technology from Finland as an international academic partner in 2015, and retained 12 industry partners. The center conducts user-inspired basic research in decision informatics by integrating analytic, visual and perceptual techniques for handling big data to help industry and government agencies to improve the way an organization&rsquo;s information is interpreted and exploited for better decision making.</p> <p>CVDI is dedicated to advancing research in decision informatics to help organizations make better decisions from large and complex data arriving from disparate sources. The center established strong multi-institutional and industry partnerships to advance research through world-renowned scientists and infrastructure, accelerate innovation through industry engagement, and produce a future workforce to benefit the local and national economy.</p> <p>CVDI leverages a strong cross-institutional and industry-driven research environment by bringing in complementary research expertise of leading scientists in the areas of analytics, visualization, human computer interaction, and data management. The center&rsquo;s research in Phase-I focused in the areas of visual analytics, predictive analytics, interactive visualization, data summarization, and automated data cleaning methods. The center&rsquo;s researchers achieved significant advances on problems related to processing high volume, streaming data from heterogeneous sensors, handling unstructured data present in text documents and social media, and handling high-dimensionality and heterogeneity in datasets.</p> <p>A total of 34 research projects were funded by the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) during Phase-I, 13 of which were at UL Lafayette. These projects generated 72 invention disclosures to the IAB and 110 publications; 30 of the invention disclosures and 31 of the publications were from UL Lafayette. Drexel filed for a patent application during Phase-I. Moreover, $3M of additional funding, in excess of the base NSF award and IAB memberships, was generated through the center; $1.9M was from UL Lafayette. Two of the UL Lafayette projects were nominated by our IAB as technology breakthroughs that were included in the NSF IUCRC breakthrough compendium.</p> <p>The center provided a platform for students to work on industry-relevant research and gain practical experience often not gained from textbooks or laboratory environments. The cross-institutional collaboration resulted in student and workforce development. 86 students were supported by various projects, 47 students were from UL Lafayette. The UL Lafayette site has graduated 17 students (6 BS, 3 MS, 8 PhD) and has had&nbsp;four students hired by industry members. Moreover, the international partnership resulted in a student exchange with TUT where a UL Lafayette PhD student went to Finland to collaborate on one of the research projects. The center also received one REV, one RET, and four REU supplements which enabled these participants to work closely in collaboration with graduate students and faculty sponsors.</p> <p>The center is engaged in various outreach activities both to the research and industry communities. Some of the leadership activities in the research community include founding and serving on steering committee of the IEEE Big Data Conference series, taking on high-profile roles in premier data mining (IEEE-ICDM) and image and signal processing (IEEE-ICIP) conferences, and delivering keynote presentations at comparable venues. IEEE Big Data has become among the most reputable conference in the field, with over 1,000 attendees at the 2017 IEEE Big Data Conference. The center also conducted 14 industry centric workshops, attracted over 130 companies in various sectors and conducted big data related symposiums in the areas of health, cybersecurity, internet of things, and energy.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/28/2018<br>      Modified by: Vijay&nbsp;V&nbsp;Raghavan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1160958/1160958_10152079_1516984746689_CVDIresearchthemes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1160958/1160958_10152079_1516984746689_CVDIresearchthemes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CVDI Research Themes"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1160958/1160958_10152079_1516984746689_CVDIresearchthemes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CVDI Research Themes"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The image depicts the major research themes for the Center for Visual and Decision Informatics during the center?s Phase-I tenure.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Raju Gottumukkala</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Raju&nbsp;Gottumukkala</div> <div class="imageTitle">CVDI Research Themes</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1160958/1160958_10152079_1516991660387_PhotobyDougDugas--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1160958/1160958_10152079_1516991660387_PhotobyDougDugas--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Visual Analytics Environment for Levee Surveillance"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1160958/1160958_10152079_1516991660387_PhotobyDougDugas--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Visual Analytics Environment for Levee Surveillance"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The image shows a user navigating sensor streams from a levee using a touch interface, which enables decision makers to see information much more clearly than a regular 2D display.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Doug Dugas</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Vijay&nbsp;V&nbsp;Raghavan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Visual Analytics Environment for Levee Surveillance</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1160958/1160958_10152079_1516991769022_visual-search-interface--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1160958/1160958_10152079_1516991769022_visual-search-interface--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Visual Search Interface"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1160958/1160958_10152079_1516991769022_visual-search-interface--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Visual Search Interface"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image shows the ontology-based visual search interface of the SemIntegrator tool.
