<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at the University of California Berkeley entitled, "Berkeley Engineering Research Experiences for In-Service and Pre-Service Teachers (BERET)", under the direction of Dr. George C. Johnson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will focus on the intersection between engineering, science, and mathematics through the interdisciplinary lens of synthetic biology.  This program will place a total of 52 middle and high school STEM teachers (26 in-service teachers from the Berkeley Unified School District and the Oakland Unified School District and 26 UC Berkeley pre-service teachers enrolled in Cal Teach)  within a variety of engineering-related research laboratories associated with UC Berkeley and will guide them to develop curricula based on their research that is relevant to the subjects that they teach in school and aligned with the educational standards for the subject addressed.  BERET will be run jointly by the Cal Teach science and mathematics teacher education program and the NSF Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BERET will increase the understanding of math, science and engineering concepts, skills and careers for K-12 students in high need urban schools, and in so doing, contribute to increasing the number of women and under-represented minority students in the STEM pipeline, particularly in engineering fields. The rigorous K-12 curricula developed through BERET will be reviewed, tested and disseminated broadly through web-based resources such as the Industry Initiatives for Science and Math Education (IISME) Community website and the TeachEngineering digital library.  The program will also help to build a vibrant network of in-service teachers, pre-service teachers, and faculty, postdoctoral, and graduate student researchers that will produce long-term collaborative partnerships among individuals and institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Berkeley Engineering Research Experiences for Teachers (BERET) program paired 36 experienced math and science teachers with 45 pre-service teachers in engineering labs to perform authentic research and to develop grade-appropriate curriculum for use in their classrooms.  Eight of the in-service teachers participated for more than one summer.  Nearly all of the in-service teachers work in high-needs schools, with large numbers of low income and underrepresented minority students.  The pre-service teachers were University of California undergraduates enrolled in the Cal Teach science and math teacher credentialing program at one of the nine undergraduate UC campuses.   The following goals were established at the beginning of the program:  Engage in-service and pre-service teacher teams in multi-disciplinary engineering research experiences. Guide teacher teams to develop and teach engineering-based lessons that connect current research in engineering to K-12 science and mathematics curricula in the classroom, and promote engineering as an exciting career that allows K-12 students to apply their math and science education to real-world problems. Build a vibrant network of in-service teachers, pre-service teachers, and faculty, postdoctoral, and graduate student researchers that results in long-term collaborative partnerships. Contribute to research in science education on how research experiences influence teachers and their teaching in secondary math and science classrooms.   Research placements were made in laboratories across the College of Engineering, including the departments of Bioengineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Nuclear Engineering.  In addition, the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (Synberc) provided a number of research placements, including several at the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) Lab.  Some of the JBEI placements also involved high school students who were in the Introductory College Level Experience in Microbiology (iCLEM) program.  Through their experiences, every BERET participant engaged deeply in engineering research that helped produce creative and sustainable curriculum for the science and math classroom.  In partnership with the Industry Initiative for Science and Math Education (IISME, now Ignited - http://www.igniteducation.org/) teachers received curriculum development support for the standard-based material that they developed and made available on the IISME Community Website: http://community.iisme.org/.   One of the key features of this Research Experiences for Teachers program involved pairing in-service teachers with undergraduate pre-service teachers in the research and in the curriculum development.  The curricular modules were jointly developed by the in-service and pre-service teachers for instructional units lasting from a few days to a few weeks.  The pre-service teachers had a unique opportunity to learn from experienced teachers how to think about curriculum development, then had the chance to teach the lessons in the following academic year.   The BERET program, supporting teachers from 2011 through 2015, was particularly timely in light of California?s adoption of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics in 2010 and its adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in 2013.  The state laid out implementation guidelines that allowed BERET participants to create lessons that would enhance students? conceptual understanding of science and mathematics.  The academic center and research focus of BERET in engineering was particularly relevant as the NGSS began to be implemented, with its introduction to the engineering design process as a complement to the scientific method.   An independent evaluation of the BERET program found that it met all of its goals.  The evaluation found that veteran teachers adapt quickly to the university environment when they are paired with an undergraduate research partner.  The undergraduate participants in turn benefit from the experience, perspective, and enthusiasm that in-service teachers bring into the lab. Further, the breadth of the summer experience, from safety training, research methods, science talks, and group meetings, to professional development sessions on inquiry-based science, engineering and math education, made this a broad learning experience that took full advantage of the strengths of the university.  Further, the evaluators found that teams did, in fact, use their summer research experiences as the foundation for developing new engineering-based lessons.  Thus, BERET successfully bridged the interface between engineering and the science and mathematics disciplines commonly taught in secondary schools.  Finally, teacher participants reported that they continue to stay in contact with their research labs and are finding additional projects to be involved in related to their summer experiences. Thus, BERET has substantially strengthened partnerships between university and school participants, to the benefit of both.
