<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[           The 12th IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networking (WoWMoM 2011) was held in Lucca, Italy, on June 20-24, 2011 (www.ieee-wowmom.org), with the IMT Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca in Italy as local host.     WoWMoM is a high quality conference and the premier technical forum dedicated to addressing new challenges in wireless mobile multimedia networking. This is highly significant as the industry is moving toward converged networks including IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) technology and wireless mesh networks.     This travel grant was used to increase the representation and participation of United States-based graduate stu&shy;dents in this conference. The travel award program specifically targets graduate students since they are an important segment of the research community. Further, they often have limited sources of funds for travel to conferences, particularly conferences held abroad.     Participation in conferences such as IEEE WoWMoM is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with peers and more senior researchers, thus having the opportunity to be exposed to leading edge work in the field of wireless and mobile multimedia networks. The support in this proposal enabled the participation of the US-based students who would otherwise be unable to attend WoWMoM 2011. Moreover, the conference being in Europe, these graduate students had unique opportunity for international exposure of their research work.     The grant facilitated 17 students' participations of the conference. They were from 15 universities and two of them are female.
