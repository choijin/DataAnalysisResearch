<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to The  University of Tennessee that will provide research training for 10 students per year, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. This program is supported by the NSF's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program, and the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure. The program focuses on microbiology and the interplay between the microbial community structure and microbial community function.  Housed in the Department of Microbiology, the site has more than 20 faculty whom will serve as mentors and make their homes in Microbiology along with Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences, Biosystems Engineering &amp; Soil Sciences, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering and Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology.   There is a wide range of interesting and exciting projects for the students that span microbiology in environments spanning oceans and lakes, caves and polar regions, industrial and agricultural sites. Students are expected to perform full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and workshops where they will receive training in responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. REU students have access to a rich array of individual mentor's facilities on the University of Tennessee campus and at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The program's multi-phase recruitment effort consists of both traditional "hard copy" formats as well as digital-based advertising. Students will be selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research. Following their summer research, students will be surveyed to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting www.bio.utk.edu/microbiologyreu , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Wilhelm at wilhelm@utk.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Zinser at ezinser@utk.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the origin of life, microbes have dominated the history of planet Earth.  The microbial world has proven complex, and microbial interactions have significant impacts on community stability and activity.   In recent years, research efforts have moved beyond the laboratory and into the environment, where state-of-the-art tools in molecular biology have allowed researchers to query entire microbial communities and how they shape the processes that make up our world.   The Microbial Community Interactions and Functions Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the University of Tennessee offered opportunities for 36 undergraduate students to embed themselves in academic research labs for the summers of 2013 through 2016.  Students gained valuable training a various aspects of molecular microbial ecology, working in systems ranging from deep ocean sediments to the microbiomes of mice resistant to severe malaria.  Students from across the United States and its territories from a broad spectrum of diverse backgrounds (42% from underrepresented groups) spent 10 weeks carrying out research in state-of-the-art microbiological facilities while also participating in training that included ethics, safety and responsible conduct in research.  The program continues to transform how academic research is completed at a Research I institution, while simultaneously creating ambassadors for our research that return to their home institutions to share their successes.
