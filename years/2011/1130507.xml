<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for underrepresented minority graduate students to attend the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) annual meetings for years 2011, 2012, and 2013. The students supported by this grant will either be engaged in the doctoral colloquium of the education forum of INFORMS or presenting a technical talk at the conference. Hence, the students will acquire necessary professional development skills to become an integral part of the operations research and management science profession. In addition, the experience gained through the professional development, the presentation of research, and the interaction with senior professionals in the field will positively affect the students' persistence to obtain a doctoral degree and practice in the field.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful, the efforts supported by this grant will increase the number and diversity of operations research professionals. Also, the interaction of the students with known professionals in the field along with other students will assist in developing a network of colleagues to provide guidance to further their careers. The primary goal of this work is to increase the exposure of underrepresented minority graduate students to researchers in operations research and vice versa, broadening the perception of both. The secondary goal is to foster these individuals into positions within the professoriate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    There are few researchers in operations research (OR) or industrial engineering (IE) who are also members of an underrepresented minority group. This is reflective of the situation for all of math, science, and engineering. Minority groups underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) fields constitute 26% of the U.S. population but only 10% of the population with college degrees employed in a STEM occupation and only 13% of STEM highest degree holders.  This grant supported the inclusion of underrepresented groups in operations research by supporting the travel of underrepresented minority graduate students so they could attend the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) annual meetings for years 2011-2014.  The participants presented posters in the Welcoming Reception of the Minority Issues Forum of INFORMS and some participated in the professional development workshops at the annual meetings.  Overall, 20 students (12 males and 8 females) were supported through this grant where 13 were African-American (Non-Hispanic) and 6 were Hispanic.  Although most of the participants are still currently students, all of the participants who have graduated work in the OR/MS profession.  Some employers of the past participants include MEI Technologies, the Michael DeBakey VA Medical Center, the University of Texas-Pan American, and Cornell University.
