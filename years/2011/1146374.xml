<AbstractNarration>A team of biodiversity specialists will inventory the free-living aquatic sponges, flatworms, annelid worms, mollusks, crustaceans, and fishes of the freshwater habitats of the lower Amazon basin of Brazil. This region is remarkably poorly sampled in comparison to other parts of the basin, and remains one of the last frontiers for scientific discovery in the tropics. Investigators from institutions in the U.S., Brazil and other countries will undertake a multi-habitat, multi-season series of expeditions to collect, photograph, identify, catalog, and analyze the aquatic fauna. The project will yield large geo-referenced collections of specimens, produce on-line and printed faunal guides, generate species descriptions, taxonomic revisions, and synthetic studies of the ecology and evolution of Amazonian aquatic animals, and will provide unique opportunities for student training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collections, data, and products generated by this project will serve as a lasting resource for understanding how the extraordinary diversity of the Amazon is generated and maintained, how resilient this diversity is to human pressure, and how it can be protected. Project results will therefore be valuable to professionals in fisheries and natural resource management, ecology, biogeography, paleontology, geology, evolutionary biology, archaeology, and anthropology. This project will also benefit people of the Amazon whose livelihoods are dependent upon aquatic resources, and members of the public worldwide who wish to learn more about the Amazon?s fascinating yet threatened aquatic life.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Aquatic Faunal Survey of the Lower Amazon (AFSLA) is a cooperative project involving scientists from the United States, Brazil, and other nations. Its objective is to document biological and ecological diversity of the lower Amazon basin. The aquatic fauna of the lower Amazon basin is poorly known in comparison to the middle and upper reaches of the Amazon, and yet is unique in exhibiting all three of the Amazon&rsquo;s major water chemistry types: 1. Nutrient-rich, sediment-rich &lsquo;whitewaters&rsquo; of Andean erosion-zone origin; 2. Nutrient-poor, tannin stained &lsquo;blackwaters&rsquo; draining lowland forested catchments; and 3. Nutrient-poor, high-transparency &lsquo;clearwaters&rsquo; flowing out of the giant Guiana and Brazilian Shields. Although some of the first scientific explorers of the Amazon, including Alexander von Humboldt, and Alfred Russell Wallace recognized that almost all rivers of the Amazon are divisible into these three categories, no ecological studies have hitherto compared the aquatic species diversity and community structure of these three water types within a single geographical region. &nbsp;Moreover, the lower Amazon also contains all three of the lowland Amazon&rsquo;s major aquatic geomorphological systems: 1. River-floodplain formations in Holocene sediments, 2. Lowland streams in Neogene-Paleogene formations above the Amazon&rsquo;s floodplain, 3. Upland streams in Shield formations. All of these water types and geomorphological foundations are found within a small geographical area in the vicinity of Santar&eacute;m, in the Brazilian state of Par&aacute;, which served as the focal study area of the AFSLA. During the period 2013-2016 we conducted nine major expeditions to this region, during which an international team of 30 scientists and graduate students surveyed the diversity of fish, mollusks, turbellaria, annelids and some other invertebrate animal groups. Additionally, a database of water chemistry and ecological data was collected for each sampled locality.</p> <p>The project team collected, identified and deposited in US and Brazilian natural history collections over 79,000 specimens off fishes, belonging to over 6,300 museum lots, and representing 700+ species. We documented a remarkable 657 species of fishes, all collected within a radius of 150 km of the city of Santarem. This represents the highest diversity of freshwater fish for any comparable area on the planet &ndash; a species richness rivaling only the extraordinary diversity of marine fishes in some Indo-Pacific coral reefs. To date 18 of these species of fishes have been described as new species, and some 20 more species descriptions are underway. In contrast, the diversity of invertebrates in the region, despite intense sampling, was documented to be surprisingly low. For example, we documented only 20 species of mollusks, 27 species of turbellarian flatworms, and 20 species of crustaceans. All mollusk and crustacean species had been previously described. Descriptions of four new Turbellaria and one new leech species are currently underway.</p> <p>Our work revealed important differences in community ecology between the major water types and geomorphological systems of the lowland Amazon. Specimens and tissue samples from the AFSLA are also contributing to multiple studies of the evolutionary interrelationships, and to studies of feeding ecology, reproductive ecology, and sensory ecology. The collections, databases, and published findings of the AFSLA will provide a long-term baseline dataset for monitoring the health of aquatic ecosystems in the lower Amazon. The lower Amazon region is currently under intense and escalating threat from fishing, deforestation for soy cultivation and cattle ranching, mining, pollution, and climate change. Ongoing and future conservation initiatives in the lower Amazon will benefit greatly from the enhanced understanding of species diversity provided by this project.</p> <p>A major outreach product of AFSLA was the production of a major natural history film &ldquo;Electric Amazon&rdquo; (Smithsonian Channel) for which the PI, W. Crampton, served as host, Field Producer and Scientific Director. This documentary describes the diversity and ecology of electrogenic and electroreceptive fish in the deep river channel, floodplain, and terra firme stream systems of the lowland Amazon. PI Crampton also hosted an episode of the National Geographic Television show &ldquo;Monster Fish&rdquo; with Zeb Hogan. This film featured a recording by PI Crampton of the highest voltage reported to date from an electric eel &ndash; a remarkable 860 volts (a record electric discharge for any animal).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/09/2018<br>      Modified by: William&nbsp;G&nbsp;Crampton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1146374/1146374_10182530_1536547779102_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1146374/1146374_10182530_1536547779102_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Examples of aquatic diversity of the lower Amazon"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1146374/1146374_10182530_1536547779102_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Examples of aquatic diversity of the lower Amazon"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Live photographs of fish (upper four images), two new species of fishes Cyphocharax muyrakytan and Thayeria tapajonica (images with black backgrounds).
