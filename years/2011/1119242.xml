<AbstractNarration>Recently there has been a dramatic increase in the number and size of low oxygen (hypoxia) regions in coastal waters worldwide due to human activities, but the long-term impacts of this global change on coastal fisheries and ecosystems are unknown. Marked reductions in egg production and hormone levels are found in Atlantic croaker collected from hypoxic coastal regions which are associated with inhibition of the brain hormone controlling reproduction, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). These studies suggest hypoxia may target three enzymes in the brain critical for GnRH function, tryptophan hydroxylase, aromatase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase. This project will test the hypothesis that all three enzymes in croaker brains are altered by hypoxia exposure through a specific mechanism resulting in down-regulation of GnRH and reproductive functions. The results are expected to show, for the first time in any vertebrate, the existence of a specific brain mechanism by which hypoxia prevents reproduction as an adaptive mechanism to conserve energy. The results will be valuable for making policy, management and regulatory decisions by resource protection agencies. Undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers, including underrepresented Hispanic minorities, will conduct independent projects and receive training on all aspects of the research and its analysis, the results of which will be communicated via different media to the general public, high school students, teachers and scientific community. Trainees will be taught how their basic research findings can be utilized to benefit society by developing their skills in recognizing the potential broader societal impacts of their research.</AbstractNarration>

Further increases in the extent of coastal hypoxia and its deleterious effects on fisheries are expected over the next century due to increased inputs of fertilizers and global warming. Recent laboratory studies have shown that reproduction is impaired in a marine fish, Atlantic croaker, chronically exposed to hypoxia. Importantly, reproduction was also severely impaired in Atlantic croaker collected from the entire northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic region (dead zone), the second largest hypoxic zone in the world. However, the long term impacts of recurring hypoxia on the abundance of marine animals and valuable fishery resources are unknown because basic information is lacking on how hypoxia down-regulates reproduction. The results of this study show the presence of a specific mechanism in the brain of Atlantic croaker to block reproduction through decreases in the secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters (chemicals that regulate the activity of nerve cells). Paradoxically, exposure of croaker to low oxygen levels causes oxygen-related stress in croaker brains through increasing the production of nitric oxide and other reactive oxygen molecules which results in declines in estrogen signaling and production of the neurotransmitter, serotonin.

The discovery of this specific response in the brain of croaker to hypoxia is likely to stimulate research on this topic in other animals. For example, these results are likely to have broad significance for our understanding of reproductive adaptations of organisms to environmental changes, particularly to oxygen-limited conditions such as hypoxia, at high altitudes, and during hibernation. In addition, evidence for an involvement of estrogen signaling and brain aromatase in the regulation of serotonin production and GnRH expression suggests that estrogens can exert a protective effect on hypoxia-induced impairment of reproductive neuroendocrine functions after hypoxia exposure.
