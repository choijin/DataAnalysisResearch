<AbstractNarration>A key region for analysis of long- and short-term behavior of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) is the eastern sector of the Wilkes Land margin, located at the seaward termination of the largest subglacial basin in East Antarctica, the Wilkes subglacial basin. The Wilkes subglacial basin may in fact respond to climate variability in a fashion similar to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Additionally, a significant portion of all Antarctic Bottom Water may originate from this part of the Antarctic coast, making this region a key player in oceanic circulation patterns. The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 318 to Wilkes Land recently obtained nearly 3,000 meters of sedimentary cores. Drill site U1357, obtained a unique ultra-high accumulation rate sedimentary sequence from the Adelie Basin that extends from the latest glacial interval through the Holocene. These seasonally laminated deposits constitute one of the world's most expanded archives of environmental change during the Holocene. The sediments contain a near annual-resolution record of when and how the ice sheet margin retreated from the shelf ~12,000 kyr B.P. They also contain a record of past changes in water temperature, water mass reservoir age, stratification, productivity, sea ice extent, and possibly bottom water production throughout the Holocene. In this collaborative proposal, the P.I.'s request funding for morphometric, stable isotopic, and geochemical analyses of foraminifera recovered from the sediment column. These will be used to produce the first high-resolution (sub-decadal to decadal) foraminiferal isotopic and chemical climate time series from the Antarctic margin. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - The results from this project will provide, for the first time, the requisite data at subdecadal to decadal resolution to address a number of questions related to oceanographic and climatic changes that occurred on and around Antarctica during the Holocene, including: 1) How does the style and timing of deglaciation along the East Antarctic Margin compare with other parts of the Antarctic Margin? 2) What were the responses of the East Antarctic Margin glacial system to deglaciation as well as global and regional Holocene climate fluctuations? 3) How did oceanic circulation and bottom water production vary during the Holocene? As part of our post-expedition educational outreach, we will organize two additional interactive webcasts targeting science museums and secondary schools during the course of this research. At Stanford, we will continue to disseminate the results of this work to secondary schools via a funded NASA project wherein he is meeting regularly with science teachers from around the SF Bay Area. Additionally, we are engaging up to 8 undergraduate students at Queens College and Stanford University in the project as interns and will guide them through the process of envisioning</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed ultra high-resolution records (7 year average resolution) that are unique for marine records, especially being so proximal to Antarctica.  In fact, outside of ice core records, these records are probably the highest resolution records ever developed for Antarctica.  In this study, two marine data sets were developed: biofacies assemblage data of the shells made from micro-organisms called foraminifers that live on the sea bottom as well as float in the upper part of the ocean and geochemical data from these foraminiferal shells.  These geochemical data are one of the principal means to estimate changes in ice volume and ocean water temperatures.  These data come the remains of shells from foraminifers &mdash; single-celled marine organisms &mdash; of that period. The ratio of oxygen isotopes in the shells depends on both the temperature and the isotopic composition of the water in which the foraminifers lived. The isotopic composition, in turn, was controlled by the melt water from icebergs. Carbon isotopes serve as proxies for surface water productivity and in the case of offshore Antarctica mixing of surface and deeper waters.      The location of the site where the sediment samples were taken, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1357, is located ~50 km off the Ad&eacute;lie coastline of East Antarctica (66&deg;24.8&prime;S, 140&deg;25.7&prime;E) in the Ad&eacute;lie Trough, which is a glacially scoured valley on the continental shelf.  An exceptional sedimentary archive of Holocene changes was triple cored during the expedition penetrating nearly 190 meters below sea floor. Carbon-14 age dates from U1357A provide a firm chronology, indicating an average sedimentation rate of nearly 1.7-cm/ yr, with the base of the core dated as approximately 11,000 years old. Samples at 10 cm spacing were collected during the expedition for isotopic and foraminiferal studies. Seasonal dark and light banding provide a varved record from immediately offshore of Antarctica, which is similar to a tree ring record, but from the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Antarctica.  Another exceptional aspect of this core is the incredible length of time of nearly continuous climate and oceanographic archives extending back to 11,000 years before present.  In this collaborative effort with Rob Dunbar from Stanford University, the upper section nine cores were worked on in this project and my students at Queens College, with the lower (older) section being worked on by RobÆs group at Stanford university.     Intellectual merits of the project include developing an ultra high-resolution foraminiferal biofacies record that provides evidence of bottom water changes in the Ad&eacute;lie Trough for the last ~5,500 years.  The 7-year resolution biofacies record provides insights into bottom circulation  and bottom water ventilation on the shelf.  This is important, as the Ad&eacute;lie Trough is adjacent to the Ad&eacute;lie Depression, which produces up to 25% of all the Antarctica Bottom Water. Higher ventilation of the bottom waters in the Ad&eacute;lie Trough occur during the mid Holocene (5.5-3.0 ky BP), with lower ventilation occurring between ~3 ky and 0.8 ky BP, and generally higher ventilation between 700 yr BP and today.      The oxygen and carbon isotope records provide proxies for surface water productivity, vertical water mixing, sea surface temperatures, and iceberg melt.  They show several brief cooling events during the mid Holocene and pronounced warming between 700 and 1,600 years BP.  These correlate well to the ice core data from East Antarctica.  The pronounced surface warming event coupled with possibly less mixing is among the best evidence that a southern expression of the Medieval Warming event for around Antarctica.  The age model also suggests that the warming may have begun before the Medieval Warming started in the northern hemisphere.  This may provide insights into the causal mechanisms for this warm...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
