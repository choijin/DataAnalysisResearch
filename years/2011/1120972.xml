<AbstractNarration>The reproductive potential of an adult depends on the embryo forming specialized stem cells, called primordial germ cells. They are the only cells of the body that are able to develop into the eggs or sperm of the adult. If this mechanism fails, or if those cells are lost, the adult will not be able to make eggs or sperm, and will be reproductively sterile. The process of developing these important primordial germ cells is not understood, but they are a type of stem cells with the ultimate in developmental capability. These investigators are using a simple animal as a model to explore how the process of primordial germ cell formation works. They are using echinoderms, i.e. sea urchins and sea stars, as a model to explore this mechanism with an understanding that they will reveal general and fundamental principles of this process. Embryos from these animals are easily manipulated, they develop outside of the adult, and advanced genomic resources are available. Echinoderms are also closely related to vertebrates, so these results will have broad ramifications for animals in which this process is difficult to study.The research support will also have a significant impact beyond the bench as our lab has an aggressive outreach program. We are regular hosts to URM faculty and students, Professor Wessel serves as a scientific advisor to several preK-12 schools, and has involved a variety of students in the lab in observation, hands-on research, authorship, and creative learning. Overall, our outreach activities over the past 3 years have involved directly over 300 citizens, and benefit both the members of the lab and society, hopefully changing us all for a healthy science outlook in the future.</AbstractNarration>

This response is very similar to what happens when the Mics are removed, but in this case they remain intact. It is possible that Z426 is part of the signaling pathway that Mics keep active in other cells, and without it Vasa is able to accumulate to high levels and reconfigure the germ line lineage.
