<AbstractNarration>The solution of symbolic computation problems can be accelerated in at least two ways: one is to integrate limited precision floating point arithmetic on the scalars, and the other is to use parallel processes. We propose to investigate those approaches on problems in real algebraic optimization and exact linear algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Semidefinite numerical optimization produces sum-of-squares representations for polynomial inequalities, which express global optimality.  But the representations are numeric and approximate, and exact rational certificates for the inequalities are derived via exact symbolic means, thus leading to truly hybrid symbolic-numeric algorithms.  When combining floating point arithmetic and randomization, analysis of the expected condition numbers of the random intermediate problems can guarantee success.  We propose to introduce fraction-free algorithms and analyze the arising determinantal condition numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LinBox is a C++ library for exact linear algebra.  We propose to participate in the parallelization of the LinBox library by investigating problems with memory contention and by creating interactive symbolic supercomputing environments.  Several related problems in computational algebraic complexity that will receive attention are: quadratic-time certificates for linear algebra problems, determinantal representation of polynomials by symmetric linear matrix forms, and interpolation of supersparse (lacunary) rational functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's research expands the infrastructure in symbolic computation and the understanding of the underlying complexity.  Aside from certifying optima, exact sums-of-squares certificates have proved theorems in mathematics, physics and control theory.  Some of the important applications of LinBox are sparse linear algebra over finite fields and integer Smith forms for computational topology data.  The PI is making the developed software freely available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic thinking and computation have become a cornerstone of modern science (pure and applied) and modern life.  Symbolic computation programs, such as Mathematica, Maple, and the SAGE platform, have many applications, such as modeling data sets by symbolic expression for Toyota and Shell Oil, generating programs for signal processing, and program and protocol verification.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project focused on two areas: 1. certificates for the correctness of lengthy computations; 2. correction of errors in input data for purpose of deriving a concisely descriptive mathematical model for the data.  A certificate for the result of a lengthy computation is additional output with which a receiver can quickly verify that the result is correct.  Such certificates are useful for computations in the cloud that the receiver cannot replicate but check for correctness.  We present certificates for computational problems in linear algebra and in optimization of polynomial functions with real coefficients and values.  Specifically, we have linear-time checkable certificates for the rank and characteristic polynomial of dense and sparse matrices and sum-of-squares proofs of polynomial inequalities.  Digital error correction is a process by which incorrect data can be diagnosed and corrected from redundancy.  A famous application is the locating of incorrectly burned bubbles on an optical disk.  When building a mathematical model from data, in our case it is a symbolic expression that models an observed list of argument-value samples of a function, say a measurement of values at different time steps, erroneous data (``outliers'') add complication.  We have brought the algebraic error-correcting decoding techniques by Reed and Solomon to our problem, namely, reconstructing a sparse one- or multi-dimensional polynomial model from values.  In our setting, the sparsity structure is not known on input.  Our techniques apply to numeric data where the non-erroneous measurements can contain a small amount of noise.  Our work has produced a new error correcting code, the sparse polynomial code.  An important goal of our research is the reduction of the needed amount of oversampling, thus increasing the allowed error-rate in the data.   Broader impact: symbolic computation is a methodology known for its time consuming computations.  Modern computing environments in large cloud facilities allow carrying out those computations, thereby solving important tasks such as optimizing parameters for engineering designs, say filters for radio signals or configurations in mechanical devices such as components of a car.  Certification of the produced outputs checks for bugs in the computation and allows for unproven heuristics in the algorithms.   Data can be measured by modern sensing devices, but it seems hard to eliminate faulty measurements a-priori.  Error-correcting codes provide a powerful tool for cleaning up the data within our symbolic computation modelling algorithms.
