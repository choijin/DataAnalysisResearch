<AbstractNarration>Over the past decade, millions of trees in California and Oregon forests have been attacked by an exotic pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, causal agent of the infectious forest disease known as sudden oak death. This destructive outbreak is occurring in redwood and oak woodland communities in the same places that have also recently experienced devastating wildfires and extreme droughts. This research will use a novel combination of molecular, greenhouse, field, and computational modeling techniques to understand how disturbances created by wildfire, drought, and infectious disease interact and impact forest ecosystems. Results are expected to illuminate how wildfire affects the persistence and spread of an invasive pathogen, how biodiversity impacts emergence of disease in disturbed vs. undisturbed plant communities, and how these interacting disturbances alter nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combined research on the ecology of infectious disease, wildfire and drought will help develop best management  practices for the growing number of forested landscapes around the world that are being impacted by complex, interacting disturbances. Outreach to stakeholders will be implemented through two highly effective organizations - University of California Cooperative Extension and the California Oak Mortality Task Force. The investigators will also be actively involved with advising state, federal and International regulatory committees put in place to create policy for managing sudden oak death and other forest diseases.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For invasive forest pathogens, there is a poor understanding of how disease dynamics &ndash; and associated tree mortality &ndash; interact with natural disturbance regimes that were already occurring in the invaded forest. In this grant, we took advantage of two large-scale natural disturbances (wildfire and drought) that affected our long-term sudden oak death studies. Sudden oak death (SOD) is an emerging infectious disease in fire-prone California coastal forests. SOD killed trees increase fire fuels, with potential for novel disturbance interactions. We wished to understand how environmental variation, disease dynamics, and fire severity jointly influence forest structure. We used a natural experiment presented by the first wildfires to occur in a SOD-impacted region: the 2008 Basin and Chalk Fires in Big Sur, CA. These fires burned &gt;40% of our OD-monitoring forest plot network established in 2006/07, covering a gradient of disease impacts. These fires allowed us to examine complex interactions between biotic and abiotic disturbances that would never be possible to conduct with manipulative experiments. We analyzed tree mortality associated with fire/sudden oak death in redwood forests of Big Sur and examined how novel ecosystem disturbances (SOD) interact with historically occurring disturbances (fire) in complex ways. The dominant tree, coast redwood (fire resistant without negative disease impacts), experienced unexpected synergistic increases in mortality when fire and disease co-occurred. Increased mortality risk was more than fourfold at the peak of the effect. This was not predictable from impacts of either disturbance alone. Fire behavior change associated with changes to forest fuels that occurred through disease progression overwhelmed redwood&rsquo;s usual resilience to wildfire. These results demonstrate the potential for interacting disturbances to initiate novel successional trajectories and compromise ecosystem resilience. We also evaluated post-fire burn severity in infested and non-infested forests using remote sensing. Models were developed for these two forest communities using synergized (post-fire) MASTER (MODIS/ASTER) airborne simulator and/or (pre- and post-fire) Landsat data. Combined Landsat and MASTER performed better than using individual sensors in almost all the evaluated forest strata from the ground to the canopy layers. This combined research on the ecology of infectious disease, wildfire and drought has helped us develop best management practices for the growing number of forested landscapes around the world that are being impacted by complex, interacting disturbances. We have expanded many of the projects from our first EEID grant. For example, in the Big Sur area, we are linking disturbance-focused research with efforts by the Los Padres National Forest to develop a joint fire-disease management plan called FireScape Monterey (<a href="http://firescape.ning.com/">http://firescape.ning.com/</a> ) that will protect both natural resources and local communities. As part of this involvement, we have written an adaptive management plan for the LPNF that focuses on fuel reduction and ecosystem restoration. Outreach to stakeholders continues through UC Cooperative Extension and the California Oak Mortality Task Force.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/22/2016<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;M&nbsp;Rizzo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
