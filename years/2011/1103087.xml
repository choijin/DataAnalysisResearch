<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Rudolf von May is "Habitat shifts and physiology of high-elevation Andean frogs." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Berkeley and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Craig Moritz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a rapidly changing world, many species are faced with shrinking native habitat, expanding new habitats, and novel climatic conditions. Tropical montane regions are of special concern because they are centers of unique biodiversity. While much attention has been given to modeling and predicting habitat-related range shifts in montane organisms, especially in the context of climate change, the underlying evolutionary factors and mechanisms of response to habitat change remain poorly understood. This research is improving our understanding of the evolutionary history of Andean frogs and explaining how major shifts in habitat are also influenced by physiological attributes and distributions of related taxa. It maps the distributions of ground-breeding frogs within forested and open habitats across elevations, tracing habitat preferences using an existing phylogeny constructed with molecular genetic data.  Empirical data on physiological characteristics including thermal tolerance, desiccation tolerance, and locomotion of sister taxa pairs are being collected for species distribution modeling to gain insights of current and past species distributions and to improve predictions on future distributions.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include molecular systematics, phylogeography, physiology, and species distribution modeling.  Broader impacts include capacity-building and advanced training for minority students from the United States, students in Latin America, and an outreach program to promote ecological literacy about local and tropical biodiversity. Outreach focuses on developing a science education partnership with local teachers. The teaching option includes a short course on tropical ecology and evolution for undergraduate students from universities in the US and Peru.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The tropical Andes exhibit extraordinary levels of diversity and endemism of amphibians. Global warming may push high elevation species past their thermal thresholds, resulting in species&rsquo; range contraction and eventual extinction.

Empirical data on thermal physiology are required to refine predictions about species responses to increased environmental temperatures. This study investigated the diversity, evolutionary relationships, and thermal physiological traits in a group of terrestrial breeding frogs (Craugastoridae) distributed along a tropical montane gradient to better understand why species live at different elevations and how they respond to environmental change. We examined the variation of critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and critical thermal minimum (CTmin) in 22 species to test the hypothesis that critical thermal limits are related to species&rsquo; elevational distribution. Frogs were captured at different localities between the Amazon floodplain (250 m elevation) and the high Andean grasslands (3700 m). We collected data on CTmax, CTmin, and six other life history traits (body size, body mass, lowest elevation, highest elevation, elevational midpoint, and elevational range) to determine which variables can better explain the observed variation along the gradient. We used genetic data to resolve a species tree and to conduct phylogenetic comparative analyses. Furthermore, given that critical thermal limits may have evolved at different rates in response to different temperature constraints along the gradient, we tested whether CTmax and CTmin exhibit different rates of evolution. Our tests of phylogenetic signal focusing on critical thermal traits suggest that closely related species experienced substantial divergence in thermal physiological traits. Phylogenetic generalized linear regression models indicate that CTmax and CTmin are significantly correlated with one another, and that CTmax is significantly correlated with elevational midpoint, highest elevation, and lowest elevation. Additionally, we found that CTmax and CTmin exhibit similar rates of evolution, a result that is in contrast with that reported for other tropical ectotherms such as <em>Anolis</em> lizards, where CTmin evolved faster than CTmax. Fundamental differences in species&rsquo; thermoregulation strategies between frogs and lizards may explain these contrasting patterns of physiological evolution. Another significant finding is that species at higher elevations exhibit larger performance breadths than species at low elevations, and highland species tolerate maximum critical temperatures that are well above the temperatures they periodically experience in their natural habitats. Our results suggest that lowland species are more vulnerable to climate warming than highland species due to their thermal physiology; however lowland species have wider geographical ranges than highland species, as well as the opportunity to migrate upslope in response to increased temperature. This research is significant because it provided insights into the mechanisms that generate and maintain tropical biodiversity, revealed hidden diversity that needs to be protected, and improved our ability to predict species&rsquo; responses to environmental change. Additional outputs include advanced training for students from underrepresented groups in the sciences, and outreach educational materials to promote literacy about tropical biodiversity.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/13/2015<br>      Modified by: Rudolf&nbsp;Von-May</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
