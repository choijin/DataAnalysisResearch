<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate the ejection of matter from the nuclei of galaxies via quasar winds, the link to accretion of matter into the nuclei, and the feedback between these processes that affects the formation and evolution of typical massive galaxies and larger-scale structures.  The PIs and their students will use data on 150,000 quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III (SDSS-III).   They will study variability in the broad absorption line troughs that characterize quasar winds.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs.  Catalogs and data products produced by the research will be publicly released, and the PIs and their students will conduct summer workshops for high-school and middle-school teachers.</AbstractNarration>
