<AbstractNarration>American ginseng is a widespread, but uncommon to rare, understory plant of the eastern broadleaf forests of North America, and serves as an excellent model for rare species more generally.  Plant censuses were begun in 1998 on a set of ginseng populations in a diverse array of environments to address important ecological questions regarding the effects of overbrowsing, invasive species, landscape change, climate change, and commercial harvest on population sustainability.  The current award extends long-term data collection for American ginseng. Mathematical models based on census data will be developed to project long-term population growth and viability in response to infrequent events (either detrimental or beneficial); the tradeoff between directional change and stochastic variation; synchronicity of demographic patterns over space; and the likelihood of extinction of small populations.  These phenomena typify vexing problems that cannot be addressed from typical short-term studies or studies of a limited sample of populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has diverse broader impacts.  Roots of this culturally and economically important plant are harvested from the wild by rural Appalachian residents to supply the Asian traditional medicine market, and contribute to the local economy. Student training opportunities will be offered annually to support career development of young scientists.  Census data will be shared with the scientific community, and linkages with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service provide direct policy input annually.  Finally, a public web site will be updated regularly to explain the research effort and its principal findings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plant demography is the study of changes in plant numbers over time, including factors that control those numbers.  The purpose of this study was to document factors affecting the demography of American ginseng, our country?s most important wild harvested medicinal plant.  Each year, thousands of rural, often-poor harvesters scour the woods for this plant, hoping to dig enough roots to earn supplemental income as they are sold to dealers supplying the Asian traditional medicine market.  This harvest is regulated by state governments, with oversight by the U. S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, which in turn is attempting to ensure compliance with the terms of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).  In this study, we set out originally to determine whether harvest was sustainable, and if not, how regulations could be improved to ensure sustainability.  It soon became clear, however, that ginseng was impacted by several other factors that could be of equal importance, and that long-term censusing of an extensive network of populations would be needed to document and evaluate all of these factors.  What followed was the most extensive censusing effort ever for a wild population of plants &ndash; both over space (30 populations in 7 states) and time (13-20 years, without interruption).  Through a series of MS and PhD dissertation research projects, we discovered three primary factors threatening wild ginseng populations: (a) harvest, (b) deer browsing, and (c) climate change.  We also investigated effects of (d) invasive species, (e) fungal disease, (e) coal mining, (f) timbering, and (g) natural canopy disturbances caused by severe storm events.  In addition, we made discoveries about the basic biology of ginseng that were previously unknown, highlighted by the discovery of the primary dispersers of ginseng seeds.  Due to space limitations, I summarize only  findings concerning the first three here.  With respect to harvest, we found that nearly half of our 30 populations were harvested during our census years, and therefore we were able to document the extent to which harvesters complied with regulations.  Shockingly, an extremely low percentage of events were legal in every sense.  The vast majority violated some element of regulations, with most of these violations occurring in three ways: (1) they harvested out of season, (2) they harvested on land where it was prohibited, and (3) they harvested plants that were below the minimum in size or age.  These findings upended our prior belief that most harvest was being performed by conservation-minded Appalachian families with a long-held stewardship relationship to the resource.  Indeed, at the outset of the study, stewardship harvesting may have been more common, however ?Reality TV? shows (largely staged) glorified ginseng theft and out of season harvest as a way to reap large financial rewards.  This in turn is believed to have shifted the complexion of the harvester community.  We performed demographic modeling of the effects of harvester misbehavior on population growth, highlighting the need for better education and better law enforcement, at a minimum, to conserve the species.  Our research also showed that even existing harvest seasons were beginning too early.  USFWS and states gradually moved to uniform, later harvest seasons as a direct consequence of our work.  Deer browse ginseng as an occasional food species, but it is not particularly favored by deer.  The reason deer browsing has become a problem is that in many regions, the deer population is as much as 10-fold higher than in pre-settlement conditions.  This has occurred due to specific management for the hunting community, along with elimination of top predators in the eastern U.S.  Deer typically don?t kill ginseng plants outright when eating them, but plants shrink in size and their reproduction is eliminated.  In typical ginseng populations, 30 &ndash; 50% of plants have been browsed by the end of the growing season, leaving a population that is producing many fewer seeds, and plants that are smaller the next year.  We performed modeling simulations to determine what the long-term effect of this pressure would be, and found that over a period of decades, a high percent of ginseng populations are predicted to go extinct if browsing pressure is not reduced.  Ginseng is not likely to be unusual among understory plants in terms of effects of deer overpopulation &ndash; indeed, it is quite typical in this regard, so preservation of the rich deciduous forest understory will rely upon deer population control.  Over the long course of our study, we observed several growing seasons that were unusually warm.  The demographic response of ginseng to these years could then be used to project the effects of climate change.  We found that populations in all parts of the range are adapted to their local temperature climate, and therefore, with increasing frequency of warm years, populations were projected to decline with a high probability.
