<AbstractNarration>This project will create a scholarship program called SPARK to offer eighteen scholarships to an undergraduate cohort comprised of first year, low income, academically talented engineering, and computer science majors at Texas State University - San Marcos. Scholarship support will continue for 3 years. Targeted recruiting and clearly defined selection criteria will help to create a strong cohort. Participants will live in a shared community integrating learning, mentoring, and academic enrichment. They will also participate in two highly engaged experiential learning summer sessions created specifically for the scholarship program.  SPARK will help students refine skills critical to success in a 21st century workforce: adaptability, problem solving, innovation, empowerment, and leadership through the shared residential learning community, co-enrollment in STEM-related courses, a dedicated first year university transition course, and special summer sessions. Regular mentoring sessions will focus on career exploration, personal development, and research opportunities.  The project will increase the number of talented female students attaining undergraduate engineering and computer science (ECS) degrees and contribute to the effort to achieve a more diverse STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

There were over 8.3 million STEM jobs as of May 2014 - and they're growing more rapidly than non-STEM jobs.
