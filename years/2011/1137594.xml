<AbstractNarration>The 2-Pi-STEM (2-Pathways into STEM) Project is designed to create pathways to professional careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) through awareness activities, field experiences, teaching and learning through problem-based learning concept and the establishment of a college bridge program at Lawson State Community College (LSCC).  The activities of the project will be supported by an enhanced STEM infrastructure at LSCC impacting the underrepresented populations in STEM careers especially in the Central Alabama region.   The overarching goal of the 2-Pi-STEM Project is to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the STEM career paths focusing in the following goals: (1) Provide cross curricular mentoring and learning communities for STEM students to improve persistence and efficacy in STEM courses (2) Create a STEM pipeline by providing enrichment and academic enhancement programs for high school students (3) Implement a college bridge program for incoming freshman/sophomore and transfer students in concert with LSCC's Freshman Academy, a seminar class acclimating new students to college life. The project expects to increase preparation and success of a pool of African American students in Central Alabama in transitioning from high school, being retained in STEM at the community college, and transferring in STEM to a four-year college.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 2-Pi STEM Program at Lawson State Community College sought to increase the number and quality of underrepresented minorities entering STEM career pathways. To this end, the program depended profoundly on the collaborative efforts of the LSCC STEM faculty, two and four-year partners, regional and federal supporters, and our business and industry stakeholders.&nbsp; The Lawson State STEM faculty, supporting the goals and objectives of the 2-Pi STEM Program, implemented innovative instructional strategies and technological enhancements, active recruiting and retention of students through intrusive advising efforts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lawson State&rsquo;s determination to advance STEM, along with its stakeholders and collaborators has established it as a leader in STEM recruitment, retention, and completion, reflecting a 24% increase in STEM student enrollment from 2004&ndash;2014; a 43 % completion and transfer rate, 12% higher than the national average and nearly three times the overall graduation average among Alabama community colleges.&nbsp; In addition, STEM majors have steadily increased, representing 12% of student enrollment at Lawson State (2014).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Along with the efforts of the LSCC STEM Faculty the Honors College, led by Mr. Weymon Holloway, Director and Dr. Shawanda Thomas, Co-Director LSCC&rsquo;s STEM Program collaborated on multiple activities broadening the possibility of exposing STEM to some of the college&rsquo;s best and brightest. Dr. Tracey Wilson has continued to enhance and broaden collaborations with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), assisting with numerous transfer and research opportunities for STEM students via the Bridge to Biomedical Careers and Noyce Scholarship Partnership Grant administered by UAB Collaboration for Excellence in Science and Math Education.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key administrative personnel, under the leadership of Dr. Perry Ward, have provided unwavering support to broaden STEM recruitment, retention, completion, and bridge opportunities: Dr. Bruce Crawford, Vice President of Instructional Services and 2-Pi STEM Program Principal Investigator; Mrs. Sharon Crews, Vice President of Student Services; Dr. Sherri Davis, Academic Dean and 2-Pi STEM Curriculum Coordinator; Dr. Karl Pruitt, Associate Academic Dean; Dr. Tracey Wilson, Natural Science &amp; Physical Education Department Chairperson and LSCC Coordinator, UAB Blazing Biomedical Careers Program; Ms. Katherine Long, Federal Grants and Budget Manager; and our LSCC recruitment team. I applaud each and every contributor for their commitment and service to achieving the grants overarching goal to increase the number of underrepresented minorities entering and persisting in STEM Career Pathways.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>During the life of the 2-Pi STEM Program Lawson State Community College implemented and institutionalized many of its course enhancements, activities, conceptual models and initiatives. For example: A research methods course titled STEM Research Methods (MTH 252). The course provides opportunity for the student to study selected topics in research and leadership under the supervision. The course covers quantitative and qualitative methodologies and leadership theory for credit. Students are introduced to basic research methodologies and leadership theories. Students are required to develop and expand a research outline using Microsoft word, excel, and/or Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The 2-Pi STEM Program created a conceptual model (The Briggs Model, figure 4.) based on the goals and objectives outlined in its proposal, this conceptual model consists of advising and mentor, research, recruitment, and enrichment opportunities for students.&nbsp; According to Jennifer Varney, Intrusive Advising involves intentional contact with students with the goal of developing a caring and beneficial relationship that leads to increased academic motivation and persistence (2007). Earl defines it as proactive interactions with students, with the intention of connecting with them before a situation occurs that cannot be fixed (1988). If you believe that intrusive Advising is &ldquo;hand-holding&rdquo; or parenting, it is not, according to Upcraft &amp; Kramer, but rather it is active concern for students&rsquo; academic preparation; it is a willingness to assist students in exploring services and programs to improve skills and increase academic motivation (1995).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The framework of the conceptual model included advising and mentorship, research, recruitment, and enrichment, these components radiate into projects and activities: learning communities, research experiences for undergraduates, summer enrichment institute, and College Bridge opportunities. The projects and activities are encompassed by guided pathways to success and broadening participation; emphasizing the need to increase underrepresented minorities.&nbsp; In spite of all the other components of the conceptual model, intrusive advising is the central force which binds the model.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Intrusive advising is defined as action-oriented; involving motivating students to seek help when needed. Intrusive (Proactive or Intentional) advising: (mentoring; enrichment; academic enhancement, accountability, and advising; social, and economic resources, academic monitoring; progress reports; study plans; time management; social enhancement (social accountability). It is essential to 1) teach students to seek help when they need it, and before it&rsquo;s too late<strong>;</strong> 2) Increase the Cognitive Bandwidth [familial, socio-economic barriers, cultural norm (racial stereotypes, gender bias)]; and 3) improve academic self-efficacy [Improving mathematics self-efficacy (enhanced study skills, peer support, peer tutoring, social accountability, academic accountability), faculty support, enhanced research skills, time management, academic engagement, and social/academic engagement].</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/03/2017<br>      Modified by: Bruce&nbsp;Crawford</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1137594/1137594_10118863_1507056143069_STEMlearningcommunity--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1137594/1137594_10118863_1507056143069_STEMlearningcommunity--rgov-800width.jpg" title="STEM Scholar Learning Community"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1137594/1137594_10118863_1507056143069_STEMlearningcommunity--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="STEM Scholar Learning Community"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2-Pi STEM Scholar Learning Community</div> <div class="imageCredit">Calvin Briggs</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Bruce&nbsp;Crawford</div> <div class="imageTitle">STEM Scholar Learning Community</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1137594/1137594_10118863_1507055718337_CenterforExcellenceinSTEMProgram1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1137594/1137594_10118863_1507055718337_CenterforExcellenceinSTEMProgram1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Center of Excellence in STEM"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1137594/1137594_10118863_1507055718337_CenterforExcellenceinSTEMProgram1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Center of Excellence in STEM"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dedication of the Center of Excellence in STEM</div> <div class="imageCredit">Calvin Briggs</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Bruce&nbsp;Crawford</div> <div class="imageTitle">Center of Excellence in STEM</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1137594/1137594_10118863_1507055983429_conceptualmodel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1137594/1137594_10118863_1507055983429_conceptualmodel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Briggs Conceptual Model"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1137594/1137594_10118863_1507055983429_conceptualmodel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Briggs Conceptual Model"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Briggs Conceptual Model</div> <div class="imageCredit">Calvin Briggs</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Bruce&nbsp;Crawford</div> <div class="imageTitle">Briggs Conceptual Model</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
