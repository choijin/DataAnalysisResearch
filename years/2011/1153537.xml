<AbstractNarration>This proposal award provides funding to support the travel costs of six U.S. researchers to participate in a workshop in Bandung, Indonesia, in January 2012.  The workshop is intended to develop a strategic plan for a new continental drilling project in Lake Towuti, Sulawesi, Indonesia, and will involve researchers from Indonesia, Canada, and Europe as well as the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The geological record at Lake Towuti provides a unique opportunity to reconstruct climate change over multiple glacial-interglacial cycles in the Western Pacific, at the origin of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Drilling in Lake Towuti will identify the age and origin of the lake, the environmental and climatic context that shaped the evolution of its ecosystem, and changes in its geomicrobiology in response to climate variations over the past 60,000 years. This workshop will lay the groundwork for a major international research study that will yield important information about the atmospheric convection over Central Indonesia, which influences strongly the global atmospheric heat and water balances. The major costs of the workshop will be covered by the International Continental Drilling Program, which is based in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;Participation in this workshop by the U.S. researchers will ensure their access to the planned research and catalyze new intellectual collaborations of American faculty and students with their Indonesian counterparts by developing jointly the first scientific drilling project in the Western Pacific. Data generated by this program will contribute to a better understanding of global climate change over the centuries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded a planning workshop to organize future scientific research by US, Indonesian, and other international scientists on Lake Towuti, one of the largest lakes in Indonesia.  Lake Towuti provides many opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborative science.  Lake Towuti is a large tectonic lake at the downstream end of the Malili lake system, a set of five, ancient lakes located in central Sulawesi, Indonesia.  The sediments accumulating on the bottom of Lake Towuti may provide one of the longest records of past climate and environmental change from the tropical Western Pacific region, heart of the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation. Lake Towuti is home to a great many endemic fish, snails, and other lake-dwelling organisms, and is surrounded by one of the most diverse tropical forests on Earth making it a hotspot of Southeast Asian biodiversity. The metal-rich rocks and lateritic soils surrounding Lake Towuti provide ferruginous metal substrates that feed a diverse, exotic microbial community in the lake and its sediments, potentially similar to the microbial ecosystems that operated in ancient oceans and on Mars.  The key goal of this workshop was to plan to drill new long sediment cores from the bottom of Lake Towuti to reconstruct long-term climate and environmental change in this unique ecosystem.     To this end, this award helped support a workshop held in Bandung, Indonesia, in March 2012 attended by over sixty scientists from nine countries.  Over four days workshop participants reviewed existing datasets from Lake Towuti, developed priorities for future scientific research on the lake, and developed a plan for scientific drilling operations in Towuti, now tentatively planned for 2015.  This workshop catalyzed a number of important new collaborations between US, Indonesian, and other international researchers for interdisciplinary research on climate and environmental change in Indonesia, and built a new interdisciplinary science team to pursue future scientific drilling in Lake Towuti.     This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.
