<AbstractNarration>This award to Professor Andrei Vedernikov at the University of Maryland at College Park is to study the reactivity of a number of new organoplatinum(II) and organopalladium(II) compounds that activate alkynes and arylimines with oxygen and hydrogen peroxide in aqueous media.  This study focuses on the structure-reactivity relationships for organometallic oxidation and C-X reductive elimination, which are of fundamental importance for developing selective platinum- and palladium-mediated catalytic reactions.  The reactivity of some monohydrocarbyl platinum(IV) and monohydrocarbyl palladium(IV) complexes with respect to C-X bond reductive elimination will be characterized in detail in aqueous media, including kinetics studies and DFT modeling. New chelating semilabile ligands will be developed for the catalytic selective aerobic oxidation of olefins and alkynes in aqueous media.  A recently discovered catalytic reaction involving Pd- catalyzed CH- hydroxylation of arylimines with hydrogen peroxide, will be subjected to a detailed mechanistic analysis and its substrate scope expanded.  The feasibility of new catalytic processes, such as oxidative CH fluorination with O2 as the oxidant and oxidative coupling of ethane and benzene, will also be explored.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge of structure-reactivity relationships for reactions involving oxygen and hydrogen peroxide as oxidants, water as solvent and organopalladium(II) and organoplatinum(II) complexes as substrates will be valuable for the development of new selective and efficient "green" synthetic protocols.  An important outcome of this research is the professional training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.  Summer research students from the ACS SEED program and local high schools will be involved.  Undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in Maryland and at the University of Maryland will participate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific merit:   The use of environmentally benign reagents such as oxygen (O2) from air or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in "waste-free" chemical transformations is becoming more and more important for chemistry as the world population, life expectations and environmental challenges grow and as natural resources become more depleted. Our future may be closely tied up to these trends and our important goal today is to face these challenges.  In this project our efforts were focused on the development of new Pd and Pt &ndash; based catalysts for transformation of organic compounds to value &ndash; added chemicals utilizing environmentally benign reagents, oxygen from air and hydrogen peroxide.  To that end we have studied fundamentals of the reactivity involving O2 and H2O2 activation by Pd and Pt compounds and  1)      developed Pd-based catalysts for preparation of carbazoles, valuable pharmaceutical compounds, starting from anilines and using H2O2 as the only oxidant. Water is the only by-product in this chemistry;  2)     developed novel Pt-based catalysts for oxidation of NaBH4 and similar borohydrides with O2. These efficient and fast reactions may find applications in the production of light-weight energy-efficient portable fuel cells that use borohydrides as a fuel and O2 from air as oxidant;  3)      discovered an unprecedented and efficient Pt-mediated reaction allowing to oxidize organoboron compounds with O2 to produce olefins, valuable organic products, containing new C=C bond;  4)    discovered a photo-induced oxidation of compounds with PdII-CH3 bond with O2 in water to produce MeOH and C2H6 in controllable ratios. These results may lay a foundation for photochemical functionalization of methane with O2 as oxidant allowing to upgrade methane from natural gas to value-added ethane or methanol.  5)    demonstrated a proof-of-concept Pt-based complexes suitable for oxidation with O2 of hydrocarbons of oil and/or natural gas to produce more complex value-added organic products.     Broader impacts:   The PI and his research group have been involved in a range of outreach activities on a regular basis. Some most important activities are listed below:  1) Every year since 2010 the PI research group has been participating in the ACS SEED program for high school students from low income families. The PI and his research group members introduced the SEED program students to the world of chemical research by integrating them into the group and involving them in work on our some most successful research projects during an 8-week summer period. Most of the PI group alumni, former SEED students, have pursued their further undergraduate education in STEM field in Colleges, including the University of Maryland.  2) The PI and his graduate students have made critical contributions to the organization and success of the 44th International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) in July of 2012. The theoretical and practical examinations of this IChO were developed, organized and hosted at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of the University of Maryland, College Park. The Olympiad involved 287 IChO high school students &ndash; participants from 73 countries selected among the very best in each of the participating nations. The PI served as the Scientific Committee Co-Chair and as a member of the International Jury of this 44th IChO in July of 2012. The 44th IChO was only the second IChO hosted in the USA in the history of the Olympiad, 20 years after the 24th IChO in the Pittsburg-Washington, DC area. The organization of the 44th IChO in the USA helped raise the prestige and visibility of science education in this country, especially in the field of chemistry. The 44th IChO and the activity of the Scientific Committee were highlighted in several issues of Chemical &amp; Engineering News in 2012.  3) Working in a tight collaboration with Prof. Shannon Stahl (University of Wisconsin), the PI has organized a Symposium "Hydrogen Peroxide a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
