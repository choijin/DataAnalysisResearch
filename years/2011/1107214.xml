<AbstractNarration>The University of West Florida proposes an ADVANCE PAID project that focuses on diversifying the faculty.  Recognizing that for the first time in the institution's history, the proportion of students of color has exceeded the proportion of faculty of color, the institution seeks to build a program for enhancing a supporting and inclusive culture for recruiting, retaining and advancing women faculty in the STEM disciplines.  Central to this goal are several specific objectives that include: promoting a more diverse applicant pool, increasing the number of women hired and retained, providing professional development for women faculty and leadership opportunity, and educating current institution administrators on the value of diversity.  These objectives are indicated within the proposal and the project to have special attention and relevancy to women of color.  Also germane to the goal of this project is a conceptual framework that is rooted in positive psychological capital.  As such, the project focuses on both the individual member of faculty and the entire institution the employs these faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This project blends two social science theories, positive psychological capital and social/ecological systems theory, that focus on enhancing understanding of gender equity at the individual and organizational levels.  Specific activities are adapted from successful ADVANCE models and applied in a unique way to a comprehensive institution.  As a result of this project, important information detailing paths to gender equity at non research intensive institutions will be gained and disseminated across the country.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;Because of the focus of this project on comprehensive, non research intensive institutions, the University of West Florida ADVANCE PAID project will have a dramatic impact on promoting gender equity at all institutions of similar type in the US.  This is particularly significant given the disproportionately high number of women faculty who are employed at these institution types.</AbstractNarration>

Goal 2: Establishing Recruitment and Retention Policies and Procedures to Enhance Diversity of Faculty: Dr. JoAnn Moody facilitated the Diversity, Recruiting, Hiring, Mentoring, and Retention workshops for deans, chairs, administrators and faculty aimed at engaging them in hands-on use of best practices for diversity recruitment and hiring. The STRIDE Task Force 1) developed and distributed the "DOs" of Recruitment and Hiring for Diversity to be used by search committees, 2) worked with Administration and UFF to facilitate paid parental leave benefits, 3) developed and disseminated report on recommendations for enhancing recruitment and retention of women and Members of Underrepresented Racial and Ethnic Groups (MUREGs). The PI team supported efforts to establish Office of Equity, Diversity, and International Affairs (OEDIA), to appoint UWF?s first Chief Diversity Officer, Dr. Kim LeDuff, establish the UWF Parent Association and co-hosted a public lecture on Work Life Balance, given by Dr. Valerie Morganson.
