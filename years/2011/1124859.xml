<AbstractNarration>An International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) between two laboratories in the area of fluorine chemistry, one from the inorganic side - Professor Joseph Thrasher of Clemson University and the other from the organic side - Professor Günter Haufe of the University of Münster, Germany, funded by the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program of NSF's Chemistry Division (with contribution from the Office of International Science and Engineering) and its German counterpart the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), seeks to advance transformative research in the emerging field of pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5) chemistry.  This research activity involves developing new or improved synthetic routes to key SF5-containing building blocks as well as using these building blocks to introduce the SF5 group into complex organic structures, energetic materials, and polymers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluorine has a prestigious position in many areas of organic chemistry with products involved in everyday life, e.g., medicinal and agrochemicals, as well as novel materials.  The development of viable methods for the simple introduction of the SF5 group into organic compounds could enhance the likelihood of obtaining materials with improved performance in many areas of application.  Broader impacts include the development of a pipeline of motivated, interested students prepared to undertake careers in STEM disciplines, particularly in the field of fluorine chemistry.  Along with the scientific exchange, the cultural and language exchange during this research is expected to result in the dissemination of this work to the general public.</AbstractNarration>

The combined efforts of their two laboratories were more readily able to make significant advances in this field by combining different, yet complimentary expertise from the areas of inorganic and organic fluorine chemistry.&nbsp; Although simple fluorine (F) or trifluoromethyl (CF<sub>3</sub>) substituents appear in 25-35% of the current major pharmaceutical and agrochemicals, applications of compounds containing the pentafluorosulfanyl (SF<sub>5</sub>) substituent or functional group are only starting to emerge.&nbsp; One of the overarching goals of this project was to facilitate the emergence of such utilization of the SF<sub>5</sub> group by providing the scientific community with improved routes or access to SF<sub>5</sub>-containing building blocks or starting materials.</p> <p class="p1">With respect to scientific progress, three new and improved routes to the carboxylic acid SF<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>C(O)OH were discovered.&nbsp; The carboxylic acid functional group or &ndash;C(O)OH is one of the most important in terms of utility in all of organic chemistry.&nbsp; As shown in Images 1 and 2, a large variety of additional SF<sub>5</sub>-containing building blocks and heterocycles can be prepared from this starting material, and our collaborators in Muenster were able to prepare even more elaborate organic structures from the starting materials that we provided.&nbsp; In addition, examination of the solid-state structures of several SF<sub>5</sub>-containing and related compounds by X-ray crystallography (a technique that basically gives one a &lsquo;picture&rsquo; of the arrangement of the atoms as shown by the example SF<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>C(O)O<sup>-</sup>Ag<sup>+</sup> in Image 3) has revealed a few interesting close contacts or non-bonded attractions between neighboring silver (Ag) atoms to sometimes even neighboring fluorine atoms.&nbsp; In addition to the aforementioned carboxylic acid building block, many other related and useful SF<sub>5</sub>-containing starting materials have been prepared at Clemson [e.g., SF<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>C(O)OH, SF<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>I, SF<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>H, SF<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>I, SF<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>Br, SF<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>H, and others), which have been successfully utilized by both research groups (American and German) to yield sufficiently impactful findings to result in two book chapters, nine peer-reviewed scientific publications, and numerous abstracts for oral and poster presentations given at either scientific conference, universities, or major fluorochemical companies.&nbsp; It is anticipated that five to ten additional scientific articles will eventually be published from research that was begun under the project.</p> <p class="p1">The research at Clemson University also involved the use of specialized facilities as represented by the example of our hazards laboratory for working safely with the monomer of PFTE (polytetrafluoroethylene) or what many call Teflon<sup>&acirc;</sup>.&nbsp; Although most persons are aware of the fact that PTFE has many useful properties and applications, many may not know that it&rsquo;s monomer tetrafluoroethylene (TFE, CF<sub>2</sub>=CF<sub>2</sub>) can be&nbsp; extremely hazardous to work with, unless one has the proper facilities, equipment, and experience (please see Image 4).&nbsp; In fact, TFE is used as a reactant in our preferred route to SF<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>C(O)OH (Image 1) as well as a co-monomer in the preparation of other new fluoropolymers that are just now coming from the efforts on this project.&nbsp;</p> <p class="p1">A diverse team of scientists at all levels of training have worked on the project, and twice over the course of four years, the team gather either in Muenster, Germany or Clemson, South Carolina for joint workshops that not only focused on scientific exchange and team-building skills, but cultural and language exchanges as well.&nbsp; Parts of the research results obtained either have or will appear in at least five dissertations or thesis from the American side and three from the German side.&nbsp; Many undergraduate research students at Clemson also benefitted from working on the project and have gone on to either take jobs in the local/regional chemical industry or pursue advanced studies in either medicine, dentistry, chemistry, or engineering, while the special training afforded the graduate students has led to gainful employment at both minor and major fluorochemical companies for several of these students.</p> <p>Recently, phenomenal growth has been witnessed in the area of SF<sub>5</sub>-chemistry.&nbsp; The SF<sub>5</sub> substituent group has been labeled by others as &lsquo;a modern functional group for the future,&rsquo; and we would like to think that we have played a significant part in the recent rise in interest in this group.&nbsp; Basically, just like we and our co-workers have been able to conquer very challenging problems in expanding the synthetic chemistry of SF<sub>5</sub>-substituted compounds, Thrasher, Haufe, and their co-workers were able to &lsquo;scale-the-mountain&rsquo;
