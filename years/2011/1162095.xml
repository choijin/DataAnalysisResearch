<AbstractNarration>This project, developing advanced mathematical and computational methods for the online calibration of ultrasound probes that takes into account a probabilistic version of the well-known AX = XB sensor-calibration problem that has been overlooked in the robotics and computer vision literature, will advance current capabilities in computer-integrated surgical interventions, leading to lower radiation exposure to patients and better outcomes for minimally-invasive surgery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultrasound has many benefits for minimally-invasive surgical procedures, including cost, ease-of-use, and patient/doctor radiation exposure. But ultrasound images are fuzzy and require extensive training for proper use during surgical procedures. As a result, outcomes are heavily dependent on an individual surgeon's skill with the device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Beyond the potential benefits to surgical procedures, the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR) at JHU has an established summer program for visiting undergraduate students that will facilitate involvement of undergraduates in the proposed research. In addition, the PI continues to mentor high school students from Baltimore Polytechnic High School through research experiences both during the academic year and the summer. The hands-on and visual nature of ultrasound image acquisition together with the mathematical problems of registration and calibration make this an ideal project to introduce students to the importance of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:   The application that motivated this study was to perform automated online calibration of ultrasound sensors used in conjunction with medical robots in order to ensure that data collected during an ultrasound sweep is registered correctly. The new theory developed during this grant was demonstrated on a physical test setup consisting of a state-of-the-art 3D ultrasound probe and a selection of tissue-substitutes made of non-biological gel materials.   Moreover, the methods developed during this award for the ultrasound calibration problem were generalized to include application such as multi-robot coordination.  Unlike previous methods on kinematic hand-eye calibration published over the past 30 years, the methods developed in this project do not require temporal synchronization. This is a big benefit in coordinating multiple pieces of equipment provided by different manufacturers in computer-integrated surgical system scenarios. It is also means that in the completely different scenario of multi-mobile-robot coordination, it is possible to do calibration without a common clock.  Broader Impact:   The broader impact of this project came in three forms: (1) the techniques developed led to algorithms that will advance current capabilities in computer-integrated surgical intervention which in turn are expected to  have tangible impact on the lives of people with cancer of the breast, prostate, liver, and kidney; (2) This grant brought together a theoretician/math modeler at Johns Hopkins University and an applied researcher from the radiology department at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and serves as an example of how such researchers can work together (3) Undergraduates from JHU and high-school students from Baltimore Polytechnic High School were involved in the project through research experiences both during the academic year and the summer. The hands-on and visual nature of ultrasound image acquisition together with the mathematical problems of registration and calibration made this an ideal project to introduce students to the importance of mathematics in the real world.  This project has been fabulously successful in terms of professional development. At different times seven PhD students were partially supported on this project. All of these individuals have gone on to high tech jobs in the USA. And the high-school students involved in the project have all gone on to study engineering in college.
