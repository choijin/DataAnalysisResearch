<AbstractNarration>Dr. Barbra Meek (University of Michigan) and Dr. Susan Philips (University of Arizona) will convene a planning workshop to develop a training program in anthropological methods of discourse analysis for documenting and analyzing social interactions. Discourse analysis is particularly valued in studies of the way ideas emerge, circulate and are transformed in the interactional process and in studies of the nature and organization of interpretive diversity.  Cultural anthropologists are increasingly turning to discourse analysis as a form of data analysis that will give them insight into the nature of culture.  Similarly, linguists are increasingly turning to discourse analysis as a method that will help them analyze socially embedded linguistic practices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-day workshop, to be held in the Spring of 2012, will bring together linguists and anthropologists skilled in discourse analysis to discuss the best pedagogical practices for teaching how to do discourse analysis and the logistics necessary for carrying out the training program, which will be held initially in conjunction with the Summer 2013 Linguistics Institute at the University of Michigan, which is organized by the Linguistic Society of America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training in anthropological discourse analysis will ultimately provide cultural and linguistic anthropologists, sociolinguists, and others with useful methodological tools that will strengthen the overall scientific merit of the research they conduct.  The project will stimulate linguistic anthropologists to speak and write about method more and to share their analytic approach with those disciplines with which linguistic anthropology engages in methodological discussions.  The workshop will also provide an important opportunity for interdisciplinarity and collaboration between scholars in Anthropology and Linguistics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is a growing interest in cultural research that involves 1) characterizing how diverse interpretations are managed in and through discourse (language), and 2) characterizing the practices involved in creating, reproducing, and disseminating these interpretations through discourse (language).  The planning and implementation of such research can be strengthened by greater knowledge of the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of discourse analysis as practiced by linguistic anthropologists.  As a first step toward strengthening this area of research, we proposed and held a planning workshop at the University of Michigan in May 2012 to bring together leading linguistic anthropologists who have documented culture in discourse (language) using a range of methods and techniques.  Our goal was to develop a training workshop in anthropological discourse analysis that would be offered annually for researchers interested in developing these skills and that could serve as a model for others interested in this type of research.     As a result of the workshop, a google.docs site was created for sharing and compiling a range of source materials from articles and book citations to our individual course designs for teaching methods in discourse analysis.  With future funding, we hope to create a public website that anyone might access.  Another outcome of the workshop was an invited special panel on linguistic anthropological methods at the American Anthropological Association meetings in November 2012 and conversations with the current editor of the lead journal in linguistic anthropology about developing a special methods section for the journal.  The first methodological piece for this journal, written by Dr. Philips, has just been published.        The broader impacts of the planning workshop are two-fold.  First, the workshop was aimed at disseminating linguistic anthropological theory and methods in discourse analysis to a wider audience of researchers interested in documenting cultural processes, providing them with useful methodological tools that would strengthen the overall quality of research concerned with interpretive perspectives of the people who are the focus of the research.  The project has also stimulated linguistic anthropologists to speak and write about method more and to share their analytic approach with those disciplines with which linguistic anthropology engages in discussion.    While the training of researchers benefits society, a second contribution is how this methodological approach advances our understanding of communicative differences.  Through these growing discussions of method among researchers focused on analyzing discourse, culture, and language, we have begun to articulate more clearly the importance and rigor of such qualitative research for understanding human nature, especially how we interact and understand, or misunderstand, one another.    By adding methodological rigor to such investigations,  we can better recognize and address the needs of clients being served by professionals.
