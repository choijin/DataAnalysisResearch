<AbstractNarration>California State University at Bakersfield (CSUB) will initiate a new Center for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) to conduct important research related to water resources in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California as well as to study potential sites and technologies for carbon sequestration in that region.  The Center activities, both research and educational, will lead to enhancements in student-involved, state of the art research and faculty productivity at a major California state university that serves student populations that are historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines.  Students will be recruited from the southern San Joaquin Valley as part of their education and developing aspirations to continue into Ph.D. programs in the geosciences, mathematics, and/or engineering. The goals will be realized principally through ample student financial support, the release of faculty from a heavy teaching load, enhanced laboratory facilities/equipment, and a center organizational structure that will foster research productivity and networking of subproject faculty and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific research activities will be conducted through four synergistic subprojects, that include&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) runoff forecasts for the four Sierran rivers that are responsible for most of the natural water supplies of the southern San Joaquin Valley, a globally important agricultural center,  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) statistical modeling of timing of Sierran snowpack accumulation and melt to better understand its spatial distribution with respect to historical changes in temperature and precipitation, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c) subsurface mapping of available storage space and baseline physical characteristics (i.e., lithology) associated with three declining petroleum reservoirs that are candidates for carbon sequestration and enhanced recovery using carbon dioxide, and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d) laboratory injections of supercritical carbon dioxide into samples of the candidate reservoir rocks to constrain expected chemical reactions and their effect on the success of sequestration efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will be strongly committed to educating and graduating B.S. and M.S.-level scientists effectively recruited from a abundant pool of minority students already enrolled at CSUB, in local junior colleges and high schools. In doing so, the center will leverage existing, successful recruitment programs already set up by the host department and school that are funded by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Education, and local industry, principally Chevron, USA. Finally, the center will serve as a focus of research in a critical agricultural and petroleum resource area and, as such, will collaborate with a large population of researchers in industry, Ph.D.-granting institutions, and government agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The CSUB CREST will develop model pathways of how basic research at a regional comprehensive university such as CSUB can directly contribute to important societal decisions regarding water resource planning and site selection for carbon sequestration projects.  The investigators of all four projects are published in the relevant disciplines and have experience with similar projects either at CSUB or at their Ph.D.-granting institutions and have a strong track record of involving students in research. Creative approaches are being proposed that may very well lead to transformative concepts such as the application of functional data regression models to space-time measurements of continuous processes in several of the other sciences and the use of connections between paleo-lake level and regional sea surface paleo-temperature records to make meaningful estimates of changes in river discharge in response to anticipated climate change. The instruments and lab facilities required for the proposed research are already present in the well-equipped CSUB Department of Geological Sciences, or are available at cooperating research institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Approximately 100 students from the San Joaquin Valley will be directly involved in the research subprojects as an integral part of an instructional program, after which most will emerge from CSUB eligible for matriculation into graduate school at the Ph.D. level. The best performing students will be awarded research assistantships, tuition and travel funds. With these resources, a vanguard of CSUB students involved in the research projects associated with this award will perform at a high academic level and will graduate on time because they will be freed from working long hours at jobs unrelated to their career aspirations while going to school, a common problem for the socioeconomically disadvantaged students of the CSUB service region. Also as a result of this support many bright students will be attracted to the program, who otherwise would choose non-STEM majors to avoid the extra time commitment demanded by lab-intensive science and mathematics courses. The enhanced research environment and the resultant increases in productivity and dissemination of results will foster networks and partnerships with employees and owners of agricultural and petroleum companies and government officials. This will lead to additional funding opportunities, and hence, contribute to center sustainability. Scientific results important to society will result, including estimates of amount and timing of snowmelt/runoff into a major agricultural center and the volumetric, baseline rock characterization and predicted geochemical evolution of reservoir rocks from the region that have been proposed for carbon sequestration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central goals of this project at California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB), were to (i) conduct research leading to the mitigation of the effects of anticipated climate change on the people, industry, and environment of the San Joaquin Valley, CA, and (ii) provide students the opportunity and resources to conduct meaningful and impactful research as part of their education experience.  Our goals were addressed through the establishment of a research center at CSUB that integrated research and education for undergraduate and graduate students.  Efforts by center faculty and students directly impacted forecasts and anticipated changes of water resources over the next several decades, as well as developing criteria and techniques for site selection and monitoring of declining petroleum reservoirs and other sites for geological carbon sequestration.  Specifically, a paleoclimate record of precipitation and stream discharge for the past 15,000 years suggest that global warming may increase the precipitation in the southern Sierra Nevada, a region for which precipitation forecasts have been uncertain. Our results also show that important features of the Sierra Nevada snowpack are changing in response to changes in climate, and as a result, have led to precipitation measurement biases in Sierra Nevada snowpack studies to be more profound over time.  The findings and data produced from these studies are now being used by researchers to better understand the future of the Sierra Nevada snowpack in response to climate change.   Our research on water resources directly impacts the southern Central Valley of California because the terminal basin for most of this precipitation is one of the most important agricultural regions in the world.  Further, mature petroleum reservoirs have been identified as suitable sites for carbon sequestration. This contributes to the available space to sequester carbon and, is thus, of societal interest.  The characterization of potential carbon sequestration reservoirs is on-going, and the associated work on the behavior of reservoir materials under laboratory-scale CO2 injections continues to provide an important baseline study for future CO2 injection projects, likely a necessary component in the mix of global warming mitigation practices. This work is important to the future economic health of the San Joaquin Valley in anticipation of carbon capture and sequestration as a possible replacement industry for petroleum extraction.  The center's procurement of funding to significantly improve the research and learning infrastructure of CSUB through acquisition of computing resources, laboratory equipment, and geochemical/geophysical instruments provided the necessary foundation for students and faculty to actively engage in research. The fields involved in this project at CSUB are now considered among the best equipped relative to other small programs in the country and serve as a model on how to effectively address shortcomings in infrastructure.  Most importantly, through this work, our students from the San Joaquin Valley, who are primarily underrepresented minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged, or first-generation students, were provided the opportunity and resources to conduct place-appropriate research on important societal problems that have a direct impact locally and nationally.
