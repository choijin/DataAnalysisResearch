<AbstractNarration>In this project, research in the algorithm design and analysis of high order numerical methods, including the finite difference and finite volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes and discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods, for solving hyperbolic and other convection dominated partial  differential equations, will be carried out.  While the emphasis of this project is on algorithm design and analysis, close attention will be paid to efficient parallel implementation and applications. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in its comprehensive coverage of algorithm development, analysis, implementation and applications.  Problems in applications motivate the design of new algorithms or new features in existing algorithms; mathematics tools are used to analyze these algorithms to give guidelines for their applicability and limitations; practical considerations including parallel implementation issues are addressed to make the algorithms competitive in large scale calculations; and collaborations with engineers and other applied scientists enable the efficient application of these new algorithms or new featuresin existing algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity will be a suite of powerful computational tools, suitable for various applications with involving convection dominated partial differential equations, in adaptive, multiscale and uncertain environments.  These tools are expected to make positive contributions to computer simulations of the complicated solution structure in these applications.  The application areas include (but are not limited to) computational fluid dynamics, traffic flow problems, semiconductor device simulations, and computational biology. Graduate students will be involved in this project, and will get training in performing mathematics research on problems closely related to applications.  Special attention will be paid to the recruitment and training of Ph.D. students from under-represented groups including women.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF project is for the research on the design, analysis and application of robust, stable and efficient computer algorithms for solving partial differential equations arising from scientific and engineering applications.  Mathematical analysis and tools play a key role in this effort.  The algorithms designed or improved include high order accurate finite difference, finite element, and other methods, with applications in computational fluid dynamics, computational cosmology, computational biology and computational semiconductor devices.  51 papers have been published or accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals as a result of this project.  The algorithms designed or improved have been used by engineers and scientists in other disciplines in their computer simulations in science and engineering.  The PI has supervised 9 Ph.D. students and 1 postdoc at Brown University during the period of this project.  All these young scientists benefited from the courses, group meetings and other activities organized by the PI.  The NSF grant also provided research assistantship support to one of these Ph.D. students.  6 Ph.D. students supervised by the PI have obtained their Ph.D. degrees from Brown University during this period.  Among them, one is now a tenure track assistant professor at a research university in US, two are working in research and development jobs in US companies, and three are working as postdocs at US research universities.  The PI has been invited to give lectures in many universities and conferences, and he has been attempting to organize these lectures so that they are accessible to not only experts but also students with suitable scientific background, to attract more American students to pursue study and career in applied mathematics.
