<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  Support from the NSF Catalyzing New International Collaborations Program will establish a new collaboration between two groups who have developed different methods for studying the stereodynamics of elastic and inelastic rotational energy transfer (RET): the Halpern group at Howard University in Washington, DC and the McKendrick-Costen group at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland.  The expertise and instrumentation at Howard and Heriot Watt are complementary.  The award will support travel of Prof. Halpern and students to Heriot-Watt to undertake proof of concept experiments.  The goal is to prepare oriented samples of vibrationally excited, ground state CN radicals using simulated emission pumping and probe the prepared states by frequency modulated transient absorption spectroscopy.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project brings together two groups that have contributed to the study of collisional polarization transfer and quenching.  The collaboration will substantially advance our understanding of this basic process, which is a severe test of the ability to calculate potential energy surfaces and carry out dynamics on them.  It will provide qualitative insights in areas such as atmospheric and combustion chemical dynamics where small radical energy transfer and reactions are basic.  Both sides of the collaboration view this preliminary work which will support further proposals, publications and student training.  &lt;br/&gt;The international nature of the collaboration advances NSF?s goal of global science.  Howard University is an HBCU, serving African Americans and with a substantial number of international students of African descent.  The new collaboration, involvement of Howard students in the research visits and the opportunities for them that will grow out of the collaboration in the future will support NSF goal of growing participation from groups that are under-represented in STEM fields in the US as well as having a global outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The transfer of energy in molecular collisions plays an important role in many basic and important processes including combustion and atmospheric chemistry. The stereodynamics of the collision, roughly the orientation of the molecules relative to each other, is a basic determinant of the process. Measurements of detailed energy transfer and collisional stereodynamics is difficult. Over the years a few simple systems have been extensively used to explore these processes. Among them are the collisions of CN radicals with rare gases and other molecules.  The two groups involved in this project, at Howard University in Washington DC and Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland have developed complementary methods of studying CN collision dynamics. This project represented an interchange of ideas and techniques between the groups.  The Howard group pioneered laser induced fluorescence measurements of CN radicals, measured the radiative properties and energy transfer in the electronically excited CN radicals and established a number of CN photolytic radical sources. The Heriot Watt group has pioneered FM modulation spectroscopy as a tool for investigating stereodynamics of CN and haspublished many recent studies using this method.  A measure of the detailed nature of such studies can be gathered from a result of this project (McGurk, et al., J. Phys. Chem. A. 2014 118 2007).   Experiments at this level are strong tests of theory (or conversely, the theory can be a strong test of these difficult experiments).  We used a laser to populate individual quantum states of the radical with well defined rotational and vibrational quantum numbers in the CN A2&Pi; excited state. Emission from CN A2&Pi; can be seen in flames and in comets. We used FM modulation spectroscopy to measure how quickly collisions with with N2, O2, and CO2 depopulated the initially excited state and the probability of the collision populating other rotational levels in the same vibrational state.  The total removal cross sections lie in the order CO2 &gt; N2 &gt; O2, with evidence for substantial electronic, in the case of CO2 or in the case of O2, reactive quenching of CN A2&Pi;, &nu; = 4) to unobserved products. This is supported by the magnitude of the state-to-state RET cross sections, where a deficit of transferred population is apparent for CO2 and O2.  There is a strong propensity for the molecular wavefunction to retain its parity for all three colliders. Spin-orbit-changing cross sections are approximately half of those of the respective conservingprocesses. These results are in marked disagreement with previous experimental observations with N2 as a collider but are in good agreement with quantum scattering calculations from the same study ( Khachatrian et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 2009 , 113 , 3922 ). Our results with CO2 as a collider are similarly in strong disagreement with a related experimental study ( Khachatrian et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 2009 , 113 , 13390 ). We therefore proposed that the previous experiments substantially underestimated the spin-orbit-changing cross sections for collisions with both N2 and CO2, suggesting that even approximate quantum scattering calculations may be more successful for such molecule-molecule systems than was previously concluded.  Other outcomes include preliminary data using FM modulation spectroscopy to study collisional dynamics of highly excited rotational levels of ground state CN X2S produced in the 193 nm photolysis of BrCN.    We have measured previously unobserved two photon UV excitation spectra of CN that may offer a useful path to ionize CN radicals.  This may have a broader impact on Ion imaging experiments, which have become the most used method for studying stereodynamics, just as CN radicals have long played an exemplary role in stereodynamics studies using laser induced fluorescence (LIF).  However, ion imaging techniques have not been demonstrated for CN radicals because of the high lying ionization...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
