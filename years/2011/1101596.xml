<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to investigate the relationships between dynamical systems, spectral theory, mathematical physics, and number theory, in the context of quantum chaos.  The general question is:  if a dynamical system exhibits chaotic behavior, how is this reflected in the quantum mechanical picture?  The "correspondence principle" suggests that properties of the classical dynamics should be reflected in the quantum system as the uncertainty tends to 0.  The Quantum Unique Ergodicity (QUE) Conjecture states that, for Riemannian manifolds of negative sectional curvature - for which the geodesic flow is highly chaotic - pure states should become equidistributed in the semiclassical limit.  However, the connection between classical dynamics and high-frequency spectral data remains very mysterious.  In fact, various models of quantum chaos show conflicting phenomena in this semiclassical limit: QUE is now known to hold in many cases under certain arithmetic assumptions, but for simpler "toy models" of quantum chaos that are not covered by the QUE conjecture, it is known that some pure states can fail to equidistribute.  It seems that some of the finer properties of the dynamics and/or spectrum are responsible for this behavior, and isolating these key properties is a main focus of this research.  In addition, it has become clear that methods from many different fields are required to shed light on this problem, and in doing so this research also aims to fortify the bridges connecting these disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For much of the last century, connections between some of these these fields (eg., between dynamical systems and number theory, or between geometry and spectral theory) have provided insight for many difficult problems, and promise to continue to do so for a long time to come.  The recent infusion of ideas from mathematical physics and ergodic theory has led to a great deal of progress in the type of difficult spectral problems described above, and being at the intersection of so many different areas of active research, the questions of quantum chaos are particularly well positioned to make contributions to a wide variety of endeavors, both in purely theoretical mathematics and in problems of an applied nature.  This also makes the projects attractive to graduate students and post-docs of different backgrounds, and part of this program is to add to the rapid growth of diverse researchers in the field through courses, seminars, and collaborations.  Thus this research aims not only to study the specific problems surrounding the QUE conjecture, but also to contribute to the rapidly growing network of connections between these important subjects of active research, and ultimately to a wide range of advances throughout the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The subjects of this project are high-frequency waves in chaotic geometry.  Though waves of high frequency are known to travel in nearly straight lines, the effects of chaos in the underlying geometry can wreak havoc on the estimates, and one can effectively study such waves only up to relatively short propagation times.  There are very deep conjectures about the long-term behavior of these waves, but very little is known.  Our project had two main components.  First, as suggested by P. Sarnak and others, we investigated the connection between frequencies of high multiplicity --- that is, when there are many waves of the same high frequency--- and failure of the waves to equidistribute.  Intuitively, the more waves of a given frequency there are, the more likely that some of them will behave badly.  We were able to show that this is indeed the case:  if one includes many waves of nearby frequencies, one can construct examples that do not equidistribute.  In fact, we were able to make this quantitative, and conjecture a sharp threshold for multiplicities, above which equidistribution fails.  We also tested this conjecture --- successfully--- in the case of Eisenstein series on the modular surface, where the arithmetic structure allows for a precise study of these special waves.  The second component of the program was to develop, compare and contrast different simplified models of quantum chaos, that are more tractable than the central objects of study.  In particular, discrete "waves" on large regular graphs provide fertile soil for such models.  In addition to developing these tools and using them to great effect in studying the role of arithmetic structure in the equidistribution of waves, we also adapted models for studying waves on other surfaces, such as the round sphere, that respect additional symmetries.  The stark contrasts between the behaviors of different models led to further conjectures about the role of various features--- eg., periodic horocycles, for one--- in proving (or preventing) equidistribution of high-frequency waves.
