<AbstractNarration>The metabolic activity of microorganisms dominates the biogeochemical evolution of the Earth over geologic time.  One of the fundamental questions facing scientists seeking to understand global biogeochemistry is: What is the relationship between microbial community composition (who¡¦s there?), metabolic activity (what are they doing?), and ambient environmental conditions (e.g., pH, sulfate levels) (how are they impacted?). Sulfur cycling, particularly the coupling between sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation, is one of the dominant geochemical pathways driving carbon mineralization within many diverse microbial ecosystems today. Isotopic and mineralogical evidence recovered from ancient rocks suggest biological sulfate reduction played an important role on early Earth as well.  In attempt to better understand this globally important process and the corresponding biosignatures of active sulfur cycling microorganisms, we are proposing a multi-disciplinary, high-resolution geochemical and molecular biological investigation of closely coupled microbial sulfur cycling in three representative microbial ecosystems. These include a 3-4 member synergistic anoxygenic phototrophic consortium, moderately diverse chemosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing mats, and highly complex benthic oxygenic photosynthetic microbial mats. These systems differ in terms of biological complexity and in the major sulfur cycling pathways, that collectively will provide fundamental information regarding light-dependent and -independent sulfur metabolisms.  Our work combines analyses at high spatial (?Ým-scale) resolution of sulfur and carbon isotopic data using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and FISH-nanoSIMS, microvoltammetic sulfur species measurements, and CARD-FISH molecular imaging to investigate the linkage among microbial spatial organization, metabolic activity, and establishment of geochemical gradients by coupled sulfur cycling communities. Together, the data from this combined laboratory and field study will develop a new toolset that can be used to study tightly coupled sulfur cycling on an unprecedented scale within microbially dominated sedimentary environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will inform scientists about the fundamental chemistry and biology governing sulfur in the environment, past and present.  This is important because sulfur plays a critical role in processes controlling not only how we view the evolution of life on this planet, but also about ore deposits as sources of metal resources, oil and gas formation and their economic recovery, soil nutrient availability affecting crop yields and the quality of water resources, and the transport of many contaminants in ground and surface waters.  Additionally this project will help train the next generation of scientists with the scientific and technical knowledge to work in high tech and scientific industry, research, and education fields.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project represented a multi-disciplinary study applying combinations of micron-scale geochemical and molecular analyses to investigate closely coupled biological sulfur cycling in anoxygenic phototrophic consortia (&lsquo;pink berries&rsquo;) and chemolithotrophic sulfide oxidizing microbial biofilms. Biological sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation within mats and consortia are often tightly coupled and occur on spatial and temporal scales that are difficult to resolve with conventional bulk methodologies. Here we used multiple stable isotope tracers to simultaneously follow the flow of sulfur, carbon and nitrogen within spatially proximal sulfur cycling microorganisms by FISH-nanoSIMS.&nbsp; Isotope amendments included either 34S or 33S-labeled sulfate, nitrogen-15 ammonium or nitrate, and carbon-13 labeled acetate or CO2. Natural samples of anoxygenic consortia collected from a salt marsh in Woods Hole, MA and sulfide oxidizing biofilms from a hydrothermally influenced intertidal system in White Point, CA were investigated, and described in 3 publications directly involving our research group in collaboration with co-PI&rsquo;s Jesse Dillon and David Fike (Wilbanks et al., 2014, Dawson et al., 2016, and Miranda et al., in review). Major accomplishments supported by this grant included the testing and optimization of 33S- and 34S-sulfate as a tracer for FISH-nanoSIMS experiments in sulfur cycling microbial communities, successful demonstration of application of multi-isotope labeling to single uncultured microorganisms in environmental samples for clustering microbial groups by their distinct phenotype (Dawson et al., 2016), and description of biological sulfur cycling and use of silver wire sulfide capture and secondary ion mass spectrometry to quantify micron-scale gradients in natural abundance 34S-sulfide within mm sized anoxygenic photroph pink berry consortia (Wilbanks et al., 2014). These optimized methodologies and unique, spatially resolved datasets offer geobiological insights into the timing and isotopic biosignatures associated with photo-and chemosynthesis driven sulfur cycling within structured consortia. Close connections with J. Dillon&rsquo;s lab at Calstate Long Beach also fostered cross-training, collaboration, and co-authorship of students (including underrepresented minorities) with members of the Orphan lab at Caltech.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Victoria&nbsp;Orphan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1123391/1123391_10159802_1483059801990_image1Final_report_NSF_sulfur2011--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1123391/1123391_10159802_1483059801990_image1Final_report_NSF_sulfur2011--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sulfur cycling microbial biofilms from an intertidal hydrothermal vent, White point, CA"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1123391/1123391_10159802_1483059801990_image1Final_report_NSF_sulfur2011--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sulfur cycling microbial biofilms from an intertidal hydrothermal vent, White point, CA"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image of sulfur cycling microbial biofilm assemblage, in situ colonization device, and example of FISH-nanoSIMS analysis.Modified from Dawson et al 2016.
