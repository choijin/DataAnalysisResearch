<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to exploit the non-linear behavior of soft structures with purposeful design patterns to create a new class of responsive origami-like materials that use their large deformation and dramatic geometric changes induced by instabilities to change their shape and volume. Possible and exciting applications include reversible encapsulation systems, active materials for on-demand drug delivery, rapidly expandable shelters and robots that can squeeze themselves through small openings and into tight places. Although instabilities have traditionally been viewed as an inconvenience, this proposal will show that they can be exploited to create materials with novel and switchable functionalities. For the proposed research an approach based on a powerful combination of computational analyses and experiments will be used to gain deeper insight into the non-linear behavior of soft patterned structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central goal of this effort is to promote interdisciplinary research and teaching and to increase the interactions between mechanicians, engineers, physicists and material scientists. This will be accomplished by: i) organizing an exhibition at the Harvard Museum of Natural History to promote science and engineering to a broad audience; ii) organizing the 'New England Workshop on the Mechanics of Materials and Structures' to bring together the New England mechanics community and stimulate exchange of ideas and collaborations; iii) involving students of all levels into active research projects and exposing them to concepts from engineering, material science and applied physics; iv) developing new courses with a focus on using powerful numerical techniques, such as the Finite Element Method, in a creative way to reach a broader audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although the study of the effect of shape and geometry on the mechanical response of solid objects has a long history,  the surge of modern techniques to fabricate structures of complex form  paired with our ability to simulate and better understand their response has created new opportunities for the design of architected materials with novel functionalities (also referred to as metamaterials).  My research has contributed to the design of materials with a carefully designed meso-structure that leads to novel effective behavior at the macroscale. I investigated  both mechanical and acoustic properties of such structured materials, with a particular focus on harnessing instabilities and strong geometric non-linearities to generate new modes of functionality. Since  the properties of the designed architected materials are primarily governed by the geometry of the structure (as opposed to constitutive ingredients at the material level), the principles I discover are universal and can be applied to systems over a wide range of length scales.  To achieve this goal, I have integrated theoretical, computational and experimental methods. We developed analytical and computation tools to  gain a deep understanding of the response of  architected materials. Guided by the analyses, we then designed, createed and tested materials for which the  meso-structure has a prominent role and results in novel  properties and functionalities.   Accomplishment of my research program include:  Design of architected materials that take advantage of mechanical instabilities and strong geometric non-linearities to achieve novel mechanical properties. These include negative Poisson's ratio, reversible encapsulation,  switching between achiral and chiral configurations \cite{Kang_2013} and energy trapping \cite{ShanAdv_2015}.  Design of  3D actuated origami-inspired transformable architected materials with multiple degrees of freedom.  Discovery of fluidic actuators in which snap-through instabilities enable large motion, high forces, and fast actuation at constant volume.  Design of phononic crystals   and locally resonant metamaterials  whose dynamic response is tuned and controlled by the applied deformation.  Discovery of phononic crystals with topologically nontrivial band gaps for both longitudinal and transverse polarizations, resulting in protected one-way elastic edge waves.
