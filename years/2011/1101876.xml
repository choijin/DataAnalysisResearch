<AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop novel design and analysis techniques for spatially distributed networks that exhibit a diffusive coupling structure, common in biomolecular networks and multi-agent systems. The first step in this development will be to unravel structural properties of agent dynamics and their interconnection that yield prescribed spatial behaviors, such as synchronization or pattern formation. The second step will be to enhance the desirable properties via architectural decisions. The techniques to be developed will serve biomolecular networks and multi-agent systems, as well as other applications that possess similar structures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part One of the proposal sets forth a new technique to determine which conditions guarantee synchronous behavior in diffusively coupled networks. In addition to networks of discrete agents, this technique is applicable to continuous reaction-diffusion models where synchrony means spatial homogeneity. A key research task will be to develop new system gain concepts that quantify the amount of inhomogeneity caused by the amount of spatial model variation, and to apply the results to oscillator networks and biomolecular signaling cascades. Part Two aims to induce desirable forms of de-synchronization to generate spatial patterns, which is one of the outstanding problems in synthetic biology. It proposes to employ systemtheoretic concepts to design new gene networks that are amenable to synthetic implementation and that exhibit diffusion-driven instability in prescribed spatial modes, thus leading to gene expression patterns dominated by these modes. One such topology is identified and detailed in the proposal. Part Three posits a connection between diffusion-driven instability and nonminimum-phase agent dynamics, and demonstrates that a form of this instability can occur in multi-agent systems. It then proposes to investigate the limits of achievable synchronization performance imposed by nonminimum-phase agents, and to mitigate the resulting design tradeoffs with a re-allocation of node and link weights to be performed via convex optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The PI will continue incorporating research material into graduate courses.  In addition, he will introduce selected topics from this project into two undergraduate courses.  The PI leads recruitment and mentoring of underrepresented graduate students in his department, and will make every effort to recruit a female or minority graduate student researcher for the proposed project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ability to form spatial patterns of gene expression is critical in developmental biology where initially identical cells differentiate into various cell types, forming different tissues, organs, etc.  Diffusion plays an important role in enabling such differentiation.  In other biochemical processes diffusion plays the opposite role of homogenization which is essential for circadian rhythms, insulin secretion, and cardiac function, among other examples.   How does diffusion display such rich dynamic phenomena in space and time?  This project investigated the mathematical underpinnings of this problem, providing a deeper understanding of diffusion driven phenomena in biological processes. It also revealed similar phenomena in engineering systems, such as multi-machine power systems and multi-agent robotic networks, where the physical coupling mechanisms exhibit characteristics similar to diffusion in biology.  We have developed new techniques to guide the design of such systems to enhance the desirable spatial and temporal properties.  In addition, we leveraged our results to propose a synthetic gene network that is capable of producing patterns of gene expression, thus mimicking the differentiation of cells in natural multicellular organisms. Our synthetic system is built upon an oscillator-driven gene network topology and is called a "quenched oscillator."  We provided an analysis technique that predicts the range of kinetic parameters over which patterning should emerge and demonstrated that this range covers physically realizable values.   Synthetic biology provides a clean slate in which to test fundamental design principles and to evaluate their plausibility in nature.  Thus our quenched oscillator system supports the possibility that pattern formation may arise from oscillator driven mechanisms which are indeed plenty in nature.  In addition to testing fundamental principles, the proposed synthetic system may impact biotechnology in the long run through applications in programmable materials, tissue engineering, and compartmented biosynthesis.
