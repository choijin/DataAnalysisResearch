<AbstractNarration>Recent studies show that Agulhas leakage may be increasing in response to anthropogenic climate change, which  would act to strengthen the Atlantic overturning circulation at a time when anthropogenic warming and associated ice melt are predicted to weaken it.  Evidence from paleoceanographic proxies, theory, and models indicate that the Agulhas leakage may impact the climate system on a number of time scales.  However, coupled climate models, including the IPCC models, do not resolve the dynamics that control Agulhas leakage and its impact on the Atlantic overturning circulation, and hence may be flawed in their ability to predict future climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agulhas system and its leakage of warm and salty water from the Indo-Pacific into the Atlantic represents a choke point in the global thermohaline circulation, feeding the upper arm of the strong and deep Atlantic overturning cell via a non-linear exchange of thermocline waters within Agulhas Rings, eddies, and filaments.  Coupled climate models do not simulate leakage correctly, because inertial mechanisms and Ring formation are not resolved.  Climate models also tend to overestimate the effect of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds on overturning, because of unresolved eddies.  This means the interplay between winds, leakage, and the overturning circulation may be flawed in these models.  Finally, almost all coupled climate models exhibit a northward overturning freshwater transport, while hydrographic observations point to a southward one.  This effects the sensitivity and stability of the overturning circulation in the models, and is linked to the balance between Agulhas and Antarctic inputs into the South Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A coupled climate simulation of the 20th century with one tenth degree ocean resolution will be run using the CCSM4.  For the first time, the Agulhas System and how its leakage responds to anthropogenic forcing in a coupled climate system will be examined.  The project objectives are to:  (1) diagnose the sensitivity of Agulhas leakage and the overturning circulation to changing winds in the presence of eddies versus in coarser resolution IPCC models; (2) analyze the relationship between Agulhas Current inertia, leakage strength, subtropical wind stress curl, and the latitude of the westerly wind maximum to test the constraints on leakage and whether they are as theoretical models predict; (3) isolate the response of Atlantic overturning to Agulhas leakage in the absence of a direct wind effect, and (4) consider the balance of the cold versus warm water routes into the surface arm of the overturning, its correlation with leakage, and its effect on the stability of the overturning.  One of the broader impacts of this project is to provide qualitative uncertainty estimates of the predictive capability of coarse resolution coupled climate models (especially Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change models) with respect to overturning strength and sensitivity in the presence of a resolved Agulhas leakage.  This project will also support a graduate student and a postdoc who will be mentored by both a field-going oceanographer and a climate modeler. All simulation data will be freely shared with the community for further analyses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we create a simulation of 20th century climate change using a global coupled model that is able to capture dynamic oceanic processes, such as boundary currents and eddies, for the first time. These processes, although far smaller than weather systems, have been shown to influence the atmosphere, driving feedbacks which in turn change the state of the climate.  Focussing on one boundary current, the Agulhas system in the Indian Ocean off South Africa, we find the new model is able to realistically simulate the looping and eddying of the Agulhas retroflection and leakage south of Africa, when compared to observations. In contrast, the current generation of climate models cannot resolve this dynamic system.  Developing new technology to archive five-daily output from the model and couple to a Lagrangian particle tracking system, we estimate the amount of waters that leak from the Agulhas system into the Atlantic Ocean. We find that our model constrains this Agulhas leakage to a transport averaging 11 Sv (1x106 m3/s), in the range of the 5 to 15 Sv estimated from observations, while current climate models simulate over 40 Sv. This large difference between the climate models could be important for climate predictability.  Agulhas leakage has been related to climate change in the past through its influence on the Atlantic overturning circulation, which transports heat towards Europe and the Arctic. Current climate models predict that the overturning is weakening, yet they do not resolve Agulhas leakage. Current ocean models predict that Agulhas leakage is increasing, yet they do not capture ocean-atmosphere feedbacks.  Here, we find no significant increasing trend in Agulhas leakage in our coupled simulation, in contrast to the ocean models. However, this can be attributed, in part, to a weaker-than-observed trend in the strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies in our simulation. More simulations and analysis will be necessary before we can conclude that coupled feedbacks may dampen Agulhas leakage response to climate change.  We are able to relate interannual variability of Agulhas leakage to changes in the position and strength of the westerly winds and, most significantly, to rainfall over southeast Africa. Increased leakage is associated with decreased rainfall rates.  This research impacts society through the improvement of climate prediction and predictability by advancement of the capability of simulations of global climate change.
