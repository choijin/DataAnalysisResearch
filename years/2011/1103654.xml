<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the four years of the grant, the PI conducted research on various topics in mathematics, generally in the areas of geometry and dynamics.  In that time, he wrote three papers and gave 21 invited lectures on the topic of his research.  These talks include four at research conferences. As part of his research, the PI developed three new computer algorithms to address computational challenges in geometry, and made implementations of those algorithms as well as the results of the computations performed using those algorithms available to his colleagues on the internet.     The PI also devoted energy to undergraduate and graduate education during his fellowship.  He gave lectures to undergraduate students on research topics in dynamics and geometry and helped organize a learning seminar for graduate students in complex dynamics.  Additionally, the PI gave a series of lectures at an educational retreat aimed at beginning graduate students with the goal of gently introducing them to topics in current research.     Some highlights of the PIÆs research achievements during the fellowship tenure include:     (1)  He developed an algorithm to compute "Veech groups" of polygonal billiard tables.  These are groups are symmetries of polygons and are important tools for understanding these dynamical systems.  His algorithm and its freely available implementation in Sage have recently been used to establish certain new polygons have the important lattice property.  (2)  Together with A. Kumar (MIT), the PI computed the algebraic equations defining Teichmuller curves associated to certain polygonal billiard tables.  These equations are the first of their kind and revealed deep connections between dynamics and number theory.  (3)  He developed a method, based on existing numerical integration tools, to evaluate the Teichmuller norm on moduli spaces.  Using this method, he gave the first accurate way to picture of this norm, yielding beautiful visualizations of a celebrated theorem of RoydenÆs from the 1970Æs.
