<AbstractNarration>This award will fund a new study to determine the masses of black holes in binary systems.  Using the new NSF-funded infrared FIRE (Folded-port InfraRed Echellette) spectrograph at the Magellan Observatory in Chile, Dr. Remillard and his team will measure the radial velocities and rotational line-broadening for the companions to a number of black holes.  Infrared observations are more useful than those at visible wavelengths, since there is much less extinction from dust and where the weakest companion stars radiate most strongly.  The goals of the project are (1) to obtain new measurements of black hole masses; (2) to make mass measurements for accreting neutron stars; and (3) to conduct a long-term study of GRS 1915+105, which is unique for its variability, high luminosity, and productivity in producing jets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass measurements anchor general efforts to infer black hole spin values via X-ray observations. Values of mass and spin are primary inputs for theorists working on stellar evolution of massive stars, supernovae, hypernovae, and binary evolution. Inferences of BH mass and spin will energize the general effort to develop quantitative applications of general relativity in the strong gravity regime.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1. Introduction  Astronomers have identified 20 stellar-size black holes, each with a mass of 6-20 times that of the Sun. These identifications depend on investigations of X-ray sources.  There are distinct X-ray properties that may classify a source as either a black-hole or neutron-star that is accreting matter from the atmosphere of a companion star in a close binary system.  The infalling gas swirls into an accretion disk as it plunges toward the compact object. The inner disk reaches temperatures &gt; 10 million degrees, causing tremendous X-ray glow.  Once a candidate is precisely located, optical high-resolution spectroscopy of the binary companion star can secure the black hole ID.  The orbital motion of the companion causes its spectral features to display a cyclical series of Doppler shifts that track the star's velocity.  A time series of velocity measurements reveals the binary period and the amplitude of the velocity curve.  These two parameters constrain the mass of the compact object. A black hole is identified when the lower limit for the mass exceeds the 3 solar mass upper limit for a neutron star (the limit of the strong nuclear force to withstand intense gravity). In addition, the spectra provide knowledge of the companions's mass and radius, and the distance to the binary system. When the black hole mass and distance are known, the X-ray spectra can be re-analyzed to infer the value of black hole spin.  the only other physical properties that a celestial black hole can have. Furthermore, the knowledge of mass, spin, and distance vitalizes investigations of outstanding mysteries, such as the origin of relativistic radio jets or the interpretation of high-frequency oscillations (50 - 450 Hz) that sometimes appear in the X-ray data.  Sadly, the supply of black hole candidates with visible companions had been largely exhausted. Dust extinction and large distances render the majority of companions too faint for study, even with the largest telescopes. However, a recent breakthrough in the development of high-resolution infrared spectrographs promised to change this landscape, since dust extinction is significantly reduced in the infrared.

Another obstacle was the handling of neighbor stars that contribute light into the spectrograph entrance slit, despite our efforts to rotate the instrument to minimize this problem. The relatively new data pipeline for FIRE is not fully equipped to handle fields in the galactic plane.  Our response was to implement a hybrid scheme that shared func...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
