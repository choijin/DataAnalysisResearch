<AbstractNarration>The aim of this collaborative project between investigators at three universities is to develop records of past climate in northwest (NW) Greenland and synthesize them with records of the position of ice margin to evaluate the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to past warm periods, such as the Holocene Climatic Optimum (approximately 5 to 9 thousand years ago). Recent studies suggest that rapid ice loss is expanding northwards into NW Greenland, as demonstrated by the dramatic August, 2010 calving event from Petermann Glacier. However, little paleoclimate and ice sheet research has been conducted in NW Greenland, despite the proximity to a logistics center at Thule Air Base. The proposed research integrates multiple climate proxies and glaciological modeling experiments in the Thule region with the following research objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1) Reconstruct Holocene climate in NW Greenland via inferences from reconstructed local ice cap extents (North Ice Cap, Tuto Ice Cap), ice core stable isotope and precipitation records, and data from nearby lake sediments. &lt;br/&gt; 2) Examine the sensitivity of the NW Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) to Holocene climate changes by developing the history of the areal extent of the GIS and synthesizing proxy data with glaciological modeling experiments to examine past GIS changes and predict future GIS retreat.&lt;br/&gt;Results from the proposed research will enable a more accurate prediction of the NW Greenland cryospheric response to a future warmer world and provide information directly relevant to predictions of future sea-足level rise. The investigators propose to enhance public outreach and K-足12 science education through development of educational modules using simplified, web-足based, climate and glaciological models. They would involve graduate and undergraduate students in field and lab research, participate in the Dartmouth Women足 In Science Project, and partner with the Dartmouth polar IGERT program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  This collaborative project was designed to increase our understanding of the sensitivity of the Greenland Ice Sheet to past climate conditions, particularly warmer than present conditions, from 11,600 years ago to present.  Temperatures in Greenland during the Holocene Thermal Maximum and the Medieval Warm Period are estimated to have been as warm as or warmer than at present.  We used meteorological data, ice core and snow pit data, lake sediment core analyses and the past extents of the small, local North Ice Cap to reconstruct Holocene climate conditions in an ice-free area in northwestern Greenland known as Nunatarssuaq.  We developed the first continuous, bias-corrected weather station record from Thule, which shows that NW Greenland has warmed by 1.5&deg;C since 1952. The North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation are natural climate cycles that influence Thule climate over periods from 1-30 years. However, when these natural cycles are removed, we find a steady warming of 1.4&deg;C since 1952 interpreted as caused by human activities. Rain and snowfall rates have likewise increased in Thule by 41% since 1981, compared to lower rates of increase, or no long-term trend, further inland on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Shallow ice cores collected from the North Ice Cap and coastal Greenland Ice Sheet faithfully record trends in temperature, snowfall, and sea ice loss over recent decades, indicating that they are viable sites from which to collect deeper ice cores spanning the past 10,000 years or more.  We used glacial geomorphic mapping together with radiocarbon dating of subfossil plants recently exposed by ice recession and 10Be ages of boulders on glacial deposits to reconstruct the Holocene extents of the Greenland Ice Sheet and North Ice Cap margins. These data document a smaller-than-present North Ice Cap from ~AD 900-1300 during the Medieval Warm Period.  Subsequently, North Ice Cap advanced to a position ~100-200 m beyond the present margin by AD 1700-1800. More recent fluctuations of the margin were smaller than the historical advance.   Near the Greenland Ice Sheet margin, determining the timing of deglaciation from the last glacial maximum position was problematic due to the presence of 10Be inherited from prior periods of exposure in many rock samples.  Radiocarbon ages of plants indicate that the Greenland Ice Sheet was smaller than at present by ~4700 years ago, consistent with evidence from the North Ice Cap for smaller than present ice conditions ~5000 years ago. This suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet was responding to similar climate conditions as the small ice cap; likely warmer summer temperatures. Evidence for a Holocene advance of the Greenland Ice Sheet includes a high level of the Lake "Nordso" (at ~540 m elevation) caused by damming of the lake outlet by the ice sheet.  Radiocarbon and 10Be ages show that this advance began by ~3000 years ago and culminated by ~2000 years ago.  Subsequently, the Greenland Ice Sheet may have been smaller than at present during the Medieval Warm Period and advanced ~100-200 m beyond the present margin by AD 1500.   Broader Impacts:  Understanding the sensitivity of the Greenland Ice Sheet to past climate changes provides information about how the ice sheet may respond to future climate conditions.  We demonstrated that during early to middle Holocene time, the Greenland Ice Sheet was smaller than at present. Lake sediment core data developed by our Northwestern collaborators indicate that summer temperatures in Thule were 3.5-5.5&deg;C warmer than present at that time.  The advance of both North Ice Cap and the Greenland Ice Sheet after ~5000 years ago was likely a response to cooler climate conditions, perhaps as a result of the decrease in high northern latitude insolation during late Holocene time.  The advance of the Greenland Ice Sheet at ~3000-2000 years ago may have been a response to cooler late Holocene temperatures,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
