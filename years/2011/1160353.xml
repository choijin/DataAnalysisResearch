<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to better understand how faculty can provide meaningful and effective feedback to engineering students who are engaged in complex design projects.  Providing good and timely feedback can have a significant impact on learning, yet little is known about how to structure or provide effective feedback during team based engineering design projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to help instructors more effectively provide feedback to student engineering teams.  This feedback will broadly support learning, and by targeting instructors can have a disproportionate impact on the number of students affected.  The project also aligns with national priorities in engineering education.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>

They also compared the extent to which virtual and physical engineering laboratories supported disciplinary thinking (modeling) and engagement. They have learned that feedback provided by the instructor during student team interactions is critical to the success of the learning system. They have described the characteristics of successful feedback and the effects of that feedback on student learning.
