<AbstractNarration>Bioelectronics is emerging as one of the priority thrusts of the American and Russian science, with emphasis on applying nanoscience and nanotechnology for a variety of biomedical applications, including cardio and cancer treatment. The objective of the Workshop is to bring together leading American and Russian scientists and engineers who are at the frontiers of bioelectronics research and development for biomedical applications.  The venue for the Workshop is the Nanotechnology Research and Education Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences at St Petersburg Academic University that was founded in 1997 by the NobelPrize Winner Dr. Zhores I. Alferov, Director of the Ioffe Institute, Vice-President of the Russian Academy of Sciences  and Rector of the Academic University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the proposed workshop is in the exchange of research and technological challenges and discussions of new ideas and emerging trends in bioelectronics, in identifying of new emerging areas and short and long research needs, and in establishing new international collaborations. The workshop topics will touch upon future directions for bioelectronics research, review of bioelectronics trends in cancer research, diagnostics and treatment, THz bio-diagnostics technology, bioelectronics devices, bioelectromagnetics, neural engineering, biosensors using magnetic nanoparticles, high-resolution retinal prosthesis, and brain-computer interfaces for communication and control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Rapid growth of bioelectronics science and technology compels the need for information exchange and intellectual discourse. This workshop will provide cross-pollination of ideas and methodologies that will make an impact on science and technology in both countries. This advanced workshop will be a special forum to gather some of the most creative minds and leading experts from both countries. It will review the most recent and exciting breakthroughs in the bioelectronics fields, facilitate the exchange views, establish future trends and directions, the market pulls and determine the necessary strategies and infrastructure needs. It will help establish future exchange programs for graduate and undergraduate students for training the new generation of bioelectronics scientists and engineers.The Proceedings of the Workshop will be widely disseminated via the University web sites in both countries and made available to students, postdoctoral associates, and young faculty.  Special emphasis will be provided to have diversity among the US participants.</AbstractNarration>
