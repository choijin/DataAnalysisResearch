<AbstractNarration>The project will support a workshop on the identification of challenges and opportunities for the large scale deployment of the smart grid, to be held in Washington D.C. area in early 2013. This workshop will be organized by Virginia Tech's Advanced Research Institute and Southeast University of China. It will bring together approximately 50 smart grid experts and researchers from both the United States and China. This workshop is designed to create a synergy among workshop participants from the U.S. and China. Specific objectives for the workshop are: (1) To identify challenges of smart grid development in the United States and China, (2) to identify technologies ? both electric power and communication infrastructures ? necessary to support smart grid development and high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, (3) to identify best practices and lessons learned based on the deployment experience in smart grid projects, (4) to identify challenges and research topics that the participants can use as a context to propose new research in this field, and (5) to provide international networking opportunities and potential for future research collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that presentations and discussions at the workshop will lead to a better understanding of research challenges and the identification of R&amp;D opportunities for international research collaboration. This activity will in turn serve as a basis for future academia-industry collaboration and for conducting joint research and/or setting up joint programs on smart grid. It is also expected that this workshop will help build awareness and promote educational and research exchange visits in smart grid related topics. Efforts will be made to recruit women researchers from academia, government and national laboratories, as well as participants from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two workshops were held under this grant &ndash; one in the US and the second one in China.  The first workshop entitled "US-China Workshop: Identification of Challenges and Opportunities for the Large Scale Deployment of the Smart Grid" was held in Arlington, Virginia on February 28-March 1, 2013. It brought together approximately 30 experts from both United States and China who discussed the challenges and opportunities for large-scale development of the smart grid. Discussions at the workshop focused on identifying research topics of common interest that can be further developed for joint research collaboration among US and Chinese universities.  Discussions at this workshop resulted in the following findings and recommendations:  There is a need to advance research in the area of managing renewable energy integration with demand response. There is a need to advance the understanding and assessment of the value of micro-grid and its scalability. Research is needed in the area of demand response in terms of market design, approach to perform demand response, assessment of demand response potentials for different types of commercial and residential customers, and identification of how much demand reduction/deployment can be achieved. There is a need to realize and conduct technical analysis and market design to allow participation of smart appliances/smart plugs in a demand response paradigm. There is a need to examine cyber security needs and challenges in electric power system operation and control.   The second workshop "US-China Workshop: Smart Grid Opportunity Identification" was held on May 15-16, 2014 at Southeast University in Nanjing, China. This workshop brought together approximately 15 experts from both United States and China, involving representatives from Virginia Tech, Southeast University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), China Electric Power Research Institute (CEPRI) and State Grid Electric Power Research Institute (SGEPRI).

Both workshops have created a synergy among smart grid experts from the U.S. and China. The U.S. participants were exposed to challenges, lessons learned and best practices of smart grid development and implementation from the Chinese experience and their plans to address these issues. The U.S. participants from academia &mdash; including students, early career researchers and senior faculty members &mdash; had the opportunity to learn industry best practices, and share their R&amp;D knowledge. Participants from China also had the opportunity to learn from the U.S. experience in smart grid implementation, including &mdash; but is not limit...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
