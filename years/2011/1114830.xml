<AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for the conference "Pulsar research at the Arecibo Observatory: a celebration of five key contributors," to be held in Arecibo, Puerto Rico in March 2011. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference brings together about 100 researchers (including 20-30 students and new researchers) to review major contributions to the field, and discuss future directions. Topics will include pulsar timing, emission mechanisms, polarimetry, using pulsars to detect low-frequency gravitational waves, and as probes of the interstellar medium.</AbstractNarration>
