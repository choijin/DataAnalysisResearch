<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant will allow the research team--consisting of engineers, computer scientists, and educational psychologists--to explore using serious electronic games to teach engineering students the concepts of system design in a context of sustainable energy.  The research team will use affordance theory to guide the development and measure the impact on student learning in two different environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to inform the design of alternative educational methods that can be widely applied both in the engineering classroom and to better inform a broad section of society about the choices and tradeoffs associated with sustainable energy.  The proposed educational medium has the potential to reach a broad cross-section of students, many who are in groups currently under-represented in STEM disciplines.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goal of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for addressing societal challenges through engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sustainable energy systems are complex puzzles that (at least for now) must be assembled from many, many pieces.  These pieces include alternate energy production, storage, and transportation technologies.  The goal of this project was to identify ways of teaching large numbers of students (and members of the general public) about this subject.  Our strategy included three components:  First, to convey the complexity of such systems (and their puzzle assembly challenge), we worked to develop a game with which users could design their own nation-scale energy system.  This approach was inspired by the viral successes of games such as Farmville and FoldIt (the latter being particularly notable as it attracted a spontaneous online gaming community that used the game to discover the true structures of two key proteins involved in HIV infections).  Through our game we hoped to capture a similar level of viral excitement, but in the form of a simulation that would nevertheless accurately represent the engineering and economic constraints of modern energy technologies.  The above game would draw students into the challenge of "solving the energy puzzle" but students must also learn what determines the shapes of the individual "pieces."  That is, they must also study the individual technologies that go into such an energy system.  To that end, the game would be supported by a more conventional assemblage of teaching materials including lecture note sets, figures, animations, and research papers.  These were created in the form of a new "Introduction to Sustainable Energy Systems" class directed toward any and all interested undergraduates at the University of Virginia.  The final "component" was large-scale dissemination.  Journal papers or presentations at educational conferences would not be enough.  Nor would a game that could only be played on a high-powered local computer.  Instead, all course materials would be posted on a completely open public website.  And, via the web, players would be able to play the game on their own personal computing device (as long as it used one of the more popular hardware or software operating systems.  How far have we come toward these goals under this "Research Initiation Grant?"   The game's server-side "engine" (incorporating the energy system data and rule-sets) is complete, as are the beta versions of the user-side game interfaces (for a variety of PC/software systems).  These have been tested over the last year, and will now be "rolled out" for local student testing this fall (2015).  Materials for the supporting class are completed and now in use in that class's premier offering.  This includes nearly 1500 pages of carefully polished and illustrated PowerPoint lecture notes which are, in turn, supported by webpages containing links to both relevant news and research publications, and to movies and animations.  Many of these animations (including ones explaining the operation of electric motors, generators and transformers - see attached image) were authored specifically for this project, by its leader.  Finally, all class materials are posted on an already well-known and widely accessed public science education website, the UVA Virtual Lab.  Under a series of NSF grants, this site has grown over 15 years to the point that visitors have now viewed almost 11,000,000 of its webpages, podcasts, or posted documents.  On this site, energy class materials will be joined by links to the full game as soon as student testing is completed.
