<AbstractNarration>Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is saline and two-thirds of the existing fresh water deposit is locked away in snow and ice, leaving only one percent for human use. Since the majority of fresh water is used to grow food, the changing climate will challenge our food supply as drought events become more frequent and intense. Therefore, it is critical to develop a new generation of crops that can sustain productivity with reduced fresh water input. This project fills a significant gap in our understanding on how unfavorable environment perturbs seed development and ultimately affects plant productivity. Because seeds from cereals (such as rice, maize, and wheat) are the primary source of calories, and rice is an established model for cereals, this work will focus on how drought stress adversely affects early seed development in rice resulting in reduced seed size. Taking a molecular and biochemical approach, the project team will identify rice genes that are critical for normal seed development, but whose expression is altered by drought stress. This work will elucidate how seed, arguably the most economically important plant organ as food source, senses and adapts to a changing environment. This project will be important for developing future crops that are needed for mitigating and adapting to changing climate. The project will broaden participation in STEM workforce by training persons with disabilities. The PIs will work with the Office for Students with Disabilities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) to recruit, and train qualified individuals into project research activities. This project will also contribute to The Plant and Soil Sciences eLibrary, an online repository of science education materials, by building a new seed development module that is accessible for students with learning disabilities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Early seed development in cereals is highly sensitive to environmental stresses such as heat and drought stress. Even a short duration of stress during early seed development leads to decrease in seed/endosperm size and in most instances result in lower total yields. In this project, we identified a specific endosperm developmental event which is directly affected by environmental stress and results in smaller seeds in rice. We next explored the underlying molecular responses to elucidate the reasons for the developmental shift induced by stress. We have identified and characterized a putative epigenetic regulatory gene and multiple genes (transcription factors) associated with seed size. These genes are likely involved in linking environmental cues with developmental triggers during seed development. One of the genes identified from our work has potential to affect several yield-components in rice. By modifying the activity of this specific gene, we were able to obtain a positive impact on yield-related traits. These findings could have a beneficial impact on generating more climate resilient rice and possibly other cereals such as wheat. This project provided training to two postdoctoral scholars, two graduate students and an undergraduate student with disabilities, thus contributing to the STEM workforce development. The learning materials developed as part of this research have been used for undergraduate teaching (~110 students) focused on importance of seed biology/endosperm for human nutrition and food security.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/02/2015<br>      Modified by: Harkamal&nbsp;Walia</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
