<AbstractNarration>One significant social problem in many countries is the very poor social health in indigenous communities.  While every native community has a substantial proportion of people who are healthy and well, there are also often a proportion of the population suffering from substance abuse, including especially from alcohol and gasoline sniffing; from suicide and domestic violence.  The rates of these indicators of poor social health can be much higher in native communities than in either the general population or among ethnic minorities in the general population.  This comparative research project will work with four native populations: two small groups in North and South Carolina, which although historically stressed by poverty and prejudice have very good social health, and two northern (sub-arctic) populations (both Inuit and Indian/Innu) where the social health is less good.  This research project will focus on developing and refining the concept of lived history: the various ways native people see and live the connections between a not-quite-past and their sense of an impending future.  This sense of a continuing history that people live, in their everyday lives, will be examined to see what role it plays in the production and maintenance of social health in native communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Final Report to the public:   NSF award number 1140707   "The Lived Histories of Vulnerable Peoples: Understanding Differential Social Health in Marginal Populations."  Gerald Sider  Professor of Anthropology, Emeritus, The College of Staten Island and The Graduate School, City University of New York; Research Associate, Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History     These projects &ndash; there have been several &ndash; all began with a small Arctic social science grant from the program called EAGER: Early Action Grants for Exploratory Research.  It was used first to finish writing my book on the epidemic of child suicide, domestic violence, and substance abuse among the sub- Arctic Inuit and northern Cree.  This epidemic began in the 1960s and has been intensifying since.  The book I finished about that is Skin for Skin: Death and life among the Inuit and Innu. [Durham: Duke University press, 2014.]     The core of this project was to use a long historical perspective, from early contact to the present, to help understand how native peoples dealt with suffering prior to the 1960s with vastly less collective self-destruction.  Native peoples in the far north have suffered a variety of serious &ndash; often fatal &ndash; problems since the disruptions of early contact: epidemic diseases, famines, forced relocations, and more.  Yet they dealt with these problems and with their consequences with far less communal destructiveness than has developed since the 1960s in the consequences of their current mistreatment.     Since the 1960s native peoples of the Canadian sub- Arctic, both Inuit and northern Cree, have suffered from severe mistreatment by the Canadian government, and a loss of opportunities to hunt, trap, and fish for major income and for a major part of their subsistence. In addition they have suffered the consequences of severe and fatal epidemics.  In this context youth suicide, domestic violence, and substance abuse have become widespread starting in the 1960s and intensifying steadily since.  In sum, the sufferings of native people are not new; the self-destruction is. That specifies the problem this research has addressed in a series of related projects.      The first part of the research on this grant finished my book about this transition: Skin for Skin: Death and Life for Inuit and Innu (Duke University Press 2014).  This research paid close attention to issues of the historically changing the relation between chaos and order in the daily lives of ordinary native people.  The second part of this research expanded the study to compare the situation of these northern native peoples to peoples in the US South &ndash; at first Native Americans and then African Americans, who have also suffered a variety of social, cultural, and economic stresses but with far less self-destruction.  This research focused on the contradictory development of civil rights victories for African American people in the small towns and villages of southeastern North Carolina, which came combined with substantial economic problems for many people with the decline of small-scale agriculture and especially the departure of almost all manufacturing jobs to overseas locations.  This same contradiction between collective political successes and individual economic problems for many people characterizes the general situation for northern native peoples.  The book that comes from this part of the research, Race Becomes Tomorrow: North Carolina and the shadow of civil rights, will be published by Duke University Press in the fall of 2015.     Very surprisingly, Australian aboriginal peoples have many of the same problems as do northern native peoples, and simultaneously face many of the civil rights struggles as did African Americans in the US South.  .  One of the fruits of this research was applying both of the early components of this project to helping to develop an understanding of the Australian aborigines situation.
