<AbstractNarration>Individuals differ in how well they survive, grow and reproduce, but the reasons for these differences are not well understood. Previous work has shown that either the intrinsic quality of the individual, the quality of the environment in which they were raised, the quality of the environment that they inhabit, or the social environment, may affect an individual's success. No study has examined the relative importance of all these factors within a single species. The central aim of this study is to elucidate the reason for differences in the performance of individuals in nature by manipulating all of these factors simultaneously. Molecular genetic characterization of individuals will be combined with large scale field experiments to test the magnitude of these factors in the ant model system, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis. The results of these experiments will be combined with an ongoing twenty-year study of the population biology of this species to provide a comprehensive measure of the determinants of individual success. This work will contribute to the development of biological infrastructure and to student training. The project will involve undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in scientific research and will provide mentoring to encourage their continuation in science, technology and engineering careers post graduation. The data from this study will be made available through Dryad (datadryad.org) and the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (knb.ecoinformatics.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A common sight in the deserts and grasslands of the western United States is the conspicuous conical mounds of the western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis (Fig 1).  This seed-eating species (Fig2) is found from central Kansas to western Nevada and from Arizona to Saskatchewan.  We have studied a population of this species in western Colorado for 28 years.  Many attributes of this species are remarkable.  Colonies have a single queen and about 30,000 workers when mature.  They can have very long lifespans.  The queen, and therefore the colony, can live for up to 45 years; workers live for approximately one year.  The queen mates during one episode in her life, and stores that sperm for the remainder of her life.  In a long-lived colony, she may produce more than a million workers over her lifetime.  When the colony becomes sufficiently large, the queen may produce new daughter queens and males.  New reproductive individuals mate in large swarms that may comprise tens of thousands of ants from many colonies;  queens then begin colonies of their own.  Colonies differ greatly in how successful they are.  Some colonies live for decades, some die within weeks.  Of the survivors, some produce thousands of reproductive offspring, some never produce any or very few.  Even when colonies survive, some grow rapidly while others remain small for years.  These differences are important because they govern evolutionary processes in this species.  Individual colonies that live a long time, grow rapidly and produce many queens and males contribute both individuals and genes to the next generation.  Those that falter at any stage, do not contribute to the next generation and are evolutionarily unsuccessful.  These differences among individual colonies are the subject of this research.   One trait that contributes to colony success is that they live in good locations.  Censuses of reproduction conducted as part of this research indicate that colonies in certain areas of our study site are more likely to reproduce than colonies in other regions.  Colonies also have intrinsic properties that predispose them for success; in particular, colonies which are headed by queens that have mated more times.  Although a queen can start a colony after mating only a single time, she is often more successful when she mates a larger number of times.  Queens mate with an average of seven males, but some mate with two or three while others mate with more than ten.  Colonies where the queen has mated more times have greater genetic variability in the workers that make up the colony.  These genetically diverse colonies grow faster, become larger, survive better and reproduce more over their life than colonies whose queens mate fewer times.  This advantage is probably due to the benefit that high genetic diversity has on foraging ability and in resisting diseases. Another factor that has been proposed, but never measured, to account for differences in colony success, has been differences in queen quality.  Queens that have more stored resources at the start of their life may be more successful later in life.  In this research, we experimentally manipulated the number of times that a queen mated, the quality of the queen and the quality of the environment of the colony, with the goal of testing the magnitude of the effects of environmental quality and intrinsic colony properties on the success of colonies.  Over three years, we experimentally produced 1,077 mated queens, grew them in the lab for a year (Fig. 3), and transplanted nearly  600 colonies as three cohorts (Fig 4).  We altered nest site quality by supplementing colonies with food and measured survival and growth over the subsequent 4-6 years (the experiment is ongoing).  Although nest site quality had a substantial effect on growth and survival, so did the colony?s genetic diversity.  Colonies whose queens mated more frequently were more likely to survive and the effects are quantitative (the more mating, the higher the chance of survival, Fig 5).  Most importantly these effects are not observed immediately, but only after several years. These results dovetail with the results from the long term monitoring of this study site and emphasize the fact that long-term data are essential for understanding how the biological properties of an organism interact with the ecological circumstances of an organism.   This project is possible due to the efforts of many people, including a number of graduate and undergraduate students.  Over the course of this project we have supported five graduate and post-graduate students, as well as 26 undergraduate students.  We have been successful in incorporating students of a variety of under-represented groups.  Among the graduate students we have supported 4 women including one African-American woman.  Among the undergraduate students we have supported 13 women, 6 Latinx and 4 African-American students.       Last Modified: 08/26/2019       Submitted by: Diane C Wiernasz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
