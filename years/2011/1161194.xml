<AbstractNarration>In this Connecting Researchers to Public Audiences (CRPA) project, the researchers from Florida State University, in partnership with their local public broadcasting station (WFSU-TV), will engage the audience in an exploration of the ecosystem services of coastal habitats.  The main content focus is the important linkages among coastal foundation species (oysters and salt marsh plants), the human and ecological communities they support, and the ecosystem services they provide.  In particular, the project illuminates the roles of biodiversity and consume-prey relationships in influencing ecosystem services, while conveying the excitement of ecological research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complementary target audiences are the general WFSU viewers and listeners, groups that actively use or promote coastal habitats, and graduate students at Florida State University and Florida A&amp;M University.  The main deliverables include:  1) a TV documentary, a series of short videos and radio spots; 2) a research blog; and 3) a science communication three-day workshop for current and future researchers to converse with the public about key learning goals.  In addition, in year two of the grant, the PIs will deliver a monthly seminar series focused on effective communication skills for scientists.   The resulting documentaries will be broadcast by WFSU and offered to other PBS stations via APT and/or NETA.  Other materials will be made available via PBS Learning Media and other portals.  Community group project collaborators, such as SciGirls and the Science Caf√©, will extend the reach and impact of the project. The project design includes formative evaluation which will focus on ways to improve the accessibility and usability of the research blog, and summative evaluation which will review each component of the deliverables.  Results of the summative evaluation will be posted on www.informalscience.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the communication gap between scientists and the public by simultaneously targeting both audiences with deliverables designed to promote dialogue and understanding.  By highlighting compelling natural history information and key ecological concepts associated with current research, the project will provide engaging educational experiences to a wide audience.   These activities will not only educate the public about specific research but also demonstrate the process of science.  Finally, the proposed seminar for students, along with the other informal learning opportunities throughout the project, will enhance the communication skills and outreach abilities of a diverse group of graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ WFSU-TV collaborated with marine researchers to create a wealth of content focused on north Florida's coastal ecosystems.  The In the Grass, On the Reef Project produced over 30 short video segments, dozens of blog posts, and the one-hour Oyster Doctor documentary.  Starring Dr. David Kimbro, Dr. Randall Hughes, and their team, this visually rich content connected the biology of salt marshes, oyster reefs, and seagrass beds to the communities of Florida's Forgotten Coast.  Here, small towns on a largely undeveloped coast depend on a healthy intertidal zone to support a fishing and tourism economy.  However, when the Apalachicola oyster fishery collapsed in 2012, the interactions of oysters and predatory snails had a tangible impact on the human community.  During the two year period during which In the Grass, On the Reef produced National Science Foundation funded content, web viewership for the WFSU Ecology Blog more than doubled.  Over 35,000 individuals tuned in for content that blended the biology of predator/ prey relationships and biodiversity with timely stories about the Apalachicola crisis and its causes.  During the five day RiverTrek kayak adventure, WFSU explored over 100 miles of the Apalachicola watershed, starting at the dam that artificially controls freshwater flows, down to what had been one of our nation's most productive estuaries.  Video segments also examined efforts to restore salt marsh and oyster reef ecosystems in Choctawhatchee Bay.  In addition to being housed on the research blog, videos aired on WFSU-TV's flagship show, Dimensions, and were available on NSF's Science 360 web and television portals.  In year three of the grant award, the videos were aligned with national and state education standards and added to PBS Learning Media.  This makes it available to teachers nationwide.  PBS Learning Media promoted the addition of the content in conjunction with the premiere of Deep Blue Sea Live on PBS.  WFSU's collaboration with Drs. Kimbro and Hughes culminated with the Oyster Doctors documentary, which aired on WFSU-TV in March of 2014.  In advance of the broadcast, WFSU staged a premiere event in Apalachicola.  Boat tours of the Apalachicola delta and a walking tour of Dr. Hughes' salt marsh experment sites preceded a screening attended by a crowd of over 100.  In October of 2014, Tall Timbers Research Station hosted a screening of the film for the Covey Film Festival.  That event featured the Gulf Specimen Marine Lab's mobile touch tank and a bird watching field trip, and was also attended by approximately 100 people.  Another component of the In the Grass, On the Reef collaboration was a workshop woth researcher turned filmmaker Dr. Randy Olson.  He worked with 15 Florida State University biology students and faculty- including Drs. Hughes and Kimbro, plus three graduate students participating with In the Grass- on effectively communicating science to public audiences.  Through their collaboration with WFSU-TV, the Dr. Kimbro, Dr. Hughes, their graduate students, and their lab technicians received experience speaking on camera, and many wrote at least one blog post.  While the research team gained experience in making their research easier for the public to understand, WFSU-TV used the collaboration as a springboard to further explore area ecology.  The WFSU Ecology Blog has continued to build on its viewership, receiving funding for its EcoShakepseare and Red Hills initiatives.    National Science Foundation funding of In the Grass, On the Reef has provided researchers, including younger students and lab techs, with media skills that are undertaught in university biology programs.  Likewise, the award laid the foundation for WFSU to provide ongoing ecology content.  That initial grant award is responsible for continuing efforts to connect public audiences with science and ecology content.
