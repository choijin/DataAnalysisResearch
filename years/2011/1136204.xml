<AbstractNarration>This project involves supporting students to attend the ACM Sigmetrics conference to be held in San Jose, CA in June 2011. Sigmetrics is the premier conference in the area of performance modeling and it is important to expose students to this conference, particularly in an environment where students tend to shy away from mathematical modeling. The students will be chosen based on a open competition and preference will be given to students who don't have any existing support or belong to underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
