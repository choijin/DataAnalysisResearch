<AbstractNarration>SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) is a 4-5 week education and research program in field-based applied geophysics. The program has existed for 25 years and involves about 25-30 graduate and undergraduate students per year. The program includes instruction in applied geophysics, and seismic, gravity, magnetic, and electromagnetic field data collection. Students at SAGE participate in every phase of a geophysical research program including data collection, data analysis, processing, modeling and interpretation; and they present their results in both oral and written form. This 2-year project supports the 5 additional students per year in the summer field program (4 weeks) and in a one-week follow-up workshop designed to extend and enhance the students' research experiences on geothermal research through additional analyses of the data collected during the summer. REU students at SAGE come from a variety of institutions ranging from small liberal arts colleges to large research universities. Student career goals are solidified from information and experiences included in SAGE through the significant participation of industry, government, national laboratory and academic professionals. The follow-up workshop is also used to provide additional professional development of the REU students through assisting them in preparation of an oral or poster presentation of research results to be given at a future professional meeting. Support for about ten of the REU students to attend a professional meeting is included in the project. This project is supported in collaboration with the Department of Energy, Office of Geothermal Technologies Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) is a summer research and education program that has been operating since 1983.  The four week, intensive, summer program is based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and involves students in learning geophysical theory and applications; collection of geophysical field data in the northern Rio Grande Rift area; data processing, modeling and interpretation; and presentation (oral and written) of results of each student?s research results. Students (undergraduates, graduates and professionals) and SAGE faculty are together on a school campus for the 4-week, intensive summer program. Successful strategies (developed over the years) of the program include teamwork experience, mentoring of undergraduate students (by faculty and more senior students), cultural interchange due to students from many campuses across the U.S. and international graduate students, including industry visitors who work with the students and provide networking, a capstone experience of the summer program that includes all students making a "professional-meeting" style presentation of their research and submitting a written report, a follow-up workshop for the undergraduate students to enhance and broaden their experience, and providing professional development for the students through oral or poster presentations and attendance at a professional meeting.  In 2013 and 2014, the SAGE program was able to increase the number of undergraduate student participants to about 19 students per year and add a significant geothermal field and research experience to the program.  In SAGE 2013, 18 undergraduates, 8 graduate students and 4 professionals participated in the program.  In 2014, 20 undergraduates, 8 graduate students and 2 professionals participated in the program.   The geothermal field work consisted of temperature logging of drill holes in the Buckman well field area northwest of Santa Fe, NM.  SAGE students measured geothermal gradients of 46 to 76&deg;C/km in shallow monitoring wells in the field.  The gradients vary over a short spatial distance (300 m), suggesting a shallow local effective source.  The observed temperature gradients are interpreted to be caused by regional east to west groundwater flow in the area and local vertical flow caused by sedimentary layer offsets along fissures or faults.  Temperature log data were collected and archived for 12 drill holes in the Buckman area.  Three abstracts and poster presentations by SAGE students and faculty co-authors, reporting the 2013 and 2014 geothermal research results, were presented at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, CA.
