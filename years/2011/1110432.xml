<AbstractNarration>Carnivorous pitcher plants are a fascinating example of adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.  Remarkably, the pitcher insect trap evolved three times independently in plants. How did the pitcher evolve from a flat leaf?  Did each separate evolution of the pitcher involve the same genetic changes, or do they represent completely different ways of making a similar structure? To address these questions, this study will apply genetic findings from model plants to test hypotheses of the genetic changes responsible for the evolution of the carnivorous pitcher from a flat leaf. This research will evaluate expression patterns and silencing of genes known to be involved in leaf formation and compare their role in the three groups of pitcher plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide research-based training for high school and undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, the ability of these plants to excite public interest will aid in the communication of both scientific principles and the findings of this study through various media formats. This study has possible benefits for the application of biotechnology. The establishment of a method for silencing genes, as proposed for the study of leaf development in pitcher plants, could help advance protein harvesting technology and gene discovery in plants of agronomic importance. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
