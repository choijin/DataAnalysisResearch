<AbstractNarration>Recent years have seen extraordinary breakthroughs in computational sentiment analysis and social network analysis.  This research has helped to reveal that robust language understanding --- in dialogue, in text, on the Web --- depends on accurately identifying attitudes, emotions, and social relationships.  However, missing from the current scientific and technical picture is a deep understanding of the ways in which sentiment affects, and is affected by, our interpersonal relationships and social networks.  The central goal of this project is to fill this gap by developing algorithms, methods, and data sets for modeling sentiment as social and interpersonal.  The approach balances fine-grained sociological and linguistic study, computational modeling, and large-scale data-mining of weblogs and other interactive social media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to reshape the field of sentiment analysis by moving it towards inferential models of emotional language as situated in specific social contexts.  It also provides social network analysis with rich features for characterizing social ties, thereby facilitating the identification of new latent structure in social networks.  The work addresses a wide variety of social and political issues, including the extent of media polarization, the effects of bias and framing, and the role of emotional content in shaping the flow of information.  It can also inform the creation of the next generation of communication tools --- software for virtual meetings and online collaboration that intelligently tracks users' evolving attitudes, social networking platforms that distinguish relationship types, and data-mining tools relevant for legal discovery, intelligent tutoring, and media analytics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sought to bring the fields of sentiment analysis and social network analysis closer together, to achieve novel scientific insights into language and social organization, and to facilitate technological innovation in social networking platforms, assistive technologies, and other applied areas of artificial intelligence. The guiding insight of the project is that, when people report their attitudes and emotions, their linguistic choices are shaped not only by their feelings but also by the social and interpersonal dynamics of the context of utterance.  Project participants developed unified models of politeness and social status; developed domain-specific sentiment lexicons; scaled powerful Bayesian models of cognitive psychology to large data sets using techniques from machine learning; tracked the flow of sentiment and emotion in massive hyperlink graphs; modeled convention formation in online communities and its relationship to membership and status in such communities; broadened the domain of computational sentiment analysis to include style, stance, and aspect of identity and social status; and achieved unified models of evaluative language and social network ties.  As part of this research, the project publicly released numerous new data sets and algorithms to facilitate further research on these topics. These releases include the largest human-annotated corpus for studying inference and argumentation in natural language; the largest annotated corpus of politeness behavior; sentiment lexica for diverse domains; and numerous other resources that can be used to understand and model the nature of bond formation in social groups and how it shapes, and is shaped by, language use.  To further facilitate the application of these resources and methods in other scientific communities and in industry, the project PIs taught large online courses, organized free, open workshops, published summaries of the work aimed at non-specialists, and ran summer internship programs aimed at training undergraduates in these new interdisciplinary methods.
