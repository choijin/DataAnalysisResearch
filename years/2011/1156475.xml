<AbstractNarration>This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Montana State University focused on networking and networks with applications for sustainability.  Each summer a cohort of undergraduate students will participate in a ten-week summer research program at the host institution.  The project includes mentoring by the experienced computer science faculty members, technical seminars and workshops, student presentations, and field trips and other professional development opportunities.  The REU Site program will target high-quality undergraduate American Indian students, students from tribal colleges, and students from small colleges with limited resources.  Recruitment efforts will focus on computer science and engineering students as well as students from environmental science and other related disciplines.  This site is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The projects are in research areas that are current and address national priorities such as networking and sensor networks. The students participate in a full range of research activities from preparing research literature reviews to production and dissemination of research results.  The project has the potential to add to the research base of networking systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups. The project team is committed to including under-represented minority students in their research.  Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Montana State UniversityÃ†s Computer Science Department has hosted a NSF REU site for ten undergraduate participants during the summers of 2012-2014 in a ten-week residential program.   The objectives of our REU site were: 1) to expose undergraduate students to real-world, innovative and interdisciplinary research focused on networks research and network modeling with application to sustainability; 2) to encourage more undergraduates to continue their academic careers and seek graduate degrees in computer science, engineering, and environmental science; 3) to develop research skills and improve communication and collaboration skills of the participants.  Our REU program has heightened undergraduate student interest and participation in computer science related research on a variety of topics.   Students have acquired general research skills, helped design algorithms and developed and used tools to tackle complex interdisciplinary problems.    A sample of some of the projects that were conducted during the span of the grant are given below:  A Step Towards Handling Large Ecological Data in R: LabDSV is an R package that is used by many ecologists and student communities.  LabDSV is one of many R extensions that can experience memory limitations when users try to analyze big data, a term commonly used to describe large data sets.  This project added functionality to LabDSV in order to address memory problems associated with big data.  Load Scheduling to Match Wind Generation Using Particle Swarm Optimization: In order for the power grid to function, the generated supply must match the demand.  In this project a particle swarm optimization approach was used to schedule loads to match wind generation.  Efficient Power Distribution and Control in Smart Grids: The purpose of this research project was to develop competitive algorithms for optimizing job scheduling in homes. Smart Grid technology now allows homeowners to track their electricity consumption, and that information can be used to lower overall power expenditures (thus saving energy) and reduce monthly energy bills.  Several algorithms were developed and tested with data pertaining to electrical appliance usage collected from various households. This research contributes to the greater body of knowledge about optimization algorithms.  IP2DC: Latency Estimation Using CDN Servers: Web applications today often deploy replica servers to deliver service or use host clustering as part of their application. This project investigated a new latency estimation system for arbitrary hosts using host-to-CDN latency measurements. Compared to existing latency estimation tools, our technique offers superior coverage and latency estimation accuracy.  Vehicle Tracking based on Kalman Filter Algorithm: Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) has a reputation of being noisy, too noisy to use for localization. In this study, it was demonstrated that RSSI can be used in combination with a recursive algorithm (Kalman Filter) to identify the position of a node in a wireless vehicular network. Using RSSI alone for positioning is a much more economical and simple method than using GPS and requires much less hardware.  RSSI data from a mobile node in the wireless network, in combination with the Kalman Filter, was able to estimate the position of the mobile node to within 3 feet of the actual position.  Our REU site has helped address the nationÃ†s need for a diverse group of innovative computer science and engineering researchers and professionals capable of using a variety of technologies to address networking and environmental problems in a sustainable way.   Participants were encouraged to take a systems-level perspective in solving problems from an ever-growing number of diverse commercial, educational and national defense domains.  The program has also helped increase student awareness of cultural diversity and has bolstered the academic confidence and interest among underrepresented groups i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
