<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal for a Principle Investigators meeting for the DataNet and INTEROP programs.  Often, PI communities that evolve within two related yet distinct programs can become partitioned in both their thinking and their interactions along strictly programmatic boundaries. The meeting proposes to use the unifying theme of the participants common passion for data to transcend these boundaries and create new collaborative networks to better explore  the challenges in data management, data preservation, and interoperability. Meetings with this unconventional venue provide open and creative conversations to expose and accentuate the group's collective knowledge, allow for a sharing of ideas and insights, and let participants gain a deeper understanding of the challenging issues involved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Data to Insight Center at Indiana University hosted a workshop on data sharing. The workshop brought together teams funded from two NSF programs, the Digital Data Preservation and Access Network Partners (DataNet) program and the Community-based Data Interoperability Networks (INTEROP) program. In an area that is moving as rapidly as is the interoperability, sharing, and archival of scientific data, a PI meeting is a venue for accomplishing more and varied kinds of objectives. We hosted an unconventional PI meeting/workshop with a two-fold goal:  to foster exchange of information about projects in the DataNet and INTEROP programs, and 2.) to plant first seeds for long lived, collective effort that advances scientific sharing and preservation worldwide.  Nearly 60 participants attended the meeting, shown in the included picture taken during the workshop.  Participants included four NSF officers, representatives from NOAA, NASA, Germany, Netherlands, the Library of Congress, 10 DataNet programs and 9 INTEROP programs.  It also included Ph.D. and MasterÃ†s students and postdoctoral fellows largely from Indiana University who helped with the workshop and in process learned from experts in the field of data science.  The intellectual contributions the workshop were achieved through a program that drew on notions from the "unconference" where topics emerge spontaneously with the goal of fostering emergent ideas or efforts.  A number of topics emerged as important for discussion.   On day one of the workshop, five separate subgroups were formed on the following topics:  Storage and funding models; clouds, libraries, repositories Metadata and semantics Building a lasting coordination group (Science Data Consortium)  Data citation Education and curriculum for data curation   On the second day new topics emerged while some of the topics emerged a second time for continued discussion. These topics included  Science Data Consortium  Storage and funding models; clouds, libraries, repositories, cont. What will Data Realm look like in 20 years? Interoperability between DataNet infrastructures: what is possible today?   The notion of the Science Data Consortium first emerged from the workshop with the following guiding principles: It must be open in that all can contribute effort, ideas, code.  The deliverables or objectives of a Science Data Consortium are to be knowledge exchange, and recommendations/standards (either with or without supporting code) for use to simplify work of domain scientists.  Information is to be delivered to the communities we serve.  The Charter is an early deliverable.   The interested participants from the workshop preferred a stronger grassroots orientation, at to start.  It was decided as a next step to establish a small group to clarify the vision and move things forward.   The advisory group once established post workshop went on to undertake a number of outreach activities, described below, that eventually contributed to the Research Data Alliance http://rd-alliance.org/.
