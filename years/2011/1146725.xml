<AbstractNarration>The S-locus receptor kinase SRK was initially identified as the stigma epidermal cell receptor that is activated by its cognate pollen coat-localized SCR ligand and is responsible for perception of 'self' pollen in the self-incompatibility (SI) response. Recently, mutagenesis of the SI response in a transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana self-incompatible model developed in the investigators' laboratory demonstrated that SRK also functions as a signaling molecule in pistil development, where its SCR-independent activity promotes cell proliferation in style and ovary, thus enhancing pistil elongation and causing stigma exsertion. The project will use molecular and genetic methods to investigate the tight integration of the cell-to-cell interactions that underlie rejection of 'self' pollen in SI with the overall pistil developmental program.  The study is expected to identify genes required for a cell's competence for SRK signaling, genes responsible for cross-talk between pollen-stigma interactions and pistil elongation, and possibly genes encoding components of the SRK signaling cascade. The project has the potential to alter current views of SRK-mediated signaling, the evolution of SI, and the poorly-understood association between SI and morphological adaptations that promote out-breeding, such as stigma exsertion. More generally, the study will contribute to answering the key question of how organisms modify their developmental programs to generate novel designs in structure and function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train post-doctoral researchers and provide them with opportunities to integrate teaching and research, within the highly-interactive and intellectually stimulating Cornell environment. The PIs are committed to providing undergraduate students with research experience and training in basic methods of plant molecular genetics, both within the framework of NSF-funded projects and in formal coursework. Their participation in 'Lab Experience for Teachers', a course designed for Masters students training to become science teachers should also contribute to the transfer of scientific knowledge into elementary and high schools.</AbstractNarration>

These transgenic plants were used in this project for genetic, molecular, biochemical, and evolutionary studies of the Brassicaceae SI system.  Expression of functional tagged versions of the receptor provided an important tool for analyzing features critical for its sub-cellular targeting and function. Live-cell imaging of the tagged receptor showed the receptor to be localized to the plasma membrane in cells of the stigma surface and demonstrated that this localization is critical for the perception of self pollen.  In planta structure-function analysis of engineered variants of the SRK ligand-binding domain pinpointed specific amino-acid residues required for self-pollen recognition, and these residues were found to largely coincide with residues that form contact points between ligand and receptor in the newly-solved high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the receptor-ligand protein complex.  As a means of gaining insight into how the activation of the receptor by its ligand leads to inhibition of "self" pollen, the expression of candidate genes was manipulated to investigate their potential role in the SI response. Additionally, in an extension of our previous discovery that the receptor functions in pistil elongation as well as pollen recognition, genetic and molecular studies showed that the ubiquitous plant hormone auxin is a critical point of convergence between SI and pistil development and that the dampening of auxin responses in stigma epidermal cells promotes SI.  The results impact, not only the field of SI, but also our understanding of the various mechanisms that underlie ligand-dependent receptor activation, of the co-evolution of receptors and their ligands in plants and other organisms, and of genetic and evolutionary coordination between pollen-pistil interactions and pistil development.
