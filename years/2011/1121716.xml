<AbstractNarration>The origin of cooperation is one of the major transitions in biology, is intimately tied to family-living and the evolution of complex animal societies including humans, and helps explain the impacts of certain pests like termites. Why do some kinds of animals form complex societies, while other closely related ones do not? Are complex insect societies similar to those of vertebrates? Although researchers have long recognized similarities between social vertebrates and invertebrates, the several conspicuous differences among social animal groups have historically divided the field of social biology, leading to distinct terminologies, approaches, and theoretical frameworks. Few studies have systematically examined how explanations for sociality in vertebrates or insects are related, or whether they apply to other family-living species. One promising approach to resolving these issues involves testing different modes of social evolution in a single group of related species that exhibits a range of social systems. This comparative study will evaluate the evolution of family-living within a socially diverse group that unusually exhibits traits of both social vertebrates and insects, the sponge-dwelling snapping shrimp, Synalpheus. Using molecular methods, this research will focus on how the cohesive (kinship) and disruptive (conflict) influences of group-living interact to mold social organization and how these interactions vary among closely related species, which may serve as proxies for stages in the early evolution of family-living. The results will illuminate several key problems, including the evolution of altruism and cooperation, the roles of family structure and conflict in the evolution of sociality, transitions among social systems, and links between social evolution and the diversification of morphology and behavior. Social shrimp have demonstrated high value in public education and outreach, and findings on the evolution of family-living in these charismatic marine animals will be disseminated to K-12 schools and the general public via an award-winning website and school lectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Across the animal kingdom, many species live in complex societies, including humans. From mammals to microbes, the diversity of social life on earth is staggering. Why should we care about sociality? One compelling reason is that social species&mdash;including our own&mdash;have come to dominate the earth. Social insects, for example, account for about half of all of the biomass of the planetÃ†s biological diversity. Yet, despite the great diversity and abundance of social species, there is only one group of social organisms that live in the sea: the sponge-dwelling shrimps (Synalpheus). These shrimps, which live inside marine sponges, include &lt;50 species and span nearly the complete range of animal social lifestyles occurring on earth. Social shrimps offer an important  window on general problems in animal social evolution because they share traits with both social insects and social vertebrates.     This project was designed to understand how social life evolves on earth using Synalpheus as a model system. We were able to combine extensive museum collections, experiments, and genetic analyses to provide broad insights into the evolution of social diversity, and specifically key questions about how kinship and conflict interact to mold social organization.

Intellectual Merits:     (1) Alternative evolutionary trajectories in social evolution   The project combined 25 years of data to identify the major categories of social life in Synalpheus, and then explored evolutionary transitions among them. Molecular data confirmed that evolutionary trajectories among pair-forming, simple social, and complex "eusocial" species took different paths, with simple and complex forms of social systems occupying different evolutionary endpoints. Thus, among social shrimps, and likely other animals, highly social species with a single queen and less social species with multiple queens evolved independently.  (2) The consequences of conflict on kin structure  Evaluating kin structure in colonies of Synalpheus turned out to be challenging because we discovered that many species (1) have large genomes&mdash;up to 10 times the size of the human genome&mdash;and (2) appear to be highly inbred. The finding of high inbreeding emerged as extremely important to understanding sociality in this group. Conflict varies with social complexity and appears to influence variation in social structure within species (see below). Kin structure also varies with social complexity, but seems to be a consequence rather than a cause of sociality. That is, the most socially complex species have had the most inbred colonies.

In short, kinship has both positive (through high relatedness) and negative (through inbreeding and potentially colony collapse) impacts on social evolution.     (3) The transition to worker sterility and caste differentiation  Unlike many social insects, workers in social Synalpheus are not sterile. Moreover, experimental manipulations demonstrated that female&mdash;but not male&mdash;workers are suppressed by queens. This sex-specific social suppression is similar to the situation in many social vertebrates and has im...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
