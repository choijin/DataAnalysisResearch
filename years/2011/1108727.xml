<AbstractNarration>An interpretation of quantum invariants of links in 3-manifolds within the framework of classical topology presented a challenge for a long time. The most convincing explanation of their nature came from Witten's work which related these invariants to quantum Chern-Simons theory. However the reason why Jones and HOMFLY-PT polynomials were polynomials in q rather than formal power series in (q-1), as a Quantum Field Theory would suggest, and what is the meaning of the coefficients of these polynomials remained a mystery. A breakthrough came from Khovanov's categorification construction: it turned out that a quantum polynomial is an Euler characteristic of a Z-graded homology associated by a combinatorial construction to a link. An extension of this result to the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariant of links in 3-manifolds is a challenging problem, in part because the WRT invariant is not exactly a polynomial of q and is defined only for q being a root of 1. Recently Khovanov and Rozansky categorified the "stable" polynomial part of the WRT invariant of links in the product of a 2-sphere with a circle. Their construction uses the derived categories of modules over Khovanov's algebras H_n. Rozansky will try to extend this result further to general 3-manifolds. He conjectures that this might be done by deforming the algebras H_n into A-infinity algebras, thus reducing their Z-grading to a periodic Z_r grading which would correspond to the associated parameter q being the root of 1. A similar trick worked to construct a categorification of the SU(N) HOMFLY-PT polynomial from its 2-variable version. In addition to categorifying combinatorially the WRT invariant, Rozansky will try to categorify Khovanov's categorificaiton construction of the Jones polynomial. This idea is based on a similarity between the objects used in the Kamnitzer-Cautis version of Khovanov's categorification and the 2-category associated to a holomorphic symplectic manifold in the joint work of Kapustin, Rozansky and Saulina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discovery of quantum invariants such as the Jones and HOMFLY-PT polynomials of links in a 3-sphere and the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of colored links in a 3-manifold opened a new chapter in 3-dimensional topology. In contrast to the Alexander polynomial which was very efficient in establishing the topological properties of links, the relation between these new invariants and classical topology is indirect. It seems that the purpose of quantum invariants is to establish deep links between 3-dimensional topology and other branches of Mathematics and Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Khovanov's categorification of the Jones polynomial was an important step in this direction: it showed that algebraic geometry could be "married" to 3-dimensional topology. Witten suggests that a superstring-inspired 6-dimensional QFT links together Khovanov homology and Langlands duality. By using the methods of homological algebra, Rozansky will try to extend Khovanov's categorification program from links in a 3-sphere to links in general 3-manifolds. He will also try to raise categorification by one level through associating a category rather than a homology to a link. If true, this might suggest that the underlying QFT is 7-dimensional rather than 6-dimensional.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   During the last year of the project I conducted two major research activities.          1. In collaboration with my graduate student Michael Abel we studied the filtration on the HOMFLY-PT link homology associated with virtual links. This relation is rather unexpected, since virtual links were introduced by L. Kauffman from a purely combinatorial perspective. Extending the HOMFLY-PT link homology to virtual links is notoriously hard, except for the case of the Jones and Alexander polynomials. However, it turns out that HOMFLY-PT homology extends to virtual links very naturally.    Our research with Abel shows that the categorified elementary braid is filtered by the identity braid and the virtual braid, and this filtration extends to the homology of the braid closure. We proved the invariance of this `virtual' filtration under the first and second Reidemeister moves. Although we were not able to prove the invariance under the third Reidemeister move, we showed that filtration may change only in a restricted way, which means that if two link diagrams of the same link yield different filtrations then we can give a bound on the number of third Reidemeister moves required to transform one diagram into the other.         If the virtual filtration is invariand under the third Reidemeister move, it is expected to correspond to the `fourth grading' on the HOMFLY-PT homology observed experimentally by Gukov, Gorsky and Stosic.         2. In collaboration with Alexei Oblomkov we studied the relation between the HOMFLY-PT link homology and coherent sheaves on Hilbert schemes on C2. This relation was noticed for torus knots by Gorsky, Oblomkov, Rasmussen and Shende: to a knot they associated a sheaf such that its homology would equal the HOMFLY-PT homology.    We were guided by a similarity between a vector space associated to a `defect unknot' in the topological QFT considered by Gukov, Kapustin and Witten in relation to the geometric Langlands duality, and the HOMFLY-PT homology of the unknot colored by a fundamental representation. We had a breakthrough in April 2015, having developed a method of associating a sheaf (in fact, a matrix factorization) on a certain Hilbert scheme-related fibration to a braid in such a way that the composition of braids becomes the convolution of sheaves and the sheaf homology yields the HOMFLY-PT homology of the braid closure. This work is in progress and it seems very promising, since it relates link homology to `brane physics' and Langlands duality in a rather unexpected way.
