<AbstractNarration>There is a massive ongoing reorganization of North Atlantic seafloor spreading geometry occurring at present south of Iceland. The previous orthogonal ridge/transform staircase geometry typical of slow-spreading ridge systems is being progressively changed to the present non-segmented oblique spreading geometry on the Reykjanes Ridge as transform faults are successively eliminated. This reorganization is presently interpreted as a thermal phenomenon, with a pulse of warmer mantle expanding away from the Iceland plume causing a progressive change in subaxial mantle rheology from brittle to ductile, so that transform faults can no longer be maintained. This explanation is nearly universally assumed to be true &amp; is used to infer important conclusions about deep Earth &amp; lithospheric geodynamics that are also nearly universally assumed to be true.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will undertake a month-long marine geophysical expedition to collect the multibeam, magnetics &amp; gravity data that would provide a definitive test between the fundamentally different thermal &amp; tectonic hypotheses for exactly how the Iceland plume (or whatever form of mantle convection or heterogeneity creates Iceland) caused the reorganization of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge south of Iceland. An important result of this test will be that modelers will either be confident that their thermal Reykjanes Ridge reorganization models are providing accurate information about Earth's behavior, or that they can confidently begin to model the correct mechanism instead. An additional benefit of this project will be the first accurate map of the Bight transform fault/fracture zone complex, known to be an important pathway for westward flow of North Atlantic mid-water circulation across the Reykjanes Ridge boundary, an important control on global climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Education and Human Resources&lt;br/&gt;Resolving the origin of this large-scale plate boundary reorganization has important implications beyond testing a long-held fundamental assumption of Iceland mantle plume geodynamics. Thermal plume pulses have been interpreted as leading to regional uplift/subsidence events that modulate ocean currents and affect climate and sedimentation patterns throughout the North Atlantic. The proposed study will examine alternative tectonic explanations related to the mechanism and timing of the sequential elimination of transform faults in this area and thus has implications for inferred links among these phenomena. The proposed work will involve significant international collaboration with Icelandic scientists, as has our previous work in the area. The project will support a graduate student who will work on the survey data as a primary part of his/her thesis. As in our previous cruise we plan to mentor several undergraduate students at sea through the NSF-funded Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Internship program and thus further NSF education and human resource development goals. Results will be integrated into classroom teaching by the P.I.s, and thus disseminated to a fairly wide audience including many underrepresented minority groups in Hawaii, enhancing scientific infrastructure. We think that improved understanding of this obviously important plate boundary reorganization will form an invaluable tool for further research and teaching, and we will make these data sets available on a project website. We think a movie of Reykjanes Ridge evolution projected onto a sphere could ultimately be a valuable teaching aid and museum display.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There is a major ongoing reorganization of North Atlantic seafloor spreading occurring at present south of Iceland, from a typical ridge/transform geometry to the present anomalous oblique spreading geometry without transform faults. This has usually been interpreted as a thermal phenomenon, with a pulse of warmer mantle expanding away from the Iceland plume causing transform faults to be progressively eliminated on the Reykjanes Ridge. This is certainly the most obvious and arguably the type-example of active plate boundary reorganization, so it is somewhat surprising that this thermal mechanism has had near universal acceptance here but nowhere else. Most if not all other progressive seafloor spreading reorganizations are equally confidently thought to result from the tectonic rift propagation mechanism. If propagating rifts were the mechanism causing the change in the North America &ndash; Eurasia plate boundary geometry, the tip of the reorganization would be expected to be near the first transform fault south of Iceland, the Bight transform fault near 56.8&deg;N, rather than in the extensively surveyed area 200 km farther north where the thermal reorganization model predicted the reorganization tip should be, so in 2013 we surveyed the essentially unsurveyed area surrounding our new predicted tip. Our investigation shows that the reorganization tip is in our survey area, just north of the Bight transform. However, our results show that this is not a typical propagating rift reorganization in which one ridge simply replaces another. Instead all propagation and resulting ridge jumps are small-scale, within the plate boundary zone. These small ridge jumps and/or asymmetric spreading of individual ridge segments cause them to migrate laterally to shorten transform offsets.&nbsp; When ridge-segment offsets become less than about the width of the plate boundary zone (~10-15 km) a rapid reconfiguration of the axis to a linear oblique configuration occurs, re-establishing its original locus with respect to the mantle ~55 Ma, immediately after initial Greenland &ndash; Eurasia rifting.</p> <p>The reassembly of the axis over its original locus geometrically explains why it is now spreading ~30&deg; obliquely as this is the angular plate motion change that produced the segmentation ~37 Ma. The segmented Reykjanes Ridge is progressively and systematically reassembling itself segment-by-segment to its original unsegmented configuration from north to south, despite having to spread obliquely to do this, indicating a strong organizing mechanism. This project resulted in a new geodynamic model for this reorganization, sub-axial propagating buoyant mantle upwelling, that provides a conceptual alternative to the prevailing pulsing plume model and explains the existence of the V-shaped topographic ridges flanking the Reykjanes Ridge in terms of plate tectonic processes rather than requiring extremely fast mantle flow. This is a transformative change to our understanding of plate tectonics and geodynamics in the North Atlantic.</p> <p>Two students participated on our cruise through the NSF-funded Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) program, which provides opportunities for practical at-sea internship experience to students, furthering NSF education and human resource development goals.
