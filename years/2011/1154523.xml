<AbstractNarration>The Scholarship, Leadership, and Mentoring in the STEM Fields (SLMS) project at Tougaloo College is supporting 15 students with 4-year scholarships as they earn degrees in science, computer science, or mathematics.  To augment traditional studies, the SLMS program also is focusing on leadership training in addition to community building.  SLMS scholars are benefiting from individual mentoring from a faculty team of two and from targeted academic support through the college's Science Success Center.  In addition, SLMS scholars are being given opportunities for internships with workforce partners as well as research opportunities with on-campus faculty.  SLMS scholars are being invited to take advantage of intensive career counseling in addition to leadership skill-building workshops and seminars.  Scholars are participating in the ACTIVE seminar series in which they are building their scientific writing and presentation skills while also interfacing with the invited distinguished faculty visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The SLMS program is removing one of the major hindrances concerning minority student success in STEM disciplines, namely financial need.  With a revamped curriculum, Tougaloo is positioned to increase STEM student engagement and build hands-on investigative and critical thinking skills.  This program is providing data on the impact of financial support on recruitment and retention-to-degree of African-American students at a small private HBCU .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The project is building on a strong base to provide everything a student needs to attend college and to succeed as a major in a STEM area.  Academic enrichment, professional development, and a hands-on approach to mentoring are at the core of this program that is graduating well-rounded, scientifically literate, community-committed, minority students who are increasing the diversity in the STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>
