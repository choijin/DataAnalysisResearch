<AbstractNarration>Explosive growth in volume and complexity of data exacerbates the key challenge facing the management of massive data in a way that fundamentally improves the ease and efficacy of their usage. Exascale storage systems in general rely on hierarchically structured namespace that leads to severe performance bottlenecks and makes it hard to support real-time queries on multi-dimensional attributes. Thus, existing storage systems, characterized by the hierarchical directory tree structure, are not scalable in light of the explosive growth in both the volume and the complexity of data. As a result, directory-tree based hierarchical namespace has become restrictive, difficult to use, and limited in scalability for today's large-scale file systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates a novel semantic-aware namespace scheme to provide dynamic and adaptive namespace management and support typical file-based operations in Exascale file systems. The project leverages semantic correlations among files and exploits the evolution of metadata attributes to support customized namespace management, with the end goal of efficiently facilitating file identification and end users data lookup. This project provides significant performance improvements for existing file systems in Exascale file systems. Since Exascale file systems constitute one of the backbones of the high-performance computing infrastructure, the semantic-aware techniques also benefits a great number of scientific and engineering data-intensive applications. This project strengthens the ongoing development of high performance computing infrastructures at both UNL and UMaine. The project enhances undergraduate and graduate education at both participating institutions and outreach to K-12 in UMaine via an ongoing NSF-funded ITEST program.</AbstractNarration>

In this project, we have developed a Semantic-Aware Naming scheme for Exascale file systems, called SANE, which provides dynamic and adaptive namespace management for large storage systems. SANE introduces a new generic naming methodology that dynamically aggregates correlated files into flat but readily manageable representations based on different contexts. It builds files? namespaces by leveraging semantic correlations among files and exploits the evolution of metadata attributes to support customized namespace management. We have made the following main contributions within the research area of large-scale storage systems.  (1) We developed ANTELOPE, a scalable distributed data management scheme, which can bridge the gap between network architecture and data placement in large-scale cloud data centers.  (2) We proposed a searchable distributed file system, Propeller, which partitions the namespace according to file-access patterns in order to expose access locality and parallelism to accelerate the file-indexing process.  (3) We designed a new paradigm for organizing file metadata for next-generation file systems, called SmartStore, by exploiting file semantic information to provide efficient and scalable complex queries while enhancing system scalability and functionality.  (4) We proposed a hot random off-loading (HRO) algorithm for hybrid storage systems (SSDs and hard drives) with dynamic data migration.  (5) We proposed a near-real-time and cost-effective searchable data analytics methodology, called FAST, to explore and exploit the semantic correlation within and among datasets via correlation-aware hashing and manageable flat-structured addressing.  (6) We proposed a novel distributed NameNode architecture (DNN) based on the flat namespace that improves both the availability and scalability of HDFS.  (7) We proposed a distributed file-search service, called Propeller, which utilizes a special file-access pattern, called access-causality, to partition file-indices in order to expose substantial access locality and parallelism to accelerate the file-indexing process.  (8) To reduce the computational overhead in conventional delta compression, we proposed Edelta that is a fast delta compression approach based on a word-enlarging process that exploits word-content locality.  (9) We proposed the Asymmetric Extremum chunking algorithm (AE), a new Content-Defined Chunking (CDC) algorithm that significantly improves the chunking throughput while providing comparable or better deduplication efficiency.  (10) To address space contention in main memory and data fragmentation on disks in data deduplication, we proposed a Performance-Oriented I/O Deduplication approach (POD) to improving the I/O performance of primary storage systems in the Cloud.  (11) We proposed the X-Ray Dedup approach to identify the redundant files across the (differently) compressed files and uncompressed files in the cloud storage environment.  (12) We proposed FastCDC, a Fast and efficient Content-Defined Chunking (CDC) approach to efficiently detect data redundancy.  (13) We proposed a hybrid redundant data distribution approach, called HyRD, to improve the cloud storage availability in Cloud-of-Clouds by exploiting the workload characteristics and the diversity of cloud providers.  (14) We proposed a Workload-Aware IO Outsourcing scheme (WAIO) to improve the VM live storage migration efficiency.  We disseminated these new techniques through peer-reviewed journal and conference papers in premier venues. The research outcomes have been employed in large data storage systems.
