<AbstractNarration>Our world's continents have been compared to both icebergs and onions.  They are like icebergs in that they consist of a buoyant solid floating on a sea of deeper denser material, and also in that they are mostly unseen, with keels extending down to 250 km (150 mi) beneath the Earth's surface.  They are like onions in that they consist of a central core surrounded by a sequence of younger layers that has grown around it.  The process by which continents were formed remains a geologic mystery. Two of the keys to that mystery lie in the structure of the deepest part of the central core (or "craton", to use the geologic term) and of the boundaries between the layers ("sutures" or "terrain boundaries").  Earthscope's Transportable Array (TA) is a tremendous asset to seismologists studying Earth structure, because it provides extremely high-quality data for the entire land area of the US, a region that includes many important geological features, including plate boundaries, rift zones and hot spots.  However, its impact on the "origin of the continents" question is limited, because the core of the continent is not beneath its footprint, but rather lies a little to the north, in Quebec.  Our project, timed to take place when the TA is operating in eastern US, is synergistic and provides a companion data set specifically targeted at the cratonic core and surrounding terrain boundaries.  We are deploying seismometers in a line stretching from coastal Maine (the edge of the continent) to northern Quebec (its core).  The density of stations is variable, and is highest in the three places where terrain boundaries are crossed.  We use earth-imaging techniques to test three significant hypotheses: 1) that the bottom of the continental keel is a distinct interface that deepens towards the cratonic core; 2) that the properties of the continent are regionalized (that is, each layer of the onion has its own recognizable properties), with terrain boundaries having a signature that extends right down to the bottom; and 3) that the part of the Earth below the bottom of the continents (the "asthenosphere") is flowing around the keel (in the same sense that ocean water flows around the keel of an iceberg).  The project is supporting two graduate students, providing them with a venue to develop their professional skills as both researcher and teachers. Seismometer operations and data analysis involves undergraduate research assistants, in both summer internship and academic-semester employment modes. During the summer, educational features are incorporated into the fieldtrips to better introduce these undergraduates to the science underpinning the project and more generally to prepare them for a career in science. These include daily science discussions, stops to view important geological features and visits with scientists from collaborating institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project was partly a data-gathering effort in northeastern North America and partly an exploration of the interior of the Earth in that region.  The years 2013-2016 were a time of intense seismological observations in northeastern North America, because of the Transportable Array, a temporary deployment of 300+ observing stations, the operation of which was made possible through US Government funding.  Our project provided supplementary data by operating 30+ additional stations in parts of Quebec and Maine with special geologic significance.  Successfully collected, our data has now been submitted to the national data center, where it is freely available.  We analyzed the new data using geotomography, a technique similar to medical tomography that produces an image of the interior of the Earth.  We made several discoveries, including a very surprising one:  At depths between 100-300 km (60-180 miles), the Earth beneath southern New England and easternmost New York State (USA) is unusually hot, so much so that the rock is at or near its melting point.  This region has been nicknamed the Northern Appalachian Anomaly, or NAA, for short. This feature is caused by convection currents in the Earth that are bringing up hot material from deeper depths.  These currents seem to be concentrated at the coast, where the ancient rocks of the continent transition into the much younger rock of the Atlantic Ocean. The heat associated with this upwelling is warming up and eroding the lithosphere, the roughly 100 km (60 mile) thick layer of cool rock just below the Earth?s surface, and causing pieces of it to fall off (delaminate) and sink.  We find evidence for erosion and delamination only beneath a region in and around the Green Mountains (Vermont, USA).  There, seismic waves are unusually slow and spring temperatures are unusually warm, both of which are signatures of heat being close to the Earth?s surface.  The lithosphere above the rest of the NAA is less affected by the upwelling, except near its southern and western edges, where some alteration may be beginning.  We believe that the phenomenon of "continental edge upwelling" is responsible for many of the unusual geologic features found in New England, such as its relatively high elevation and copious microearthquakes. We are continuing to study whether the same phenomenon occurs elsewhere and whether it might be responsible for enigmatic geological features at continetal margins, worldwide.
