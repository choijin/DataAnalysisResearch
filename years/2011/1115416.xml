<AbstractNarration>In this effort the investigator and his student will consider developments of discontinuous Galerkin methods suitable for solving fractional differential equations. Motivated by a series of preliminary but very encouraging computational experiments, local discontinuous Galerkin methods for both fractional ordinary and partial differential equations will be considered. These initial computational observations supports a number of conjectures and these will guide the development and analysis of the proposed methods. While specific target applications are not considered detail, problems of a more practical character such as computational efficiency, multi-dimensional problems, and alternative formulations will be addressed in the latter part of the effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the notion of fractional calculus is as old as that of classical calculus introduced by Newton, the development and analysis of fractional calculus and fractional equations is not nearly as mature. However, during the last few decades fractional calculus has emerged as a natural and important description for a broad range of non-classical phenomena in the applied sciences and engineering. Examples can be found anomalous transport processes, sub-diffusion, and problems dominated by memory effects. Applications of such models are found in wide range of areas such as porous, visco-elastic, or biological flows, flow of crude oil in reservoirs, fusion plasma problems, modeling of properties of complex materials, financial markets etc. The planned activities seek to develop efficient and accurate computational techniques to allow application scientists and engineers to more effectively solve this important class of models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goals of this project has been to develop, analyse and apply novel computational methods to solve problems modeled using fractional calculus. Fractional calculus is emerging as being of increasing importance to model a variety of problems in the engineering and life sciences, e.g., flows in porous media or strongly anisotropic problems, problems with memory etc  The project has made advanced in three areas  1) Developed, analyzed and applied methods for fractional problems based on discontinuous Galerkin methods. These development illustrate, among other things, the ability of such methods to achieve full accuracy when the fractional parameter changes. It is the only known approach for achieving this.  2) Development and application of adaptive hp-FEM methods to solve fractional Laplace equations and shown their favorable properties for image processing. The results show superior performance when compared to traditional methods and, among other things, are well suited for filtering and de-noising of spliced images.  3) Development and analysis of a novel family of methods that allows for the compression of long temporal tails in the approximation of Caputo integrals. These methods are based on Kernel compression methods and offers a complete error theory to enable a balanced approach between computational efficiency and accuracy.
