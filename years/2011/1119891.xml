<AbstractNarration>Invasive non-native species create large economic losses and have many negative effects on native plants and animals. Spotted knapweed, Centaurea stoebe, is classified as a noxious invasive plant in the western U.S. Most studies of invasive species have been carried out on long-established invasions. However, the most important processes and factors responsible for successful invasions may occur during the early stages of an invasion. It is newly invasive and increasing rapidly in New York State, providing a rare opportunity to study an invasion in the early stages. This study will focus on how local, small populations of spotted knapweed are changing. The study will be conducted for a large number of small, isolated populations of spotted knapweed on Long Island and in Adirondack Park. The researchers will use measurements on the populations and their environments to construct mathematical models predicting how spotted knapweed populations may change over time. Using data on population sizes and on individual plant growth, survival and reproduction, the investigators will address three basic questions: (1) Are most of these small, isolated populations of spotted knapweed increasing at about the same rate, or are many populations actually growing slowly or shrinking, with just a few successful 'jackpot' populations growing very rapidly? (2) What properties of the environment are most likely to be responsible for population growth rates in each region? (3) What aspects of individual plant performance (for example, seed production vs. plant survival) are most important in determining whether a population is expanding quickly or not? These answers will also help scientists to understand and predict the progress of other invasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasions are a special case of the expansion of a species into a new geographic range. This study will provide answers to some fundamental ecological questions about the early stages of range expansion, and also to predict how plant populations expand or contract as climates change. Because invasions are easiest to control in the early stages, the results of this study will be directly useful to land managers responsible for preventing, controlling, and managing invasive species.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of our project was to study the early stages of a plant species becoming invasive, and to document how the process of biological invasion unfolds across a landscape. The plant we studied is spotted knapweed, <em>Centaurea stoebe</em>, a low-growing perennial plant that dominates millions of acres of rangeland in the Western U.S. but is only recently becoming invasive in the East. We focused on two regions with contrasing climates, topography, and extent of human impact: the Adirondack mountain region in upstate New York, and the highly suburbanized landscape of central and eastern Long Island, New York. We located hundreds of mostly small, isolated populations of spotted knapweed, recorded their locations and population densities, and for some populations, tagged and followed plants (thousands of plants!) over time. We returned to the populations regularly over a period of 3 years to measure how they changed, and to record the establishment, growth, survival and reproduction of the tagged plants. We also carried out experiments to determine how long seeds survived in the soil. We wanted to know if invasions appear to be due to all or most of the populations growing rapidly, or to some growing rapidly while others are not. We found that most of the populations were either stable in density or even declining over time, but that some populations appear to be growing very rapidly. We are building models of population growth to determine which aspects of the plants' lives are most responsible for contributing to invasiveness and high rates of population growth, and what environmental factors are most closely associated with high population densities and rapid population growth. One advance we made in carrying out this research is developing the concept of studying plant demography--the lives and deaths of the individuals in a population--across broad landscapes, rather than only at a local level. We feel that this perspective, which we call landscape demography, will offer new insights into many ecological processes, including range shifts and responses to changing environments. The results of this work may also prove to be useful in helping land managers and policy makers who are working to limit the spread of noxious invasive plants to set priorities and focus their efforts on controlling the most problematic populations.
