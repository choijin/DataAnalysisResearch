<AbstractNarration>This research intends to determine the importance of genetic variation in the two separate genomes that occur in all animal cells: the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. These genomes work together to form the enzymes in one metabolic pathway, the Oxidative Phosphorylation metabolic pathway. The Oxidative Phosphorylation pathway makes the vast majority of ATP energy produced in animals breathing oxygen. To investigate the importance of genetic variation in this pathway, the research goals include 1) determining the sequencing variation among all the genes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, (2) quantifying the differences in RNA expression for these genes, and (3) determining the functional and biochemical consequences of both protein polymorphisms and gene expression. To understand the naturally occurring genetic differences, this research uses evolutionary analyses of the two genomes among populations of the salt marsh minnow, F. heteroclitus, that are distributed along a steep thermal cline where southern populations are &gt;12Â°C warmer than northern populations. This clinal variation in temperature is associated with adaptive changes in enzyme kinetics and enzyme expression. This approach integrates the physiological effects of temperature on protein variants, nucleotide polymorphisms and quantitative variation in RNA expression, and defines biologically important differences by defining changes that have evolved by natural selection (i.e., are evolutionary adaptations). Combining the discovery of nucleotide variation, quantitative variation in RNA expression, and the functional consequences of this variation will enhance our understanding of the evolution of two genomes and how constraints and conflict within and between genomes affect evolutionary processes. By analyzing a complete metabolic pathway, we will gain a broad understanding of how adaptive evolution affects changes among many interacting genes to achieve adaptive physiological changes. Thus, these data provide a unique perspective of how global warming may affect the physiology and evolution of animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This research will enhance undergraduate and graduate student training and education in scientific research using DNA sequencing, biochemistry and physiology. To enhance the participation of under-represented groups, minority undergraduates will be recruited through our interactions with science programs that are geared for minorities at the University of Miami. Additionally, society and the science community will benefit from the empirical data on the relationship between changing thermal environments and nucleotide variation across many whole mitochondrial genomes. These data, which will be publically available, will provide a rich database for the Fundulus research community, physiologists working on mitochondrial function, and researchers modeling haploid genome evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Within animals cells are two genomes: the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.  The nuclear genome has more than 99.9% of all protein coding genes, and these genes are inherited from both parents.  The second genome, the mitochondrial genome, only codes for 13 proteins, and these mitochondrial genes are inherited only from the maternal (female) parents. These 13 mitochondrial proteins work with the nuclear proteins to form a critical metabolic pathway: the Oxidative Phosphorylation (OxPhos) pathway.  The OxPhos pathway is responsible for nearly all energy production, and mutations in the OxPhos genes are responsible for a majority of inborn human metabolic disease. Clearly, both these genomes have to work together to produce the necessary energy for successful living. Yet, there is little evidence that the natural genetic variation among these genomes is critically important in natural populations.      The research supported by the National Science Foundation investigated how genetic variation in both the nuclear and mitochondria affected OxPhos metabolism.  This research investigated whether there are combinations of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes that do better (produce more energy) than other combinations. To accomplish this, the metabolic rates (~energy production) in cardiac and liver mitochondria were quantified to discover significant differences in OxPhos metabolism that depend on both the nuclear and mitochondrial genome and how environment modulated these differences.  A synthesis of this research, which produced fourteen science publications, can be distilled to two major points: 1) Differences among genomes are modulated by the environment such that genetic differences are often hidden.  That is, genetic variation can cause changes among individuals? performances, but these differences disappear in some environments; 2) Among individuals with different mitochondrial genomes, there are interactions between the mitochondria and nuclear genetic variations that affect OxPhos function.  This interaction between genomes is one of the most important findings because it suggests that nuclear genetic variation can have a positive or negative effect depending on which mitochondrial genome an individual inherits from his or her mother.  These data suggest that metabolic fitness is not simply a function of the mitochondria but instead is reliant on mitochondrial-nuclear interactions.       In addition to contribution to science and our understanding of how both genomes affect physiological function, this award had Broader Impacts by enhancing the education of graduate students, undergraduate students and under-represented individuals. Four Ph.D. students were supported by this award, as well as two visiting students from France and Italy.  This award also supported twelve undergraduates from the University of Miami who have worked for one or more years in the laboratory performing their own independent research.  Seven of these students have graduated with honors thesis research projects based on the research supported by NSF.  More broadly, we have reached out to under-represented students from a community college (Miami-Dade College) to involve eight summer students in genomics research.  We also have trained a visiting scientist from the community college in bioinformatics approaches to teach to her own students.
