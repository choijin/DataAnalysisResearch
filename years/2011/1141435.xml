<AbstractNarration>Determination of regional fluid flow and gas flux rates for a continental plateau using cosmogenic and radiogenic noble gas isotopes&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Kieft, Tullis Onstott&lt;br/&gt;New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Until recently, the only available approach for quantifying regional-scale subsurface fluid flow was by dating ancient groundwater using cosmogenic chlorine-36 or radiogenic noble gas analyses.  However, cosmogenic chlorine-36 is difficult to quantify in saline groundwater, and radiogenic noble gas dating relies on too many poorly constrained assumptions.  A new cosmogenic isotope method based on krypton-81 is more accurate due to well constrained input rates and is made possible by developments in laser-based atom trap trace analysis. This project will compare cosmogenic krypton-81 dating to radiogenic noble gas isotope data in deep fracture water in the Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa, for which considerable background data already exist as part of ongoing geomicrobiology investigations, and in the nearby Bushveld Igneous Complex.  The investigators will collect gases from deep fracture waters sampled in deep South African mines using a novel degassing system, while preventing air contamination.  Gas samples will then be purified and sent to Argonne National Laboratories for krypton-81 analysis.  Other tracers, including radiogenic noble gases, will be quantified by traditional mass spectrometric methods.  The subsurface residence times derived from groundwater dating will enable: 1) a better understanding of the physical and geochemical processes associated with meteoric water flow through fractured rock containing saline fluids,  2) a better calibration of the flux of radiogenic noble gases, abiogenic hydrocarbons and hydrogen from the continental crust, 3) the temporal delineation of a potential paleoclimate record stored in the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of the paleometeoric water, 4) a clearer understanding of regional scale fluid flow for this elevated continental plateau for which the uplift rates and cooling have been determined in published reports, 5) better constraints on the rates of cycling of organic and inorganic carbon by the deep continental biosphere, and 6) better constraints on the subsurface residence times of microbial communities, with biogeographical and evolutionary implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is the first time that krypton-81 analyses will be applied to fractured rock fluid systems that are a characteristic of deep continental crust. The combination of radiogenic and cosmogenic noble gas analyses will improve our estimates of the rates of fluid flow, gas diffusion, biogeochemical cycling of elements and microbial evolution in these systems.  This study will also provide better constraints on the water budgets and fluxes in the old mine infrastructure of the Witwatersrand Basin, which in turn will provide the scientific basis for modeling the flooding of these deep mines, which is leading to the development of acid mine conditions today and which will become an increasing problem in the future for South Africa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A radiokrypton method using a long-lived isotope, 81Kr, has been developed recently for determining the age of ancient groundwater, i.e. the time since last contact with the atmosphere.  81Kr is attractive for this purpose because it?s generally thought to be produced solely in the upper atmosphere; its 229,000-year half life makes it possible to measure ages up to ~1.5 million years; and as a noble gas, it?s inert and thus not subject to interfering reactions.  We sought to date groundwater samples collected from deep  (0.6 &ndash; 1.9 km) rock fractures in the Kaapvaal Craton, South Africa.  Previous studies using other dating methods have estimated groundwater ages at these sites in the 1-100 million year range.  Samples were collected from flowing boreholes in gold and diamond mines using packers inserted into the boreholes to prevent exposure to mine air.  81Kr analysis requires that ~100-500 liters of water be degassed on site.  Dissolved gasses were separated from the groundwater using two different types of gas strippers that were connected directly to the packer.  Separation of krypton and also argon gasses from the bulk gas was performed using cryogenic absorption and gas chromatography.  Kr isotopes were quantified by atom-trap trace analysis at Argonne National Laboratory.  Very surprisingly, three of four samples collected in deep gold and diamond mines showed significantly higher 81Kr concentrations than the atmospheric equilibrium value.  Duplicate sampling and analyses in 2012 and 2016 in Beatrix mine were in excellent agreement with each other, and thus the results are unlikely to be analytical artifacts.  This finding indicates that 81Kr can be generated underground in measurable quantities.  This is the first time that underground production of 81Kr has been reported. This finding is in contrast to the long-held paradigm that 81Kr is insensitive to underground production.  Subsurface fissiogenic production is the presumed main production channel for these elevated 81Kr values, and thus previous estimates of the 81Kr fission yield appear to be too low.  The combination of elevated U concentrations, high groundwater residence times and elevated formation temperatures facilitate the accumulation of 81Kr in this specific case. In less extreme environments however,  underground production is very likely not affecting groundwater dating by means of 81Kr data,  The 81Kr-enriched waters of our study are apparently older than the 81Kr dating range (older than ~1.5 million years).  The minimal age of the only sample with a depleted 81Kr signature is 430 thousand years.  Based on these results, more detailed investigations are required for a better understanding of the production and release mechanisms of 81Kr in rocks.
