<AbstractNarration>PROJECT DESCRIPTION &lt;br/&gt;The PKAL Learning Space Collaboratory (LSC) is developing and implementing a workshop involving: "Planning spaces for learning for 21st century undergraduate learners: Translating what we know from learning about learning into policies and practices for shaping, building, and maintaining 21st century learning environments." This effort addresses the gap between research and practice in shaping learning environments. There currently are no easily accessible research-based resources, protocols, or tools through which the impact of space on learning can be explored in the process of planning spaces. The goals of this project are to develop and disseminate such resources and to engage a visible, sustainable community of practice that finds them immediately useful. The developed resources are being disseminated virtually via the LSC website, through regular LSC Teambox discussions, workshops, and other venues, as well as at events sponsored by collaborating partners and other national educational, scientific, and professional organizations. The project activities are offering an opportunity to triangulate the connections among:  findings from current research (on learning, pedagogical practice, organizational change); current practice in the field (e.g., studio class-labs, interdisciplinary STEM labs, high-technology information commons, green buildings); and the work of those now responsible for shaping and sustaining 21st century learning environments. The project team is analyzing experiences, stories, and findings from the field through the lens of their particular expertise, seeking key lessons that would inform those ready to ground their planning efforts on learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE &lt;br/&gt;The effort is building networks for exchanging ideas, critique practice, and identify important issues relative to planning spaces for learning. Through the LSC workshop, new questions are surfacing that will inform future practice in the field and influence future research. Beyond the LSC and its eight collaborating partners, ten national disciplinary, educational, and professional associations are vetting and promoting the use of project resources. The resources are being made accessible through the LSC website, advancing the continuing efforts of researchers and practitioners to understand why spaces matters to the quality and character of the undergraduate learning experience.</AbstractNarration>

This guide is intended to prompt greater attention to the how do we know question throughout the process of planning 21st century learning spaces for 21st century learners. Questions such as:   By what measures can we assess the impact of learning spaces on the learning experience? What are the qualities and affordances of spaces for learning that reflect communal awareness of research-based evidence about how people learn? What are the qualities and affordances of spaces for learning that reflect communal awareness of societal and institutional goals for what 21st century students are to become? What difference will it make on our campus and to whom if we explore the question of how do we know in the process of planning new and repurposed spaces for learning? How does attention to assessing enrich the process of planning? There is now a deeper understanding within communities of academics and architects about the power of learner-centered planning.   There is a substantive body evidence from research and from the field that learning is more robust when students are actively engaged in a social and supportive community; empowered to address problems that are meaningful personally and of import to the world beyond the campus. There is a growing body of evidence of what difference spaces make to the enabling of such learning experiences.
