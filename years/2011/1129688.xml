<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop mathematical models to determine an optimal screening strategy to eliminate pathogens from the blood supply. Blood products are essential for many medical treatments, and because many dangerous pathogens can be transmitted through blood products, blood screening is a vital medical service. For each pathogen, there are often multiple FDA-approved screening tests from which to choose, each having different characteristics (e.g., false-positive and false negative probabilities and cost). Thus, the set of screening tests, testing strategies (e.g., pooled versus individual testing), and decision rules (to classify blood as "safe" based on test outcomes) must be determined to minimize the risk of a transfusion-transmitted infection. This research will result in novel mathematical models and effective solution methodologies to determine an optimal screening strategy. Considerations include the amount of pathogen-free blood falsely discarded through screening, subpopulation specific and uncertain infection rates and test performance parameters, co-infection rates among pathogens, and the limited resources available. Other objectives focus on using this problem to help further the education of engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will contribute to the safety of healthcare delivery by building a better understanding of optimal screening strategies for donated blood, considering unconventional solutions, such as regional, blood group, or sub-population specific testing, which focus on equity in outcomes. As such, it has the potential to be transformative by shifting focus to unconventional testing schemes. This research is driven by the current needs of blood suppliers, and our collaboration with the  American Red Cross, within a multi-disciplinary team of engineers and medical professionals, is an essential component of this project. Further, this research has application beyond blood screening (e.g., organ/tissue transplants, carcinogen testing, food testing). Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary: This project studies the design of post-donation blood screening strategies that minimize the possibility that pathogens are transmitted through blood products, which are essential for a variety of medical treatments and procedures.  Such pathogens include, for example, the human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis viruses, West Nile virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus, syphilis, Dengue virus, and babesiosis, all of which may result in severe, and even life-threatening, consequences if transmitted through blood products. Consequently, a safe blood supply is essential for a well-functioning and safe healthcare system. This project develops optimization-based algorithms and accurate risk estimation methodologies in concert with our industrial partner, the American Red Cross, so as to mprove the safety of blood supply in the United States.  Intellectual Merit: Our major contributions to this area of research can be summarized as follows:  Healthcare Decision-making:   1) We develop optimization-based models for determining the optimal set of tests for screening donated blood, considering multiple pathogens, multiple tests for each pathogen (i.e., multiple markers), and limited testing budgets. Optimization models are capable of: (i) considering important issues, including the  number of blood donations falsely discarded due to testing error and societal costs of transmission of the pathogens (i.e., treatment costs and reduction in quality of life); (ii) exploring innovative strategies, including non-universal strategies that provide the blood center with the flexibility to customize the set of tests performed for different donor groups (e.g., repeat donors versus first-time donors), as different donor groups may have different infection prevalence rates; and (iii) determining robust strategies when  key parameters, such as prevalence rates, are uncertain.  Furthermore, we demonstrate the value, to the society, of this optimization-based approach in various case studies using published and publicly available data.  2) We develop improved probabilistic methodologies for estimating the risk of pathogen transmission through blood products. The risk estimation model utilizes mathematical models of infection dynamics of the various pathogens and eliminates many restrictive assumptions often used in the transfusion literature. We demonstrate, through various case studies that use published and publicly available data, that our probabilistic risk estimation model provides more accurate risk estimates than the current models.  Operations Research and Management Science:  We develop an innovative modeling framework to study an important resource allocation problem in healthcare.  Using this framework, we derive the structure of optimal screening policies under uncertainty, considering various objective functions, including robust objective functions, and develop efficient and exact algorithms that take advantage of the structural properties of optimal solutions.  Consequently, our research findings contribute to the knowledgebase in both operations research (through novel modeling approaches and new theoretical results on resource allocation problems) and transfusion (through novel risk estimation methodologies), as well as to the practice of decision-making for blood centers (through algorithms, insights, and cost-effectiveness studies).  We are pleased to report that one of the students, Hadi El-Amine, is selected as the 2015 INFORMS Bonder Scholar based on his dissertation work in this area; one paper that is related to this project was selected a finalist for the INFORMS Pierskalla Award for the Best Paper in Healthcare in 2015, and another paper was the winner of the INFORMS Pierskalla Award for the Best Paper in Healthcare in 2011.   Broader Impact: This project is performed within an inter-disciplinary research team, of industrial and systems engineers, a medical expert, and an expert in blood transfusion safety.
