<AbstractNarration>The Global Environment for Network Innovations? GENI ? is a suite of research infrastructure rapidly taking shape in prototype form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for ?at scale? experiments in future internets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GENI supports two types of experiments: (a) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks; and (b) ?in the wild? trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today?s Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants. GENI will provide excellent instrumentation for both forms of experiments, as well as the requisite data archival and analysis tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GENI entered its prototyping phase in mid 2007 as NSF awarded the GENI Project Office (GPO) role to BBN Technologies. Now, after several years of community prototyping, a number of interesting research experiments are running across the nationwide ?meso-scale? GENI prototype, built from GENI-enabled commercial equipment, that spans 14 US campuses and the two national research backbones (Internet2, NLR). GENI is being built by GENI-enabling existing testbeds, campuses, regional and backbone networks, cloud computation services, and commercial equipment. GENI can then incorporate these networks and services by federation, rather than constructing and operating a separate set of infrastructure for experimental research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund the GENI project through its completion. During this period, the GENI Project Office will: Complete the transition from building GENI to using GENI for research experimentation;&lt;br/&gt;Phase in full-time, federated GENI operations to support this rising experimentation; Grow to an ?at scale? suite of infrastructure in hundreds of campuses and networks, and perhaps even one or more cities; Transition to community governance; and Wind down the GENI Project Office.</AbstractNarration>

This outcomes report summarizes overall GENI-related outcomes. This specific award, &ldquo;GENI Project Office, Phase 2,&rdquo; focuses on expansion of GENI&rsquo;s physical footprint to an initial at-scale deployment, as well as enhancing research impact through improved instrumentation and experimenter outreach.</em></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>GENI's Goals</strong></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Global Environment for Network Innovations &ndash; GENI &ndash; is a suite of research infrastructure that comprises a distributed laboratory deployed across the United States.&nbsp;GENI transforms experimental research in networking and distributed systems by providing a suite of infrastructure for "at-scale" experiments in future internets.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">GENI supports a wide variety of experiments, including:</span></p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Experiments ranging from small to &ldquo;at-scale&rdquo; experiments.</span></li> <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Both experiments that are compatible and experiments that are incompatible with today&rsquo;s Internet.</span></li> <li class="li2"><span class="s1">Not only controlled, repeatable experiments, which which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks, but also trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today&rsquo;s Internet and that engage large numbers of users.</span></li> <li class="li2"><span class="s1">A variety of classroom and research experiments.</span></li> </ul> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although GENI&rsquo;s goal is to support &ldquo;at-scale&rdquo; experiments on future internets, our plan has never been to build a separate, parallel set of infrastructure &ldquo;as big as the Internet,&rdquo; which is clearly infeasible. Instead, the approach has been to &ldquo;GENI-enable&rdquo; existing testbeds, campuses, regional and backbone networks, cloud computation services, and commercial equipment to be programmable, virtualized and sliceable, so that they can support end-to-end experiments.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>GENI's Results</strong></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">GENI has addressed its initial purpose of supporting innovative research, and it has gone beyond these goals in a number of ways. The GENI project office and the GENI community have built GENI with an initial at-scale deployment now in place. GENI&rsquo;s use in the classroom is lowering the barrier for laboratory-based learning in computer science education. It is increasingly finding application in data- and compute-intensive domain sciences. Furthermore, GENI infrastructure is supporting advanced application development in areas of societal impact, through initiatives such as US Ignite.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">GENI continues to see explosive growth in usage for both research and education &ndash; over 12,000 unique users have turned to GENI, allocating over a third of a million GENI configurations. &nbsp;GENI&rsquo;s user base reaches more than 180 US universities and over 30 countries.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under this award, the GPO worked with the GENI community to design, develop and deploy hardware platforms &ndash; GENI racks and GENI wireless base stations &ndash; to form a nationwide, at-scale GENI laboratory, which now incorporates sixty GENI racks and twenty-four GENI wireless base stations at universities, regional and backbone networks, and partner institutions across the US. GENI hardware and concepts are increasingly extending beyond GENI proper and being integrated with campus scientific computing infrastructure. More researchers from the GENI community are publishing their results &ndash; the <a href="http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/GENIBibliography"><span class="s2">bibliography of GENI-relevant publications</span></a> now includes over 350 entries.</span></p> <p class="p3"><span class="s1">Educators continue to develop GENI-based curriculum and employ GENI in their classrooms. In the most recent complete academic year (2016-2017), instructors used GENI in at least 47 different courses with total enrollment of over 1400 students.</span></p> <p class="p5"><span class="s1">This award also developed and fielded in GENI the first functional software-defined exchanges (SDXs). These prototypes provide a valuable proof-of-concept environment that has paved the way for additional SDX research, including national and international interoperability, even while fostering the continuing development of competing and complementary SDX concepts.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Future Directions</strong></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The GENI community and GENI technology are playing a vital role in leading the development of research cyberinfrastructure. Key GENI concepts are increasingly embedded into new projects, such as the NSF Future Cloud research platform. Similarly, the central GENI notions of <em>slicability</em>&nbsp;and <em>deep programmability</em>&nbsp;are finding their way into future internet and distributed cloud research testbeds worldwide. (See <strong>Figure 6</strong>.) The NSF CISE <a href="https://lookingbeyondtheinternetblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/looking-beyond-the-internet-final-report.pdf"><span class="s2">"Looking Beyond the Internet" Steering Group Report</span></a>&nbsp;identifies GENI as a thought leader for future research infrastructure, and future mid-scale infrastructure research efforts, such as the recently initiated Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program, are poised to build upon GENI&rsquo;s success.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">As GENI is being created and improved, it is engaging an unusually wide range of participants from a cross-section of US institutions. This community is designing and developing GENI technology, deploying GENI on their campuses, and using GENI in their research. Many universities are applying GENI in their courses, with the potential to transform totally how experimental computer science is taught and learned.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Perhaps most important to us, the GENI community, is that the newest generation of networking and distributed systems researchers have enthusiastically taken up research leadership roles in an ambitious project of national importance. We would like to congratulate the numerous academic and industrial groups &ndash; both Principal Investigators and many graduate students &ndash; who play a role in defining and shaping GENI.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mark Berman, <em>GENI Project Director</em></span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/21/2018<br>      Modified by: Brig 'chip'&nbsp;Elliott</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1125515/1125515_10137790_1517607755844_Figure1-GENIMap--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1125515/1125515_10137790_1517607755844_Figure1-GENIMap--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1 -

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Note: GENI is supported by multiple NSF awards. This outcomes report summarizes overall GENI-related outcomes. This specific award, "GENI Project Office, Phase 2," focuses on expansion of GENI?s physical footprint to an initial at-scale deployment, as well as enhancing research impact through improved instrumentation and experimenter outreach. GENI's Goals The Global Environment for Network Innovations &ndash; GENI &ndash; is a suite of research infrastructure that comprises a distributed laboratory deployed across the United States. GENI transforms experimental research in networking and distributed systems by providing a suite of infrastructure for "at-scale" experiments in future internets. GENI supports a wide variety of experiments, including:  Experiments ranging from small to "at-scale" experiments. Both experiments that are compatible and experiments that are incompatible with today?s Internet. Not only controlled, repeatable experiments, which which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks, but also trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today?s Internet and that engage large numbers of users. A variety of classroom and research experiments.  Although GENI?s goal is to support "at-scale" experiments on future internets, our plan has never been to build a separate, parallel set of infrastructure "as big as the Internet," which is clearly infeasible. Instead, the approach has been to "GENI-enable" existing testbeds, campuses, regional and backbone networks, cloud computation services, and commercial equipment to be programmable, virtualized and sliceable, so that they can support end-to-end experiments.  GENI's Results GENI has addressed its initial purpose of supporting innovative research, and it has gone beyond these goals in a number of ways. The GENI project office and the GENI community have built GENI with an initial at-scale deployment now in place. GENI?s use in the classroom is lowering the barrier for laboratory-based learning in computer science education. It is increasingly finding application in data- and compute-intensive domain sciences. Furthermore, GENI infrastructure is supporting advanced application development in areas of societal impact, through initiatives such as US Ignite.  GENI continues to see explosive growth in usage for both research and education &ndash; over 12,000 unique users have turned to GENI, allocating over a third of a million GENI configurations.  GENI?s user base reaches more than 180 US universities and over 30 countries.  Under this award, the GPO worked with the GENI community to design, develop and deploy hardware platforms &ndash; GENI racks and GENI wireless base stations &ndash; to form a nationwide, at-scale GENI laboratory, which now incorporates sixty GENI racks and twenty-four GENI wireless base stations at universities, regional and backbone networks, and partner institutions across the US. GENI hardware and concepts are increasingly extending beyond GENI proper and being integrated with campus scientific computing infrastructure. More researchers from the GENI community are publishing their results &ndash; the bibliography of GENI-relevant publications now includes over 350 entries. Educators continue to develop GENI-based curriculum and employ GENI in their classrooms. In the most recent complete academic year (2016-2017), instructors used GENI in at least 47 different courses with total enrollment of over 1400 students. This award also developed and fielded in GENI the first functional software-defined exchanges (SDXs). These prototypes provide a valuable proof-of-concept environment that has paved the way for additional SDX research, including national and international interoperability, even while fostering the continuing development of competing and complementary SDX concepts. Future Directions The GENI community and GENI technology are playing a vital role in leading the development of research cyberinfrastructure. Key GENI concepts are increasingly embedded into new projects, such as the NSF Future Cloud research platform. Similarly, the central GENI notions of slicability and deep programmability are finding their way into future internet and distributed cloud research testbeds worldwide. (See Figure 6.) The NSF CISE "Looking Beyond the Internet" Steering Group Report identifies GENI as a thought leader for future research infrastructure, and future mid-scale infrastructure research efforts, such as the recently initiated Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program, are poised to build upon GENI?s success.  As GENI is being created and improved, it is engaging an unusually wide range of participants from a cross-section of US institutions. This community is designing and developing GENI technology, deploying GENI on their campuses, and using GENI in their research. Many universities are applying GENI in their courses, with the potential to transform totally how experimental computer science is taught and learned. Perhaps most important to us, the GENI community, is that the newest generation of networking and distributed systems researchers have enthusiastically taken up research leadership roles in an ambitious project of national importance. We would like to congratulate the numerous academic and industrial groups &ndash; both Principal Investigators and many graduate students &ndash; who play a role in defining and shaping GENI.
