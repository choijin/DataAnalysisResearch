<AbstractNarration>The proposed research focuses on a construction that lies at the core of quantum topology, namely the Kauffman skein algebra of a space. This combinatorial object was first defined with  the Jones polynomial in mind and thus plays a central role in the corresponding Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev topology quantum field theory for 3-manifolds.  Later, it was realized in terms of hyperbolic geometry, namely as a quantization of the PSL(2,C)-character variety.   However, the relationships between the various interpretations remain somewhat mysterious.  By better understanding the algebraic structure of the Kauffman  skein algebra, the PI hopes to facilitate further applications of quantum theory to problems in 3-manifold theory and to uncover relationships with existing classical topological invariants.  This project also continues the work of Bonahon and the PI  to classify representations of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra, an endeavor which combines skein theoretic arguments with the representation theory of the quantum Teichmuller space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From its inception, quantum topology has been a bridge between mathematics and mathematical physics.   Topology is an area of mathematics concerned with the intrinsic properties of a space, that is, properties that are preserved under continuous deformations.   This is in contrast to geometry, where there is a definite concept of distance between points in the space and deformations are not allowed.  Circa 1980, researchers developed a new topological quantum field theory which, as its nomenclature suggests, drew from both quantum physics and topology.  This new theory opened up exciting avenues for research, and in particular has allowed many mathematical theorems and constructions to find applications in physics, quantum computation, and beyond.    Conjectured deep connections between geometry and quantum theory are too becoming clearer and is a subject of the proposed research.  Indeed, the main goal is to  strengthen the relationships between these three - quantum theory, topology, and geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The project researched problems that arose in quantum topology, which aims to bridge geometry and topology from mathematics to quantum theory from mathematical physics.  In particular, this project considered the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface, whose original definition came naturally following the Jones polynomial and the related Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev topological quantum field theory.   After some time, researchers eventually realized a connection between a surface?s skein algebra and the PSL(2, C)- character variety of its fundamental group, an important and well-studied construction from topology and geometry.  The research questions in this project aimed to elucidate and strengthen this connection.       The main results from the project were about matrix representations of the skein algebra and were completed jointly with Francis Bonahon.  They proved several theorems describing an explicit way to go from a representation of the surface?s skein algebra directly to a point in the character variety.  They also showed that that the representation from the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev topological quantum field theory corresponded to the simplest, trivial character.       The PI worked with several groups of undergraduates studying combinatorial and algebraic properties of various arc algebras, all of whom are different generalizations of the skein algebra.  Two research papers resulted from her collaboration with her colleague Stephen Kennedy and students Martin Bobb and Dylan Peifer.  The PI is currently finishing a manuscript about her collaboration with students Crystal Lai, Matt Sikkink Johnson, and Julian Skothiem.   All except one of the aforementioned student collaborators are currently in graduate school in mathematics.      In addition to her work in quantum topology, the PI worked with another student group applying knot theory techniques to studying the topology of DNA.  This resulted in a research paper with colleague Erica Flapan and students Jeremy Grevet, Qi Li, and Daisy Chen Sun.       Besides her research activities, the PI continued to be active in educational and service activities, including co-authoring an elementary textbook about topology, giving talks about topology to both research communities and general audiences, and curating a local exhibit about knot theory.
