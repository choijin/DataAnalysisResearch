<AbstractNarration>This award partially supports a workshop at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory on the use of the Free Electron Laser in the biological sciences.  The workshop will have approximately 120 attendees, and it will be held in January 2011. The workshop will explore the exciting possibilities which the recent invention of the hard Xray laser offers for biology. The PIs will bring together leaders in the fields of biophysics, structural biology, biochemistry, accelerator physics, and diffraction physics to review the research opportunities which the unique capabilities of the many Free Electron Lasers (FELs) which are being constructed provide. Topics covered will include pump-probe protein dynamics, in-situ chemical snapshot diffraction at room temperature, protein nanocrystal growth and synthesis, single-shot imaging of cells and viruses, fast ab-initio fluctuation SAXS, reconstruction and phasing algorithms, detectors, sources and protein-beam injectors. A panel of senior biologists will outline the needs of structural biology, and suggest lines of development for this field. The workshop is co-funded by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Arizona State University, and the Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology at University of California at Davis.</AbstractNarration>
