<AbstractNarration>Climate change effects on the timing of breeding seasons have been well documented for many bird species.  Birds may breed earlier because warmer spring temperatures cause earlier plant growing seasons and, consequently, insect prey becomes more abundant earlier in the year.  In southwest Idaho, American kestrels are breeding almost a month earlier than they did 20 years ago; however, spring temperatures and plant growing seasons have not changed significantly during that time period.  One explanation is that more individuals are spending the winter on or near their breeding ground.  If so, it is important to understand the fitness consequences of this shift in behavior.  This project will examine whether kestrels that remain on the breeding area year-round 1) nest earlier in the year, 2) obtain better territories or 3) produce more offspring, compared to kestrels that leave the breeding area for the winter. While many studies have suggested how climate change may negatively affect bird populations, in this system, milder winters may be resulting in more year-round residency, earlier breeding, and potentially, population stability or growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will promote partnerships among community members, including private landowners, universities, and local non-profits.  It will also provide education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students while supporting an early-career female researcher.  Results from this project will be relevant for nationwide bird monitoring programs and management plans.</AbstractNarration>

Our study system was a population of American Kestrels (<em>Falco sparverius</em>) that nest in southwestern Idaho in a mix of irrigated agriculture and shrub and grassland habitats.&nbsp; In our study area, American Kestrels are partial migrants, meaning that some Kestrels migrate while others remain in the nesting area year-round.&nbsp; Over the past 24 years, winter temperatures have warmed significantly and, in that same time period, the average American kestrel nest initiation dates have advanced. To address the hypothesis that warmer winters have carry-over effects on the timing of breeding, we followed color-banded Kestrels across their whole annual cycle.
