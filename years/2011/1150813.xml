<AbstractNarration>Dr. Daniel Hruschka (Arizona State University) will undertake research to advance understanding of the cultural roots of cooperation and favoritism. In the last decade, new research has revealed how perceived social closeness fundamentally transforms people's willingness to help certain people and to neglect others. Based largely in industrialized countries, current findings raise key questions about how cultural context changes the relevance of social closeness for decision-making. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using interview, observational and survey methods to ground concepts of social closeness in local context and innovative experimental tools to measure social behavior, the study will ask three main questions: (1) How do people discriminate between socially close and non-close others in different religious and socioeconomic contexts? (2) How do religious and economic factors change the effect of social closeness on the willingness to help and to share? (3) What are the proximate psychological mechanisms by which social closeness influences helping and sharing?  To answer these questions, the project will compare four rural communities in Dinajpur, Bangladesh that differ in terms of religious background and economic uncertainty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to a number of policy areas that depend on how people resolve dilemmas between helping friends and family and being fair to a broader public, including issues of favoritism and corruption, civil governance, and charitable giving. The multidisciplinary project will train undergraduate and graduate students in study design, sampling, observational techniques, interview construction, data collection, behavioral experiments, and qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Middle school curricula will be disseminated through  innovative programs at the Santa Fe Institute designed to engage youth in laboratory activities and social scientific approaches to studying pressing social issues. The project will also build research and training capacity at LAMB Project for Integrated Health and Development in Dinajpur, Bangladesh.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This five-year project investigated how rural Bangladeshi villagers discriminate between socially close and non-close others, how perceptions of social closeness and need influence willingness to help others in this context, and how religious and economic factors shape the importance of social closeness on willingness to help others.   The project collected comparative data in four Bangladesh villages (n~500) to assess local conceptions of social closeness, need and social relationships.  It further developed and implemented novel behavioral measures to assess how these factors changed the way that people choose to give more to people they feel closer to (i.e. social discounting).  Training. With support of the project, the Laboratory for Culture Change and Behavior has trained 29 undergraduates and 5 graduate students (2 funded by REU and REG grants), and it has contributed to building a lab which now trains 8-10 undergrads in social science research methods annually. The project supported the development of an honors research supplement in the PI?s Medical Anthropology course that has to date trained over 100 students in research and data management.  Five honors students have pursued independent research on related topics for their thesis under the supervision of Dr. Hruschka. In addition to U.S. trainees, the project trained 2 team leaders and 8 research assistants in rural Bangladesh in research methods and project management. Three graduate students, in collaboration with the PI and two of the undergraduate lab members, also developed and implemented high school learning modules around the Science of Friendship.  These modules were implemented in 2013 and 2014 in a Santa Fe high school science club in collaboration with the Santa Fe Institute's GUTSy Girls program, which is geared to training the next generation of woman scientists.   Main Findings. Three of the main findings from the project were unexpected in the original proposal.  First, the apparently simple social discounting protocol refined over two decades on U.S. college students encountered numerous linguistic, conceptual, and practical difficulties in translation to rural Bangladesh.  In one paper, we review how refining protocols on only a select set of respondents (e.g., U.S. undergrads) can severely limit the generality of commonly used methods.  By describing the long process of translation, we also illustrate how attending to methodological "failures" can reveal researchers? tacit (and often incorrect) assumptions about what diverse participants bring to any research protocol and what they consider relevant.  We further argue that systematic study of methodological failures and successful adaptations will help us go beyond our own intuitions to better understand the range of skills, motivations and social expectations that respondents bring with them.   Second, with these new methods, we unexpectedly found that although social closeness was associated with real helping in the Bangladesh communities, it had no observable effect on sacrifice in a range of adapted social discounting protocols.  Most notably, relative need, rather than closeness, played a substantial role in decisions to give in social discounting protocols in the rural Bangladesh context.  This finding is an important counterexample to a large and growing literature in studies of U.S. college students and online users that social closeness shows clear and regular relationships with sharing in similar protocols.  We have also confirmed the unexpected finding of no social discounting in an additional rural Indonesia sample. Finally, a partner?s need, rather one?s perceived closeness or genetic relatedness to a partner, may be a better candidate for a general influence on giving behavior across these settings.    Two peer-reviewed papers describing these findings have already been published, and a third is submitted.  Dissemination. The PI has disseminated project-related findings at invited talks at the American Anthropology Association Meetings and in six additional invited talks at international, national and local venues.  Student lab members have presented project-related results in two presentations at the American Anthropology Association meetings and one poster at the Northwest Human Behavior and Evolution Society.  They have also published two student-authored publications in high-profile journals and have two more submitted for publication.  In total, the project has produced 16 project-related peer-reviewed publications, with two additional publications submitted for peer review, and an invited commentary on the website, "This View of Life" which has received over 4500 views.  The project also dovetailed with two interdisciplinary NSF-funded workshops and a Sackler colloquium co-organized by the PI.  These were designed to develop strategies for increasing diversity in the social and behavioral sciences.  Among other outcomes, these meetings have led to a set of guidelines for journal editors, reviewers and authors aimed at improving attention to cultural context and sample diversity during the write-up and review process.  It has also led to a special issue in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences focused on increasing diversity in the social and behavioral sciences.
