<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will focus on three organizations outside of the formal engineering program that provide mentoring support for African American engineering students to determine how participation in such organizations impacts academic and career pathways.  The project, building from a successful pilot, will examine how such organizations provide positive support to assist African American engineering students, the most effective aspects of this support, and how this support aids in developing professional identities that lead to long term success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arise from better understanding the mechanisms which effectively support one group of under-represented engineering students.  Such understanding can potentially lead to educational practices which can improve how engineering degree programs attract, retain, and support groups of under-represented students, thus improving the national pipeline for STEM talent and the STEM workforce.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a precursor to developing an overarching theory, we have developed and disseminated a model for how African American students enter the "Black student experience" at Predominantly White Institutions and engage with minority in engineering programs, NSBE and Black Greek-letter organizations during their undergraduate experience and beyond into their careers. Our work elucidates the importance of non-curricular organizations that provide "cultural enclaves" at predominately white universities to positively contribute to African American students? experiences in engineering studies and to impact future career success.  While our study focused on African American students, the findings are expected to offer new insights for Hispanic and Native American student in similar non-curricular activities (e.g. Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers and American Indian Science and Engineering Society). In fact, we have made great strides during the last year in connecting our research with regard to NSBE to a separate study conducted with colleagues who studied Hispanic/Latino/a students? involvement in SHPE.  We have disseminated our findings within the engineering education, the student affairs and student development communities, to organizations such as NAMEPA, NSBE and its members, and BGOs. Our deliverables will inform research-based practices and the development of research agenda with recommendations to pursue follow-up research, including recommendations to more fully develop the infrastructure by which we can study non-curricular activities for other underrepresented minority groups.
