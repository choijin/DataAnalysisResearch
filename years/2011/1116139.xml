<AbstractNarration>Shannon's source-channel separation theorem states that separating the source coder (compressor/decompressor) and the channel coder (error correction coder/decoder) via the universal digital interface of 'bits' is optimal for point-to-point communication of a single data source. While this modular design principle has inspired the basic architecture for most of today's communication systems, it is outperformed by more complex 'joint' source-channel coders for communication of multiple sources over networks---an important task in today's explosive demand and supply of distributed information sources. At the same time, many emerging applications involve computing a summary of data from multiple nodes, making a coordinated decision, and performing a joint action among these nodes, rather than merely communicating sources. This research establishes a hybrid source-channel coding architecture for these applications that is as simple as Shannon's separation architecture, yet achieves much improved performance. The new architecture will eventually lead to the discovery of practical algorithms for distributed computation, sensing, decision making, and coordination over networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this research focuses on and develops new approaches for tackling the following problems: 1) hybrid coding for communicating correlated sources over multiuser channels (a unified approach for joint source-channel coding), 2) hybrid coding for network communication (a new relaying scheme based on joint source-channel coding), 3) implementation issues for hybrid coding (design of a practical code that is a good channel code and a good source code simultaneously), and 4) a mathematical framework for performance analysis and code design (information theoretic tools when the codebook and the message are entangled).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Shannon's source-channel separation is one of the most fundamental principles in communication theory that establishes binary digits (bits) as the universal interface between source coding (data compression) and channel coding (digital communication). In network communication involving multiple sources, this simple digital interface fails to achieve the optimal performance due to its limitation in handling coherence between the sources. In this project, we developed a natural unification of simple symbol-to-symbol analog communication and Shannon's block-to-block digital communication. This hybrid coding architecture includes and extends many existing schemes in communicating multiple sources over communication networks. Beyond such joint source-channel coding problems, the proposed hybrid coding architecture can be also applied to relay networks, as the same principle can combine the so-called amplify-forward and compress-forward relaying schemes. We also investigated the emerging channel coding techniques to implement hybrid coding in practice. Among a few candidates, the polar code was ultimately selected as a main vehicle for hybrid coding thanks to its flexibility in playing the dual role of source code and channel code simultaneously. Based on this observation, several extensions of Arikan's original polar code have been developed for network communication, which have independent values beyond hybrid coding. Overall, the project contributed to advancing our understanding of hybrid coding and polar coding, which can be applied to practical communication problems ranging from sensor networks to wireless communications. The project involved active participation of Ph.D. students including two underrepresented (female) students.          Last Modified: 12/17/2016       Submitted by: Young-Han Kim]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
