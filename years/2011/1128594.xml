<AbstractNarration>The complexity of power grids has significantly increased in recent years, both in terms of the interconnection of more physical components and the deployment of more advanced monitoring and control systems. The grid has become critically dependent on the supporting communication infrastructure for control, monitoring and management, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The objective of this project is to develop a system-wide vulnerability-reliability modeling and evaluation framework for modern power systems, taking into account various uncertainties from both physical and cyber domains. The approach is based on the integration of cyber vulnerability into the power grid reliability model and the development of new methodologies for efficiently calculating composite vulnerability-reliability indices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This project will develop analytical and statistical inference models for anomaly detection of potential malicious activities across control networks for an enhanced SCADA cybersecurity framework. Credible scenarios and the impact of their failures will be examined. Wind-farm management systems will be incorporated into the analysis of overall system vulnerability and reliability by accounting for various uncertainties in a cyber-physical environment. Methodologies to model and evaluate the overall reliability of cyber-physical power systems will be developed in a probabilistic manner. New reliability test systems, including current-carrying components and cyber components, will also be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The project will generate critical knowledge for a broad spectrum of vulnerability-reliability issues in cyber-physical energy infrastructures. In turn, this project will yield far-reaching benefits for society and the nation as a whole by accelerating technological development, training a well-qualified workforce, and promoting participation of underrepresented groups through the integration of our research results into undergraduate and graduate power and energy courses and curriculum. The power and energy engineering community will benefit from broad dissemination of our research findings in leading journals, conferences, workshops, the Internet, short courses and tutorials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the ongoing smart grid initiative, more and more information and communication technologies are being integrated into the current power grids. These cyber technologies are useful to enable a more reliable, more efficient, and smarter power system. However, various cyber vulnerabilities will be inevitably brought about. This project investigates how these cyber vulnerabilities will impact the power supply reliability in a quantitative manner. This research significantly advances the state of the art in the research fields of power system reliability evaluation and cybersecurity. Novel reliability models and evaluation methods are developed, and quantitative cybersecurity models are built. The major outcomes obtained from this project are listed as follows:  A comprehensive set of new failure modes caused by the cyber vulnerabilities is identified and the corresponding mathematical models are built. A set of representative cyberattacks targeting the critical cyber assets of power grids are modeled using the probabilistic techniques, and various attack scenarios are examined. A novel, integrated reliability evaluation framework is established which accounts for the risk caused by potential cyber vulnerabilities.  A novel, comprehensive reliability test system is developed by incorporating the cyber technologies into the traditional reliability test system. This test system can be used as the benchmark in reliability study by the power engineering research community. An efficient reliability calculation procedure is developed for calculating the commonly used reliability indices based on the integrated reliability-vulnerability model. Simulation results indicate that power supply reliability could be compromised by the malicious cyber attacks. In certain severe situations, major power outages could be caused.  For each attack scenario, corresponding countermeasures are proposed to mitigate the cyber vulnerabilities and enforce the power grids. The research results have been integrated into the educational materials for teaching and training purposes. The research is instrumental to fostering the next-generation workforce in this strategic field. Several graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups are involved in this project for performing various research tasks. The research results have been widely disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations, seminar talks, and other outreach activities.
