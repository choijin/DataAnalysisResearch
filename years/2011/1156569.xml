<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to Marquette University that will provide research training for 8 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. This award is supported by both the NSF Directorate for Biosciences and the Department of Defense ASSURE program (thru a Memorandum of Understanding with NSF). The REU program is intended to encourage students to pursue science- and research-related careers. The focus of this program is the understanding of biological processes in organisms ranging from microbes to mammals at the level of individual cells, proteins, and genes. Students will choose from among several faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences and will design and carry out a research project under the direct supervision of their faculty mentor, thereby developing a realistic view of the demands and excitement of scientific discovery. Besides full-time research, students will learn to read the scientific literature and develop written and verbal communication skills through weekly journal clubs, laboratory group meetings, and research discussions. Students will also participate in workshops on responsible conduct of research, career opportunities, and the graduate school application process. Students will present their findings at both a poster session and research symposium during the final weeks of the program. Social activities are interwoven throughout the program to promote camaraderie among faculty, Marquette students, and the REU participants. Housing, a stipend, and meal and travel allowances are provided. Students will be encouraged to present their work at national meetings during the following year. Students are selected based on their interest in research, academic record, and phone interviews with potential faculty mentors. Members of underrepresented minority groups and students from colleges with limited research opportunities are especially encouraged to apply. After the program, participants are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The program will be assessed using various means, including an REU common assessment tool available online to students. More information about the REU Site program is available by visiting http://www.marquette.edu/biology/summerresearchprogram.shtml, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Edward Blumenthal at edward.blumenthal@marquette.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Gail Waring at gail.waring@marquette.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Cellular and Molecular Biology in the Department of Biological Sciences at Marquette University.  The first goal of the REU site was to provide a high-quality and comprehensive summer research experience to undergraduate students.  During the summers of 2012-2015, the award directly supported the participation of 25 students in our summer program and allowed the participation of an addition 27 students from the host institution who were supported by institutional and investigator funds.  Participating students were chosen from a total pool of 524 applicants over the four summers, and only 30 offers of admission were needed to fill the 25 slots.  Students conducted independent research projects for 10 weeks on a wide range of topics related to cellular and molecular biology, working directly with one of 17 faculty mentors.  At the end of the summer, students presented their results in a departmental symposium and in a poster session that, in the last three years of the award, included summer research students from multiple disciplines across the Marquette campus.  Seven of the participants have since presented their results at regional or national conferences, and at least three will be co-authors on future publications.  During the summers, participants also took part in training in the Responsible Conduct of Research and in weekly journal clubs, discussions of science communication and the place of science in society, and other activities designed to expose students to the full range of topics and challenges faced by professional biologists.  In the final summer of the award, students created video overviews of their projects aimed at a general audience; these videos are available for viewing at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqABkbFawT-cKh5Zqc-zYPEVFtGjKrGEh.  The second goal of the REU site was to provide a summer research experience to students that had limited research opportunities at their home institutions and to members of minority groups that are underrepresented in science.  Of the 25 students funded by this award, 24 were enrolled in non-PhD granting institutions with limited research opportunities, including two students at two-year institutions.  Nine of the 25 students were members of underrepresented minority groups, including one military veteran and one student with a disability, and one additional student had a disability.  No students from the home institution were directly supported by this award.  The third goal of the REU site was to promote participantsÆ choice of a research-related career.  Of the REU-funded students, 17 have completed their undergraduate degrees.  12 of these 17 students are now in research-related careers, including 9 who are currently enrolled in doctoral programs in biology or a related field.  The remaining five graduated students are enrolled in professional programs in health-related fields.  As another means of assessing the impact of the program, students responded to a survey at the end of the summer.  Following are the mean values of student satisfaction or learning gains with respect to different aspects of the program using a scale of 1-5 with 5 indicating "very satisfied" or "great gain".  For "the research experience overall", the mean response as 4.6, for "Understanding what everyday research work is like"&mdash;4.7, for "confidence in my ability to do research"&mdash;4.3, and for "feeling like a scientist"&mdash;4.5.  In summary, the REU site in Cellular and Molecular Biology at Marquette University that was supported by this award achieved its goals in the period 2012-2015.
