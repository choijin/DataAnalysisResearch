<AbstractNarration>Restrepo, DMS-1109856&lt;br/&gt;Mariano, DMS-1108949&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Lagrangian methodology based on a Discrete Kernel Filter (DKF) and the Ensemble Bred Vector (EBV) that uses local estimators that preserve significant dynamical features, detected by observations and in numerical simulations, is developed for the Forward Lagrangian Trajectory Prediction (LTP) and inverse source estimation problems that are fundamental in many different scientific disciplines.  These nonlinear filtering problems are non-Gaussian and can have large-dimensional state spaces.  DKF is based upon a particle filter and it does not suffer ensemble collapse because it has a built-in regeneration process in the parameterization of the diffusion process that defines the primary branches for prediction.  The method linearizes about branches of prediction, yet makes no Gaussian assumption in the analysis stage.  The EBV algorithm is used to find the best choices for branches of prediction, thus increasing the efficiency of the method significantly for application to important real-world problems such as oil spill modeling and pollution source identification, transport and dispersion of radioactive gases in the atmosphere, fish larvae transport and fishery connectivity, predicting sea ice motion, human colonization, mapping invasive species, and monitoring asteroid movements, to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Observations of fluid flows and the trajectories of the flows are called Eulerian if the observations are taken from points fixed independent of the flows, and Lagrangian if they are taken from points that move with the flows themselves.  In the same way, a computational simulation of a flow is called Eulerian if the flow moves through a fixed computational grid, and Lagrangian if the grid moves with the flow.  The investigators develop a method to predict the trajectories of fluid flows, which are subject to random perturbations.  They apply the method to two problems where capturing features is critical: hurricane/typhoon tracking, and US Coast Guard search and rescue.  Both of these problems are of great societal importance because more optimal solutions with tighter error bars can save both lives and money.  For reasons of practicality they seek an efficient method that is also capable of (1) fusing multi-platform observations and numerical model simulations of ocean circulation for improving both the Eulerian, diagnostic variables of the model and prediction of Lagrangian trajectories, as well as the associated estimation uncertainties, and (2) handling already existing ensembles, fusing hurricane track forecast ensembles from the leading operational models (such as NCEP GFS, GFDL, UKMET, ECMWF, NOGAPS, others) to improve predictions of the path of tropical cyclones (hurricane, typhoon).  The method can help produce state-of-the-art uncertainty maps that are critical in search and rescue flight planning and for reducing the "cone of uncertainty" for operational hurricane predictions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The study of ocean currents and ocean velocity variability is important for many practical and scientific problems such as optimal ship routing, search and rescue for lost boats and people, tracking of pollutants like oil,  its influence on weather,  red tides, and global climate, and and the transport of fish larvae, lobster larvae, and baby turtles.  Oceanographers use (near-)surface observations of the position of drifters to calculate the velocity. These observations are typically from the satellite-based ARGOS system or GPS-tracked drifters.  How to estimate the average flow and the flow variabiltiy of ocean currents from drifter observations of ocean flow is not straight-forward. The ocean surface flow changes a lot in time, changes a lot from near-coastal waters to offshore waters, and the flow is very complicated.  The ocean drifter data are limited, and are contaminated by measurements noise and sampling biases.  There are many scientific papers on how to average ocean drifter data.  Traditional methods average all velocity observation collected in some spatial bin and during some time period.  Some of these methods use overlapping bins. Other methods fit simple functions to the data by least-squares methods.  We have used feature-based methods to produce better estimates of both the mean ocean currents and their statistical properties.   This technique assumes a certain dynamical feature-a current exists with a dominant coherent flow direction. It uses one-dimensional polynomials functions to account for cross-stream variations of the mean flow structure within each bin, whose advantage relative to 2-D methods lies in the fact that the fitting operation requires the determination of a smaller number of parameters.   Subsets of drifter velocity measurements were first selected within circular spatial bins with 1/2 dergee radius centered on the grid points of a regular 0.25 degree by 0.25 degree Eulerian grid.  The local Cartesian coordinate system was rotated in small angle increments about the data centroid. At each angle, polynomials are separately fitted to the velocity component aligned with the rotated x-axis. The respective fitting errors were calculated.  Estimates of the mean zonal and meridional velocity structure are retrieved at the angle where the fitting error is a minimum.   These velocites are then mapped on a regular grid. Some examples are given in the figures.  The statistical properties of ocean velocity vary from coastal to offshore waters, and are a strong function of the dynamical feature sampled. For example, a drifter can either be in a strong vortex known as ocean eddies that occur various sizes,  in a strong flow associated with a major ocean current or the super-positioning of ocean eddies, inertial oscillations, wind-driven motion, or a complex combination of these features and others.  A Lagrangian-based technique was used to map out the statistical properties of these features in the Gulf of Mexico for drifters from the GLAD experiment.  The statistical properties included the mean flow, its variance, the dominant period of the flow,  integral time scales, and diffusivity-a measure of how stuff disperse in the ocean.   The results show that these quantities are small near the coast and larger offshore. The largest values are found in regions of flow bifurcations.  Flow bifurcation regions are where an organized flow splits into two organized flow. These regions are the most difficult regions to predict how things would move on the surface of the ocean.
