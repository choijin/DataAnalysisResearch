<AbstractNarration>A prosthetic robot hand is designed and developed with programmable passive dynamics modeled after human hands.  The goals include the development of mathematical models of variable passive dynamics in human hands, the study of the role of passive dynamics in hand operations, the design of novel joint mechanisms, development of a hand prototype and an EMG control interface, and the development of pedagogical laboratory modules for education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops technology to substantially improve rehabilitation and quality of life for persons with hand disabilities, including amputees returning from ongoing wars. This work addresses the acute need for  substantial improvement in the functionality and control mechanisms for prosthetic hands.  Most current prosthetic hands do not address the underlying design constraints of a useful prosthetic hand, namely, weight and size limitations, limited control, ease of control and suitable aesthetics.  In addition, students learn this new subject and contribute to the advance of science and technology in this domain. Finally, programs are in place to recruit women, individuals with disabilities, and Native American students in engineering research and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the research effort were to analyze the properties and role of passive dynamics, defined by joint stiffness and damping, in the human hand and wrist during grasping and manipulation, and then mimic such properties in a wrist-hand exoskeleton for stroke rehabilitation. This project has informed the design of more effective wrist/hand rehabilitation devices that are feasible for clinical use. In addition, the proposed project created a unique interdisciplinary environment enabling education, training, and co-advising of graduate students, undergraduate research, and significant and targeted outreach activities to underrepresented groups in science and engineering. These aspects address the broader impacts of the research effort.  A significant majority of stroke survivors suffer from upper limb paresis, yet only a fraction of these individuals gain full motor recovery with conventional treatments in the year following stroke. Thus, continued rehabilitation of the impaired limb is needed. Robotic devices are excellent candidates for delivering repetitive and intensive practice that can facilitate motor recovery in chronic stroke cases, even several years after the injury. Rehabilitation of the wrist and hand in particular are critical for recovery of functional movement which enables execution of activities of daily living (ADLs) and allow for independent living after stroke. However, robotic devices that focus on hand rehabilitation are limited due to either excessive cost and complexity, or limited functionality. A design and control strategy for such devices that bridges this gap is critical.  In order to develop robotic devices that facilitate the range of hand movements that are characteristic of ADLs, devices must allow for multiple degrees of freedom and natural control. In this integrated research effort, we proposed that rehabilitation devices for the upper extremities, especially the wrist and hand, must be designed to match and leverage passive dynamic properties, such as those that exist in the human hand.  The intellectual merit of the proposed research stems from the analytical basis for modeling of passive dynamic properties and control mechanisms, and how to integrate the mechanical design of wrist/hand exoskeletons with control for close physical coupling between machine and man.
