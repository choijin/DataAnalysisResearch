<AbstractNarration>This award funds a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&amp;M University.  The program allows undergraduate students to conduct research projects in atmospheric science over an 8-week period during the summer, with an expected enrollment of 10 students each summer.  REU student research involves linkages between physical meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, and weather and climate, as well as making and analyzing observations and designing, conducting, and interpreting modeling studies. Research topics are largely driven by air quality, climate change, and precipitation processes in the Gulf Coastal region.  Students spend the majority of their time conducting focused research under the direction of mentors from the Atmospheric Sciences Department.  Sudents also gain exposure to a variety of research settings and multiple sub-disciplines within atmospheric sciences, giving them a clear understanding of the wide variety of atmospheric science research and study opportunities available to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU program has broader impacts through its educational focus, as it exposes students to atmospheric science research and helps to develop the future workforce in atmospheric science disciplines.  This REU program is particularly advantageous due to its location in and focus on the Gulf Coast Region, in which there are few atmospheric science departments and, when this award was made, no other REU programs in atmospheric sciences.  With its regional focus, this REU site involves students in research problems that are directly relevant to their own and neighboring communities, leading to immediate and long-term benefits to those communities.  In addition, the REU program strives to recruit students from underrepresented groups, both through existing partnerships between Texas A&amp;M faculty and minority-serving institutions in the region, and through recruiting visits to minority-serving institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the summers of 2013 through 2015, this project brought a total of 32 undergraduate science students to the Texas A&amp;M Campus for an eight-week summer research experience.  Students carried out individual research projects under the supervision of faculty members in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences.  The types of projects undertaken included computer modeling and simulations, laboratory and field measurements, and analysis of atmospheric data sets.  Students presented the results of their research projects at the campus-wide Undergraduate Research Symposium at the end of each summer.   Students also participated as a group in a 5-day, 4-night field experience on the Texas Gulf Coast at Galveston Island where they planned and executed a short meteorological field campaign.  At the field site, students learned the fundamentals of upper-air observations, in-situ meteorological observations, air pollution observations, and the SMART-R truck-mounted C-Band radar.  Pursuing the scientific objective of observing coastal meteorological phenomena, including the local sea breeze and related fronts, students engaged daily in critiquing the previous day's operations, deciding the deployment strategy for the current day, and collecting data from the available instruments.   Of the students who participated, 23 came from institutions not classified as major research universities.  Eighteen of the students were female.  Of the 16 students who had graduated from college at the point at which statistics were collected (fall 2015), 14 are continuing their educations in graduate programs of science.  Fourteen of the 20 participants from the first two years presented their research results at national scientific conferences.
