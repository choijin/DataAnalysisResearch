<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1104373            PI:  Yan, Hao  ORG: Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  DNA Origami Nanostructures with Complex Curvatures in 3D Space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  A grand challenge in the fields of nanotechnology and biomaterials is to assemble arbitrary, three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures with complete control of the material shape.  To address this challenge, the PI will develop various novel strategies to construct self-assembling DNA nanostructures that possess complex curvatures in 3D space.  More specifically, he proposes to develop a self-assembling system to: (1) Produce 3D DNA nanostructures that contain intricate, complex curvatures using the DNA origami folding technique.  (2) Create a set of geometric, wedge-like DNA nanostructures to direct the curvature of preformed, planar DNA nanostructures using targeted insertion and deletion.  (3) Utilize curved, 3D DNA origami nanostructures as scaffolds to mimic the role of histone proteins in gene packaging and create artificial nucleosomes for subsequent study.  This new technology will exploit the exceptional addressability and spatial control associated with structural DNA nanotechnology to produce an artificial structural platform that resembles the conformational complexity that exists in biological structures, thus creating unprecedented opportunities for engineering novel bioinspired, biomimetic, and biokleptic materials.  The design strategies included in this proposal present fundamental steps toward meeting this challenge.  The proposal aims to achieve self-assembly of 3D nanostructures with high programmability and complexity, and subsequently use them as scaffolds to mimic the functionality of nucleosomes.  Furthermore, the proposed research will provide various new and significant approaches to DNA-based nanofabrication.  This project ultimately seeks to go beyond the evident limits of current top-down techniques for the fabrication of arbitrary shaped 3D nanostructures.  This will lead to smaller, faster, and more diverse nanoscale structures for a wide range of applications from energy to bio-diagnostic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  There are broad societal implications for this research.  As the PIs advance nanoscale techniques for the development of novel technologies, their research leads to opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student to receive advanced scientific training, and for educational outreach to the community by ASU.  Yan and Liu's teams at ASU are located in the Biodesign Institute, which places special emphasis on interdisciplinary research.  The Biodesign Institute provides an opportunity to recruit students with various backgrounds including chemistry and biochemistry, engineering, physics, and life science.  Also actively recruited are minority and female students.  In addition, every summer the Biodesign Institute and ASU also provide research opportunities to local high school students and to middle and high school teachers [Summer Research Experience for Teachers (RET) and High School Student Summer Internship Program (SIP), and Arizona Science Teacher Advancement and Research Training (AZ-START)].  The PI and co-PI have actively participated in these programs, hosting several minority high school teachers and students in their labs.  They anticipate the recruitment of additional high school students to participate in the proposed research during each summer and plan to collaborate with local high school chemistry and science teachers to design an interactive online course called DNA Nano Laboratory, aiming to introduce DNA nanotechnology to high school students, undergraduate students and the public.  Course materials will include text introductions and laboratory photographs, video demonstrations, and animations of experimental procedures.  This will benefit a multitude of students who are not able to participate in the highly competitive internship programs.  Projects from this proposed research will also be used in laboratory modules for the development of a web-based training protocol for a larger community interested in nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
