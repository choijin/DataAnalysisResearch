<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the Foundations of Molecular Modeling and Simulation (FOMMS) 2012 conference to be held in Welches, Oregon July 22 - 26, 2012.  The conference will emphasize the latest developments in computational quantum and classical simulation methods, as well as their application to discovery and data driven applications in science and engineering.  The grant will be used to support participant costs for the meeting, facilitating attendance by researchers who might otherwise be unable to attend the conference, including junior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and under-represented minorities.  The conference features an outstanding and diverse slate of 18 renowned innovators in and practitioners of molecular modeling and simulation from the US, Europe, and Japan who have accepted invitations to present plenary talks over the 4.5 day conference.  Additionally, workshops on open source molecular simulation codes and on the use of molecular simulation methods in education will be conducted. Participants will be encouraged to present their latest work in one of two poster sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FOMMS 2012 conference will broadly impact researchers and students who develop or use molecular-based modeling and simulation tools in academia and industry. The conference format and venue provide ample time and opportunity for interaction among participants, cross-fertilization of disciplines, and mentoring of young researchers.</AbstractNarration>

Wednesday began with talks on "Energy and Environment" by Prof. David Sholl (Georgia Institute of Technology), Prof. Fumio Hirata (Institute for Molecular Science, Japan) and Dr. Bruce Garrett (Pacific Northwest Laboratory). The second poster session (again with about 50 poster presentations) took place Wednesday afternoon and the day ended with evening presentations in the "Life Sciences" session by Prof. Sarah Price (University College &ndash; London) and Prof. Joan Emma Shea (University of California, Santa Barbara).     The final day of FOMMS 2012 began with a session on "Complex Fluids" in which Prof. Mark Asta (University of California, Berkeley), Prof. Juan de Pablo (University of Wisconsin) and Prof. Pablo Debenedetti (Princeton University) all gave outstanding talks. The afternoon was dedicated to the second conference workshop, with the theme being "Validation of Simulations". Prof. Ellad Tadmor (University of Minnesota) and Prof. Michael Shirts (University of Virginia) challenged the participants to think of ways in which simulation methods and results can be better validated, archived, and trusted. The conference ended with the presentation of the FOMMS Medal to Prof. Keith Gubbins of North Carolina State University, who gave a talk entitled "Molecular Modeling and Simulation of Confined Nano-Phases". Following this, the traditional FOMMS movie was screened (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWSBttSf4c) and the conference ended with a wonderful outdoor banquet on the grounds of the resort.        Overall, FOMMS 2012 was a great success. We are especially grateful to the National Science Foun...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
