<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for a delegation consisting of researchers from the University of Maryland, College Park, Purdue University and Harvard University to attend the 2011 International Conference on Noncontact Atomic Force Microscopy (NC-AFM) to take place in Lindau, Germany.  The delegation consists mostly of graduate students and junior researchers. Additionally, it includes two members of the provisionally approved 2013 NC-AFM Conference Organization Committee, who will be updating and seeking final approval from the Conference Steering Committee on the proposed conference plan to be carried out in 2013 in Washington D.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The delegation will have the opportunity to learn from and interact with the most prominent researchers in the field of NC-AFM, most of which reside in Europe and Japan.  One of the most relevant conference topics to be presented (by others) is the nascent field of sub-atomic chemical force microscopy, which holds significant promise in the electronic structure probing of nanoscale surfaces.  This is particularly important for energy-related applications, such as lithium ion diffusion tracking and enhanced fuel cell materials.  Hosting the conference in the U.S. in 2013 will enable a large number of U.S. researchers to attend and acquire knowledge on the latest NC-AFM techniques, which will in turn help raise the level of interest in the U.S.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided partial support for eight U.S. travelers (one junior faculty, two research associates and five graduate students) to attend the 2011 International Conference on Noncontact Atomic Force Microscopy (NC-AFM), which took place in Lindau, Germany, on September 18-22 of 2011 (http://ncafm2011.unibas.ch/home/).  Each of the travelers submitted a technical contribution to the conference, including two oral and six poster presentations.  Additionally, a proposal was presented to organize the 2013 conference at the University of Maryland, which was accepted by the International Steering Committee.  The NC-AFM conference is the most prestigious international conference dedicated exclusively to the field of atomic force microscopy.  The support provided by this grant allowed the participants to directly interact and learn from the most prominent researchers in the field of high-resolution atomic force microscopy, who presented a range of theoretical and experimental topics related to measurement of the topography and properties of sub-nanoscale surface features.  The award of the 2013 NC-AFM conference to the University of Maryland offers a unique opportunity for local investigators (especially students) to immerse themselves into the most advanced research in a field that is currently dominated by Europe and Japan, and which focuses on a very important enabling tool in nanotechnology.
