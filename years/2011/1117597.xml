<AbstractNarration>Broadband cellular networks are emerging to be the most common means for mobile data access worldwide. Predictions from industry analysts indicate that the volume of data through cellular data networks will increase exponentially in near future. Understanding of the mobile data traffic via measurement and analysis is critical for the development of resource management techniques for these networks. While spectrum resources are of great concern, this project specifically focuses on the energy required to operate the cellular network infrastructure, specifically base stations. The project undertakes a significant modeling exercise with two goals. One goal is intellectual, driven towards understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of mobile traffic and discovering possible structure or relationships. The project uses state-of-the-art machine learning tools to develop models using large-scale data collected directly from the operator's networks. Such modeling will bring new insights that in turn will help to deploy and manage future generation cellular data networks. The second goal is utilitarian. Here, techniques are developed to predict base station loads for use in resource management, specifically energy. Algorithms are designed to exploit energy-optimization opportunities to turn off specific network resources based on the forecasted load.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has significant broader impact. It develops technologies to appreciably reduce energy consumption in cellular networks. Overall, this exercise will both reduce cost, and contribute to the environment. The project also contributes to several green initiatives in both institutions and to the education and training of graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

A sound understanding of how  user data traffic and use of wireless spectrum over which such traffic is transmitted changes over time and space is crucial to modeling, analysis, design  and operation of   such wireless networks. Therefore, contributions we made in this NSF funded grant  towards improving such understanding are of signifncant value.  Our research efforts focussed on three areas: (1) Statistical analysis of  detailed traces of cellular traffic  to develop new understanding of spatial and temporal characteristics of cellular traffic and development of machine learning based spatio-temporal models that can be used to predict future traffic loads on cellular base stations. (2) Use of these models  in design  of better solutions to problem of how to  manage critical parameters of wirreless networks such as amount of energy consumed in the network, amount of capacity delivered to mobile devices and distribution of user traffic between spectrum bands. (3) Implementation of a proptype wireless network operating in multiple spectrum bands that can demonstrate usefulness of our new insights and solutions.

(3) We successfully showed that machine learning based models for spatio-temporal characteristics of data traffic can be quite useful in reducing network monitoriing load. (4) We successfully designed and implemented a novel small cell network that demonstrated  the resource management concepts we researched.   In summary, our research  has created valuable tools and insights that can be used in industry and academia   for design of  accurate demand forecasting and traffic and energy management solutions for current as well as future wireless networks.
