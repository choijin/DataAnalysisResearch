<AbstractNarration>The Jones polynomial is a powerful knot invariant that keeps tightly locked key information about the geometry and topology of the knot complement. The principal investigator  and the principal co-investigator propose to study the Geometry and Topology of the Jones polynomial and its 3-dimensional counterpart, the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant, that is revealed via asymptotic expansions, and especially its relation to hyperbolic geometry via representations of the fundamental group and to number theory via modular properties of the asymptotic expansions. A side project growing out of the proposal which concerns only classical invariants is the investigation of the growth rate of torsions of finite coverings of 3 manifolds and its relations to geometry/topology of the manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of knotted curves in  3-dimensional manifolds is intimately related to our physical 3-dimensional space. With a long history reaching back to the early stage of topology, it is fundamental to many areas of mathematics and physics, and also has applications in biology, chemistry, and quantum computation. In the last few decades, Jones and Witten's work and ideas from physics have led to the discovery of  new  types of invariants for knots which create interactions of low dimensional topology with  geometry, algebra, number theory, analysis, quantum field theory and combinatorics. The aim of this project is to better understand the nature of these new invariants and their relations with classical invariants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SUMMARY: Knot theory, classical and quantum, is ubiquitous in biology, computer science, physics and mathematics. In biology, knotted structures appear in the DNA molecule, the backbone of life, during its replication. Chirality (or left versus right handeness) is an important component of protein building, as well as of most organic chemistry. In computer science, knots are an integral part of quantum computing and play a key role in entanglement. In physics, knots appear in plasma physics, as well as in theories that explain particles beyond the standard model. In mathematics, knot theory is a well-established part of 3-dimensional geometry and topology.  The birth of quantum knot theory coincides with V. Jones's discovery of his famous knot polynomial. The Jones polynomial is the key interaction between the above mentioned principles.  INTELLECTUAL MERITS: The grant supported by the PI and the co_PI focused on problems relating the geometry, topology, number theory and physics of the Jones polynomial of a knot. An important conjecture in this subject asserts a deep connection between the asymptotics of the (colored) Jones polynomial and the volume of the ambient space, taken with respect to a hyperbolic metric. The latter is a solution to Einstein's equation for 3-dimensional spaces, and is intimately related with the structure of the 3-dimensional complex group of isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space.  Aside for the connections between quantum topology and hyperbolic geometry, the PI and the co-PI developed connections between knot theory and number theory, and connections between knot theory and functional analysis of infinite covers of the knot complement. These connections have far-reaching consequences.  BROADER IMPACTS: The PI and co-PI have supervised PhD theses, and mentored two post-doctoral fellows during the span of this grant. The PI and co-PI are currently advising three more Ph.D. students.  The PI and the co-PI have been a co-organizer in three conferences in Vietnam and in Switzerland. During the span of the grant, the PI and the co-PI have given over 50 presentations of their research results in invited seminars and international conferences.
