<AbstractNarration>The aim of the proposed research is to advance the state of the art of quickest detection by developing mathematical and statistical tools for systems consisting of large numbers of sensors with heterogeneous change times across sensors. Three related yet increasingly complicated and practical models will be considered. First, the assumption that the change times are the same at all sensors will be relaxed. The goal is to design quickest detection algorithms for the scenario with direct links between the sensors and the fusion center but with different change times. Next, the assumption that the access point can observe signals from all the sensors simultaneously will be relaxed. The goal is to develop quickest attack detection and localization algorithms for the scenario in which the fusion center can access only a subset of sensors at any given time. Finally, the assumption that there is a direct link between each sensor and the fusion center will be relaxed. The heterogeneity and sparsity of sensor observations will be exploited to develop quickest attack detection and localization algorithms for this scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is expected to make substantial contributions to both applications and theory. On the application level, the proposed research has the potential to substantially improve the efficiency and robustness of chemical and biological threat detection algorithms. It is meant to develop low&lt;br/&gt;complexity algorithms that will be useful for implementation. On the theoretical level, the proposed project will advance the state of the art of sequential analysis and contribute new approaches to the general methodological base for optimal stopping and control problems for quickest detection. The proposed work has widespread potential applications not only in the detection of chemical and biological threats but also other areas as well. For example, in medical diagnosis, there are often more than one symptom related to a disease and these symptoms do not necessarily occur at the same time. The results of this research can be used to improve the performance of medical diagnostic techniques. The breadth of applications of the proposed research also makes this an ideal topic for attracting students from diverse disciplines and backgrounds from applied mathematics to engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposal makes advances in the field of Quickest Change Detection and its Applications. In these problems the goal is to detect changes in the statistical behavior of observations as quickly as possible, while keeping the false alarm rate at a tolerable level.  One of the main findings is reported in the Transactions of Information Theory (which is the top journal in information theory), where the quickest change detection problem with sampling rights constraint is introduced and solved. There are two versions of this problem that is considered both of which are motivated by "energy constraints": one in which the decision maker is given a fixed number of observation rights, and a second one in which these rights come a come randomly. This work determines the optimal strategies and develop low complexity alternatives that are approximately optimal. A companion article in Sequential Analysis solves this problem in the continuous time set-up.  In a paper published in SIAM Journal Control and Optimization (which is the top journal in control theory),  the concept of Byzantine Fault Tolerant Quickest Detection Problems with multiple sensors is introduced. The performance of the so-called CUSUM statistic, which is optimal when all sensors are "honest", degrades significantly, and we showed ways of improving it by fully distributed low complexity schemes. A more centralized scheme can further improve the performance.   In an article that appeared in Stochastics the Quickest Search over Brownian Channels is resolved. This mathematical framework is developed for modeling for the problem of finding unoccupied frequency bands before transmitting information.   As a part of the proposal some important methodological progress is made is tackling stochastic control problems and games, which have implications beyond the problems resolved in the proposal.  The proposal helped with the career development of several post-docs and Ph.D. students.          Last Modified: 08/14/2015       Submitted by: Erhan Bayraktar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
