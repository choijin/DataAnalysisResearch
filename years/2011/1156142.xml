<AbstractNarration>No single discipline has sufficient breadth of perspective and tools to address the societal challenges posed by crime, violence, and lawlessness. Yet currently there is no adequate forum for creating a sustained inter-disciplinary community of researchers to address these issues and train new scholars to adopt this broader perspective. A second problem is that while some of the most cost-effective alternatives to incarceration may include efforts to address human capital deficits and change the social environment, research on those issues too often ignores crime-related outcomes. A third limitation is that research on crime tends to be provincial, and ignores potential insights from variation in policy or social conditions within or across other countries.  This proposal is to establish a research coordination network (RCN) that would seek to create an international inter-disciplinary network of researchers to study these issues, and which would include: annual meetings to discuss new research; a training component via an interdisciplinary cohort of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral "NSF / NBER fellows" to help organize the meetings and actively participate; a data component through which fellows would identify new data sources to add to the those available on the NBER websites and other sources; and a dissemination component that leverages the outstanding capacities of the NBER website.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific benefits will flow from shared data and research methods, new research collaborations across disciplines and nations, the expanded consideration of crime-related outcomes in conjunction with the cost-benefit evaluation of social programs, and mentorship of junior researchers. New knowledge generated from this process will serve the public interest in reducing criminal behavior at lowest possible social cost.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal investigator, together with colleagues Jens Ludwig and Justin McCrary, had as a major goal to create a research coordination network (RCN) of leading researchers from economics and other disciplines to stimulate discussions, research collaborations and mentoring of junior researchers around the connections between human capital and social capital &ndash; or the social environment, broadly defined &ndash; and criminal behavior.     More specifically, the primary mechanism for bringing the network together and stimulating network cohesion was the annual NBER Summer Institute.  This meeting brings about 1500 applied economists together in Cambridge, Massachusetts, many of whom have a research interest in crime and criminal justice. The NSF grant has enabled us to bring in non-economists and economists working outside of the U.S., and to involve junior researchers and those from under-represented groups.     We appointed a diverse group of two dozen graduate students and post-doctoral fellows as NSF/NBER Crime Research Fellows during 2012 and 2013.  That program was replaced in 2014 by a less formal program of welcoming graduate students to attend sessions if recommended by their advisors.  The Fellows have now taken career positions in Universities and are among the leading young "crime and criminal justice" scholars in several disciplines.     We held a total of four two-day workshops at the NBER summer institute, in July 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.  These workshops each involved 14 papers selected from scores of submissions.  We included some of the Fellows in every workshop as presenters, and assigned senior scholars to serve as their discussants.  Other presenters, discussants, and the audience included a number of foreign scholars at our invitation, which has helped provide stronger international linkages to the burgeoning "economics of crime" field and introduce the younger scholars to the foreign leaders of this field.  Finally, we were able to integrate a number of non-economist social scientists into the program,  One memorable session has psychologist Kenneth Dodge paried with Nobel Laureate James Heckman for a fascinating exchange on early childhood influences on criminal behavior.      The grant has also supported the creation of new data resources.  Under the direction of Justin McCrary, working with NSF/NBER fellow Aaron Chalfin, a large FBI Uniform Crime Reports data set has been cleaned and documented.  (The version posted on ICPSR has changes in column locations from year to year, and those changes have not been documented in the past.

Under the direction of Philip Cook, NSF/NBER fellow Songman Kang has developed a new data set that links North Carolina administrative data on all students in the public schools to Department of Corrections data on convictions and juvenile delinquency data.  The linked data support unique investigations of school-to-crime trajectories using data sets of 100,000 individuals or mo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
