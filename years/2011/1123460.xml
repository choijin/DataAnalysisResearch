<AbstractNarration>Does the dialect you speak determine how you hear the speech around you? With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Tyler Kendall and Dr. Valerie Fridland will conduct twenty-four months of linguistic research investigating how vowel perception is affected by dialect experience. Utilizing web-based perception experiments to gain participation from across the U.S., and recording speech from a subset of these participating subjects, the project will investigate what links exist between the perception and production of vowel categories (e.g., "ee" and "ih") and how these categories are mediated by variation at the level of the community and the individual. In particular, the research will examine whether distinctive regional vowel changes that affect three main dialects of American English (Northern, Southern and Western) are contributing to greater diversity in speech processing, in addition to speech production, and whether the degree to which individuals show such vowel changes themselves affects their speech processing in relation to their community norms. To gain a better understanding of the impact of social influences on speech perception, this research will investigate whether listeners' categorization of vowels is also affected by their expectations regarding learned social distinctions among speakers, such as regional affiliation or gender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing evidence suggests that socially derived linguistic variation provides more than simply clues to social identity, and, in fact, plays a pivotal role in the actual processing and decoding of the speech signal itself. Research in this area should prove to have applied benefits such as informing educational approaches to non-native language/dialect populations and also to the development of voice recognition technologies. Further, comparative examination of the productive and perceptual range of speakers affected by different dialect experiences will inform both speech and hearing science and sociolinguistic research, contributing to basic theories about the nature of speech processing and of sound change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Building on findings from previous work supported by NSF, this grant project collected data on a vowel categorization task from over 750 participants across the United States, along with speech samples (providing vowel production information) from a subset of these participants, in order to explore three main topics:  (1) Vowel Production and Vowel Identification: how does a talker?s regional accent (i.e. vowel productions) relate to that same talker?s perceptual patterns in vowel identification? In other words, is there a relationship between how we speak and how we hear the speech around us?  (2) Vowel Dynamics: how do under-studied aspects of vowel production, such as duration and vowel spectral dynamics, relate to other, more studied aspects of regional vowel shift participation?  For example, do stereotypes of the Southern ?drawl? or ?slower? speech reflect measureable differences in linguistic cues cross-linguistically?  And,  (3) Social Information: how does the addition of talker-specific social information alter listeners? perceptual ranges in our vowel identification tasks?  Does knowing something about group-level (social) associations of a speaker alter how we hear that speaker?     This project has enlarged the scope of sociolinguistic work to incorporate more fully the role of perception in our understandings of regional dialects and in processes of sound change, demonstrating that perception patterns in regionally differentiated ways.  The project has yielded several other significant findings, including a range of findings relating the perception of vowel category boundaries for mid front vowels (i.e. the vowels in words like bet and bait) both to a listener?s regional background and to her or his own productions of those vowel categories.  Our work has also shed new light on regional differences, as well as similarities, in vowel production patterns through a closer examination of how temporal and dynamic properties of vowels covary with more traditional measures of vowel identity.  Finally, we have uncovered further evidence for the role of social factors in perceptual processing, demonstrating that listeners respond differently to our experimental stimuli when being told the stimuli speaker is a local vs a non-local speaker.  As a part of this project, we have also uncovered important regional patterns in perception that do not simply align with traditional dialect maps.  With this research, we have expanded the boundaries of traditional sociolinguistic inquiry to include perceptual processing as an important component of dialect, something often assumed by work on sound change more generally, but rarely investigated.     In terms of intellectual import, our work has combined the field-based approaches and methods of sociolinguistic inquiry with the experimental approaches of speech science inquiry, allowing a marriage of two areas previously benefitting little from collaborative efforts.  This combination has allowed us greater breadth in terms of the type of contributions our research has been able to make to both theories of sound change (sociolinguistics) and theories of speech processing (speech science).  In terms of broader impacts, the supported research has explored how speakers' social and ideological affiliations mediate not only how they pronounce vowel sounds, as many sociolinguistic studies have clearly established, but how their pronunciation and that of those around them affects how they categorize and organize the vowel sounds they hear as well.  If ideologically driven social differences such as race, gender or region are empirically shown to result in different perceptual ranges as well as productive ranges, it carries implications for a myriad of contexts from the selection of pedagogical approaches in classrooms to the development of speech recognition software.
