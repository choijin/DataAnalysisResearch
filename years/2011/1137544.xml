<AbstractNarration>Tennessee State University's Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Vertical Integration of Concepts, Laboratory Experiences and Research Training in Cyber Security across the Undergraduate Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science Curriculum -  is a joint initiative between the Departments of Computer Science (CS) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). The project fosters interdisciplinary research and education in cyber security. The project vertically integrates concepts, laboratory experiences and research training in cyber security across the undergraduate CS and ECE programs, thus enhancing the CS and ECE curricula and increasing research opportunities for undergraduate students. Vertical integration refers to a series of laboratory exercises in a given topical area that starts as well-structured experiments at the lower levels and proceeds as increasingly complex open-ended design projects at upper levels of the curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to 1) offer vertically integrated curricular material in coursework and research training opportunities to cyber security scholars; 2) strengthen the CS and ECE programs by the infusion of vertically integrated multi-year curricular material; and 3) strengthen the university's ongoing undergraduate and outreach programs in science, technology, mathematics and engineering by the availability of education, research and facilities targeted to cyber security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering the rapid market growth of cyber security and a critical shortage of qualified cyber security engineers, the focus of this project is a significant step in training future system designers with a strong appreciation for the complexity, implementation and performance evaluation of cyber security technologies. This project addresses the under-representation of African Americans in the cyber security workforce and in competitive cyber security graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the NSF Targeted Infusion Award #1137544 was to infuse cyber security concepts, techniques and hands-on experiences in undergraduate computer science and electrical and computer engineering courses. The project has resulted in the development of network measurement and mapping education tools in the Cyber security Laboratory at the TIGER Institute in Tennessee State University. Specifically, the award has supported the development of a cloud data center and of education modules in network measurement and mapping for undergraduate courses across all levels. Educational modules have been incorporated in courses within the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Departments.  Overall the project has resulted in two journals, six conference proceedings and five undergraduate research presentations.   Below, we present the objectives and outcomes of the project.  Objective 1:     Prepare Cyber Security Scholars  Outcome (1a): Over 200 students benefited from the infusion of network measurement and mapping modules in undergraduate courses.  Outcome (1b): The students were able to use cloud data center resources to implement the network measurement and mapping modules.  Outcome (1c): The modules also exposed students to ethical issues involved in cyber security.  Outcome (1d): Six students conducted internships at the cyber security laboratory at AFRL Rome. Five students were hired by Raytheon, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin.   Objective 2:   Strengthen CS and ECE undergraduate programs  Outcome (2a): We were able to infuse the education modules in four selected courses from freshmen to senior level in the CS and ECE curriculum.   Outcome (2b):  Topics which could not be taught within the selected courses were introduced as part of undergraduate research training.  Outcome (2e): 100% retention among students who participated in the cyber security undergraduate research training program  Outcome (2f): The team published research results in two journal and five refereed conferences.  Objective 3:   Enhance Institution Infrastructure and Sustainability  Outcome (3a):  The award has helped establish TSUÆs private cloud data center in the NSF TIGER institute. The cloud data center is a part of the TIGER InstituteÆs research infrastructure and is available for research projects in the area of cyber security and advanced computing.  Outcome (3b): Enhance the outcomes of NSF HBCU-UP Implementation and Targeted Infusion awards by providing participating students in these programs cyber security research experiences.  Outcome (3c): The award was leveraged to secure NSF S-STEM and NSF SFS grant awards.  The project has contributed to the cyber security knowledge and capacity in undergraduate curricula and research for students during the project period and future. The team has shared this with the broader scientific community.       Last Modified: 11/30/2015       Submitted by: Tamara Rogers]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
