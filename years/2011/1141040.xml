<AbstractNarration>New Mexico State University and El Paso Community College are collaborating to create a new introductory course that fully integrates instruction in biology and mathematics. The idea grew from a successful Undergraduate Biology and Mathematics project in which teams of faculty and students worked together on common research questions. Now that effort is being broadened and tested on a larger and less experienced student population. Targeted to students beginning their studies of STEM disciplines, the course is offered at both institutions in parallel with more traditional courses and the effectiveness of the two instructional models are compared using common assessment tools. If the combined approach is as successful at influencing student learning and conceptual mastery as expected, it will replace traditional instruction at both institutions. Not only does this innovative interdisciplinary approach provide a solid foundation for future studies in quantitative STEM subjects, it also allows development of strategies to encourage participation of more underrepresented minority students, a large part of the population in Southern New Mexico and Western Texas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project began in Spring 2013 as an integrated math and biology learning community (LC) at El Paso Community College (EPCC).  The projectÆs goals were to prepare and motivate students to pursue education and careers in STEM disciplines.  Our vision was to allow students to explore the relevance of mathematics to biology and vice versa.  We envisioned better mathematical literacy, an established relevancy of mathematics to biology, the promotion of interdisciplinary thinking and problem solving, and a decrease in anxiety in math among students.  A lack of quantitative skills and math anxiety have been repeatedly identified as  key impediments to student interest in and pursuit of STEM careers.      We taught an LC that combined an Introductory Biology course with a College Algebra course.  The students were required to register for classes concurrently.  As instructors, we aligned the topics from both courses and created integrated assignments.  We compared the LC courses with non-integrated (non-LC) math and biology courses.  The principal investigator, Ms. Melinda Camarillo, taught both LC and non-integrated math courses.  The biology courses were initially taught by Dr. Violeta Chavez followed by Dr. Naomi Waissman.  Data was also collected from non-integrated biology courses taught by other faculty at EPCC.     Outcomes were analyzed with Pre and Post Math Anxiety Surveys, student grades, and retention rates.  The Math Anxiety Surveys were meant to gauge student anxiety levels and are a shortened version of the Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale, modified by our co-investigators at New Mexico State University.   A Likert scale examined the responses ranging from "1" indicating "Low Anxiety" and "5" indicating "High Anxiety."  Pre and Post surveys were given in LC courses as well as non-integrated math courses.  Pre surveys were administered the first week of class and Post surveys the last week of class.  The average difference between Post and Pre surveys showed a significant difference between the LC and the non-integrated classes in math anxiety, whereby the level of anxiety in the LC increased from beginning to end of the semester, while the anxiety level in the non-integrated math courses did not change (Figure 1).     The math grades, based on a 4.0 scale, were averaged as one overall grade for the LC courses and one average grade obtained for the non-integrated classes.  The average grade of LC students was 1.52, while the non-integrated classes averaged 1.41.  While this is not a significant difference, perhaps more time would determine whether this LC would eventually see a steady increase (Figure 2).     An acceptable grade in a course is considered a D or above.  According to Figure 3, the percentage of successful grades in the LC math course is 61% versus only 52% for the non-integrated course.  Figure 4 shows final grade percentages from both the LC courses and non-integrated courses, with the most significant difference between students who obtained a grade of D, F, or W.  While the percentage of students with a D or F is higher in the LC, the percentage of students who withdrew is much higher for the non-integrated math students.  Figure 5 represents the retention rate of LC classes as 90%, and 74% for non-integrated courses.  Because LC students stayed enrolled, this likely contributed to a higher percentage of failing grades.      On average, the anxiety level of LC students increased by the end of the semester, with the highest increase seen in students whose final grade was an F (Figure 6).  Although an increase in math anxiety was initially perceived negatively, we believe that this occurrence was due to the students feeling inclined to complete and pass both courses.  Anxiety in this case could be interpreted as concern for their grade because students exhibited increased interest in math, though were unable to make a higher grade.     Students in the LC courses worked closely and developed a strong ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
