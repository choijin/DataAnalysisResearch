<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI's research is concerned with moduli theory in algebraic geometry, a vast area with deep connections to complex geometry, topology, number theory, and representation theory.  Moduli spaces parametrize geometric objects and the relationship between the space and the parametrized objects is a two-way street:  special families of objects endow the moduli space with additional geometric structures, and conversely properties of those objects can be proven using the geometry of the moduli space.  Intellectual Merit:  The PI's research during the tenure of the award largely fell into two categories:  Moduli spaces of abelian varieties.  Moduli spaces of certain varieties (including abelian varieties) can be realized as quotients of bounded domains by discrete group actions, and their uniform negative curvature leads to rigidity properties of these varieties in families.  Part of the PI's research is to understand how additional structures (such as torsion points on abelian varieties) further limit the existence of such families.  This behavior is strongly motivated by arithmetic analogs.  In joint work with Jacob Tsimerman, the PI has developed a general framework to prove such results, resulting in the resolution of several outstanding conjectures in this area.  The techniques also have applications to the birational geometry of these moduli spaces and for example provide a new method for computing their Kodaira dimension.  Symplectic varieties.  The geometry of Ricci-flat manifolds is particularly rich, and hyperkahler manifolds arise as one of their three main building blocks (along with complex tori and strict Calabi-Yau manifolds).  Moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces are an important example, and their birational geometry can be beautifully described by wall-crossing in the derived category of the K3 surface.  The PI---partially in joint work with Andrei Jorza---has applied these techniques to classify special subvarieties of symplectic varieties, thereby proving conjectures of Hassett and Tschinkel.  Broader Impact:  The theory developed by Jacob Tsimerman and the PI applies to a number of geometric analogs of arithmetic uniformity conjectures, and is the subject of extensive ongoing research.  Moreover, the intuition garnered from the geometric case often points to a plan of attack in the arithmetic case, and the PI is currently investigating these strategies.  The work of Andrei Jorza and the PI has yielded a much more comprehensive classification of certain special subvarieites of sympletic varieites in joint work with Christian Lehn.  Additionally this has allowed for an extension of a number of classical results in the field of sympletic manifolds---for instance the Torelli theorem and the classification of birational models---to their singular counterparts.
