<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding to support the travel of advanced doctoral students so that they can participate in the 15th International Conference in Artificial Intelligence in Education and in the Young Researchers Track (YRT) that is part of that conference. The Young Researchers Track provides a forum for Ph.D. students to present and discuss their work with mentors from outside of their home institutions and to meet peers with similar interests. Mentoring happens in two ways -- as part of the Young Researchers Track, where they will be encouraged and offered feedback by three mentors, and through an individual mentoring program where each doctoral student will be matched with a mentor with expertise in the student's research area. Mentors will be senior AI and ED researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the Young Researchers Track are members of the next generation of cyberlearning researchers. Participation in the proposed program will supplement their education at their home institutions and help prepare them to be leaders in transforming education through the use of learning technologies.</AbstractNarration>

The YRT/DC has been very successful in past conferences. Comments and feedback from previous AIED conferences indicate that the carefully structured conference format continues to be professionally rewarding and stimulating to all who attend.   Participant Selection Process  Funded participants were selected from among the US-based participants of the Symposium, most of these participants were authors selected through peer review of research abstracts (three reviewers per abstract).  This grant paid full or partial travel reimbursements for 13 graduate students, who were selected from among the US-based participants at AIED 2011 to make presentations in the Young Researcher Track (YRT) or the main conference at AIED 2011.   The selection process for the student travel awards was made through a special call for submissions to the YRT as part of the main conference. The call for submissions (see http://www.aied2011.canterbury.ac.nz/docs/yrt/aied2011-call-for-yrt-letter.pdf) required students to submit three page papers with references that included the following information:   The problem(s) that is addressed by the research and how it fits into the bigger picture The aims and objectives of the research The methodology to achieve the aims and objectives The main contribution(s) of the research to the AIED community.    Students had to be pursuing their PhD studies in a recognized US university, and they were required to justify that their research was at a stage where feedback from the AIED community might be of value. In addition, students were required to submit a sponsoring letter from their research advisor. US students, who had papers accepted in the main conference, were also allowed to compete for the travel grants. A committee of three senior researchers in the field evaluated all of the submissions, and selected 15 students to receive full or partial travel awards.  13 students used teh awards, and their names and affiliations appear in Figure 1. Figure 2 lists their topic of presentation, and includes other international students who were provided support by the AIED society. Students funded by the travel grant were required to submit a formal report describing their experiences at the conferen...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
