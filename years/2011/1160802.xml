<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this research project is to develop a mathematical understanding of a number of scientific phenomena that are modeled by nonlinear integro-differential equations. The main thrust of the project concentrates on solutions of nonlinear problems involving anomalous (in particular integral) diffusion processes arising, for instance, in phase transitions, fluid dynamics, game theory and optimal control. Specific examples of the type of phenomena being studied include, in the continuum mechanics side, the analysis of equations modeling surface phenomena, like ocean-atmosphere interaction (the quasigeostrophic equation) or planar dislocation propagation, and diffusion at multiple scales, like polymers or turbulent flow, while on the probability side, problems of optimal control in game theory and finance, involving random variables that jump discontinuously (Levy processes or Levy walks) in changing environments.&lt;br/&gt;The issues to be investigated in this research project have a certain universality in the sense that the same paradigm reappears from geometry and analysis, to fluid dynamics and material sciences, to financial mathematics and more recently biology and stochastic geometry. The proposed research program will improve the interplay between modeling and phenomena in these areas. Understanding their basic structure will promote interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research related to this grant has been mostly dedicated to issues concerning diffusion processes. Particularly those exhibiting non local phenomena, non linear behavior and the presence of phase transitions.  Diffusion processes can be described as those phenomena where a temperature, a density or a flow tries to revert to its surrounding "average" value. In an insulated material, caloric energy will flow from higher to lower temperatures to even out the temperature distribution, a species will invade less populated areas,  in a viscous flow a particle will gain or lose speed dragged by its surrounding flow.  Traditionally, these phenomena have been described and numerically simulated under the ansatz that the superposition of infinitesimal interactions among surrounding particles describes long range affects, giving rise to the classical theory of partial differential equation. Many important phenomena, though, have present non local interactions and memory components that have to be incorporated in an integral way. For instance, if the diffusion species has "global" information due to, say, the presence of a chemical potential they created; their diffusion (or aggregation) pattern may change.  A good part of our research has evolved in these directions and some specific examples are included below.  We developed a general existence regularity and stability of non local processes with memory. This research was originally motivated by the quasigeostrophic equation. (QG) The QG equation describes the temperature evolution of the water on the ocean surface where the temperature at different points "communicates" through the atmosphere. It is a "critical" equation where diffusion through the atmosphere and non linear surface transport due to water flow compete in a borderline fashion.  In part due to the ideas developed there, we study how other non local and at the same time non linear equations behave. An interesting case is the equation describing compressible (gas) flow in a porous media. The main variables are the density and pressure. It was proposed, (Caputo et. al.) that the pressure was determined by global in space and time (memory) potentials of the density, due to the pore alteration. We gave an extensive treatment of this problem: existence through implicit in time schemes through energy and entropy methods, finite speed of propagation, etc. Similar equations arise also at the continuous limit of particle systems. (Giacomin, Lebowitz)  Another family of problems concern movement by non local mean curvature, minimal surfaces and phase transition problems. Given, for instance, a surface involving a set,  its mean curvature at each point averages the way the surface is bending inwards and outwards of the set. Mean curvature is often an important factor in the way interphases between two materials evolve in phase transition theory and it has been proposed that a non local interaction among the adjacent domains plays the role of a non local mean curvature (Chen and Fife).  A few years ago, we starting developing the basic theory of non local minimal (stationary) surfaces and the regularity theory of phase transition problems where bulk factors on each side of the surface interact with the non local minimal surface of the interphase.  Other aspects were also studied including:  Non local optimal control, where the value of a portfolio changes discontinuously (a Levy process) and at the same time two players can influence the jump in opposite directions in "a non local tug of war game."  And lastly, we studied boundary diffusion, like in the theory of semipermeable membranes, where flow can only occur in one direction, etc.       Last Modified: 06/03/2016       Submitted by: Luis A Caffarelli]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
