<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemistry Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Suzanne Bart at Purdue University.  In this project, Professor Bart will focus on the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of reduced uranium complexes for small molecule activation.  The planned research will test the hypothesis that low-valent uranium alkyls are useful synthons for elusive uranium targets.  Experiments will be carried out to 1) obtain a family of uranium(III) alkyls with a variety of ancillary ligands, 2) understand under what conditions uranium can undergo two electron processes, similar to late transition metals, including reductive elimination, oxidative addition, and migratory insertion, 3) explore the utility of uranium alkyls for multiple bond formation. The planned research includes synthetic methods, spectroscopic analysis, and computational approaches to fully understand the reactivity of these compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the educational plan, Professor Suzanne Bart will continue and expand her initiative to increase the population of women among college age science majors with her ChemTeens conference (formerly "High School Day on Campus for Girls"). Through this program, junior and senior female students are invited to interact with leading female faculty in the chemical sciences at Purdue to learn about careers, college majors, and the benefits and challenges of a career in the sciences. At this event, participants also make connections with current undergraduate and graduate students who can serve as mentors and take the intimidation out of a major in science as the participants begin their college careers.  Professor Bart will also participate in a program aimed at high school teachers in Indiana.  Through this program, the high school teachers could perform and videotape in Professor Bart's laboratory those demonstrations not possible in their own classrooms.  These demonstrations help to highlight the importance of rare earth and actinide elements.</AbstractNarration>
