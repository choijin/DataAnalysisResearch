<AbstractNarration>This award will support an an observational program to study  the Be class of stars and their surrounding disks.  Observationally, Be stars are intermediate-mass stars with temperatures about 9000 K that show emission lines in their spectra from circumstellar material.  While Be stars have been studied for a long time, recent data on high-energy particle emission has spurred a new interest in these objects.  Dr. McSwain and her group have discovered a large population of very active Be stars in a young open clusters, and now wish to perform detailed studies of these stars.  They will perform a photometric study of nonradial pulsations of Be stars, produce accurate models of nonradial pulsations on the distorted surfaces of rapidly rotating stars, model the flow of material into a circumstellar disk, and compare the predicted disk masses to observations of observed disk growth episodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is expected to shed light on the effects of rapid rotation upon stellar structure and evolution, surface activity and mass loss via stellar pulsations, and upon very high energy particle acceleration produced by the interactions of the disk with a compact companion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A "Be star" is a type of massive star, about 5-10 times larger than our Sun, that is surrounded by an equatorial disk.  The stars are rotating almost, but not quite, fast enough to fling off stellar material into the disk.  To form the disk, the star needs an extra boost from some other process, and that is what Prof. McSwain and her research group investigated with this award.  They found evidence that at least 25% of Be stars have short-term variability (with periods less than 2 days) that is consistent with nonradial pulsations across the stellar surface.  The pulsations cause the star to ring like a bell, and the vibrations provide enough linear and angular momentum to eject material into orbit.  Prof. McSwain and her collaborators are continuing to study these pulsations and model how mass is ejected into the circumstellar disk.     Many Be stars are joined by neutron star companions, and in one rare case, a black hole.   Neutron stars and black holes are the dead, post-supernova remnants of former massive stars.  Many neutron stars are observed as pulsars, which produce rapidly pulsed radio emission.     The companion interacts with the circumstellar disk to produce emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from very high energy gamma-rays to the lowest energy radio waves.  Prof. McSwain and her collaborators measured the emission from several binary Be star systems to study how the companion affects the disk structure.  They found that the Be star disk can grow substantially as a pulsar passes close to the disk, triggering a tidal disruption of the stellar surface and pulling off additional mass into the disk.  The excess mass then collides with the neutron star, producing a bright gamma-ray flare during each orbital cycle.  On the other hand, a more widely separated black hole companion does not lead to such dramatic flares, and they may produce barely a hiccup of gamma-ray emission.  These results were published in a series of papers in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
