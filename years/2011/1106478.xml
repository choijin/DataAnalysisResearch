<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for US participants, especially women,&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the&lt;br/&gt;twenty-third and twenty-fourth international conferences entitled&lt;br/&gt;Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC), to be held,&lt;br/&gt;respectively, in Reykjavik, Iceland, and Nagoya, Japan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continuing success of the annual FPSAC conferences stems in part&lt;br/&gt;from their considerable interdisciplinary breadth -- linking leading&lt;br/&gt;researchers in combinatorial mathematics with strong researchers in&lt;br/&gt;allied fields drawn from pure and applied mathematics, theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science, physics, and biology. The span of this conference&lt;br/&gt;series is unique among international conferences with an emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial mathematics.  The principal topics featured during the&lt;br/&gt;FPSAC 2011 and 2012 conferences will be algebraic, geometric, and&lt;br/&gt;enumerative combinatorics. The emphasis will be on applications in&lt;br/&gt;physics, biology, and computer science and on relations to other areas&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra,&lt;br/&gt;K-theory, geometric group theory, representation theory, and&lt;br/&gt;symplectic geometry.</AbstractNarration>

From FPSAC 2011 "...for the second consecutive year, being at FPSAC has led to me meeting new people who have subsequently invited me to speak at their seminars."  "FPSAC 2011 was the best experience I have had as a student in mathematics.

To be surrounded by so many people in my field made me realize that my own research is not in a bubble, and that other people share my interests and ideas."   "I presented my results in the form of a poster and one of the people who talked with me about my poster made some excellent comments about ... which looks like it will lead to another paper.
