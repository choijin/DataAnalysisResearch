<AbstractNarration>WDM (wave-length multiplexing) Optical networks form the critical backbone of all modern communication networks and systems. Therefore, there has been a great deal of interest in the fault tolerant design and operation of these networks. In the past decade or so several fundamental advances relating to the fault tolerance, protection and restoration issues have appeared in the literature. Most of these advances have been in the context of failures in one layer. But, modern communication systems consist of multiple physical implementations communicating via layered protocols. As such, a single failure at one layer may lead to cascading failures, i.e., failures at the physical layer lead to failures at the logical layer. Research in this area of cross-layer survivability is still in its infancy. In this basic research project the principal investigators will carry out a study of network survivability across layers to deal with cascading failures in layered networks. The research will be in the context of IP-over-WDM Optical networks. The focus will be on multiple failures in the physical (optical) layer and their consequences at the higher layer, namely the IP layer. Specifically, the broad scope of the project will cover i) survivable logical topology mapping under multiple failures, ii) Logical topology mapping for guaranteed survivability, iii) Logical topology mapping under multiple constraints, and iv) A generalized theory of flows across layers, capacity of survivable logical topologies and related algorithmic challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to develop unifying theories and methodologies that will make significant advances to our understanding of cross-layer survivability issues, and providing the theoretical foundation for future advances in the general area of cross-layer design and optimization. These theories will be based on modern advances in graph theory, mathematical programming (e.g., network interdiction) and algorithm design. The principal investigators will develop innovative algorithmic techniques based on advanced data structures and computer algorithms such as approximation techniques as well as a generalized theory of cross layer flows that will go well beyond the widely used classical theory of single layer flows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Although IP-Over-WDM networks will provide the context for the research, the theory of cross-layer flows and the algorithmic (in particular approximation) techniques that will be developed will have multidisciplinary value spanning computer science, electrical engineering, graph theory and mathematical programming. The research will also have significant educational value in training highly skilled researchers for research and development in cutting edge technologies in different areas of information technology.</AbstractNarration>
