<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses on electrophoresis in liquid crystals.  Electrophoresis is a motion of charged dispersed particles relative to a fluid in a uniform electric field. The effect is widely used to separate macromolecules such as DNA and proteins, to assemble colloidal structures, to transport particles in nano- and microfluidic devices and ePaper type of displays. Typically, the fluid is isotropic (for example, water) and the electrophoretic velocity is linearly proportional to the electric field. It has been recently demonstrated that when the electrophoresis is performed in a liquid-crystalline nematic fluid, the effect becomes strongly nonlinear, with a velocity component that is quadratic in the applied voltage [O. D. Lavrentovich, I. Lazo, O. P. Pishnyak, Nonlinear electrophoresis of dielectric and metal spheres in a nematic liquid crystal, Nature 467, 947-950 (2010)].  The goal of this project is to explore the fundamental physical mechanisms controlling the LC electrophoresis, establish the role of LC orientational order, anisotropy of dielectric and electroconductive properties, determine the flow patterns around an electrophoretic particle, explore the phenomenon as the function of amplitude and frequency of the driving voltage, type of the liquid crystal carriers and the particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY  &lt;br/&gt;Electrically-induced transport of particles in fluids is an important phenomenon with applications ranging from e-readers such as Kindle to health sciences, where it is used in separation of DNA molecules and proteins, antibiotic and vaccine analysis.  In regular fluids (such as water) a particle can move parallel to the field direction when it is electrically charged.  This project explores a new type of electrophoresis that occurs when the particle moves in a liquid crystal rather than in a regular fluid.  The ordered structure of the liquid crystal brings an entirely new dimension to the effect.  For example, particles that cannot move in a regular fluid (say, because their electric charge is zero) acquire the ability to move once the medium has a liquid crystalline order.  The project will explore the basic mechanisms and feature of the electrically induced motion of microparticles in liquid crystals.  The phenomenon offers new perspectives for practical applications where highly flexible, precise and simple control of particle (or cargo) placement, delivery, mixing or sorting is needed.  The research will offer new insights for the display technology, colloidal assembly, sorting, microfluidic and micromotor applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Manipulating fluids and particles by an electric field is a broad theme of fundamental scientific and technological interest.  One of the oldest known effects is electrophoresis, i.e. a motion of charged particles dispersed in an electrolytic fluid, under the action of a steadily applied electric field.  The velocities of the particles are usually proportional to the amplitude of the electric field.  Current applications based on electrophoresis range from medical diagnostics (such as pregnancy tests, DNA and protein separation) to informational displays such as e-paper readers. For many decades, the research focused on the case when the electrolyte, i.e. the fluid in which the electrically triggered dynamics occur, is an isotropic fluid, such as water with added salts.  The research conducted within the NSF-supported project on Electrophoresis in Liquid Crystals focused on a new type of electrolyte, namely, on anisotropic fluids known also as liquid crystals. The defining feature of a liquid crystal is that its molecules are orientationally ordered, being parallel to each other. In a regular isotropic fluid, the molecules are not aligned and can be oriented in any direction, independently of other molecules.  The project demonstrated that by using a liquid crystal, one achieves a new mechanism of electrophoresis with many advantageous features.  First, the velocity of the particle grows with the square of the applied electric field (rather than linearly). The quadratic dependence allows one to use an alternating current instead of the direct current driving, which eliminates parasitic effects such as screening of the electric field and electrochemical processes at the electrodes.  Second, the particle trajectory in the liquid crystal can be controlled in such a way that it is not collinear with the direction of the applied electric field.  This feature allows one to design curved trajectories of the particles; the feature might be useful in future applications, for example, when one need to mix different components sequentially.  Third, the liquid crystal-enabled electrophoresis can transport particles that are deprived of any electric charge.  This feature is important for diagnostics, as many molecular species of interest are either weakly charged or not charged at all; moving them in space has been a fundamental challenge so far.  The project established that all the beneficial features of the liquid crystal-enabled electrophoresis are rooted in the new distinct mechanism of electric charge separation.  Charge separation is necessary to trigger the motion, as the separated charges feel the applied electric field; charges that are too close to each other are effectively neutralizing each other and thus do not move in the field.  In regular electrophoresis, separation of charges occurs either at the surface of dielectric particles placed in contact with the electrolyte, or through polarization charges generated near conducting substrates.  In contrast, separation of charges in a liquid crystal electrolyte occurs in the bulk of the medium in presence of molecular reorientations, thanks to the anisotropy of physical properties of the liquid crystal such as electric conductivity. In other words, the distinct feature of the liquid crystal, namely, orientational ordering of the molecules, enable a new mechanism of electrophoresis that overcome many limitations known in the classic version of electrophoresis, such as zero mobility of uncharged particles.  This fundamentally new mechanism has been termed "Liquid crystal-enabled electrophoresis", or LCEP.   The project advanced our understanding of electrophoresis and of liquid crystals as materials for applications other than informational displays in flat panel TVs and computer screens. The liquid crystal enabled electrophoresis enables one to design practically any three-dimensional trajectory of the particle. The phenomenon offers new perspectives for practical applications whe...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
