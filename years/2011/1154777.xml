<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the 5th NSF Large Facilities Operations Workshop, which will be hosted by Michigan State University on the site of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), April 24-26, 2012.  The NSF Large Facilities Operations Workshop has been held annually since 2008 and provides a forum for discussing best practices and sharing lessons learned from operational experiences at the NSF-funded large facilities.  The workshop will emphasize fostering close interactions and making new contacts to facilitate continuous improvement efforts in operational aspects of NSF large facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will address long-term issues such as workforce development. It is also an excellent venue for cross-fertilizing best practices at facilities representing a wide array of NSF disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit:   The purpose of this annual meeting was to bring together NSF staff and personnel from NSF-funded large facilities that are currently in operation. The workshop provided a forum for discussing best practices, sharing lessons learned, making new contacts and fostering better interaction between facility operators and managers to promote more efficient and effective facility operation across the spectrum of NSF-support installations.   Three major themes were discussed by fourteen presenters:  Life Cycle Management of Large Facilities  Facility Access Challenges  Scientific Workforce Development   The workshop involved 79 participants, who were engaged for two and one-half days of presentations,round-table discussions, breakout sessions, and a reception/tour at NSCL.

Broader Impacts:   The LFW facilitated broader understanding of issues commonly faced by all NSF-funded operators of large facilities. Large facilities are fundamental components of NSFÆs teaching and training mission. By sharing knowledge and experiences, operators were able to strengthen their ability to efficiently manage their facilities for the benefit of all researchers, students and educators. The workshop served as a forum to disseminate information regarding a variety of technical issues related to the management of large facilities, thus enhancing the operational capabilities of shared-use large facilities among a diverse group of participants. In addition, this workshop had thematic presentations on workforce development, where keys to identifying, hiring, and retaining highly qualified individuals were discussed, as well as actions and behavioral trends that can help diversify the scientific workforce at large facil...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
