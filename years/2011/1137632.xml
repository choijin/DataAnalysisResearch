<AbstractNarration>The M6.3 Christchurch earthquake struck the Canterbury region in New Zealand's South Island on 22&lt;br/&gt;February 2011, causing widespread damage and multiple fatalities. The earthquake occurred at 5 km&lt;br/&gt;depth, 10 km south-east of Christchurch, New Zealand's 2nd-most populous city. It followed ~6 months&lt;br/&gt;after the Sept. 4, 2010 M7.1 Darfield earthquake in the same region. The Christchurch earthquake was&lt;br/&gt;part of a series of earthquakes and aftershocks in the region following the 2010 M7.1 Darfield. New&lt;br/&gt;Zealand's GNS Science describe it as "technically an aftershock" of the earlier event while other&lt;br/&gt;seismologists from USA and Australia consider it a separate event, given its location on a separate fault&lt;br/&gt;system. Seismologically, this M6.3 quake is classed as an aftershock because of its relationship to the&lt;br/&gt;ongoing activity since September last year. However, it has generated a significant series of its own&lt;br/&gt;aftershocks, many of which are considered big for a M6.3 earthquake. Over 200 aftershocks including a&lt;br/&gt;M5.7 were experienced in the first week. It did not occur on the Greendale Fault, on which the 2010 M7.1&lt;br/&gt;Darfield quake occurred, but on a previously unknown blind fault line running 17 km east-west south of&lt;br/&gt;Christchurch, at depths of 3?12 km. On the contrary, precise aftershock relocations suggest that at least&lt;br/&gt;two north-east/south-west trending faults lie between the two and that there is no evidence from the&lt;br/&gt;earthquake data of an extension of the Greendale Fault. However, there are still many aftershocks of the&lt;br/&gt;2010 M7.1 Darfield earthquake spread along the fault line of the 2011 M6.3 Christchurch earthquake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to document the complicated subsurface structure of the damage zones caused by the&lt;br/&gt;sequence of the 2010 M7.1 Darfield and the 2011 M6.3 Christchurch earthquakes in the Canterbury&lt;br/&gt;region of NZ?s South Island, the investigator proposes to record fault-zone trapped waves (FZTWs) generated by&lt;br/&gt;aftershocks, and use the FZTWs to image the rupture zones composed by damaged fault rocks at&lt;br/&gt;seismogenic depths. Because the amplitude and dispersive feature of FZTWs are sensitive to the&lt;br/&gt;geometry and physical properties, and the location of aftershocks (within or outside) of the low-velocity&lt;br/&gt;fault-zone waveguide formed by severely damaged rocks in these two earthquakes, observations and&lt;br/&gt;numerical modeling of recorded FZTWs allow us to learn more about (1) the width, velocity reduction, Q&lt;br/&gt;value and depth extension of damage zones of the 2010 M7.2 and 2011 M6.3 earthquakes, (2) the shape&lt;br/&gt;of subsurface rupture zones with the principal slip plans of the mainshocks, and if the two rupture&lt;br/&gt;segments are connected at seismogenic depths, (3) the difference in rock damage magnitude caused by&lt;br/&gt;these two earthquakes occurring at different depths with different sizes, (4) the fault healing with time&lt;br/&gt;after the mainshock.This RAMP experiment will be collaborated by USC/UoA /UoC/GNS in NZ to pursue the value of&lt;br/&gt;the work proposed, likewise with the ongoing efforts by the NZ national GEONET seismic network and&lt;br/&gt;researchers. GNS will offer to follow the USC/UoA/UoC work and help them keep up with other&lt;br/&gt;initiatives and projects concerning the Darfield event.</AbstractNarration>

(2)   while the 2010 M7.1 Darfield mainshock initiated on a NNW-SSE trending blind fault, the main rupture ran along the E-W Greendale fault with its surface breaks in a total length of ~30-km and likely penetrated to the depth of at least ~8-10 km. Its easternmost portion bifurcated into two blind segments extending further ~5-8 km eastward beneath the dilatational step-over.  (3)   The main rupture zone of the 2011 M6.3 Christchurch earthquake is ~15-km long along the blind Port Hills fault dipping to SSE. Its west extension formed by moderated damaged ran beneath the dilatational step-over approaching to the easternmost branch of Darfield rupture zone.  (4)   The rupture segment of the largest aftershock of M6 is along a NNW-SSE conjugate fault of the east portion of the blind PHF. We tentatively interpret that if a consequent M6+ aftershock happens in Canterbury Plain, it is more chance to occur east of Christchurch out to the sea rather than elsewhere along the GF and PHF which rocks have been severely damaged.       We have used a test model for Darfield-Christchurch rupture zones formed by damage rocks to fit observed FZTWs, within which seismic velocities are reduced by ~35-50% in the 300-m-wide low-velocity waveguide containing a 75-m-wide damage core zone with the maximum velocity reduction.

The spatial extent of fault-zone damage and the loss and recovery of strength across the earthquake cycle are critical ingredients in understanding of fault mechanics and physics.       The present project is in a few cases to illuminate the complicated subsurface fault-zone rock damage structure on multiple rupture segments associated with multiple slips in the M7.1 Canterbury - M6.3 Christchurch earthquake sequence.
