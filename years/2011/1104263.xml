<AbstractNarration>The Discover, Relate, Engage, Attract, Motivate with Interactive Technologies (DREAM-IT) project provides awareness and increases interest in information technology as a STEM career for high school students.  The project team is addressing the challenge of inspiring underrepresented and first generation in college students and convincing them that a STEM degree is attainable.  Objectives include using interactive computer programming to create awareness and interest in STEM careers, fostering a connection with Del Mar College, familiarizing parents with college admission and financial aid opportunities and enhancing high school teacher awareness of STEM careers.  The ultimate goal is to increase the number of students successfully completing introductory computer programming courses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovative project-based summer camp exposes high school students to information technology.  Students are divided into digital media and computer programming teams that form the basis for extended projects.  Teams reverse roles during the second week.  Programming assignments are completed using the Scratch environment developed at MIT.  The teachers arrive three days early to learn the curriculum and technologies.  They then serve as leaders during the camp.  This exposure is expected to impact classrooms in their local communities.  Ongoing activities throughout the year are provided for students and parents to learn more about information technology careers and Del Mar College opportunities.  In total, the three camps are expected to serve thirteen teachers and one hundred students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ DREAM-IT was a National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education (NSF-ATE) grant program in conjunction with Del Mar College (DMC) targeting high school students, studentsÃ† parents, and high school teachers and career counselors to increase awareness of and positive attitude toward technical careers and technical education available to the community in south Texas. DREAM-IT had a two-prong approach to achieve its objectives: 1) DREAMCamp, an on-campus camp where students, teachers, and counselors work to create projects in programming, videography, biotechnology, drafting, robotics, web design, etc. 2) DREAMCaf&eacute;, on-campus sessions where parents and student become more acquainted with the college admissions process and the resources to aid them.  Many students in the local area are first generation in college student; their families are unfamiliar with the school campus, processes for enrollment, financial aid help, and support services available. Such inexperience with the processes causes many to perceive a college education as an unattainable dream.  A major goal of the project was not only to introduce participants to the array of technical education programs available to students, but also to create a sense of friendly familiarity with the college campus to help reduce angst about asking for help and feeling welcomed, removing the apprehensiveness that might easily create a barrier to higher education.  A review of the survey data showed the project was successful in connecting with the parents/guardians of the students attending camps.  The vast majority of parents reported learning information not previously known and feeling more comfortable on the college campus than before their students attended camp.  Information gleaned by the project team ultimately showed counselors were the most efficient and effective resource to provide large numbers of students with important information. As a result, the college will seek to hold information session for high school counselors to keep them abreast of program changes and adoptions.  Data from the project was examined to determine whether participants in the DREAM Camps, over the three years of the project, had subsequently enrolled at DMC.  The data revealed 42% of all DREAM Camp attendees enrolled at Del Mar, with not all participants having graduated high school by May 2015.  Of these participants enrolling at DMC, 44% chose to major in advanced technology, science, math, or engineering.   These numbers indicate that a substantial influence was made on student to continue their academic careers or training at DMC, with a large number of those enrolling choosing advanced technology or STEM degrees programs. Both this, and the fact that the department will sustain the efforts to share advanced technology degree and program information with counselors annually, point to successful attainment or adaptation of the goals of the DREAM IT project.   In summary, the DREAM-IT project achieved all its goals and objectives.  DREAM-IT activities piqued student interest in considering a career in ATE and STEM (Objective 1), and the numerous activities offered during DREAM Camp fostered a sense of connection between the students and the Del Mar College campus and faculty (Objective 2).  The DREAM Caf&eacute; activities familiarized parents (and students) with DMC admissions/registration as well as financial aid opportunities (Objective 3).  Finally, including high school teachers/counselors as DREAM Camp instructors enhanced their awareness of STEM career possibilities (Objective 4).  This type of interaction increased teacher and counselor knowledge that can be shared with students and parents for years to come, thus impacting a dramatically larger number of students than just those students participating in the DREAM Camps.
