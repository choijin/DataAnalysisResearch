<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, and co-funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Louis Bouchard and Omar Yaghi and their groups at University of California, Los Angeles are proposing to develop novel methodologies to visualize chemical reactions in real-time and in a non-invasive manner.  Chemical catalysis and the optimization of chemical reactors rely on the accurate knowledge of chemical reaction thermodynamics, but methods to probe reaction dynamics non-invasively are currently lacking.  Such methods would enable the optimization of catalysts and help improve the design of chemical reactors.  Any improvements in the reaction efficiency could potentially translate into economic savings and reduced negative impact of chemical catalysis to the environment. In this project, the reserachers will develop novel imaging methods to be applied to existing and emerging catalysts such as metal organic frameworks and metal nanoparticle catalysts, which are attractive not only to conventional industrial catalysis but also for modern microreaction technology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learned knowledge from the development of novel imaging technology will be used to devise new experiments to benefit undergraduate education. The researchers are involved in developing new experiments for undergraduate chemistry labs and in developing extracurricular teaching activities that benefit local public schools, where many minority students are enrolled.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merits  Smaller catalytic reactors could be viable alternatives to conventional catalytic reactors with a number of advantages, including higher specific surface, improved efficiency, and better heat and mass transport. However, it is not presently possible to obtain detailed views inside microreactors because inserting probes in the reactor perturbs the reaction. The conventional approach, which is to rely on simple input/output relationships, severely limits the ability to optimize microreactors. It is known that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool that can be used to generate images of chemical reactions inside reactors. In this project, we explored new ways to extend MRI techniques for the study of chemically reacting flows inside reactors, with the aim of studying thermodynamics of these reactions.  The hope is that such techniques could lead to new ways to optimize reactions and reactors, and ultimately, lead to more efficient ways to do catalysis.  The proposal was designed to developed necessary MRI readouts of various physical parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and local concentrations, and then use these parameters to derive other thermodynamic quantities. Much of the effort was devoted to developing the novel readouts and properly validating them on model systems.   The work was divided into 2 Specific Aims. Aim 1: To validate and quantitate non-equilibrium thermodynamic (LNET) methodologies on a model hydrogenation reaction involving metal nanoparticle catalysts. Aim 2: To apply the LNET methods to the study of metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts.   Year 1 activities: Develop novel techniques for non-invasive temperature measurements, inside operating reactors.  Begin development of novel pressure mapping techniques.  Synthesize platinum nanoparticle (PtNP) catalysts.   Identify suitable MOF catalyst, begin synthesis &amp; characterization.  Year 2 activities: Finish temperature mapping technique.  Continue development of pressure mapping techniques (specifically in year 2 we developed a computer algorithm to solve pressure field). Continue synthesis of PtNPs &amp; MOFs (and characterization).  Begin LNET measurements.  Year 3 activities: Finish pressure mapping, continue PtNP &amp; MOF synthesis &amp; characterization.  Finish LNET measurements on PtNPs and MOFs.  The project has produced several scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals, trained many students and postdocs and gave rise to new collaborations.  Additional unexpected research directions have been generated, as it relates to the effects of line narrowing in magnetic resonance experiments and the removal of undesired noise.     Broader Impacts  Impacts on catalysis: We have developed entirely novel methodologies for operando spectroscopy in catalytic reactors.  Completely new methods were developed for the mapping of temperature, pressure and integration of various measurements toward elucidation of the reaction thermodynamics (using the LNET model).  This is a significant development in catalysis.  For the first time, reaction thermodynamics can be obtained in real-time, in operating reactors.  Other disciplines impacted: physics.   We have discovered a flaw in the conventional NMR theory of line narrowing in the presence of magnetic-field gradients.  This result has been published in Physical Review Letters.  In general, this project impacts physics because we are measuring, for the first time, thermodynamics of gas-phase reactions in real-time.  So a lot of unexpected results are anticipated.  Training of students: Two undergraduate students were trained initially. One was admitted at Stanford and the other, to UC Berkeley. Two more talented undegraduates later joined the project. All students were directly involved in the major parts of the research activities, such as chemical synthesis, reactor design and testing, and validation of the NMR methods.
