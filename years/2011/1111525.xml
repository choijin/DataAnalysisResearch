<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Matthew Tarr of the University of New Orleans to study the effects of sunlight, photooxidant particles, and dispersants on crude oil in seawater, using a variety of analytical methods under different, environmentally relevant conditions. The goal of this work is to understand the photochemical transformation of Deepwater Horizon oil as a function of irradiation time, dispersant loading, and the presence or absence of photocatalysts. This work will help to understand the fate of oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill, improve the predictive power of different models used in preparing for future spills, and provide greater overall insight into the photochemical processes affecting crude oil in marine systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this research are centered in the societal benefit of learning, at the molecular level, the fate of crude oil after exposure to the harsh conditions present in salt water with light exposure. Crude oil inside a bore well, which has been preserved for millions of years in the dark, has a very different chemical composition almost immediately upon reaching the surface of the ocean after a spill. This research will provide detailed information about the changes in the general composition of the oil as well as specific changes to the structures of the major components that take place after excitation from visible and ultra-violet light from the sun. This work is critical to our understanding and prevention of environmental damage from aquatic oil spills such as Deepwater Horizon. Professor Tarr's research group will actively engage high school students and teachers, including underrepresented groups, in this research program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on how sunlight changes the composition of oil spilled in aquatic systems.  Thin films of oil were placed on seawater and were exposed to simulated sunlight under environmental conditions.  We measured changes in oil using several sophisticated tools that probe the way the oil interacts with light, what types of molecules are created, and how the toxicity of the water in contact with the oil changes.  The overall findings of this project showed that exposure of oil to sunlight in the presence of water and air results in addition of oxygen atoms to the oil molecules.  This addition is very important because oxygen causes oil molecules to become more polar or water soluble.  After addition of oxygen, the modified oil molecules can more readily dissolve in water, making them more available for further degradation.  However, some of the oxygenated molecules can exhibit higher toxicity to some organisms.  In collaboration with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, we were able to identify the molecular formulas of water soluble oil compounds.  We discovered that the original oil molecules can have 10 or more oxygen atoms added to them through exposure to sunlight.  We also found that some of these oxygenated molecules remain in the oil, while others tend to dissolve in water.  Additional findings focused on the production of reactive transients during exposure of oil films on water to sunlight.  An important reactive transient, hydroxyl radical, was observed in the water, indicating that petroleum compounds can create this highly reactive transient when exposed to sunlight in the presence of water.  Hydroxyl radical is a very strong oxidizing agent that can result in degradation of oil molecules or other compounds dissolved in water.  Additional studies identified singlet oxygen and excited state organic triplets, two other important reactive transients that are involved in the sunlight driven decomposition of oil.  We also observed that under longer term exposure with mixing, oil on water films exposed to simulated sunlight produced thick mousse (see image).  This form of oil can be more difficult to remove from the environment due to its thick, sticky nature.  The results of this research will help us understand how oil behaves when spilled in the ocean and may be helpful in developing better ways to deal with future oil spills.  This project included programs that involved high school students and teachers in the research.  In addition, undergraduate students from the US, visiting international undergraduate students, and graduate students were involved in the research.  Their participation helped to train the next generation of scientists.       Last Modified: 01/18/2016       Submitted by: Matthew A Tarr]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
