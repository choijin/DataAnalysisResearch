<AbstractNarration>The Pennsylvania State University College of Engineering at University Park is providing scholarship awards that target members of groups that are underrepresented in engineering which include women, racial minorities and first generation college students. The Engineering Pathways program is based on a cohort model, bringing the students onto campus for a math-intensive bridge program the summer before they enroll and providing special housing, mentoring and internships throughout the students' undergraduate careers. The elements of the Pathways program are based on the research findings on effective strategies for increasing enrollment, retention and career success for these underrepresented groups. The program awards 10 new scholarships each year to incoming students and, based on student achievement, awards retention scholarships for continuing students. The evaluation plan is designed to provide timely feedback on the success of the students and the overall program, and it will add to the knowledge base of successful retention strategies in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
