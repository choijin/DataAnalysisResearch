<AbstractNarration>This research project consists of two parts: almost everywhere convergence along subsequences and multiple averages. In the first part, the theory of Hardy fields is used to describe good sequences of measurements. Based on two decades of previous work, it has become clear that a complete characterization of good sequences in terms of Hardy fields will be  possible - quite a surprising development in almost everywhere questions. The second part deals with multiple ergodic averages.  It is suggested that  complete characterizations of good sequences for mean convergence and recurrence are possible in terms of Hardy fields. Random modeling of sequences is also investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical impact of the work on almost everywhere convergence is on Fourier analysis and number theory. The Fourier analysis connection is related to the work of Magyar, Stein, Wainger and others. The number theory connection is with bases of the integers. The mathematical impact of the work on multiple averages is in additive combinatorics: problems related to Szemer√©di's theorem. Each of these mathematical connections have been established previously by the PI. As with most theoretical mathematical work, it is difficult to predict the impact on other sciences and other activities of humanity.  But quite pleasingly, the proposer has already found some connections in physics and computer (hardware) security. His collaborations in the foundation of thermodynamics and in hardware security have come about because of work on subsequence ergodic questions. It is also important to note that the connection between the project's activitiy and other parts mathematics has led to some important educational insights into how to teach and view some basic mathematical theories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit of the work done  Ergodic theory, the main subject of the work done in this grant period, grew out of Statistical Mechanics, which is the study of physical systems made up of a large number of randomly moving molecules and other particles.    The fundamental result  of ergodic theory is the ergodic theorem which deals with the interpretation of  measurements made on a physical system. It says that if we measure a physical quantity, say, speed  of a single molecule in a cup of water repeatedly, and take the average of these measurements, we, in fact, get the average speed of all the molecules in the cup of water.  To reemphasize,  the average of speed measurements of a single molecule  is close  to the average speed of all the molecules provided we make a large enough number of measurements.    The ergodic theorem has two main defects: 1) it doesn't say, how many times (how long) we have to take the measurements till the average of the measurements on one molecule gets close to the average of all the molecules. 2) The ergodic theorem demands that the measurements on the molecule are done at equally spaced time intervals, like at 1st second, 2nd second, 3rd second, etc.    The work done addresses both questions.  In the first two years of the project, we addressed defect 2) above, and we examined what happens when the times at which the measurements are random---as it can be expected in case of making measurements in real life.   The main achievement of our work is that we developed a new method to handle random measurements that is elementary, so it doesn't use the usual deep technology of ergodic theory.  This method not only greatly improves the clarity of earlier approaches, but it permits easy applications of the results to other parts of mathematics, such as combinatorics, and it  improves known results significantly.   The other achievement of our work addresses defect 1) above: it establishes a formula, called "large deviation estimate" which can be used to eliminate defect  1) under very general circumstances.  This work started 25 years ago, and now it reached a complete solution.   While the large deviation result brings together three different branches of mathematics, namely, Ergodic theory, Probabilty theory and Fourier analysis, the surprising thing is that the methods have implications to another, much more applied field: statistics.        Broader Impacts of the work done  It usually is very difficult to predict the broader impacts of a theoretical mathematical work, since it usually takes a long time for "real life" applications to emerge. In case of this work, though, some of the broader impacts have already started to emerge.    One is the possible implications to what they call density estimations in statistics.  Density estimations are used to interpret statistical data: given some raw random data (obtained from a poll, survey, or via a measurement), density estimates try to figure out what kind of known random process might have generated the data.  This way, the underlying natural (biological, physical, chemical, etc) law could be identified.  Density estimates can be viewed as a sophisticated verion of curve fitting to given points in the plane.   The other broader impact of the research is not unique to this grant period: the work done in addressing both defects  1) and 2) were noticed to have connections with thermodynamics, and, in fact, the PI has been collaborating for over a decade on reworking the foundations of thermodynamics.   Thermpdynamics is one area of physics which has heavy engineering applications: mechanical and chemical engineering, to name the two most immediate ones.
