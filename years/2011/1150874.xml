<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to develop ways to measure the innovation skills of engineering students, and use the tools developed to design engineering degree programs that produce more innovative graduates.  The research study uses a mixed methods approach to identify innovation skills then measure them in students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project lies in the potential impact it can have on workforce needs in the United States.  The project will widely disseminate its findings on innovation to education scholars as well as academic decision makers.  The project also seeks to provide outreach to the K-12 teachers through support of workshops.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

Engineers play a fair role in supporting innovation as vital agents in a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem. Many efforts have been made in engineering education to support student innovation through new courses, new programs, and even new institutions designed with technical innovation as their core goal. Yet, research on how engineering students approach and experience innovation has been limited. Funded by an NSF-supported CAREER project, the project team conducted a series of empirical studies using interviews, think-aloud protocols, and surveys to examine engineering students&rsquo; views of the innovation process, their abilities to innovate, and the type of experiences that support the development of innovative competencies.</p> <p>By connecting research from diverse fields and building on the interdisciplinary background of the project PI, this project has developed a framework explaining an innovation ecosystem within engineering education. When students characterize innovation in the context of their engineering education, their views suggest an approach to teaching that we call innovation-based education. This approach includes three components: 1) creating value for oneself, peers, and the project&rsquo;s stakeholders; 2) experiencing a cycle of learning by seeking support when challenged and exert autonomy to engage; and 3) working in an environment that that supports innovation through authenticity, autonomy, support, interest, and novelty (See Figure 1). As part of this framework, the assessment of student learning should also be aligned with these components including embracing the unique and unexpected student outcomes that innovation projects can provide.</p> <p>In one study, we examined engineering students&rsquo; understanding of innovation as a process. In this study, students were asked to draw their depiction of an innovation process using smart pens. The research team analyzed two aspects of these drawings: (1) the stage of innovation illustrated and (2) the area that the innovation has focused on. The analysis of the innovation stages revealed that students were more familiar with opportunity identification stage of innovation than later stages of innovation such as life-cycle management (See Figure 2). Students also emphasized the technological elements of the innovation process compared to strategic and societal elements.</p> <p>In another influential study, the project team explored differences in the experiences of students with innovation through courses, internships, projects, etc. In this study, the team interviewed with a diverse group of students who studied engineering. This study resulted in 8 unique ways of experiencing innovation that differ based on the amount of focus on technology and the elaboration of the innovation process. These levels, illustrated in Figure 3, are innovation as: realizing a technical function, redesigning to meet stakeholder criteria, solving a stakeholder problem, filling a gap in market, benefiting a client with new solution, making a difference for a user, helping societal progress, and developing a radically new technology.</p> <p>Informed by these studies, this research project has expanded our understanding how engineering students characterize innovation and provides recommendations on developing more responsive and effective design projects and approaches to teaching and assessment that support innovative competencies. The research recommendations for educators are as following:</p> <ul> <li>design projects should be positioned with the broader innovation process stages in mind and target specific competencies within these stages (e.g., questioning methods for opportunity identification). </li> <li>design projects must be designed with attention to student motivation factors and evaluated based on their ability to support self-directed learning as students create value for themselves and others. </li> <li>teaching and assessment methods must be carefully organized to address key learning objectives and should be diversified to illustrate a culture of innovation.</li> <li>educators must recognize variations in student experiences and views of innovation but at the same time highlight that innovation is not only a function of developing technologies but also meeting human needs and establishing enterprises. </li> </ul> <p>In conclusion, this project has produced research on how engineering students innovate and how educational interventions support the development of these skills. The outcomes of this project have also resulted in recommendations to enhance the education and training of innovative engineers, with long-term impact on continuous growth of our economic viability. Although not all students need to be innovators defined in a traditional sense, all students would benefit from learning to be innovative. To be prepared for 21<sup>st</sup> century engineering, students need the skills to innovate.
