Generally both copies are expressed equally but a small subset of genes is differentially expressed, with a dominant expression from one parent. These maternally or paternally silenced genes are called imprinted genes. Imprinted genes in plants are suggested to influence seed size and quality. To date, imprinting is only found in embryo and endosperm of plants, the two main components of a seed. These tissues are formed through double fertilization.

Genetic and molecular studies in plants have shown that presence or lost of DNA methylation regulates imprinted genes. DNA methylation is a well studied epigenetic mark that is associated with repression of genes and transposons without changing the underlying nucleotide sequences. Recently, we generated comprehensive single nucleotide maps of cytosine methylation and gene expression profiles in rice endosperm and embryo. In this study, we have identified a number of candidate imprinted genes. However, the mechanism by which these genes are selectively expressed in rice endosperm is still elusive.
