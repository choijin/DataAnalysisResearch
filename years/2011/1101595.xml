<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "Fifth Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium (2011)" that will be take place from March 24-27, 2011, on the campus of Rice University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this conference, like those of its four predecessors in the series, is on the rich mathematical legacy of Lars Ahlfors (1907-1996) and Lipman Bers (1914-1993). Some of the special topics of emphasis for this particular event are the following: Teichmuller theory, with a focus on the Weil-Petersson flow on moduli space; the virtual Haken conjecture for hyperbolic three-manifolds; surface group representations into various targets; Schramm-Loewner evolution and its relation to other areas of geometric function theory (e.g., conformal welding). The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities, especially in the two workshop-like sessions and the problem session that the conference will feature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium is a scientific conference on topics in the mathematical areas near 'complex analysis' that has met roughly every three years for the past twelve years, continuing a tradition of sporadic meetings that go back more than fifty years.  The field has at its core some very fundamental topics so that it continues to impact other subjects throughout its history.  Presently, fairly disparate topics like the shapes that we might encounter in space, some aspects of random motion of particles on a dish, curved geometries, and the frontiers of calculus come together fruitfully in this rich melting pot of a field.  The Colloquium had several separate aims.  First, we highlighted the most important developments in the subject over the past three years with nine 'plenary' lectures by the people behind the advances that had had the greatest impact.  Second, we allowed for the exposition of interesting work, but of less prominence than that of the plenary series, in a series fo fifty-one shorter talks.  We emphasized showcasing more junior researchers (together with researchers from institutions that are not at traditional centers of research) in these talks so as to help develop the careers and raise the visibility of these participants who are generally at more fragile stages of their careers.  These speakers often had the opportunity after their talks of discussing their work with the some of the most well-known researchers in their discipline.  Finally, this conference was quite inter-disciplinary for a mathematics conference: there were many groups at this event who do not normally come into contact with one another at more typical events.  In part, this has to do with the parallel development of this colloquium series with the fields it serves over half a century, and also due to the historical reputation of this series as one of the most important conferences of the three year period.  Roughly 225 people pre-registered for the conference, we were able to give some partial support to about one hundred, and about 180 attended. The populations of attendees and supported participants was quite diverse by most ways of measuring diversity.  The talks were of a high quality, and many participants commented that they felt the colloquium helped their research.  A conference proceedings volume will create a versionof permanent record of the colloquium.          Last Modified: 03/19/2012       Submitted by: Michael Wolf]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
