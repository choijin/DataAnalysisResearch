<AbstractNarration>St. Mary's College of Maryland's STEM Navigator project is supporting 30 academically talented individuals who demonstrate financial need, with scholarships during their pursuit of STEM degrees.  Ten scholars, in two 5-scholar cohorts, are receiving four consecutive years of support, beginning with their first year.  Twenty scholars, in four 5-scholar cohorts, are receiving two consecutive years of support following their transfer as rising juniors from the College of Southern Maryland, the local community college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To enable all of the Navigators to experience success, St. Mary's College of Maryland is building upon a largely pre-existing system of support structures, all designed to help students navigate with confidence, their transition from high school or community college to the academic culture of the host institution.  These academic programs include Tresiman-style Emerging Scholars Programs (ESPs, based on the UC-Berkeley Calculus workshop model), customized Navigator seminars (facilitated discussions that support academic and social goals of the Navigators), enhanced summer research opportunities, and the matching of students to key personnel for coordination of mentoring, advising, learning plan development, and the tracking of progress.  The initial St. Mary's ESP in mathematics has drastically improved the performance of historically underserved students in Calculus, and similar success is being found in the newer ESPs.  The Navigator project is adding ESPs in Chemistry and in Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To contribute to the diversification of the STEM workforce, St. Mary's College of Maryland is using previously developed ties with Cardozo High School of Washington, D.C., the Baltimore City Public Schools, and the College of Southern Maryland to encourage and enable previously underserved populations in the pursuit of high-quality STEM degrees.  An articulation agreement with the College of Southern Maryland, already in place for computer science, is being expanded to include all STEM disciplines.  The agreement allows students to apply for dual enrollment at the time of application for entrance to College of Southern Maryland and to complete their BA degrees in STEM disciplines at St. Mary's College of Maryland.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This award supported scholarships for low income students with high academic potential.  Additionally, it supported the expansion of our successful Emerging Scholars Program enrichment courses into Chemistry and Physics which includes all the introductory STEM courses.  It was anticipated that providing financial support and the cohort building experience of both the Emerging Scholars Programs and monthly scholarship meetings would increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. While we initially expected to fund 20 scholars, we were able to fund 34 students.  These students included every STEM major available at SMCM with several students completing double majors and many completing minors.  The Emerging Scholars Programs have been very successful for both our scholarship students and the other students who have participated.  This success includes an increase in grade for the introductory course sequence and an increase in retention of minority students in STEM majors.  We also saw an increase in the graduation rate, especially for minority students who participate in ESP.   Of the 34 students in the SMCM STEM Navigators program, 18 have already graduated (53%) after completing at least one STEM major with another 8 who are on track for graduation with STEM major(s) with less than one semester to go, for a minimum 76% success rate for the SMCM STEM Navigators program. Four students withdrew from the College (12%) (cited reasons were: financial hardship, medical leave of absence, poor grades, one undisclosed), one (3%) graduated with a non-STEM major (with the intent of pursuing graduate studies in a STEM field), and three students (9%) are enrolled with more than one year of course work to complete. If these three students graduate with a STEM degree, our success rates increase to a maximum of 85% for the program. Six of our SMCM STEM Navigators students were STEM double majors (e.g. Biology and Mathematics or Physics and Computer Science) and an additional two students were double majors in one STEM and one non-STEM major (e.g. Chemistry and Spanish), for a total of 30% double majors. Of these 26 students, only 10 (38%) have completed or are anticipated to complete their degrees within a traditional number of semesters; 62% required additional semesters (typically summer courses) to graduate; some of this can be accounted for co-enrollment in the DB program (mandatory summer bridge program), as well as the prevalence of double majors and medical school prerequisites.    Our SMCM STEM Navigators transfer students enrolled in the program with an average of 65 credit hours. Fourteen of our transfer students (n = 18; 78%) finished (or will soon finish) their degree with an average 3.2 GPA, three left the program, and one is still active.  Our traditional undergraduate students (n = 16) enrolled with an average of 6 credit hours, twelve (75%) finished (or will soon finish) their degree with an average 3.2 GPA, two left the program and two are still active.    For every ESP associated with the first semester of a STEM sequence, ESP participants had both a higher grade and a higher probability of continuing on to the next course in the sequence than those students who did not participate in ESP (see Figure 1).       Figure 1: Comparison of grade and retention rates for students in Introductory STEM courses by participation in ESP (Graduating classes of 2016, 2017 and 2018); *CHEM is only classes of 2017, 2018; **PHYS is only class of 2018    Data on STEM major completion is sparse for some of the newer ESPs. However, when looking at the data for all ESP participants from Fall 2010 through Fall 2016, we see interesting information regarding the connection between participation in an ESP in the first year and retention and graduation, especially in minority students.  As seen in Figure 2, the retention and success rates become more dramatic during the time at SMCM.       Figure 2: Retention and Success rates of ESP and non-ESP students in general and for minority students.    We were very encouraged by the success of both the scholarship and the Emerging Scholars Program enrichment courses across the STEM disciplines.
