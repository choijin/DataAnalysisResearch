<AbstractNarration>End-to-end data transfer rate requirements in the computational science communities&lt;br/&gt;---including computational biology, physics, astronomy, medicine, and environmental&lt;br/&gt;modeling--- are soon to approach the terabit-per-second regime. Unfortunately, the&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art in end-to-end transport protocol implementations scales to at most a&lt;br/&gt;few gigabit-per-seconds of single-stream steady-state throughput. This project will&lt;br/&gt;develop a 10Gbps+ Linux transport-layer stack of the novel paradigm of "packet-scale&lt;br/&gt;congestion-control", which can potentially improve scalability by several orders of&lt;br/&gt;magnitude. For this, the project will: (i) develop a non ACK-clocked state machine&lt;br/&gt;that replaces the TCP state machine, and (ii) develop both software-based as well as&lt;br/&gt;hardware-assisted high-speed implementations of precise inter-packet gap control and&lt;br/&gt;packet timestamping. The implementation will be extensively tested on a 10Gbps&lt;br/&gt;in-laboratory test-bed as well as on nationwide NLR paths. The project will then&lt;br/&gt;partner with up to three projects from the scientific domain, for deploying and&lt;br/&gt;evaluating the impact of the protocol stack on their infrastructure. The resultant&lt;br/&gt;implementation is expected to be transformative in the design and implementation of&lt;br/&gt;non ACK-clocked transport protocols. It is expected to dramatically improve large&lt;br/&gt;high-speed bulk data transfers, without requiring expensive dedicated networks, thus&lt;br/&gt;revolutionizing how the computational science community relies on the networking&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
