<AbstractNarration>Elfriede Kraka and Dieter Cremer of Southern Methodist University are supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to continue development of the Unified Reaction Valley Approach (URVA). This project has the ambitious goal of introducing a completely new methodology for the analysis of chemical reaction mechanism, with an emphasis on providing an advanced understanding of homogeneous catalysis. The focus will be on the reaction path, which the reaction complex traces in the reaction valley. From the curving of this reaction path the chemical changes of the reaction complex can be derived. The reaction mechanism will emerge in form of "snapshots" of the reaction complex taken at the path critical points (which correspond to extremal points of the reaction path curvature). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the URVA analysis the mechanism of a wide variety of homogeneous catalysis reactions (including H2 generation and CO2 consumption) will be determined and results will be presented in a generally accessible reaction library. The URVA programs and the reaction library will be made available to the scientific community via the group's web page. New courses in computational chemistry and reaction dynamics for undergraduate and graduate students will bring the new methodology to the classroom.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p style="text-align: left;">More than 90% of all commercial compounds are synthesized by employing a catalyst at one stage of their production. Therefore, the aim of this project was to i) obtain a detailed understanding of catalytic reactions and ii) to develop new design concepts for the next generation of catalysts. URVA (Unified Reaction Valley Approach) studies of more than 400 catalyzed chemical reactions (Fe, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, Au, etc. catalysts) have been collected in a reaction library, which provides new and unique insights into catalysis. General catalytic principles have been worked out that form the basis for a <em>de novo</em> design of catalysts.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">URVA2016 has been programmed as a new method that provides a &ldquo;spectrum&rdquo; of a chemical reaction in the form of a <em>reaction path</em> <em>curvature diagram&nbsp;</em>&kappa;(<em>s</em>) (<em>s</em>: arc length of the curved reaction path). This is based on the vibrational modes and their influence on the reaction path curvature as a highly sensitive indicator for the electronic structure changes of the reaction complex during the chemical reaction. The scalar curvature &kappa;(<em>s</em>) of a reaction contains all mechanistic information, which is obtained by decomposing &kappa;(<em>s</em>) into local vibrational mode components. The latter are easily associated with bond breaking/forming or other chemical processes. A curvature maximum and the path regions up/down to the two adjacent curvature minima define a <em>reaction phase</em>. Chemical, pre-chemical, and post-chemical phases can be distinguished.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Although catalysis can have many different facets, URVA studies suggest that there are only a few electronic principles that are characteristic of catalysis. In general, chemical reactions are initiated by charge transfer/charge polarization processes. One of the reaction partners is labialized and adopts an active form that &ldquo;drives&rdquo; the reaction. The simplest form of catalysis is the <em>electrostatically-driven catalysis</em>: Mechanistic features of the non-catalyzed reaction are enhanced by the presence of Lewis acids/Lewis bases, polar solvents, solid surfaces, etc. We have found many examples of push-pull effects that increase the charge-transfer/charge-polarization effects and that are typical of the electrostatically-driven catalysis. The lowering of the energy barrier of the catalyzed reaction is moderate in these cases.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">A closely connected type of catalysis is the <em>coordination-sphere-driven catalysis</em> that is typical of transition metal complexes. The latter catalyze a chemical reaction by extending the coordination sphere of the transition metal to facilitate a specific charge-transfer/charge-polarization effect. This is often associated with<em>&nbsp;agostic bonding&nbsp;</em>in a general way: Charge transfer takes place from an exposed part of the reactant to a vacant, low-lying orbital of the transition metal and, guided by this transfer, the reactant &ldquo;docks&rdquo; into a natural or enforced hole in the coordination sphere of the transition metal. Geometrical features of the reaction complex come into play for the <em>space-confinement-driven catalysis</em>, which requires that the catalyst generates a compartment that determines the stereochemistry of the reaction. Often, the space-confinement-driven catalysis includes features of the first and second type of catalysis. It is obvious that this type of catalysis requires a larger catalyst, which is able to generate a suitable compartment.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">One example of a <em>coordination-sphere-driven catalysis</em> is the rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation, an important industrial process for the worldwide formaldehyde production. The first step of the catalytic cycle of this process, the ethene insertion, &nbsp;is summarized in Figures <strong>1</strong> &ndash; <strong>6</strong>. The energy diagram of this reaction (Fig. <strong>1</strong>) already indicates that the H transfer from rhodium to carbon seems to proceed in an unusual way, which one can analyze with the reaction force (first derivative of E(<em>s</em>); Fig. <strong>2</strong>) or the energy concentration (second derivative of E(<em>s</em>); Fig. <strong>2</strong>). Neither reaction force nor energy concentration diagram provide a mechanistic dissection of the H-transfer that is useful. The mechanistic details are unraveled by the curvature diagram (the &ldquo;spectrum&rdquo; of the reaction: Fig. <strong>3</strong>): Ten reaction phases are identified in the curvature diagram according to ten smaller or larger &ldquo;spectral lines&rdquo; of the curvature.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">The secret of the reactant-catalyzed breaking of the Rh-H bond (normally: 56.7 kcal/mol, in the reaction analyzed: 11.5 kcal/mol) lies in the way the Rh-H bond is broken: An edge-protonated three-membered ring between rhodium and ethene is formed, which determines the height of the barrier (Fig. <strong>1</strong>). Due to the assistance by the Rh-C bond, the Rh-H bond can be converted stepwise into an agostic, then anagostic bond, and finally a weak Rh,H-interaction (&ldquo;<em>quantized bond breaking</em>&rdquo;). The protonic H (Fig. <strong>4</strong>) seems to &ldquo;slide over&rdquo; the Rh-C bond, which is formed for this purpose (M2 to M6, Fig.s <strong>3</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, <strong>6</strong>) and then cleaved again, i.e. the ethene is first bonded to Rh via a &pi;-complex, then in the form of a rhodacyclopropane, and finally as &sigma;-ligand. <em>The temporary formation of an auxiliary-bond is one of the many fascinating tools nature uses to accelerate chemical reactions, that can be successfully deciphered by URVA2016.&nbsp;</em></p> <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/07/2016<br>      Modified by: Elfi&nbsp;Kraka</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152357/1152357_10187801_1475853075276_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1152357/1152357_10187801_1475853075276_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 3.
