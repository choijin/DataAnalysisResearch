<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the Seventh Annual Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics and the collection and analysis of data on the impact of these meetings on undergraduate women in physics. Six regional conferences will take place January 13-15, 2012, simultaneously at Stanford University, the University of Washington, Texas A&amp;M University, Yale University, the University of Tennessee, and Case Western Reserve University. Data analysis will be centered at Indiana University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conferences have two overarching goals: 1) To give undergraduate women the resources, motivation, and confidence to apply to graduate school and to successfully complete a Ph.D. in physics or a related discipline; and 2) To increase awareness by undergraduate women in physics of the wide range of career opportunities available to them. Regional conferences are held simultaneously to maximize student attendance by minimizing travel, to increase the excitement of the participants in a joint national venture, and to allow the interactive simulcast of a keynote address. The conference goals are achieved by providing a series of inspiring talks by female physicists, panel discussions on graduate school and physics careers, student presentation sessions, and ample opportunity for networking and informal mentoring. The success of these goals will be measured by surveys given to students before and after the conferences, as well as by longitudinal studies following the student's post-graduation paths and comparing them with female student cohorts who did not attend the conferences.</AbstractNarration>

A subaward at Indiana University supported assessment of the impact of the conferences.  The conference hosted at Texas A&amp;M University was in very well attended, with 41 participants. The conference featured a number of elements:  talks by eminent women physicists; tours of forefront research      facilities, including the cyclotron institute and the observatory; talks about the different career      options with a physics degree talks on frontier physics by      current graduate students and postdocs;  panels on graduate school and      careers;  poster session on undergraduate      research by the participants;    Each speaker integrated into her talk a brief description of her personal career path. The keynote talk by SLAC Director Persis Drell described opportunities and choices physicists may face in their professional and personal lives, and provided guidance on handling the dilemmas that may arise.  The websites for all six conferences are linked to this APS-hosted site:  http://www.aps.org/programs/women/workshops/cuwip.cfm  The materials generated by the conferences, including the results of the assessment supported by this award, are archived on an APS-hosted wiki, and are being used to identify and promote best practices and facilitate efficient organization of future conferences.
