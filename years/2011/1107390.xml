<AbstractNarration>Precisely how galaxies initially form and how they change throughout their lifetime are among the least understood problems in astrophysics.  Many projects are centered on unraveling these mysteries.  This project aims to provide the first robust census of gas-rich halos over a cosmologically significant volume and intends to provide important insight into how some massive galaxies maintain huge gas reservoirs without converting their gas into stars and how isolated low mass halos are able to retain some atomic hydrogen gas despite their fragile thermal state and shallow potential wells.  This proposal is intended to conclude the already initiated survey, previously funded by NSF.  The conclusion of the survey was understandably delayed primarily by telescope downtime but should conclude by the fall of 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survey is conducted at the Arecibo radio telescope and uses the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA), the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA).  The survey has already produced results far exceeding the previous survey in this field, and the survey results will help to characterize the mass function of such halos and allow direct comparison with theoretical simulations of Universe in the current Lambda-CDM paradigm.  ALFALFA, an extragalactic HI 21 cm line survey, will identify HI-bearing objects found over 7000 square degrees of the high galactic latitude sky out to z &lt; 0.06.  The public ALFALFA database includes HI line spectra and catalogues of HI line positions, redshifts, velocity widths, and flux densities as well as coordinates and cross-identifications in other digital data sets of the most probable optical counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has educational broader impacts as well.  Graduate students will be intimately involved in all phases of the project, helping to plan and execute the observing program, developing software for data processing and analysis, producing public data products and interfacing with the Virtual Observatory, as well as undertaking their own science projects.  Educational materials that are developed as part of this project will be made available through the existing ALFALFA public web site.</AbstractNarration>

ALFALFA is the first survey of its kind to probe a cosmologically significant volume, i.e. a volume with average properties equal to those of the Universe at large, thereby allowing robust determinations of the atomic hydrogen mass function (the distribution of how much hydrogen a galaxy has, from a small amount to a large amount), its correlation function (a measure of how closely galaxies with cool hydrogen tend to cluster within the local large scale structures) and rotational velocity function (the distribution of rotational velocities of hydrogen-bearing galaxies, from slow to fast rotators). This work has shown that nearly all star-forming galaxies contain cool hydrogen and that the ALFALFA population is the least-clustered population of galaxies known. A subset of the ALFALFA population consists of objects which do not seem able to convert their interstellar medium (gas and dust) into stars, an arrested state possibly linked to the angular momentum of their dark matter halos. The initial result that galaxies with a higher gas fraction for their stellar mass reside in dark matter halos with higher "spin" has been verified by the fact that the clustering of ALFALFA galaxies is recovered in numerical simulations when halos with low spin are excluded. ALFALFA discoveries include previously-unrecognized nearby star-forming dwarf galaxies, extremely metal-deficient galaxies (astronomers refer to all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium as "metals"), very massive hydrogen disks, and candidate dark matter minihalos. Interpretation of the clues obtained from the hydrogen measurements in the context of the stellar populations revealed by ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared imaging from other public databases shows that, on-average, the ALFALFA galaxies are bluer, have fewer metals and have their stars spread over a larger area than samples selected by their starlight. Because of their tendency towards isolation, ALFALFA galaxies include systems which may have existed their entire lifetimes without being impacted by interactions with other galaxies. Their pristine condition makes them good "laboratories" for the investigation of the physical conditions that were common in the primordial galaxy formation epoch. The processes by which gas in these galaxies is converted into stars appears to be different from that in higher surface brightness disk galaxies such as our own Milky Way; rather, there appears to be a bottleneck in the conversion of interstellar atomic to molecular hydrogen, resulting in a slowdown of star formation processes.
