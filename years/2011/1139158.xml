<AbstractNarration>Making Sense at Scale with Algorithms, Machines, and People&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is increasingly awash in data.   As more and more human activities move on line, and as a growing array of connected devices become integral part of daily life, the amount and diversity of data being generated continues to explode.   According to one estimate, more than a Zettabyte (one billion terabytes) of new information was created in 2010 alone, with the rate of new information increasing by roughly 60% annually.  This data takes many forms: free-form tweets, text messages, blogs and documents; structured streams produced by computers, sensors and scientific instruments; and media such as images and video.&lt;br/&gt;Buried in this flood of data are the keys to solving huge societal problems, for improving productivity and efficiency, for creating new economic opportunities, and for unlocking new discoveries in medicine, science and the humanities.   However, raw data alone is not sufficient; we can only make sense of our world by turning this data into knowledge and insight.  This challenge, known as the Big Data problem, cannot be solved by the straightforward application of current data analytics technology due to the sheer volume and diversity of information.  Rather, to solve it requires throwing away old preconceptions about data management and breaking down many of the traditional boundaries in and around Computer Science and related disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Algorithms, Machines, and People (AMP) expedition at the University of California, Berkeley is addressing this challenge head-on.    AMP is a collaboration of researchers with a wide range of data-related expertise, committed to working together to create a new data analytics paradigm.  AMP will produce fundamental innovations in and a deep integration of three very different types of computational resources:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Algorithms: new machine-learning and analysis methods that can operate at large scale and can give flexible tradeoffs between timeliness, accuracy, and cost.&lt;br/&gt; 2. Machines: systems infrastructure that allows programmers to easily harness the power of scalable cloud and cluster computing for making sense of data.&lt;br/&gt; 3. People: crowdsourcing human activity and intelligence to create hybrid human/computer solutions to problems not solvable by today's automated data analysis technologies alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMP research will be guided and evaluated through close collaboration with domain experts in key societal applications including: cancer genomics and personalized medicine, large-scale sensing for traffic prediction and environmental monitoring, urban planning, and network security.    Advances pioneered by the project will be made widely available through the development of the Berkeley Data Analysis System (BDAS), an open source software platform that seamlessly blends Algorithm, Machine and People resources to solve big data problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information visit http://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Algorithms, Machines, and People (AMP) Project set out to execute a complete rethinking of large-scale data analytics (?Big Data?) processing systems by holistically considering: 1) scalable software systems and data management architectures, 2) machine learning and artificial intelligence, and 3) interaction with both human decisions makers and crowds of on-line workers.   AMP was a pioneer in deeply integrating computing systems and machine learning expertise, and as a result produced novel and impactful new computing systems and algorithms.  The project developed scalable implementations of statistical and machine learning methods that had previously been constrained to single machines.  The project also trained a diverse group of students and practitioners who are well-positioned to drive the next wave of innovation in data-intensive artificial intelligence and cloud computing.    The Expeditions grant served as a catalyst for the Berkeley AMPLab, which over its lifetime involved 36 companies as corporate sponsors, produced industry-leading open source software, and spawned numerous products and start-up companies.  Interaction with industrial and academic partners provided real-world applications that drove the research, including: cancer genomics, road traffic prediction, astronomy image analysis, mobile device power management, and crowdsourced information gathering and data cleaning.  Industrial support also augmented the Expedition award funding, enabling a much more comprehensive project.  Impact and Adoption: The project developed open source software that was made freely available to anyone who wished to use it for any purpose.   This software, called the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (BDAS), can be used on dedicated clusters or commercial cloud services.   The core of BDAS is the Spark analytics engine.  Spark, now called ?Apache Spark?, provided 10-100x performance improvement over competing systems and has proven to be a flexible and robust platform.  The project built and released a variety of tools and interfaces on top of Spark, including Spark SQL for database queries, Spark Streaming for real-time analytics, GraphX for graph processing and MLlib for machine learning.   While Spark itself was written in the Scala programming language, BDAS included interfaces for languages such as Java, Python, and R.  This ?unified analytics? approach was a major differentiator to the state of the art, and a key contributor to the software?s popularity.  In 2015, an industry expert from Goldman Sachs opined that Apache Spark was ?emerging as the compelling `lingua franca? API [Application Programming Interface] and platform for scalable Big Data computation?.  Other parts of the BDAS stack also became popular, including the Tachyon (now ?Alluxio?) distributed memory layer and the Mesos resource manager (Mesos was created earlier but enhanced by the AMP Expedition).  The real-world impact of the AMP Expedition?s software is evidenced in many ways.  Four start-ups have spun out of the project: Alluxio, Databricks, Determined.ai, and Mesosphere (now D2iQ).   Together (as of July 2020) these start-ups have raised nearly $1.2Bn in venture capital and employ over 1500 people.   Access to Apache Spark and its related BDAS components is sold by numerous companies (Databricks, Cloudera,  Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, and IBM to name a few), generating substantial revenue and providing numerous jobs in those companies.   Other companies have created their own products using software created by the project, and many companies and institutions use the software for their own internal data analytics and machine learning functions.  Academic Impact: The AMP Expedition trained dozens of PhD students and Postdoctoral scholars.  At least 34 of these are now tenure/tenure track faculty members at leading universities in the United States and elsewhere.   Universities that have hired multiple AMP alumni as faculty include: MIT(4), Stanford(4), CMU(3), Chicago(2), Columbia(2), Cornell(2), Michigan(2), USC(2), and Wisconsin (2).  AMP PhD students received 3 ACM Dissertation Awards (1 winner and 2 honorable mentions), and numerous ?Best Paper? and other awards.   The Expedition generated approximately 200 peer reviewed publications over 8 years.   The three main papers for Spark alone have collected a total of over 11,000 citations to date.  Training, Workforce and Community Development: The Expedition also engaged in training and community building well beyond the university.   The project ran annual ?AMPCamp? training workshops.  These workshops, designed and run by AMP students, provided hundreds of practitioners with in-person data science and machine learning training using BDAS software.   Thousands more attended AMPCamp remotely, via synchronous webcasts and asynchronous published materials.  In 2013, AMP students created the first ?Spark Meetup? group in San Francisco.  There are now 591 such groups worldwide, with over 590,000 members according to the ?meetup.com? website.   AMP students and staff also actively supported and promoted a robust open source community that formed around the BDAS software stack.  In their 2020 annual report, the open source Apache Foundation lists the Apache Spark repository as the most visited of its 2,045 git source code repositories.  In summary, the AMP Expedition was a successful collaboration that drove the state of the art in ?Making Sense at Scale?.
