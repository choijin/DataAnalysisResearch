<AbstractNarration>Dr. James Neff (College of Charleston, South Carolina) and Dr. Douglas O'Neal (Keystone College, Pennsylvania) will lead an effort to understand the physical conditions in starspots.  Analogous to spots on the Sun, starspots are regions in the atmospheres of other stars that are cooler than the rest of the stellar surface.  The goals of this project are to use recent advances in atmospheric modeling codes to determine starspot properties, re-analyze extensive databases of existing spectra using the new techniques, expand observational surveys to include cooler stars, and combine various techniques to yield a better understanding of the observational signatures of starspots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic activity on the Sun is perhaps the most dramatic way in which astronomy impacts our daily lives. By measuring the properties and distribution of starspots on a wide range of active stars, it might be possible to uncover the fundamental nature of the solar dynamo. Photometric light curve modeling, Doppler imaging, and the spectroscopic properties of molecular bands (which are formed only in starspots, not in the warmer unspotted atmosphere) all yield important information about the distribution, temperature, and fractional coverage of starspots.</AbstractNarration>

A third undergraduate institution, California State Fullerton, became involved in the late stages of the project, and we plan to continue the collaboration.  The project has provided research and educational opportunities for approximately 10 undergraduate students, and it has helped to integrate the research and educational infrastructure at all three institutions. In addition to enhancing their astrophysics education, the undergraduate students involved in this research project have developed valuable professional skills such as oral and written communication, planning, management, and the ability to function as part of a team.  Using recent advances in atmospheric modeling codes, we have developed routines to generate realistic synthetic spectra in specific molecular band regions.  With these tools, we developed procedures to directly measure the properties (surface area and temperature) of starspots. Ultimately, we can combine these molecular band results with simultaneous photometry and spectroscopy to probe magnetic activity on other stars, including planet hosting stars.  This will allow us to map magnetic activity on the surfaces of other stars.  It might also permit more precise stellar radial velocity measurements, helping to enable the discovery of Earth-sized planets, and allow us to study the star-planet interactions that critically determine habitability of exoplanets.
