<AbstractNarration>Maria Gomez of Mount Holyoke College is supported by a RUI award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division for research that aims to understand grain boundary structure and how it affects preferred proton conduction pathways in doped perovskite oxides.  The proposal is co-funded by the Condensed Matter Materials Theory program in the Division of Materials Research. A systematic study of the ensemble of proton conduction pathways across tilt and twist grain boundaries of the most stable surfaces is being undertaken using a combination of electronic structure methods and graph theory. With these ensembles, the most probable paths and averages of the limiting barrier across a grain boundary are found. Further, by combining graphs for the grain boundary core with graphs for two differently doped bulk systems, the effect of increasing dopant concentration at the grain boundary are considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the impact of grain boundaries on proton conduction can help set goals for the making of efficient proton conductors. In addition to expanding our understanding of how grain boundaries affect proton conduction paths, which could impact fuel cell design, this project has a broader impact on the training of future scientists, and is being carried out entirely with undergraduate student researchers at Mount Holyoke College, the oldest continuing undergraduate liberal arts college for women in the United States. The student participants will present their undergraduate research at national or regional meetings, and co-author publications. The PI will plan an Adventure Day about energy and materials in the Passport to Chemistry Adventure program she runs for parent/child teams who complete a series of kits at their local public libraries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proton conduction in perovskite oxides has potential for use in fuel cell technologies, humidity sensors and batteries.  Understanding how defects can trap protons and alter proton conduction pathways is crucial to designing great conductors. Kinetic Monte Carlo trajectories show that aluminum dopant in barium zirconate acts as a trap which is escaped infrequently to access long range proton conduction highways away from the dopant as shown in Figure 1.1  The centrality measures developed through this grant were able to highlight both traps and key nexuses connecting traps to fast proton conduction highways in both aluminum and yttrium doped barium zirconate and strontium zirconate and thus alert us to key regions in trajectories as shown in Figure 2.2  The centrality measures used standard probability theorems for average number of steps to first return to a site and converted these to averate time to first return to a site using calculated rates for the different.  Our paper further highlighted that these key regions were not highlighted by either the Boltzmann distribution or electron density plots.  Our recently submitted paper3 shows that proton trajectories are affected by other protons as the first proton distorts the lattice in away that helps the next proton move more easily.   More details on the coperative motion of protons will be included in a paper in preparation.4  Finally, our last paper in preparation shows that lower dopant concentrations lead to decreased distortions and can thus alter the benefits of dopant on proton conduction.5  Experiments sugest that grain boundaries lead to changes in dopant concentration through the boundary, we plan to stitch together the pathways found through differen dopant concentration regions to see how proton conduction is affected by the grain boundary.
