<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to develop an integrative approach to understanding incipient and youthful rift zones developing in thick continental lithosphere by targeting a portion of the East African Rift system in northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. The development of these rifts is a fundamental plate tectonic process yet the driving forces behind rift initiation and early evolution are tenuously understood, particularly the feedbacks and trade-offs between strain accommodation by magmatic and tectonic processes (dike intrusion vs. faulting). Furthermore, the integrative roles of hydrothermal fluids and preexisting structure in weakening the lithosphere and focusing deformation and magmatic activity are virtually unexplored in developing rift systems. This project seeks to explain the relative roles of magma systems below incipient rifts, the development of large border faults and systems of distributed normal faults across rift valleys, and the geochemical influences of hydrothermal fluids in weakening thick continental lithosphere and promoting the development and evolution of focused rift zones. This analysis will utilize: (1) field-based mapping of fault system geometries and dynamics to characterize spatial patterns of strain in association with magmatic systems; (2) 3D visualization of magmatic and fault systems in the lithosphere, and crustal and upper mantle structure along the length of the rift zone segments, using geophysical imaging (a broadband seismic array); (3) sampling of gas emissions from hydrothermal springs along border fault systems to determine chemical signatures of fluids that may contribute to weakening within the lithosphere; and (4) sampling of volcanic products exposed by fault systems for geochronologic analysis, providing temporal constraints on faulting events in relation to magmatic episodes and allowing a quantification of time-averaged strain rates. This study will result in the development of an integrated model of magmatic and fault system interactions during the early stages of rifting that can serve as a benchmark for evaluating continental rift evolution globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continental rift zones are enigmatic in that they develop in thick, strong continental lithosphere for reasons that are poorly understood. Their development is a linchpin of the of plate tectonic process, however, facilitating continents breaking apart, forming ocean basins by the process of mid-ocean ridge spreading. Rift zones worldwide are commonly associated with large magnitude earthquakes as well as volcanic activity, either focused at discrete volcanoes or erupting from tens of kilometer long fissures. They thus present geologic hazards that threaten humans living in rift zone environments worldwide, including the U.S.A. Past work on rift zones in advanced stages of development (prior to continental breakup) has shown that the progressive stretching and thinning of the continental lithosphere by rifting allows the mantle to well up beneath the rift and melt. In young and developing rift systems, however, magma appears to be important for rifting despite very little mantle upwelling at that stage. This suggests that, despite the presence of thick continental lithosphere, magma is able to form and ascend into the crust, enabling extension and helping to drive the faulting. The lithosphere is clearly weakened in some manner to allow magmatic activity to be so focused. This research team hypothesizes that lithosphere weakening is assisted by focused, deep mantle fluids associated with developing magmatic systems and that these fluids chemically alter and weaken the lithosphere, allowing magma to intrude and drive rift development. This work in the East African Rift will allow researchers to determine the relative roles of these fluids and intruding magma in weakening the lithosphere and allowing faults to develop. By combining fieldwork, geophysics, geochemistry, and geochronology, a model for rift development and evolution will be formulated that is integrated across disciplines and will capture multiple facets of the rifting processes. The results of the work will be applicable to rift zone development globally and can thus be integrated into existing plate tectonic models to provide a rationale for why continental breakup is possible.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The East African Rift is over 3000 km long and the type example of continental extension and tectonic break-up.  Magmatism in the East African Rift is spectacularly expressed in numerous currently active volcanoes of great compositional diversity as well as million year old flood basalt lavas that extend over huge areas in the Rift.  This magmatic and volcanic activity results in geothermal resources that provide energy for a number of countries in Africa.  At the same time, the extensional tectonic forces also cause earthquake activity that has resulted in the development of large fissures at the surface, such as the 2009 event in northern Tanzania.  The Rift is also the location of some of the most alkaline lakes on Earth that support life and the associated salt and soda deposits.    Our work in the Natron-Magadi sector of the Rift straddles the countries of Kenya and Tanzania.  We investigated in detail the processes the lead to continental break-up and the development of extensional faulting.  We used a multi-disciplinary approach that includes sampling and measurements of hot spring waters and diffuse carbon emissions from the surface, detailed mapping and categorization of the faults in the region as well as investigating the timing of movement on these faults.  We use geophysical and geochemical methods to constrain the tectonic and magmatic processes that occur in the region and develop a comprehensive model for the current and past extension of the continent.   Our results show that fluids containing large amounts of carbon dioxide and other volatiles are moving from the mantle or the base of the crust through faults to the surface.  The fluid movement appears to be focused on the faults and the source of the fluids are probably large unerupted magma bodies at deep crustal levels.  Our estimates of carbon dioxide emissions support the idea that degassing along faults in the rift is substantial and similar to what is emitted through the volcanoes in the Rift.  Our work further implies that the degassing of these magmas at depth plays a key role in the rifting process and may weaken the crust sufficiently for faults to develop.  Our work has implications for the formation of other continental rifts, for example the Rio Grande Rift in the South Western USA.  Our work also has implications for the movements of fluids in continental extensional settings in general, with applications for better understanding the formation of economic resources and earthquake hazards.
