<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Protein phosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism by which cells respond to environmental signals. In eukaryotes, protein phosphorylation is carried out by a large and diverse family of protein kinases, which display remarkable diversity and complexity in their modes of regulation. The complex modes of protein kinase regulation have evolved as a consequence of natural selection operating on genomic sequences for billions of years. Despite the availability of over 100,000 protein kinase sequences from diverse organisms, however, very little has been done to use the evolutionary information embedded in genomic sequences to understand the complexity and diversity of the protein kinase machinery. The overall goal of this project is to generate testable models of protein kinase evolution and regulation through quantitative and integrative analysis of protein kinase sequence, structure and functional data. Specific goals are to (i) quantify the sequence and structural similarities and differences between eukaryotic and distantly related eukaryotic-like kinases in prokaryotes, (ii) identify and experimentally characterize the evolutionary constraints acting on major protein kinase groups, in particular tyrosine kinases, which represent an important transition state in the evolution of the kinase domain, and (iii) provide conceptual representation of protein kinase sequence, structure and functional data in the form of an ontology. In order to accomplish these aims this project will use a novel evolutionary-systems approach in which mechanistic models of protein kinase regulation and evolution will be built and tested through quantitative and integrative analysis of sequence, structure and functional data. Accomplishing this project is expected to have a major impact by providing new testable hypotheses/models for experimental studies, a computational resource for large-scale integrative analysis of protein kinase data, and a conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of regulation in other signaling domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The major educational goal of this project is to help students develop an understanding of the importance of evolutionary and integrative approaches in biology. To accomplish this goal, the investigator will develop and assess new educational tools useful for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about data integration and data mining.  These tools will be piloted, assessed, revised and broadly disseminated to undergraduate educators through web-resources and publications. The investigator will provide research training for undergraduate and high school students through existing training programs at the University of Georgia, and incorporate under-represented minorities in educational and research activities by partnering with the NSF REU Fungal Genomics and Computational Biology program.  The educational activities of this project will promote inquiry-based learning at the high school and undergraduate level, and prepare the next generation of scientists for careers in integrative biology.</AbstractNarration>

Title: Unraveling the design principles of protein kinases using an evolutionary systems approach:  Intellectual Merit: The existence of life relies on the effective and faithful communication of signals from the environment to specific cells and organs in our body. In most organisms, cellular communication is mediated by a large and diverse family of protein kinases that function as molecular switches to turn "on" and "off" cellular signals at the right place and time. Although large scale genome sequencing studies have unveiled the protein kinase complement of the genomes (the kinomes) from diverse organisms, a fundamental understanding of how these proteins evolved to function as complex molecular switches was lacking. The CAREER proposal enabled the development of a pioneering new approach&mdash;the evolutionary systems approach&mdash;to unravel the design principles of the protein kinase machinery.  Understanding the design principle of these proteins in atomic detail is critical because it serves as a conceptual starting point for designing new signaling systems for applications in agriculture, biotechnology and biomedicine.  Through the application of evolutionary systems approach, this proposal delineated the sequence and structural features contributing to the unique modes of regulation in various kinases. Several important advances were made including the discovery of an ancient conformation "switch" in the active site of protein kinases and identifying a previously unappreciated role of hydrophobic core variations in tyrosine kinase evolution and functional specialization. The CAREER award resulted in fifteen peer reviewed publications, new software tools and resources for the signaling community, and several testable models of protein kinase evolution and regulation that were validated independently by multiple research groups.  Broader Impacts: Research and education was integrated by providing inter-disciplinary training for 3 post-docs (all three have secured positions in industry), 5 graduate students (2 graduated and secured research scientist positions), and 15 undergraduates (several are enrolled in PhD, MD-PhD programs), 2 REU students and 3 high-school students.
