<AbstractNarration>An Advanced Center for Laser Science and Spectroscopy (ACLaSS) is proposed.Three subprojects are included:&lt;br/&gt;1) Laser Spectroscopy and Materials Modeling, 2) Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Application, and 3) Laser Remote Sensing.&lt;br/&gt;Laser Spectroscopy and Materials Modeling of Plasmon-Coupled Optical Nanoparticles and Molecules for Photonic Applications: Primary research will be focused on investigating the spectroscopic analysis and electric field enhancement of plasmonic nanoparticles, and the optical properties of semiconductor quantum dots and Raman molecules with plasmonic coupling in the spectral region from visible to MIR for photonic applications including light amplifications, chemical molecular sensing, and nonlinear optical modulations.&lt;br/&gt;Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Application: Development of Low-Quantum Defect Gain Media for Eye-Safe Lasers: Development of new laser gain media continues to be an active area of research with a large range of potential applications for the civilian and military sectors. The proposed activities will be focused on developing new gain media with low-quantum defect operating in the eye-safe infrared spectral region of ~1.5-1.7 Ã¬m.&lt;br/&gt;Laser Remote Sensing: Atmospheric remote sensing has applications in weather forecasting, global climate change, and provides a better understanding of the troposphere. The proposed work will focus on expanding the capabilities of the current lidar systems to include new atmospheric retrievals and aerosol characterization.</AbstractNarration>

The goals of Advanced Center for Laser Science and Spectroscopy (ACLaSS)  were to 1) advance the research and education center with cutting-edge laser sciences and spectroscopy; 2) develop and implement graduate and undergraduate educational modules; 3) provide extensive research and educational opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, 4) strengthen the pipeline of students pursuing advanced degrees in science and technology through outreach activities and summer workshops, and 5) provide educational opportunities in laser science and spectroscopy to high school teachers and students in grades K-12. The ACLaSS included three subprojects of 1) Laser Spectroscopy and Materials Modeling, 2) Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Application, and 3) Laser Remote Sensing. Each subproject reported the scientific results, findings, and outreach activities that included the scientific merits and broader impacts. Scientific Merit: The research performed in Laser Spectroscopy and Materials Modeling project has provided the deep understanding on the plasmon-exciton coupling to develop hybrid white LEDs with greater visual wellness beyond the off-white emission from discrete spectral combinations. The selective contribution between the reduction of nonradiative decay rate due to the plasmon-exciton coupling and the local field enhancement greatly enhanced emission efficiency as well as the spectral quality for the hybrid white LEDs.  The research performed in the Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Application project has provided new insight and knowledge in the purification, synthesis, and crystal growth of rare earth activated lead halides for infrared applications (e.g. Pr doped KPb2Cl5 and KPb2Br5). The investigated halides were characterized by low maximum vibrational energies, which enabled efficient IR emission bands in the eye-safe spectral region covering ~1400-3000nm. This class of materials has also shown great promise for applications in scintillators, fluorescence cooling, and IR taggants.  The research performed in Laser Remote Sensing project has provided the important scientific information of atmospheric chemistry and physics, the biosphere, climate, and public health. The airborne solid and liquid particles in the nanometer to micrometer size range influence the energy balance of the Earth, the hydrological cycle, atmospheric circulation, and the abundance of greenhouse and reactive trace gases.
