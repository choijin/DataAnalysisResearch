<AbstractNarration>Observations of South Pacific Tropical Water (SPTW) have revealed variability on interannual time scales and a trend of increasing salinity over several decades.  SPTW identified by a shallow salinity maximum forms in the eastern South Pacific and is transported in the subtropical gyre and along the equator.  Variability of SPTW may affect the circulation and water properties in the equatorial region, in particular if the salinity and temperature anomalies are not density compensated.  SPTW has a significant interior equatorward pathway, and thus a relatively short (5-15 years) residence time and high formation rate.  As a consequence, the contribution of SPTW to the equatorial Pacific is expected to be faster and stronger than its North Pacific counterpart.  This project will initiate a more complete understanding of how the equatorial ocean is ventilated through the subduction of South Pacific waters and how variability in this ventilation contributes to climate variability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall research objectives of the project are:  to identify variability in SPTW, and to assess downstream impacts of this variability.  The relationship of SPTW variability to interannual and longer term atmospheric forcing will be investigated.  Depending on the extent and magnitude of the SPTW variability, it is hypothesized that there will be a dynamical signature in the downstream circulation and thermal structure of the tropical South Pacific.  The research includes the analysis of available Argo floating profiles and WOCE/CLIVAR tracer (salinity, potential vorticity, oxygen, CFC, SF6, tritium, helium-3, 14C, etc.) data, as well as results from the OGCM for the Earth Simulator (OFES), and simulated passive and adjoint tracers from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The project will utilize all available hydrographic (mainly Argo) and tracer observations to identify the variability of SPTW.  The combined use of observations with results from high-resolution GCMs will allow for a comprehensive, physically consistent interpretation of this variability and its downstream impacts on the tropical Pacific Ocean circulation and thermal structure.  In addition, the simulated passive tracer and its adjoint will provide unambiguous means to identify the SPTW pathways and in particular to assess the influence of meso-scale eddies and small scale processes.  The SPTW contributes to the Equatorial Undercurrent and water upwelled in the eastern equatorial Pacific, both having direct relevance to ENSO.  The derived assessment of the SPTW downstream impacts will enhance the understanding of ocean?s role in climate variability, and provide new information for the predictability and prediction of interannual and longer time scale variability such as ENSO and PDO in the Pacific.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The project will lead to improved skills for use with ENSO and climate prediction; advance science while promoting education by the training of a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student in the analysis of observational data and model outputs; enhance infrastructure for research and education by establishing collaborations between different disciplines and different institutions; and benefit the society by the use of existing observations and results from high-resolution GCMs to assess climate change.  One of the PIs participates in the program Mentoring Physical Oceanography Women to Increase Retention, and is on the implementation committee of an NSF Advance grant to the University of Miami.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The South Pacific Tropical Water (SPTW), identified as a shallow salinity maximum (&gt;36.2 psu) in the density range between 24.0 and 25.0 kg m-3, forms in the eastern subtropical South Pacific.  A significant portion of the SPTW enters the equatorial Pacific through the subtropical gyre and its interior and western boundary pathways, providing important water sources for the subtropical cell in the South Pacific, on which phenomena like El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) critically depend.    Large, spatially coherent sea surface salinity variability has been reported in the subtropical South Pacific. One striking feature of this variability is that sea surface salinity has increased during the past several decades. This variability may be conveyed into the thermocline and affect the Equatorial Undercurrent and the properties of water upwelled in the equatorial Pacific, thereby playing a potentially important role in modulating the climate system across the Indo-Pacific basin.   However, due to the lack of observations, the basin scale structure of the SPTW was not carefully examined and as a consequence a comprehensive description of this water mass was not available. The funding of NSF through grant OCE-1130050 has allowed the PIs to capture a number of new features of the SPTW.  Combining recently available satellite and in situ hydrographic and tracer data with results from high-resolution general circulation models, the PIs were able to investigate the formation, circulation, and variability of the SPTW, to examine the impacts of the SPTW on the equatorial Pacific, and to determine the processes that govern the SPTW spatial and temporal variability.      The findings of the project include: (1) there are subthermocline eddies generated in the western equatorial Pacific, propagating northward along the New Guinea coast; (2) the SPTW mean subduction rate is ~6.0 Sv, of which ~80% is due to vertical pumping and ~20% due to lateral induction; (3) the SPTW subduction rate varies from year to year, and this variability is closely related to ENSO; (4) the SPTW experienced a poleward shift during the past decade; (5) the sea surface height increase in the western South Pacific is largely due to thermal expansion, except in the deep ocean where haline contraction is of comparable strength; (6) a spin-up of South Pacific subtropical gyre took place during the Argo period, and the spin-down during 2002-04 reported by previous studies was merely an interannual perturbation; (7) a significant portion of the SPTW makes its way into the equatorial Pacific through its interior and western boundary pathways; (8) a large portion (up to 70%) of the SPTW that enters the equatorial Pacific resurfaces; (9) two sea surface salinity indices were introduced to identify event and type of El Nino; (10) sea surface salinity variability in the equatorial Pacific is closely related to the zonal displacement of the sea surface salinity front which in turn is linked to the resurfacing of the SPTW.  These findings have advanced our knowledge of the SPTW and its downstream impact. They help us understand the oceanÆs role in climate variability and likely result in improved skills for predictions of ENSO and PDO in the Asia-Pacific sector.  This project has also contributed to training two postdoctoral fellows in the analysis of observational data and model outputs, and to enhancing infrastructure for both research and education by establishing collaborations across different disciplines and different institutions.
