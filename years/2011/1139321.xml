<AbstractNarration>This project is directed at assessing the global impact of lightning-generated Very Low Frequency (VLF) waves on radiation belt electron loss, a process known as lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP). The project will address the following topics: (1) Quantify the connection between injection of energetic solar particles during geomagnetic storms, (2) Quantify the connections between lightning parameters and resulting LEP characteristics, and (3) Derive the total contribution of lightning to radiation belt energetic electron losses. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In order to quantify the role of lightning in energetic electron losses from the radiation belts, continuous and reliable global lightning geo-location data and a global network of observation sites to detect these precipitation events are needed. A new lightning geo-location network provides complete global coverage of lightning activity for the first time, and a global network of VLF receivers now operates, allowing monitoring of ionospheric disturbances associated with the electron precipitation. Finally, recent efforts have yielded two major breakthroughs in modeling the physical process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the training of a graduate student at Stanford University. The program will leverage, and consequently strengthen, an international network of VLF receivers that was set up under the auspices of the International Heliophysical Year (IHY). Under this program, Stanford University has placed ¡­25 receivers in developing countries, sponsoring and training local scientists to use the data.  Stanford has built significant infrastructure in support of this program and is continuing to hold a series of international workshops engaging scientists around the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This program sought to quantify the global loss rate of energetic radiation belt electrons due to resonant interactions with VLF emissions from lightning. Radiation from lightning in the 1-30 kHz range propagates in the magnetosphere as whistler-mode waves and causes pitch angle scattering of radiation belt electrons. The fraction of electrons that precipitate in the upper atmosphere has previously been estimated for individual lightning strokes, but has not been extrapolated to a global estimate. In this program radiation belt precipitation is measured by its effects in the D-region via subionospheric VLF remote sensing, through what are referred to as lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) events.  Our efforts were primarily in numeric modeling of LEP. First, a two-dimensional model of LEP was restructured to improve flexibility and correct for previous modeling errors. However, the two-dimensional model constrained wave propagation to a meridional plane. We relaxed this assumption and expanded the model to three dimensions, in order to examine longitudinal spreading of LEP.  While our work agrees with the two-dimensional model at noon and midnight, results of the 3-dimensional model indicate a significant (several degrees) longitudinal spreading of LEP at off-axis locations. This longitudinal drift / spreading implies that precipitation occurs with a longitudinal displacement relative to the lightning location. Methods to detect LEP events, and thus deter mine the local and global effects of LEP on the ionosphere and radiation belts, need to take this effect into account to accurately measure these events.  In developing the 3D model, we made several improvements to a 3-dimensional raytracing code, previously developed at Stanford. Accurate modeling of whistler wave propagation is essential in modeling LEP; this raytracer forms the backbone of the 3D model.  We constructed a global LEP model in order to quantify the total effect of precipitation on the ionosphere and radiation belts. The global model incorporates lightning location data from the GLD dataset, along with interpolated results of the simplified 2D model of LEP for computational efficiency. Results of this code will be published in a Ph.D thesis in June, 2017.  Currently in progress is a study of VLF wave power as generated by l ightning from the GLD dataset. Results of this study aim to estimate the relative contribution of lightining to the formation of plasmaspheric hiss.
