<AbstractNarration>The challenges of 21st century science and engineering demand the creation of effective and efficient distributed, multi-disciplinary, collaborative teams and virtual organizations.  This researcher will manage a workshop to develop a detailed picture of emerging results, critical research directions, and grand challenges for understanding the socio-technical processes that underpin virtual organizations.&lt;br/&gt;This program planning workshop will provide an opportunity to consolidate the new knowledge that has been emerged and identify new directions.  Focusing on research in areas covered by the NSF "Virtual Organizations as Sociotechnical Systems (VOSS)" program, it will explore emergent and potential productive research directions and syntheses at the intersection of recognized and projected VOSS research themes, and objectives. Specific directions that might be interesting but not yet topical or generally compelling will also be noted.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Virtual Organizations as Sociotechnical Systems (VOSS) is a critical emerging area of technical innovation. A program-planning workshop was conducted to combine knowledge developed under Virtual Organizations as Sociotechnical Systems (VOSS).  The goal of the workshop was to build new directions for understanding virtual organizations as social systems and to develop a detailed picture of emerging results, important research directions, and challenges facing virtual organizations. The activities under this workshop had the following general goals:  Find ways to extend current research in areas covered by VOSS and its communities to combine and support the goals and new possibilities of the VOSS program.   Develop standards for informing decisions about future directions in these areas.    Develop a set of specific new directions and critical issues for research in these areas that meet those standards.   Make recommendations to NSF for how best to focus new research efforts in VOSS areas.   This workshop filled an important need by examining and consolidating existing findings in VOSS research, and in bringing urgent, new research needs to light.  By bringing together scientific knowledge, the workshop helped to solidify the idea of virtual organizations as social and socio-technical systems. In addition, the workshop provided an important channel for creating insights. These insights will help individuals use this knowledge for the design and development of more effective VOs.  The broader impacts of this work include greater effectiveness, breadth of impact, and cross-community integration of the results of the VOSS program.  This will allow for more usable, manageable, societally-productive, cost-effective and efficient approaches for design and exploitation of virtual organizations.    Also, the workshop suggested ways to broaden the application and sociotechnical integration of novel information technology systems. This will provide more powerful and advanced capabilities for large-scale, distributed, and collaborative scientific projects and activities.
