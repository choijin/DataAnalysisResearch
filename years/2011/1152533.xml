<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is supporting the research of Professor Cynthia Burrows of the University of Utah.  Professor Burrows hypothesizes that simple chemical transformations of RNA bases could have been the key steps in creating redox active catalysts driving early chemical systems toward a primitive metabolism.  With prior NSF funding, her laboratory has shown that the oxidized base 8-oxoguanine serves as a photochemical catalyst to reductively reverse cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers to monomers.   In this reaction, 8-oxoguanine acts as a flavin mimic to facilitate excited state electron transfer.  Future work will explore 8-oxopurines and other redox active RNA purine and pyrimidine base derivatives for their ability to mediate oxidation and reduction reactions.  For example, key reactions of early Earth must have included the ability to interconvert alcohols and aldehydes or ketones (e.g. lactate/pyruvate) using redox cofactors analogous to NADH and FADH2.  Reactions such as these will be studied in RNA world-like conditions in order to test the hypothesis that simpler versions of these RNA-based cofactors could have presaged modern-day metabolism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are demonstrated in the unusual link between DNA damage and repair chemistry pertinent to cancer and the chemistry of primordial Earth.  Photoinduced electron transfer appears to play a role in both realms, and insights from this work could be broadly applicable to other disciplines.   Students trained on the project will be involved in interdisciplinary sciences including aspects of synthetic and physical organic, analytical and biochemistry.  Professor Burrows has demonstrated continuing leadership in broadening participation, including programs that advance the careers of women scientists, and will continue to be active in dissemination of research to public audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research conducted in this study was aimed at understanding the interaction of the genetic molecule DNA with light.  While ultraviolet light is generally considered deleterious to DNA through the formation of thymine dimers, we hypothesized that certain modified components of DNA, namely bases like guanine (G) that had undergone free radical oxidation, could be beneficial and actually lead to the repair of photo-induced damage to DNA.  We noted that vitamin B2, riboflavin, is structurally similar to the base guanine, and shares chemical properties in common with the oxidized base 8-oxoguanine (OG). Indeed, using a wavelength of light longer than that originally used to inflict damage on DNA (in the form of thymine dimers, a molecular promoter of skin cancer) led to electron transfer between OG and a thymine dimer such that the dimer reverted back to the original form of DNA.  The broader impact of these studies is that we have a deeper picture of how light can cause both damage and repair to the bases of DNA.  Additionally, we see that a simple change in a DNA or RNA base gives it properties similar to ribonucleotide vitamin.  Several of the vitamins like riboflavin are small dinucleotide components based on RNA that are thought to be "fossils of the RNA World," i.e. remnants of an earlier pre-biotic life in which these small heterocycles were responsible for both the genetics and catalytic functions leading to simple organisms.  Thus, these studies provide insight into the molecular basis for the emergence of life.  The research was conducted principally by graduate students who are now trained in DNA and RNA chemistry techniques, how to evaluate data, how to prepare scientific reports, and how to present their work to a critical audience.  These students have gone on to jobs in both education and biotech industries.  The PI presents lectures on this work in many contexts including to the public as part of her role as co-director of the Curie Club, engaging women students and faculty in science, at the University of Utah.
