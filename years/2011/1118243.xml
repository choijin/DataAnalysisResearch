<AbstractNarration>The Cerro Chajnantor Atacama Telescope (CCAT) is planned as a 25-meter telescope operating at millimeter to short sub-millimeter wavelengths and located in northern Chile close to the site of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). At an elevation of 18,500 feet the telescope would take advantage of the exceptionally dry air for high frequency observations. Instrumentation containing advanced detector arrays would exploit the telescope's large field of view for surveying wide areas of sky to detect an abundance of high redshift galaxies, to image nearby galaxies and molecular clouds and to discover and study Solar System bodies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CCAT was called out in the National Academies? Astro2010 Decadal Survey as the highest priority medium-scale project for the decade. CCAT would be a public-private partnership with significant institutional and private investments from Cornell University, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Colorado, a consortium of Canadian universities, the German universities of Bonn and Cologne and potentially other domestic and foreign partners. Astro2010 estimated the total construction cost of CCAT to be $140 million ($37 million as the Federal investment) and annual operating costs of $11 million ($7.5 million Federal). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has developed a conceptual design for CCAT using institutional and private funds. Funding through this award advances the design and development of the telescope and its enclosure to the level of construction readiness. The CCAT partners intend to provide ongoing institutional contributions to move all other elements of the project to a comparable level of design maturity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CCAT is a project to design, construct and operate a 25-meter diameter, sub-millimeter (submm) telescope at an elevation of 5,600 meters in the high Atacama Desert of northern Chile.   CCAT originated with a 2006 agreement between Cornell University and Caltech; it grew to include the University of Colorado, Associated Universities, Inc., a consortium of eight Canadian universities led by U. of Waterloo and U. of British Columbia, and the German universities of Bonn and Cologne (collectively called the CCAT Partnership).  Collaboration with the U. of Chile and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile were also cultivated, as were relationships with several world-class commercial design, engineering and construction companies.  Astro2010, the Decadal Survey Committee of the National Academy of Sciences, strongly endorsed CCAT, calling it out as the only medium-sized, ground-based project, "because it is ranked most highly".  Astro2010 went on to state, "With a broad scientific agenda, CCAT will enable studies of the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time, the formation of clusters of galaxies, the formation of stars in the Milky Way, the formation and the evolution of planets and the nature of objects in the Solar System"1. The outstanding capabilities of this facility will be its sensitivity at submm wavelengths, its wide field of view - capable of accommodating mega pixel detector arrays - and its consequent mapping speed.  With these characteristics, CCAT "would excel as a sensitive survey facility" and will be "an essential complement to ALMA"1.  The main purpose of this NSF award was to accomplish the engineering design phase (EDP) for the 25 meter-class telescope capable of achieving CCAT's stated science goals.  The end state of EDP was to establish a detailed design for the telescope and key supporting infrastructure, mitigate outstanding technology risks, and refine the cost of the project to ensure it was both feasible and achievable.  This work involved not only telescope design, but also instrument and supporting infrastructure development, as well as negotiating a land concession with the Republic of Chile for a location in the high Andes mountains that would allow CCAT to maximize the scientific utility of its state-of-the-art hardware.   CCAT's science goals required a telescope design with a surface accuracy far better than the natural limits predicted by Sebastian von Hoerner in his 1966 paper, "Design of Large Steerable Antennas."  As such, new materials and novel techniques had to be investigated in order to develop a design capable of achieving these ambitious goals.  These included contracts to investigate high-performance actuators to facilitate an active main-reflector dish surface, state-of-the-art carbon fiber work and adhesives to build prototype surface panels and back-up structure elements, development of a complex space frame geometry, the design of a custom enclosure system as well as other elements that could be installed and work reliably at the extreme altitude of 5,600 meters above sea level (ASL).  Because the observatory was to be located at the extreme altitude of 5,600 meters ASL and that no telescope this size had been attempted in such an extreme climate, new installation and safety techniques had to be formulated so that the developing design could be safely assembled and commissioned.   Further, work on multiple instruments for the telescope (i.e., short and long wavelength cameras, a heterodyne receiver, and a multi-object spectrometer) were also initiated under this award.  These prototype concepts were each custom, state-of-the-art designs.  Finally, a land concession had to be negotiated with the Republic of Chile in order to gain access to a suitable astronomical site.  EDP successfully concluded in March 2016 with all key goals essentially achieved.  Although roughly 80-85% of the overall funding required to construct the CCAT telescope and supporting infrastructure had been...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
