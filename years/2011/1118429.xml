<AbstractNarration>A large number of Atlantic tropical cyclones, especially the most dangerous hurricanes, develop from easterly waves over the Atlantic Main Development Region (MDR: 10-20N, 20-80W), along the northern edge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The close proximity between the ITCZ axis and the wave track allows ITCZ-wave interaction on different time scales. This project aims to study the interaction between the ITCZ and easterly waves over the Atlantic and the impacts of their interaction on subsequent storm development. In particular, easterly waves will be examined as a "connecting link" between the large-scale circulation and tropical cyclone formation. The statistical aspects of the link are relatively well-known, but the dynamical and thermodynamical mechanisms are not. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of observational analysis and numerical modeling that focus on a set of testable hypotheses on ITCZ-wave interaction and tropical cyclone formation. The investigators will use insights from their recently developed marsupial framework to examine how the variability of the Atlantic ITCZ affects tropical cyclogenesis in the Atlantic MDR by altering the existence and morphology of the wave "pouch". The emphases are on the structure and evolution of the wave pouch, and ITCZ-wave interaction in a multi-scale framework. The wave pouch is a region of approximately closed Lagrangian circulation within the wave's critical layer and is shown by our previous studies to be a necessary condition for storm formation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work are in advancing our understanding of the impacts of the large-scale circulation on tropical cyclone formation and variability, which can ultimately contribute to improved tropical cyclone forecasts and to studying tropical cyclone activity in a changing climate. The proposal will train and support one graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

The proposal supported a MS student and a PhD Student. The proposed research directly contributed to the studentsÃ† professional training and development.  Outcomes: 1) A unified framework to understand the interannual variability of Atlantic tropical cyclones  Tropical cyclone activity is subject to strong year-to-year variability. In an active year, more than 30 tropical cyclones can form over the Atlantic (e.g., 2005); in an inactive year the number of tropical cyclones may drop to five or six (e.g., 1983).

This finding also helps to better understand how climate change will impact tropical cyclones, as the variability of the Hadley circulation in a warmer climate will provide insight into changes of tropical cyclone activity.  2)    Merger of African easterly waves and genesis of Cape Verde storms There are two easterly wave tracks over West Africa, one to the south and the other to the north of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ). The waves south of the jet peak at the jet level 3-4 km above the ground and are often associated with squall lines and precipitation. The northern disturbances are primarily confined to 850 hPa (1.5 km above the ground) and below. Located north of the jet, they are much drier and are often associated with dust outbreaks. A northern wave sometimes merges with a southern wave near the coast of West Africa. It was found that the merger leads to a stronger and deeper wave structure and the formation of a Cape Verde storm near the coast (see Fig. 2). The dryness of the northern disturbances does not hinder the storm development as the dry northern wave is typically moistened quickly over the ocean during the merger process. It was also found that merger developers are associated with ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
