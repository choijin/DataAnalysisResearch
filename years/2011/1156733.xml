<AbstractNarration>This NSF REU project will provide research opportunities for 8 talented undergraduate students to spend 8 weeks working with four faculty mentors at Georgia State University, an outside faculty mentor from Georgia Tech, two industrial mentors from McAfee and Barracuda Networks, and graduate students. The teams will conduct hands-on research projects in high performance data-mining for bioinformatics and network security. The students will work on research projects to master professional research skills and submit research papers for real publications. Summer activities will include participation in student data mining competitions such as the Data Mining Cup and the UC San Diego Data Mining Contest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project recruit students from small colleges with limited research resources. The project will include a web-based student data mining club (a global student data mining e-community) that can be used by not only the REU students but also other students interested in high performance data mining research and its applications. Opportunities to explore broad future career opportunities will be provided by the student's research and access to graduate students, scientists, engineers, and faculty members. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The 8-week summer program for three years had 30 REU students whose research projects focused on high performance data mining techniques and their applications in bioinformatics and security. Most REU students are underrepresented students (especially minority and women) from small colleges with limited research resources. They published 6 peer-reviewed publications. Many REU students applied for graduate schools. Several REU students were admitted to graduate schools. Especially, two REU students already got M.S. degrees. Most REU students planned to go to graduate schools. Four faculty mentors at GSU, one external faculty mentor at Georgia Tech, two industrial mentors and 17 PhD student mentors advised 30 REU students with financial support to do 27 research projects in high performance big data mining using machine learning algorithms, GPU computing and cloud computing for applications in bioinformatics and security. REU students visited the Communications Assurance and Performance Group at Georgia Tech to learn latest network security techniques. All REU students attended the annual GSU Molecular Basis of Disease (MBD) Research Day related to data mining and bioinformatics at GSU student center. In addition, three undergraduate students without financial support also participated in partial REU summer research activities. REU students also attended social activities.

General research methodologies and tips were introduced to all REU students. How to write a high quality professional paper with IEEE format was also explained for all REU students. Lectures on how to apply for graduate school were given for all REU students to make them understand application tips and various chances for graduate student fellowships. REU students participated in brainstorming activities to improve their research skills. Software systems related to data mining and machine learning were introduced for all REU students by Ph.D. student mentors. Each REU student gave a 20-munite final presentation like a real international conference presentation that clearly described the research project (other researchers' work, new contributions, results, conclusions and future work), and answered different questions.
