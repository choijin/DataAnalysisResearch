<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Profs. Stefan Franzen and Jon-Paul Maria of North Carolina State University and Karl Booksh of the University of Delaware are investigating the structure/property relationships that regulate surface chemical interactions, and the mid-infrared optical properties of electrically conducting oxides, metallic nanoparticles, and their hybrid combinations. Specifically, the multidisciplinary team is studying surface plasmon oscillations in the mid-infrared, and how those oscillations can be tuned by modulating the nanostructure of conducting oxides. Effects on tunability of these optical phenomena by incorporation of metallic nanoparticles are also under investigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work seeks new understanding of how light interacts with solid surfaces.  It will provide new opportunities to probe the attachment of macromolecules and biomolecules on robust oxide surfaces, enabling novel mechanisms for surface characterization and sensing.  It also provides opportunities for graduate students (particularly those from underrepresented groups) to collaborate with researchers in Poland and China through the PIs' well-established international exchange programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project explored the theory and practice of using thin films of metal oxide materials that can absorb infrared light under specific conditions. The light path used in research measurements is shown in the first figure (Thin film and optical path geometry). The specific absorption that was studied, called a surface plasmon resonance, is a property of all conductors. Infrared light is of particular interest in this regard because it is the spectral region of interest for technologies such as night vision, heat capture from buildings and detection of pathogens. The specific goal was to develop a material that had a resonant property in the infrared range.</p> <p>This is a new area of research, but one that has a basis in our experience with similar materials that absorb light in other regions. Using our experience we predicted the cadmium oxide would be a good material to observe the effect. As is often the case in thin film technology it was necessary to dope the film with a small amount of another metal in order to increase its conductivity. After study of the cadmium oxide (CdO) structure we settled on dysprosium, Dy (a heavy metal known as a lanthanide) as the dopant. Doping at every low levels &lt;&lt; 1% gave excellent results. These are shown in the figure entitled Reflectance Map. The comparison with aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO) shows that CdO:Dy has much narrower absorption features (in black). However, the technology to make the thin films and to accurately dope the films was quite challenging. A great deal of effort was expended to make this type of thin film production a routine method in the laboratory. We developed methods to detect the effect as well. We compared three different kinds of instrumentation for research purposes and successfully demonstrated the effect using all three instruments. The use of an infrared ellipsometer with a specially designed sample holder gave the best results. An ellipsometer is a device that uses polarized light to study thin films. The sample holder permits the user to study a thin film on a slide pressed against a prism, which is shown in the second figure (Top and side view of the sample holder).</p> <p>We have studied the modification of the films using thin molecular layers. This aspect of the project was challenging. One goal of this work is to study the binding of biological molecules. Since cadmium oxide dissolves in water we needed to study various methods to protect the thin film. We used atomic layer deposition of silicon oxide, but this is very expensive and slow because of the high demand for the technique.&nbsp; Other methods for protecting the thin film were not as effective. We were able to deposit layers in non-aqueous solvents and to study the effects of binding of these layers on the resonant frequency of the absorption of the thin film. This type of effect is used to detect binding interactions in commercial devices that use gold thin films. One goal of the new technology is to extend the spectral range of this type of detection to the infrared. A second goal is to extend the set of materials that can be used to detect the effect since it would be desirable to use solid state architectures for this type of detection. These are challenging, but promising outcomes of the research.</p> <p>As part of this project we have implemented an outreach event that we will implement as an annual workshop on various aspects of the interaction of light and matter.
