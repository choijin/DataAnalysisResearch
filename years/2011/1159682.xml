<AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices Program (EPMD) in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) and the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The research objective of this project aims to develop a better understanding of the fundamental materials properties of the band offsets and interfaces between dielectrics and semiconductors. It covers investigation of the band offsets for different dielectrics (SiNX, Sc2O3 and (CeTb)MgAl11O19) on crystalline ZnO, CdZnO, ZnMgO and also for the latter two on a-IGZO and measurement of interface state densities and thermal stability of all these dielectrics on a-IGZO. Optical and electrical techniques are used to characterize the band offsets, bandgaps and interface state densities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: Crystalline and amorphous electronic oxides are gaining interest for gas and chemical sensing, ultra violet light-emitting diodes for solid state lighting, flat-panel, flexible and touch-screen displays and solar cells. The importance of transparent conducting oxides in these products has led to a surge of research in recent years to discover new materials, lower the costs of manufacture and improve properties. Oxide-based thin film transistors have great potential for realizing a roll-to-roll display. If this can be realized, it may also create new applications in heads-up displays, windshields, electronic books or light weight computers and eventually change the entire display industry.  This project is designed to develop a new class of solid-state materials that can be made at low temperatures, allowing their use on cheap substrates like paper and plastic.   In addition, cross-disciplinary education activities introduce the public to these exotic and enabling materials. The PI engages in undergraduate and graduate mentoring, K-12 outreach, conference symposia organization, and writing a textbook.</AbstractNarration>
