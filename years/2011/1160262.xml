<AbstractNarration>1160262/ Revzin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to develop biosensors based on nucleic acids called aptamers.  Aptamer based biosensors are emerging as viable alternative to traditional sensors that employ antibodies for recognition of target molecules.  Aptamer based biosensors are more chemically and thermally stable and may be reagentless - that is no additional processing steps are needed to generate a signal in response to target molecules. Our proposal seeks to addresses a distinct challenge in regenerating these biosensors in order to make the same sensor available for continuous in-line monitoring.  We propose to use applied voltage to tune and control affinity of sensing electrodes in temporal and/or spatial manner to ensure that some electrodes are detecting association while others are monitoring dissociation events.  This way up and down changes in the level of target molecules may be monitored.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The goal of our proposal will be to develop novel, aptamer-based microsystems for analysis and sorting of cells.  It is our belief that such aptasensors are particularly advantageous for monitoring dynamic changes in the levels of proteins secreted by living cells and have numerous applications in biotechnology, cell/tissue engineering and infectious disease detection.  In addition to biosensing, aptamer-modified surfaces may be used for affinity separation of cells from heterogeneous samples such as blood.  This proposal will combine aspects of basic science with bioengineering to further enhance state of the art in cell analysis and manipulation by developing tunable aptamer-coated devices.  We will actively recruit graduate, undergraduate and high school students to participate in the proposed experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biosensors are tools that allow to convert biologicalevents or molecules into recordable and measurable signals.  Biosensors have become common place in our lives glucose meters, pregnancy strips, oxygen sensors are all examples of biosensors.  Our project was focused on addressing an important issue in biosensor utilization, what happens when biosensor became saturated with the analyte being detected?  At the present biosensors are designed with the goal of detecting the smallest amount of target molecule, which means that biosensors avidly bind these target molecules.  We wanted to come up with new ways to regenerate the biosensors such that bound target molecules could be removed and the biosensor could be reused.  We developed such strategies employing microfluidic devices to deliver reagents suitable for refreshing the surface of the biosensor.  We also focused on using electrical field to control binding and dissociation of target analytes on the biosensor surface.  The microfluidic devices with integrated electrodes allowed us to operate with very small volumes and also allowed us to control delivery of liquids to the electrode surface.  This way we could delivery solution containing analyte, allow for binding to happen, record the signal and then flush the surface with regeneration buffer.   Overall, our project produced novel strategies to extend the lifetime of biosensors.       Last Modified: 07/15/2015       Submitted by: Alexander Revzin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
