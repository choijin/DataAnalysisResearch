<AbstractNarration>The Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation project combines the efforts of an alliance of&lt;br/&gt;30 colleges and universities, 7 professional organizations, 2 government laboratories, 4 educational&lt;br/&gt;organizations, 12 corporations, 147 academic and support programs, 500 resource individuals,&lt;br/&gt;approximately 85% of whom are scientists, engineers, and other faculty, and 15% administrators.  The new project is a comprehensive, concerted, sequenced effort that uses NSF funding for historically underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate student activities, including the transition of college sophomores, juniors, and seniors toward graduate school and the development of&lt;br/&gt;high technology products with application or dissemination both regionally and nationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the NSF-funded Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) and the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program the alliance will continue the seamless transition and student support from STEM undergraduate to STEM graduate studies through the successful multidisciplinary faculty&lt;br/&gt;mentoring network to transition these students to doctoral completion and into faculty ranks, as well as other sectors in the Nation's STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the multiple prior successes in doubling the number of historically underepresented minorities in STEM majors and being on pace for a similar doubling goal for this population of students by 2016, the recruitment and retention activities will result in the alliance becoming a national model for strengthening and diversifying the Nation's STEM workforce to meet 21st century innovation needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Summary of Results   Intellectual Merit: We have drawn upon and expanded our alliance?s large existing communities of Underrepresented Minority (URM) Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) scholar/researcher/teacher/ mentors and student apprentice scholar/researcher/teacher/prot&eacute;g&eacute;s working collaboratively to further structure and sustain a research-based "hot house" environment to create wide-spread regional systemic change with dramatically positive national implications and repercussions. We had 2,092 student participations in the first five years with many of them involved in very intensive activities. This has more than doubled our baseline participations of 954, and has successfully "primed the pump" in terms of increasing retention and boosting graduation rates. Findings from the external evaluation indicate that building a sense of community with students, peers, and faculty along with hands&shy;-on cutting edge research experiences are an important combination to maintain interest in our target URM population and to foster continuing professional and academic development. A focus group of faculty referred to WAESO LSAMP students as "investable".   Broader Impacts: We have been building toward achieving and sustaining a level of admission, development, graduation, placement, promotion, and tenure of baccalaureate, masters, doctoral, post-doctoral, junior faculty, and senior faculty underrepresented STEM scholars in proportion to the diversity of our society as a whole. We have strong reason to believe that our WAESO LSAMP alliance is a national model for the strengthening and diversification of STEM students and faculty to ensure that the U.S. will continue to lead the world in research and technology despite the increasingly intense global competition of the 21st century.   1. We achieved a 125% increase in B.S. Degrees to URMs (2,666 B.S. degrees to underrepresented minorities in 2015-2016 from our baseline year of B.S. STEM undergraduate degrees of 1,185 awarded yearly in our focused senior alliance).  2. We achieved a 124% increase in Master's Degrees to URMs (365 Master's degrees to underrepresented minorities in 2015-2016 from our baseline year of Master's STEM undergraduate degrees of 163 awarded yearly in our focused senior alliance).  3. We have developed a model for community college involvement that has begun to build an increase in student transition to 4-year colleges and universities.  Our external evaluators report that faculty meet very frequently with their WAESO students, many research labs have students participating as co&shy;-mentors, and the environment for our students is more akin to a family structure and contrast markedly with student experiences in the rest of the institutions. We believe that this model is likely to be portable nationwide not only to STEM but also to non&shy;-STEM disciplines.  External Evaluation Highlights:   In general, student participants and faculty mentors have a high level of satisfaction with the WAESO-LSAMP program. Student participants are exposed to high level, hands on research that prepares them for the rigors of graduate school. Beyond exposure to high-level research, students engage in a number of professional activities that increase their self-confidence, academic accomplishments and influence their professional paths including conference travel and presentation and the opportunity to co-author academic papers. The sense of community provided through WAESO-LSAMP funded experiences has a significant impact on students. WAESO-LSAMP support helps faculty in their efforts to diversify their labs and even influences some of their views on working with minority students. Faculty driven recruitment models have an interesting impact on both faculty and students, but come with challenges. Faculty shared a number of insights on recruiting and working with underrepresented minority students into STEM environments including the importance of listening to students to understand their cultural backgrounds and giving students the opportunity to work on challenging research problems. Students noted a number of factors that attracted them into STEM environments including hands on research, altruistic projects, supportive mentors and diverse work environments Students and faculty mentors noted that WAESO-LSAMP supported environments are fundamentally different than experiences students receive in a traditional academic environment. WAESO-LSAMP environments were described as realistic where students are given the opportunity to engage in research and learn from mistakes while classrooms were described as a place to learn general knowledge in a formulaic manner.  Evidence suggests that the WAESO-LSAMP program utilizes a cutting edge model of diversity in higher education and is reflective of a Multicontext model of diversity rather than an assimilationist model of student development.   A Model for Future Success! As one of the first six "charter" alliances funded by the LSAMP program, WAESO has been not only successful but also a pathbreaker for others since its initial planning grant. WAESO has been vision-driven, fully engaged in the support of the development of URM STEM students, preparing and motivating faculty at WAESO participating colleges and universities to engage in active mentoring, creating institutional inclusiveness for both student and faculty, providing faculty leadership, and ever increasing both quality and diversity.
