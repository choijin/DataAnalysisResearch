<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project, in collaboration with General Motors (GM) R&amp;D Center, will develop a novel system of experimentally validated, physics-based multi-level computational models for simulating multi-scale deformation and predicting ductile failure in Magnesium alloys. Simulations will focus on high strain rate impact loading and forming processes. The multi-scale model will develop modules at three relevant scales, viz. (i) macroscopic scale of structural components, (ii) microscopic scale of individual grains and polycrystalline aggregates, and (iii) atomic scales of crystal lattices for postulating crack evolution. Both homogenization and localization strategies will be incorporated in a hierarchical-concurrent framework. Specific developmental modules include: (i) image-based three-dimensional microstructure generation of polycrystalline aggregates, (ii) image-based crystal-plasticity FEM modeling of microstructural deformation and failure, (iii) homogenized continuum plasticity-damage laws for incorporation in macroscopic models, and (iv) macroscopic simulations. GM will be responsible for experiments at different scales to validate and calibrate the computational models. The program will provide an unprecedented understanding of the role of microstructure on deformation and failure characteristics in Magnesium alloys. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnesium alloys have a huge potential for enhancing fuel efficiency and energy economization in the automotive industry, which will be facilitated. The program will aid the materials industry, where materials development is stymied by not knowing how variabilities at different scales affect performance and processing. Graduate students will have a strong interaction with eminent industrial researchers. The program will educate next generation of engineers on the challenges of emerging technologies, with a unique academia-industry perspective.</AbstractNarration>

However, a complicating phenomenon of magnesium and its alloys is their <em>deformation induced anomalous mechanical behavior</em>. This complex plastic behavior is caused by a strong basal texture that is responsible for significant deformation twinning in their polycrystalline microstructure. Operable twinning modes in the microstructure have significant effect on the formability and ductile failure of magnesium alloys. Grains, unfavorably oriented for dislocation glide, develop high constraint stresses as precursors to fracture. As a consequence, magnesium alloys undergo only low to moderate plastic deformation before fracture in comparison with aluminum or steel. Complexities of deformation, compounded by the lack of fundamental understanding on interacting deformation and failure behavior of magnesium alloys, have impeded their design and accelerated insertion into industrial practice. Most computational models today, lack proper microstructural effects and do not incorporate underlying physical mechanisms.

This is a considerable departure from conventional volumetric approaches that cannot precisely capture the nature of localized failure characteristics preceding failure in these materials. An advanced, image-based crystal plasticity FE (CPFE) model, has been developed for predicting discrete twin formation and associated heterogeneous deformation in polycrystalline microstructures of Mg and its alloys. The model combines advanced methods of computational mechanics and computational material science to achieve this goal. A subcycling algorithm that invokes multi-time scales is developed for accelerating CPFE simulations. This increases the accuracy of CPFE simulations, while significantly enhancing efficiency. CPFE simulations of high purity Mg microstructures predicts the experimentally observed sigmoidal shape of the stress-strain curve and the tension-compression asymmetric response. Heterogeneous twin formation with strain localization are predicted in the polycrystalline microstructures and stress concentrations are observed at certain locations of twin-grain boundary intersections.
