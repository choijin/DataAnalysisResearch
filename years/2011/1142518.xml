<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to establish an ice shelf network of 18 broadband seismographs deployed for two years to obtain high-resolution, mantle-scale images of Earth structure underlying the Ross Sea Embayment. Prior marine geophysical work provides good crustal velocity models for the region seaward of the ice shelf but mantle structure is constrained by only low-resolution images due to the lack of prior seismic deployments. The proposed stations would be established between Ross Island and Marie Byrd Land. These stations would fill a major geological gap within this extensional continental province and would link data sets collected in the Transantarctic Mountain transition/Plateau region (TAMSEIS) and in West Antarctica (POLENET) to improve resolution of mantle features beneath Antarctica. The proposed deployment would allow the PIs to collect seismic data without the expense, logistical complexity, and iceberg hazards associated with ocean bottom seismograph deployments. Tomographic models developed from the proposed data will be used to choose between competing models for the dynamics of the Ross Sea. In particular, the PIs will investigate whether a broad region of hot mantle, including the Eastern Ross Sea, indicates distributed recent tectonic activity, which would call into question models proposing that Eastern Ross extension ceased during the Mesozoic. These data will also allow the PIs to investigate the deeper earth structure to evaluate the possible role of mantle plumes and/or small-scale convection in driving regional volcanism and tectonism across the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from this deployment will be of broad interdisciplinary use. This project will support three graduate and two undergraduate students. At least one student will be an underrepresented minority student. The PIs will interact with the media and include K-12 educators in their fieldwork.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project deployed 18 autonomous broadband seismographs on the Ross Ice Shelf and surrounding regions to study both the Earth structure beneath the region and the deformation of the ice shelf itself.    New earth models developed from the new dataset show that the western and southern margins of the Ross Sea are characterized by very thin crust and low upper mantle seismic velocity, indicating warm upper mantle temperatures.  These features were likely produced by Terror Rift extension in the past 10 million years.   In contrast, the eastern margin of the Ross Sea (the Siple Coast) shows thicker crust and faster upper mantle velocities.   The faster velocities indicate the development of thicker lithosphere due to cooling since the much older extension in this region.   Another aspect of this project was studying the deformation of the ice shelf using ice quakes.   During the two year period of the deployment (2014-2016), the instruments detected nearly 6,000 ice quakes along a 120-km-long rift (crack) in the ice shelf. We compared the timing of the ice quakes to air temperature data, ocean wave activity, and tides to see whether these factors influenced the crack's behavior. We found that fracture occurs most frequently just after high tide during winter and when the air is very cold. We also found that fracture at the rift is not triggered by ocean waves, but is correlated with ocean tides, which significantly change the stresses on the ice shelf.  This work demonstrates that Antarctic ice shelves are subject to strong environmental forcing, and that deformation in reponse to this forcing is concentrated along rift zones.   This work was carried out by Washington University undergrad student Seth Olinger as his honors thesis research.
