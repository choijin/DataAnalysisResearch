<AbstractNarration>Traditionally, bacteria have been thought of as simple "bags of enzymes" with no significant internal structure. However, some bacteria contain a set of proteins that come together to form compartments, termed bacterial microcompartments, that are much like the organelles in more complex organisms. With this project, researchers will use one such microcompartment to create a separate, customized environment in the bacterial cell "much like a reactor in a factory" for the production of useful chemicals.  Challenges that will be addressed by this research include determining what proteins are required to form the microcompartments, and how best to sequester reactions and chemicals within the resulting structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic biology is a growing field with great potential for the development of biologically-based manufacturing. This synthetic biology research project will directly impact society by enabling eco-friendly methods for the production of useful chemicals that are currently derived from petroleum or via reactions with potentially harmful chemicals. Graduate students on the project will be trained in the field of synthetic biology, and results of the research will be presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. Furthermore, the investigator and a team of student volunteers will communicate the potential and challenges of synthetic biology research to public audiences of all ages and backgrounds at the Bay Area Science Festival, Science Caf√©s, and service organization meetings. An annual workshop will also be organized to educate the volunteer students on how to describe their research to non-scientists in a clear manner a valuable skill often lacking even in students at the graduate level. The goal of these outreach efforts is to raise the science literacy of the general public at all age levels.</AbstractNarration>
