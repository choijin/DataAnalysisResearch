<AbstractNarration>0807731 &lt;br/&gt;Gruner&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award from the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry supports Cornell University to perform accelerator and x-ray technology research and development (R&amp;D) to advance in a non-site specific way preparation for construction of an ultrahigh spectral brightness, hard x-ray coherent light sources (CLS), such as Energy Recovery Linacs and X-ray Free Electron Lasers. The high coherence and temporal properties of a CLS would transform the sciences and engineering and would enable numerous experiments that are not feasible using existing x-ray sources. Enabled capabilities would include studies on ultrafast chemical reactions, holographic imaging of materials and biological structures, new ways to determine the structure of proteins, properties of matter under extremely high pressures, and properties of glasses, disordered, and polycrystalline materials. Continued R&amp;D is needed on the electron beam and x-ray technologies required to realize a CLS. Cornell proposes to utilize apparatus assembled under previous NSF awards to perform R&amp;D based on the Energy Recovery Linac Technology, with specific emphasis on the requisite (1) superconducting electron accelerators, (2) electron sources, (3) electron beam physics and diagnostics, (4) electron beam dynamics, and (5) x-ray beamline components capable of handling CLS x-ray beams. The R&amp;D will involve collaborations with other laboratories, both in the U.S. and abroad. Training the technical work force will be a major product of the work. This training is made more important by intense world-wide demand for accelerator physicists and beamline scientists familiar with the apparatus and challenges of new high brightness synchrotron beams. The work includes an effective, diversity-based, broad outreach program to the K-12 and undergraduate communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of this NSF-funded project and is in addition to the final project report.  Accelerated particle beams have a wide range of applications from the basic sciences to the production of computer chips with yet higher information density and to truck- or ship-penetrating investigation systems for border security. Nuclear physics and elementary particle physics has relied on accelerators for decades and many Nobel prizes have only become possible with these instruments. X-ray science uses focused x-rays, usually from accelerators, to investigate materials, from hair fractures in airplane wings to the atomic structure of viruses, of proteins, or of pharmaceuticals.   This grant developed components of and strategies for a new kind of accelerator, the Energy-Recovery Linac, which produces x-ray beams with revolutionary brightness. Their x-ray beam would be so narrow that it behaves more like a laser than a light bulb, revolutionizing the kind of materials that can be analyzed: individual biological cells, individual portions, and even individual atoms embedded in matter.   Accelerators with the largest current of particles are circular, storing particles for millions of turns. It is very efficient that each particle traverses an application millons of times, but these accelerators have the drawback that the many turns make the beam-sizes relatively large, and they only allow applications that hardly disturb the beam, lest it be destroyed in millions of disturbances. Accelerators without these drawbacks are linear, accelerating narrow beam straight onto an application, where the beam can interact strongly before it is stopped. Alas, these accelerators can only have very little current, because each particle is used only once.  This grant focused on a new kind of accelerator, the Energy-Recovery Linac, which has the advantages of both, circular and linear accelerators and the drawbacks of neither.   This accelerator produces the narrow high-quality beam of a linear accelerator with the high current and efficiency of a circular accelerator, allowing applications that strongly interact with the beam. Particle beams are accelerated in a linac and are therefore narrow and can interact strongly with an application, but their energy is recaptured by deceleration before they are stopped. Each particle is used only once, but its energy is recaptured and used to accelerate new beam, leading to high efficiencies and high currents.  In a preceding grant, (Phase 1A: Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) Technology R&amp;D), equipment needed for an Energy-Recover Linac was developed, in this grant we commissioned and operated it, pushing many parameters to world-record levels and showing that the beam parameters needed for a hard X-ray ERL can indeed be produced. Major achievements are the worldÆs largest current from a photo-emitter electron gun, the largest brightness electron beam, and the lowest energy loss of an accelerator cavity in a linear accelerator. Six of such cavities were combined into a 10m long linear accelerator optimized for ERL operation. All major components are now ready to build this new kind of accelerator to revolutionize x-ray science and other applications.  These world records have been recognized by other laboratories and we have obtained funding by LCLS-II at SLAC to use our ERL equipment in research for this x-ray laser, we have obtained funding from an industrial company to study itÆs use in computer-chip production, and we have obtained funding to use it in a 4-turn ERL with FFAG arcs to prototype components of eRHIC, reducing some of the main risk drivers for this large nuclear-physics accelerator.
