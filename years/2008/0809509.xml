<AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Andrew Hilier of Iowa State University.  Prof. Hilier's research program focuses on the development of highly sensitive surface plasmon spectroscopic methods for quantitative studies of adsorption of analytes to surfaces. Prof. Hilier and his students will perform detailed experimental and modeling studies to better understand and optimize the conditions needed to facilitate maximum enhancement of light transmission through metal-coated gratings.  The proposed studies will be directly applicable to the development of a greatly improved surface plasmon spectroscopic technique. The study will provide an excellent educational opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to carry out a spectroscopic method development project wit the potential to revolutionize the field of surface plasmon spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>

Hillier Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering Iowa State University     The primary objective of this project was to exploit the recently discovered phenomenon of extraordinary light transmission through nanometer-scale metallic structures in order to create new and highly sensitive analytical measurement tools, including chemical and biological sensors as well as novel spectroscopy measurements. In this work, gold and silver films coated onto surfaces possessing nanostructures in the form of one-dimensional periodic grooves, also known as surface relief gratings, were fabricated out of common sources, such as compact disks (CDs) or digital versatile disks (DVD), or out of elastomeric polymers whose surface could be controllably buckled by coating with a thin, rigid film.

The benefits of sensing and spectroscopy methods exploiting surface plasmon resonance are that they are simple and can be constructed from relatively inexpensive components.
