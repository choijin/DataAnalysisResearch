<AbstractNarration>This project is directed toward the discovery of new chemistry for catalytic C-N, C-C and C-O bond formation using high oxidation state transition metals with reactive nitrenoid or amide ligands and the application of these new methods to the synthesis of chemically and medicinally relevant targets. As an integral part of this research we aim to establish an in depth understanding of the requirements for the formation of reactive metallonitrenes and understand how different transition metals and their ligand environments affect the reactivity of the nitrene ligands. Complementing the tangible scientific and technological gains arising from the successful implementation of this research program is the implicit development of human potential and education of our next generation of scientific leaders. Although a prominent educational component of this program involves the advanced scientific training of graduate students in an environment that fosters creativity and rigor, this project will also encompass efforts by the P.I. to develop and implement new curriculum and pedagogy at the undergraduate level, with a focus on scientific method and problem solving as a means of understanding fundamental organic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Simon Blakey of the Department of Chemistry at Emory University. Professor Blakey's research efforts revolve around the development of new cascade reactions for the formation of selected chemical bonds between carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, building complex molecular architecture from simple building blocks. These reactions are expected to be transformative, with the potential to impact the discovery of new medicines, streamline processes for the large scale synthesis of important nitrogen containing compounds and access new functional motifs for applications in materials chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

Quite simply put, not a day goes by when our lives are not significantly impacted by nitrogen containing compounds. From very simple materials such as nylon and the contact adhesives that hold our cars together, to more complex examples, such as the drugs we turn to when we are sick and the organic semiconductors appearing in energy efficient Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) TVs, nitrogen-containing compounds are truly ubiquitous. However, the chemistry we often use to incorporate nitrogen into organic molecules remains firmly grounded in the 20th (or even 19th) centuries.  Traditional chemical syntheses utilize carefully orchestrated sequences of reactions to systematically build complicated structures from readily available starting materials. However, the vast majority of these reactions construct only one chemical bond at a time. With each chemical step requiring new reagents, new batches of solvent, reactor time, and product purification, the synthesis of even moderately complex molecules is often extremely time consuming and expensive.  During this project, the research team has developed a series of new reactions for the synthesis of nitrogen containing compounds that construct multiple chemical bonds (anywhere between two and four new bonds) in a single reaction. These new reactions allow us to establish significant molecular complexity from remarkably simple starting materials, introducing substantial shortcuts into traditional synthetic routes. The development of these new reactions has recently allowed us to access the core structures of a family of biologically important molecules.  Specifically we focused on the securinega alkaloids, which have long been revered in traditional Chinese medicine. These molecules have been shown to modulate CNS activity, and have potential in the treatment of paralysis following BallÆs palsy and in alleviating the symptoms of myotrophic lateral sclerosis (commonly known as Lou GehrigÆs disease).  We also demonstrate rapid entry to a variety of different drug-like scaffolds, with significant structural diversity arising from the new controlled reactivity developed during this project.  The efficiencies we gain from constructing the multiple bonds of their complex cores in a single step will enable us to rapidly assemble a number of analogues of these molecules to more fully understand the relationship between their structure and their medicinal activity.
