    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to create a terahertz detector for safety and security applications. The approach is to develop a low-cost easily fabricated room temperature metamaterial-enhanced optomechanical radiation detector for active imaging applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the development of active structures and devices for enhancing the ability manipulate and detect terahertz radiation by combining electromagnetic metamaterials with microelectromechanical system technologies. Motivating our effort to advance terahertz science and technology is the unique characteristics of terahertz radiation which includes transparency to materials such as cardboard, plastic, and styrofoam which are opaque at other wavelengths, and the sensitivity of terahertz radiation to gas and solid phase molecular signatures including biological agents and chemical explosives. A potential application is imaging and identification of embedded illicit or hazardous materials. While there have been laboratory-based demonstrations, further improvements in terahertz sources, components, and detectors are required for systems which are sufficiently compact and robust for real-world operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed multidisciplinary effort will facilitate the development of fieldable terahertz systems by combining electromagnetic metamaterials with microelectromechanical system technology. Metamaterials is an emerging field with considerable opportunity for scientific exploration and relatively near-term technological impact. Furthermore, the marriage of metamaterials with microelectromechanical technology enables technological advances that would otherwise be difficult to achieve. This work will set the stage for additional advances through the intelligent design of micromechanically responsive metamaterial composites while providing undergraduate and graduate level students with unique educational opportunities. The PIs will also develop summer short courses for high school students.</AbstractNarration>
