<AbstractNarration>This Strategies project seeks to provide year round programming following an intensive summer camp for teachers and students from middle schools in a rural area. It proposes to build on the Games that Teach research at MIT, and the games research of the Digital Collaboratory at UT-Austin, to give teachers the skills they need to design educational game components in team situations with students. The approach is to use 3-D visualizations, physics engines and other gaming strategies to relate abstract math and science concepts to real world phenomenon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Additionally, the population was predominately potential first generation college graduates with less than 10% of parents holding 4 year degrees and approximately 100% of the students low SES.     In focus groups and telephone interviews, teachers praised the project and indicated that it had a positive impact for them and their students. The teachers indicated that their students benefited from being able to make friends with students from their own districts and from the other districts. Some teachers pointed to how the project benefited "kids who were not the stars in their districts." One teacher shared that he/she believed that participation in this project will actually help to "keep some of the students in school." Teachers also shared how valuable it was for them to have the opportunity to get to know students who would be in their classes in the future.      Data collected from students and teachers pointed to the projectÆs success in meeting its objectives by:  Increasing motivation and interest of rural      middle school students in robotics and gaming programming as well as      increasing their motivation and interest in attending college and pursuing      STEM careers Increasing studentsÆ science, math, and      technology proficiency along with their problem-solving skills Increasing teachersÆ knowledge about and      confidence in teaching robotics and gaming programming Providing opportunities for      collaborative learning experiences for students and teachers related to      robotics and gaming programming Providing students and teachers      information about STEM careers, especially engineering careers.
