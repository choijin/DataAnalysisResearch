<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Anders Nilsson of Stanford University, together with his graduate student researchers, will investigate the nature of the hydrogen bond network in liquid water.  The main experimental techniques to be used include x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray raman scattering measurements, small-angle x-ray scattering and x-ray diffraction measurements.  These experiments will be carried out at the SSRL synchrotron radiation facility as well as with equipment in the Nilsson laboratory.  The work will be augmented with a theoretical collaboration with a Swedish computational chemistry group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water is the reaction medium for the most important environmental and life processes.  Many of the unique chemical and physical properties of water are due to its propensity to hydrogen-bond with itself and other species.  The work of Prof. Nilsson and his group is aimed at developing a better description of the hydrogen bond network in liquid water.  The students working in the Nilsson laboratory will have the opportunity to work in one of the premier light sources in the country, and will further benefit from an international collaboration.  Besides being intimately involved in the research work, Prof. Nilsson is an outstanding ambassador for science, participating in a number of public outreach activities at Stanford as well as at the Exploratorium in San Francisco.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
