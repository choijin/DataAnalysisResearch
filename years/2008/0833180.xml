<AbstractNarration>CENSES seeks resources from CREST to enhance as well as develop research expertise in areas associated with sensors and energy transduction systems in order to serve as a national resource center in these critical areas, and to be available for collaboration in research and development efforts with a variety of potential partners. Three research subprojects are proposed. Subproject-1 focuses on nanomaterials and nanostructures for sensor applications, with 3 constituent projects dealing with mid-IR sensors based on wide bandgap II-VI semiconductor devices; chemical and biological sensors from single-walled carbon nanotubes; and liposome-based arrays with nanoparticle markers for toxin detection. Subproject-2 exploits nanomaterials and nanostructures in energy systems, and has 4 constituent projects concerned with battery electrode nanomaterials; single-walled carbon nanotubes onto which electrocatalysts are attached for fuel cell applications; hybrid II-VI and III-V multiple quantum well/quantum dot high-performance solar cells; and hydrate-based gas storage materials. Subproject-3 focuses on emerging technologies and novel characterization techniques, and has 4 constituent projects dealing with biologically inspired self-assembled nanostructures; cobalt-oxide-based thermoelectric materials and devices; surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) applied to the study organicinorganic hybrid nanomaterials; and femtosecond time-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the above aforementioned research efforts will be invaluable in addressing the major challenges facing our nation and the world today in the development of sustainable energy technologies that focus on renewable resources, and the monitoring of health, the environment and national security threats. The impact of this CREST center project not only includes a diversity recruitment &amp; retention plan to continue engaging graduate students from underrepresented groups and a research experience for undergraduate students-style enrichment program geared towards the largely minority population of transfer students, but it also contains a professional development plan to increase the number of underrepresented individuals with in-depth research knowledge and skills in the nanotechnology fields who can join the faculty and postdoctoral ranks of City College and elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>

CENSES sought to enhance and develop research expertise in the critical areas of sensors and energy transduction systems, and aimed to serve as a national resource center and to be available for collaboration in research and development efforts with a range of potential partners.  The research was organized along three Subprojects.

Some of the noteworthy outcomes achieved by CENSES researchers are listed below.    The team demonstrated light emitters and detectors from a novel semiconductor material system that can operate in the critical short wave mid-infrared spectral region not reached by currently used materials.  A new type of detector that they developed exhibits excellent characteristics, including broad spectral response and room temperature operation.  Potential for compact, high brightness green laser was also demonstrated.  They developed a miniaturized device based on functionalized nanobeads for the high throughput screening of toxins and biomolecules.  They developed new gas sensors based on carbon nanotubes for the detection of explosives.  They investigated the effect of surfactants on the formation of a class of molecules known as gas hydrates, which can capture large quantities of small gas molecules for energy storage. Based on this fundamental work, they could elucidate how the surface-active agents accelerate gas hydrate nucleation and crystal growth.  The team studied the effect of adopting an ordered porous structure on the properties of electrodes to be used in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells.  They investigated the adsorption of colloidal nanoparticles at the solid-liquid interface, a phenomenon of fundamental importance in environmental and biological processes, such as wastewater treatment or biocompatibility.  In the bioinspired materials area, they made progress towards the development of components and models for a biomimetic solar cell, and a self-assembling protein template for cheaper and environmentally friendly plasmonic metamaterials (materials that modify the way light is transmitted).  They also developed a vegetable oil-based sensor for detecting trace amounts mercury in water.  Finally, a new experimental tool: time-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy was used to study the detailed properties and atomic arrangements of semiconductor layered structures and of graphene deposited on different substrates.    These investigations resulted in over 150 publications in high profile journals, and similar numbers of presentati...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
