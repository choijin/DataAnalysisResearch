<AbstractNarration>Energy consumption for data centers (a.k.a. hosting centers, server farms, clusters etc.) is rapidly increasing and is fast becoming a significant portion of the nation?s annual energy budget. Surprisingly, many of the contemporary data centers are designed and managed very inefficiently, mainly due to reliance on folklore techniques rather than those grounded in hard scientific evidence. In addition, contemporary research and experimentation in greening data centers is severely hindered by the unavailability of an experimentation test-bed, the cost of performing live tests of alternative configurations and the excessive long duration for performing simulations based on high-complexity offline models based on computational fluid dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;The BlueTool project aims to resolve these issues by: 1) increasing awareness of the latest scientific and engineering research on managing data centers, and 2) providing a research and evaluation infrastructure to test and develop new methodologies to address the inefficiencies of data centers. BlueTool will promote the use of holistic cyber-physical concepts to foster the development of energy-efficient and sustainable data centers. It will leverage recent research advances in cooling technologies and cyber-physical management for data centers at Arizona State University (ASU) and provide synergy for advancing the ongoing research in this field at ASU and elsewhere. BlueTool will consist of: (a) an online tool that can simulate various configurations of data centers, in terms of physical layout, hardware and software configuration; (b) a research hub and portal, maintained by the IMPACT Lab at ASU (http://impact.asu.edu), that offers data services on various updatable archives including power and thermal profiles, multi-scale low-complexity thermal and power models, and data center management methods and software. Researchers from both academia and industry will be able to use BlueTool's online consulting services to improve the computing performance and energy consumption of conventional or existing configurations with newly developed techniques.</AbstractNarration>

A CPS is any computer system which has dominant physical interactions with its immediate environment, in terms of movement, material exchange or energy exchange. Considering and modeling a data center as CPS, we can link quantitatively the amount of computational workload to how much energy is needed, what the heat conditions are in the data center room, and how much energy is wasted from the various components (see Figure 3).

BlueTool has helped:  -        In model validation:  In validating the "heat recirculation matrix", a model that predicts temperatures given heat output from each server:  In producing power curves, i.e. utilization-to-power models. BlueToolÆs infrastructure was used to run experiments and yield what is called power curve. On developing a model for the computing-cooling trade-off effect, i.e. a condition where when consolidating the computational workload to fewer servers to save energy makes the cooling infrastructure work harder because of gathering all the heat to one side of the room. In research on models for operating data centers with energy storage.   -        Overall research in data centers:  On how heat-activated cooling can be a feasible option forcooling data centers. This means that no significantly additional power is needed to run air conditioners. On the energy-wastage effects of phase imb...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
