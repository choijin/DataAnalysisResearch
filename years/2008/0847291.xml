<AbstractNarration>Professor Jayne C. Garno of Louisiana State University &amp; Agricultural and Mechanical College is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry CAREER Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop a new scanning probe microscopy method, termed "Magnetic Sample Modulation" for mapping magnetic domains at nanometer dimensions.  The project aims to: (1) evaluate the size scaling effects of nanomaterials in a range from superparamagnetism to regular bulk ferromagnetism; (2) study the effect of material composition on magnetic moments of nanomaterials; (3) differentiate and map magnetic and non-magnetic nanoparticles; (4) implement magnetic imaging at the level of individual cells; and (5) apply the newly developed imaging method for dynamic studies with ferromagnetic proteins such as ferritin.  Fundamental knowledge of the effect of particle shape, size, and surface structure, on the magnetic properties is essential for understanding the scaling effects of nanomagnetic materials.  The results will have a high potential impact in the fields of nanoscience, surface chemistry and biotechnology.  Scanning probe microscopy imaging concepts will be introduced in several courses, and students will receive training on state-of-the-art instrumentation while conducting fundamental research.</AbstractNarration>
