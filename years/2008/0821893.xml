<AbstractNarration>Project Summmary:  If the DNA from all of the chromosomes in a single human cell were joined end to end, the genome would span approximately 2 meters.  In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is tightly associated with proteins called histones that allow it to be extensively folded upon itself to form a polymer called chromatin.  The compaction of DNA afforded by wrapping around a complex of histones allows the entire genome to be packed into the microscopic confines of the nucleus of each cell.  However, for individual genes to be expressed, for damaged DNA to be repaired, and for the genome to be replicated prior to cell division, regions of chromatin must be unfolded so that the relevant cellular machinery can gain access to the DNA.  Conversely, chromatin must be condensed to form chromosomes during cell division to ensure that daughter cells each receive a complete copy of the genome.  The addition and removal of small chemical groups or "modifications" to histones are central to both chromatin folding and unfolding.  A wide variety of histone modifications have been described, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in mediating their function or how the levels of individual modifications are controlled.  This project will investigate how the levels and genomic localization of histone H4-lysine 20 methylation are regulated.  Lysine 20 can be unmodified or modified by the addition of one, two or three methyl groups.  The enzyme PR-Set7 mediates monomethylation, whereas Suv4-20 mediates both di- and trimethylation.  Decreased levels of PR-Set7 are associated with increased DNA damage and defective cell division, whereas depletion of Suv4-20 alters cellular responses to DNA damage and increases genomic instability.  Both enzymes are activated during cell division and it is likely that their activities are coordinately regulated by dynamic modifications or interactions with other proteins.  State-of-the-art approaches will be used to identify proteins associated with PR-Set7 and Suv4-20, characterize the modifications affecting the activities of these enzymes and associated proteins, and ascertain the significance of the PI's findings in human and Drosophila cells.  Understanding the molecular regulation of these enzymes will impact our understanding of the roles of chromatin structure in cell cycle progression, detection and repair of damaged DNA, mitosis, and other processes that are critical for normal cell function.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This work will enhance our understanding of an epigenetic pathway involved in aspects of chromatin function that are fundamental to normal cell biology and the development of multicellular organisms.  The cell lines, antisera and other reagents created during this project will be useful to labs investigating other aspects of chromatin function and will be made readily available.  In addition, this work demonstrates how proteomic methodologies can be used in conjunction with cell biology and molecular biology approaches to make paradigm-shifting discoveries in the life sciences.  The unique training that graduate and undergraduate students receive in this project will enable them to apply these powerful strategies in their own careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All of the information necessary for cells to survive, grow, and replicate is stored in the DNA molecules that comprise their genome. Consequently, molecular mechanisms that detect and repair the various types of DNA damage that cells encounter are critical for maintaining their viability and proper regulation of growth.  Double strand DNA breaks are a particularly hazardous type of DNA damage since they can lead to chromosomal rearrangements, cell death, and diseases including cancer if not fully repaired.  In eukaryotic cells (i.e. fungi, plants, animals), genomic DNA is bound by histones and a diverse array of other types of proteins to form a complex called chromatin.  Elucidating how the structure of chromatin is regulated dynamically to allow the instructions in DNA to be read ("gene expression") and sites of DNA damage to be recognized and repaired has been a major focus of biological research during the last forty years.     The work performed in this project led to the discovery of a novel molecular mechanism involved in marking sites of DNA double strand breaks for subsequent repair.  A protein called 53BP1 that is distributed diffusely throughout chromatin in the absence of DNA damage, rapidly redistributes to assemble into discrete "foci" that mark chromatin at sites of double strand breaks after they occur.  Focal accumulation of 53BP1 depends on the specific binding of 53BP1 to a chemically modified amino acid residue (dimethylated lysine 20) in the histone H4 chromatin protein.  However, since H4 lysine 20 dimethylation (H4K20me2) is established ubiquitously throughout chromatin in the absence of DNA damage, how the binding of 53BP1 to H4K20me2 is prevented in the absence of damage, and how it is localized to H4K20me2 at sites of damage once it occurs, has remained a mystery.     We discovered that cells use the addition and removal of acetylation, a different type of chemical modification, at the neighbouring lysine 16 (K16) amino acid residue to regulate the accessibility of K20me2 within individual molecules of H4.  Concurrent K16 acetylation prevents 53BP1 binding to H4K20me2 in the absence of DNA damage.  However, when cells are exposed to conditions that generate DNA double strand breaks, deacetylase enzymes are recruited to sites of damage and remove K16 acetylation locally to facilitate focal accumulation of 53BP1 and the subsequent break repair.  These findings are significant because they provide new insight into how cells signal the presence of DNA double strand breaks, and may be useful for the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat cancer or other diseases.
