<AbstractNarration>Development is a precise and reproducible process that is insensitive (or robust) to both individual differences and environmental variations.  How such robustness is achieved remains an intriguing but fundamental problem in developmental biology.  Dr. Ma proposes to use the fruit fly Drosophila as a model organism to study developmental robustness.  Since the fundamental principles that guide developmental processes are conserved in all animals, the findings of this study will be directly relevant to the understanding of ourselves.  This study will focus on a gradient protein called Bicoid that instructs the embryo to develop the anterior structures including the head and thorax.  Dr. Ma will investigate the processes of both Bicoid gradient formation and gradient action in embryos, with a focus on the robustness of the system.  He has assembled an interdisciplinary team to tackle this problem and will take advantage of tools in genetics, molecular biology, mathematics, computer science and physics.  Dr. Ma aims to obtain experimental data to build a mathematical model that describes developmental robustness.  The information revealed in this study will be useful not only to developmental and systems biologists but also to physicists and mathematicians working on living systems.  The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed work will help train a new generation of scientists that can traverse between distinct scientific fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under the support of this NSF award, we have gained critical new insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling developmental robustness.  Our study takes advantage of the model organism of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which offers excellent genetic, molecular and analytical tools for mechanistic investigations.  We perform quantitative experimental studies, combined with theoretical and simulation studies, using the Drosophila embryo.  We probe how the morphogen gradient of Bicoid instructs the embryo to form patterns along the anterior-posterior axis.  We are particularly interested in the question of how embryonic patterns are formed in a manner that is insensitive, or robust, to different types of fluctuations, including size variations among individual embryos.   Our study has led to the discovery of quantitative measurements relevant to how the Bicoid morphogen gradient is formed in the early Drosophila embryo.  A significant finding of our study is that the amount of the maternally-provided Bicoid protein in the embryo is related to the size of the egg laid by the mother, suggesting that robust embryonic patterning has a maternal origin.  Our study has also led to the discovery of new proteins that control embryonic patterning by regulating either the activity of Bicoid or its concentration gradient shape inside the embryo.  We have developed simulation models for Bicoid gradient formation and have obtained quantitative evaluations of how the shape of the Bicoid gradient can have an impact on how precisely the embryos are instructed to form patterns.  We have had more than 20 scientific publications supported by this NSF award.       Last Modified: 05/30/2014       Submitted by: Jun Ma]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
