<AbstractNarration>Gunnells proposes to work on problems in number theory and&lt;br/&gt;representation theory in three broad areas.  First, he will focus on&lt;br/&gt;topics related to cohomology of arithmetic groups and allied areas,&lt;br/&gt;such as geometry of locally symmetric spaces and connections with&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic geometry.  Second, he will study multiple Dirichlet series&lt;br/&gt;attached to Weyl groups and affine Weyl groups and their connections&lt;br/&gt;to combinatorics, representation theory, and automorphic forms.&lt;br/&gt;Third, he will investigate the geometry of Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in&lt;br/&gt;Coxeter groups and their connections with combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;representation theory.  As a major writing project, he will continue&lt;br/&gt;to work with Hirzebruch and Zagier on the updating of their book "The&lt;br/&gt;Atiyah-Singer theorem and elementary number theory."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with number theory and representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers, and&lt;br/&gt;is the oldest branch of mathematics.  Representation theory is the&lt;br/&gt;systematic study of symmetry, through the development of simple&lt;br/&gt;mathematical objects that encode the fundamental irreducible pieces of&lt;br/&gt;symmetry.  A principal aim of the proposal is to explore relationships&lt;br/&gt;between these two subjects in the spirit of the "Langlands&lt;br/&gt;philosophy," which predicts deep connections between number theory and&lt;br/&gt;representation theory.  Today the questions and phenomena addressed by&lt;br/&gt;these subjects serve as driving forces in much of contemporary&lt;br/&gt;mathematics research.  Moreover, the subjects have contributed many&lt;br/&gt;applications in such diverse areas as codes and data transmission,&lt;br/&gt;chemistry, physics, and theoretical computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
