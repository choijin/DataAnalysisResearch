<AbstractNarration>WGBH will produce a third season of Design Squad, PBS reality competition series-with an accompanying outreach campaign and Web site (pbskidsgo.org/designsquad)-designed to inspire a new generation of engineers. Through the show, teenagers learn to think smart, build fast, and contend with a wild array of engineering challenges-all for real-life clients. Targeted to 9- to 12-year-olds, and fun for people of all ages, this fast-paced TV series is the fuel behind a national, multimedia initiative designed to attract kids to engineering. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The plan is to continue to build on the excitement and momentum have created during Seasons I and II, while also creating many innovations in project deliverables. More specifically, the four overarching goals are to (1) expand the project's reach into the middle school classroom with materials that will enable teachers to integrate engineering into their curriculum; (2) broaden participation with the TV show by casting contestants nationwide and producing three challenges at locations around the country (the Nevada desert, New Orleans, and Alaska); (3) create the first online community where kids can share their real-world engineering projects and provide a richer video viewing experience with embedded "pop-up" commentary; and (4) support existing partnerships especially with engineering professional societies, while forming new ones.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Design Squad and its "Middle School Classroom" initiative will have maximum impact: (1) addressing a critical need in engineering education and children?s television; (2) increasing students, knowledge of engineering and the design process; and (3) showcasing engineering as creative, rewarding, and socially relevant, especially to girls and minorities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Formative and summative will inform both future seasons of Design Squad and the informal and formal science education community at large, which is lacking research on how teachers can integrate engineering into the middle school science curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by Directorate for Education and Human Resources and the Directorate for Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Design Squad Season III Project Outcomes Report     During Season III, Design Squad continued to bring an innovative combination of engineering content and reality show competition to ætween viewers, while showcasing design challenges and illustrating what it means to be an engineer. NSFÆs support for Season III was crucial in bringing the excitement of science and technology to kids, educators, and engineers. More specifically, Design Squad achieved the following project goals: 1) expanding our reach into the middle school classroom; 2) broadening participation with the TV show; 3) creating a more robust Web site; and 4) supporting existing partnerships, while forming new ones.    1)    Expanding our reach into the middle school classroom  With the Design Squad "Middle School Classroom" initiative, we leveraged Design SquadÆs broadcast resources, in tandem with the projectÆs Web site and other outreach resources, to enable teachers to integrate engineering into their classrooms. The TeacherÆs Guide we created provided a breadth of engineering and design activities aligned with schoolsÆ science curricula. Concord Evaluation Group performed an experiment (randomized block design) to explore the extent of learning and changes in attitudes of students who used the Middle School Classroom initiative. They reported that the resources helped students in a significant way learn key science concepts and develop skills that are essential to performing engineering challenges.

With the DS Xchange, kids could brainstorm and sketch their own solutions to design challenges and then share them in a public gallery. HereÆs a small sampling of the creativity exhibited in the public galleries: combination shoes/roller-skates that run on rechargeable batteries; a solar-powered motorized wheelchair; a Frisbee-like disk that squirts water in all directions when it is thrown; a pet-feeding machine made of environmentally-friendly materials; and robotic arms installed at a pool that detect and rescue a swimmer in trouble.
