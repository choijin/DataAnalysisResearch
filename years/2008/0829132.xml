<AbstractNarration>CBET- 0829132&lt;br/&gt;Ferguson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal objectives of this proposal are to identify and characterize microbes in activated sludge that are capable of biodegrading emerging trace-contaminants (ETCs) at low concentrations, and develop a bioaugmentation process for existing wastewater treatment systems to remove ETCs from wastewater. In the last decades many ecological concerns have arisen related to ETC in aquatic environments. As a primary environmental source, ETC removal is one of the main challenges currently facing wastewater treatment facilities. Many studies examining the fate of ETCs in treatment processes suggest that biologic degradation contributes to transformations of ETCs. While the existence of microbes that can grow heterotrophically on ETCs has thus been confirmed, their ability to grow and contribute to ETCs degradation at the extreme low-concentrations has not been fully explored. In this proposed study, advanced analytical chemistry, microbiology and molecular biology methods will be combined to study the heterotrophic degradation of ETCs in wastewater treatment. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop a bioaugmentation approach for existing biologic treatment processes that will enhance ETC removal by addressing the following hypotheses: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Microbes presented in activated sludge are capable of degrading ETCs at low concentrations. &lt;br/&gt;2. Metabolic degradative activity is expressed at environmental concentrations of ETCs. &lt;br/&gt;3. Heterotrophic degradation contributes to observed losses in WTF of ETCs. &lt;br/&gt;4. The ability of microbes that degrade trace-level compounds to also grow using other organics will allow bioaugmentation engineering based on growth with less hazardous compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is potentially transformative in that a method of bioaugmentation for specific ETCs degradation will be developed to investigate and design processes for biomass addition to achieve targeted effluent limitations, as they are promulgated. Direct educational benefits include the training of graduate students, and participation of undergraduate researchers. Increased participation by underrepresented groups will be realized through established program through continued partnership with the University of Washington, College of Engineering Office of Diversity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Discharges of trace organic contaminants in treated wastewater, especially endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), have caused dramatic damage to fish and other aquatic life.  Since most of these compounds are partially removed by biodegradation during wastewater treatment, it was postulated that bacteria capable of degrading the compounds could be isolated from wastewater treatment plants (WTP) and might be cultivated and added back to the WTP to improve removal of specific contaminants and eliminate damage to aquatic life.     There are many steps involved in developing and implementing this approach.  This project has made progress in several aspects, including isolating bacteria that can grow on trace contaminants, degrade the contaminants to very low levels, and degrade the contaminants in the presence of wastewater and the microbial community of the biological treatment process. Nine organic compounds were evaluated for bacterial isolates. Eight bacterial isolates have been obtained thus far that degrade five of the compounds, including triclosan, estradiol, bisphenol A, gemfibrozil and ibuprofen. Suitable organic compounds have been identified to be able to grow the bacteria in amounts to add back to the wastewater treatment process (termed bioaugmentation), and tests have been performed to obtain growth and degradation rates for each bacteria. The degradation rates have been incorporated into a model that allows calculation of bacteria dose to obtain a desired effluent concentration or percent removal for the contaminant. The model can also show the effect of process configuration or operating parameters such as solids residence time, endogenous decay or predation of the bacteria.     Further work is needed to find bacteria that can be used for all of the most damaging EDCs, to improve understanding of how to cultivate the bacteria to maintain their high degradation activity, and to improve their survival when added to the microbial community of biological treatment.  When one or a few EDCs can be identified as responsible for impacting aquatic life, bioaugmentation may well prove a useful technique for improving removal and stopping the damage.
