<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the REU site at Kansas State University which will have research opportunities for undergraduates focusing on interactions of laser light with matter at atomic and nanoscales. The participants will engage in significant research projects and related experiences during the summer. At the core of the program are the research projects with mentors from the faculty.  Participants will do research on how atoms and molecules behave in intense and ultra-fast optical and xray pulses, how scattered laser light reveals the structure of nanoparticle crystallization and gel formation, and how light interacts non-linearly in optical fibers; they will develop computer codes for calculations of atomic interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates and codes for modeling nanoparticle self-assembly from lattices to gels.  This experience will be supplemented by a small series of lectures that provide the background these students need to carry out their projects. The participants will gain experience in explaining their research work to a variety of audiences and will also engage in reading on and discussion of ethical behavior in science. Social activities, both organized and spontaneous, will enrich this undergraduate research experience.   This award is supported by the Physics Division and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Twelve students from around the United States have been funded by the National Science Foundation to do research in physics at Kansas State University each summer from 2009-2011. Most of these students were from smaller colleges that offer fewer opportunities for research than we have available at KSU. For most of them this research experience confirmed their choice of a career in physics or engineering but also helped a few of them decide to pursue interests in medicine, law, or a non-technical area. It is good for our country for bright students to make an informed career choice early in their education, and this NSF program, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), has advanced that national interest.      They have sometimes done independent research, mentored by a KSU professor, but usually joined existing research groups that are already involved in basic research. The research they did ranged from computer simulations of how crystals evaporate to experimental work on how lasers can be used to manipulate the way molecules break up into their constituent atoms. Here are a few examples of the projects and the outcomes.      One student joined the KSU neutrino-physics group. These physicists are working on an experiment in France in which neutrinos are detected by the light produced when they interact with a special liquid in a large container. Inside the liquid are light sensors and other devices. A clear resin is a component of some of these devices, and it was not known how much light would be produced by interactions in the resin.  An REU student at KSU in 2010 studied this and her results -- that the resin would produce no light -- were reported to the group of experimenters working in France.  When unexpected light was later found in the operation of the detector, it stimulated other research groups to check her results, and her work was found to be correct. She is now in graduate school studying nuclear physics.      When a laser beam hits a molecule the molecule may break up, but there are many ways that the break-up can occur. One REU student joined a group at KSU that studies this process and made great progress during the ten-week program. She continued the work during her senior year at a small mid-western college, occasionally returning to KSU to do further experiments. She won the Apker award for the best undergraduate physics research in the nation in 2011 and is attending graduate school on a prestigious Department of Energy Fellowship. Her publications already include five peer-reviewed papers on related work.      Another student investigated the different ways that experts and beginners solve pictorial physics problems. Earlier research had shown that when problems are presented in the form of a picture or graph, experts pay attention to different regions of the image than beginners do.  The REU student recruited beginning physics students from our summer classes and found that if these beginners were cued to look at the same parts of the picture that the experts did, then the beginners modified incorrect ideas more readily and generally did better at solving the problems. The research was prepared for presentation at a national meeting and helped initiate a program of research that continues today.      Even when a project is not a technical success the experience pays off. One REU student from a small school in the southeast spent the summer trying to build a special sort of laser that would produce a long sequence of very short pulses by embedding carbon nanotubes in a fiber composed of a honeycomb of extremely small glass tubes. The laser worked, but produced a steady output instead of the wanted stream of pulses. Nevertheless, the excitement of the work confirmed her desire for a research career, and she is now in graduate school in electrical engineering, having won a NSF Graduate Fellowship.      The NSF-sponsored REU program has worked the way it is supposed to, and KSU is proud to be a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
