<AbstractNarration>Technical&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports a project to investigate interacting disordered electrons in semiconductor heterostructures.  High-frequency measurements in radio and microwave frequency ranges will be developed to address a set of questions that cannot directly be answered by more standard transport techniques.  An emphasis of the investigations will be on how spin/charge interactions can influence the ground state properties of electrons when two sets of Landau levels are brought into degeneracy.  The study will be facilitated by using resistively detected nuclear magnetic resonance and microwave absorption spectroscopy techniques in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well with two occupied subbands.  Another focus of the research will be on the search for broken-symmetry magnetic and spin-paring states of highly correlated electrons. High-frequency spectroscopy studies will be done in strained Si/SiGe heterostructures.  The results anticipated from these experiments may have applications in high-frequency electronics.  The hands-on research, which will include microwave engineering and characterizations, will give graduate and undergraduate students excellent training in the important technical area of microwave electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports an experimental research project involving high-frequency studies of advanced semiconductor devices.  These electronic devices are very similar to those widely used in high-speed electronics and in information processing. The main objective of the project is to understand a set of newly-discovered electronic properties stemming from the intricate interactions between two electrons due to a property of electrons called electron spin.  The ability to gain such understanding will be made possible by using an array of unconventional high-frequency techniques.  The results anticipated from these experiments may have broader impacts on the development of the next generation of semiconductor devices.  For example, devices using electron spins to perform information processing via memory and logic functionality are gradually emerging.  The capability to measure and manipulate electron spins at high frequencies may become an important part of the development of these new devices.  The heavy hands-on research, which will include microwave engineering and characterizations, will give graduate and undergraduate students excellent training for microwave electronics, a technological area that is of great economic importance to our society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Studies of interacting, disordered low-dimensional electronic systems continue to be major areas of research in condensed matter physics.  This sustained intellectual pursuit is driven by constant experimental discoveries that challenge much of the basic framework of our understanding of the quantum physics of electrons in low-dimensions.  Quantum Hall systems provide ideal laboratories for experimental studies as both effective correlation and disorder on two-dimensional carriers can be controllably varied in tailor designed semiconductor structures.  In the last several years, it has become increasingly apparent that experimental tools other than that of standard transport techniques are highly desirable for further addressing some of the fundamental questions.  This project represents an effort towards this direction.  High-frequency measurements in the radio and microwave frequency ranges were developed and performed to address a set of questions that cannot directly be answered by more standard transport techniques.  In particular, questions of how spin/charge interactions can influence the emergent phenomena of electrons when two sets of Landau levels are brought into degeneracy by varying magnetic fields or carrier concentrations were addressed by the research. These advanced understanding in long run may have an impact on the development of new generation of semiconductor devices for information processing. The technical results were disseminated as publications in peer reviewed journals, and as invited talks in national and international conferences. The NSF support has been instrumental in the training both undergraduate and graduate students at UCLA. In fact, the heavy hands-on research experiences effectively developed careers of three female students, which helped to increase the diversity in the experimental condensed matter physics field.
