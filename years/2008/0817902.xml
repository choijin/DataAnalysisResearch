<AbstractNarration>Sally A. Moody, Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal# IOS-0817902&lt;br/&gt;"Molecular specification of the pre-placodal ectoderm."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "ectoderm" of the vertebrate embryo is initially patterned into four domains: epidermis (skin), neural plate (the precursor of the central nervous system), neural crest (a precursor of the peripheral nervous system) and pre-placodal ectoderm (the precursor of several sensory organs in the head). In particular, the pre-placodal ectoderm gives rise to the olfactory and auditory systems, the lens of the eye, numerous sensory neurons in the head and the lateral line organ in fish and amphibians.  Although the developmental mechanisms that regulate the formation of the neural plate, neural crest and epidermis have been studied extensively, very little is known about the development of the pre-placodal ectoderm. This proposal will elucidate the molecular interactions that: 1) induce the formation of the pre-placodal ectoderm; and 2) establish and maintain the boundaries between the four ectodermal domains as the head develops. Although these early steps of placode development have been overlooked in mutant mouse studies, perhaps because they occur very early when rodent embryos are especially fragile, they are particularly amenable to study in Xenopus frogs because of easy access to the early developmental stages and wealth of available molecular and embryological tools.  The proposed studies will provide important new knowledge about the genes and tissue interactions that establish this important ectodermal domain, and is expected to elucidate the genetic and evolutionary changes that have occurred in these structures across vertebrates. In terms of Broader Impacts, because the Xenopus system allows one to visualize and manipulate gene expression without extensive technical expertise, the experimental approaches can be taught to high school, undergraduate and graduate students and thereby provide an outstanding learning experience for students interested in exploring a career in science. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Major Findings Addressing Intellectual Merit:  The studies supported by this grant provided important new knowledge about the genes and tissue interactions that establish this important ectodermal domain, which is required for the development of important cranial sensory structures, such as the olfactory epithelium, lens and inner ear.  1) The expression of neural crest (NC) and pre-placodal ectoderm (PPE) genes in the lateral zone that borders the neural plate causes the withdrawal of epidermal gene expression.

Thus, the transcription factors that specify each domain reciprocally repress adjacent domains. This gene interaction can explain how domains are regulated during development.  4) Six1 does not regulate the expression of later-expressed Six genes in the placodes, its regulation of Sox11 in the PPE is dose dependent; and it represses the onset of Xiro1 expression, which is required for placode neuron differentiation.

Major Broader Impact Activities:  General Scientific Impact: The results from this research elucidate the gene regulatory network that defines placodal fate, and provide new knowledge about boundary formation that can be applied to a wide range of tissues across species. This information is expected to be applicable across vertebrates and therefore be useful for understanding genetic and evolutionary changes that have occurred in these structures.    Training Experiences:  Dr. Moody sponsored nine undergraduate students to work in her laboratory on aspects of this project. Dr. Moody sponsored five high school students to work in her laboratory on aspects of this project. One was African-American and received a minority support grant. Dr. Moody sponsored one Full Professor from a primarily undergraduate institution to work in her laboratory during his sabbatical leave from teaching.    Drs. Moody and Neilson engaged in undergraduate teaching at GWU and other undergraduate institutions to encourage students to incorporate research into their curricula.
