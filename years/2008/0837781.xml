    <AbstractNarration>Auburn University proposes the African American Researchers in Computing Sciences (AARCS) program to broaden African American participation in tenure track faculty and research scientist positions within the education pipeline. African American undergraduate students across the nation will be exposed to role models, research, and graduate school opportunities that are specifically designed to address disbeliefs, concerns, and misunderstandings about computing sciences faculty and research. This will be accomplished through targeted presentations by African American computing science faculty and graduate students, a Future Faculty/Research Scientist Mentoring program, and an annual AARCS mini-conference. The AARCS program will serve as an empirically-based and tested model that can be incorporated into larger Alliance projects. In addition, it will serve as a model that can be used to target other underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
