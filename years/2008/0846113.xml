<AbstractNarration>Internet systems perform suboptimally because of selfish user behavior; examples include email spam, freeloading, link spam, and packet flooding. How should a multi-user system such as a computer network be designed such that it operates well in the presence of selfish user behavior?  The field of mechanism design lays the economic foundations for the design and analysis of protocols, services, and applications in computer networks where users may act selfishly in their own best interest.  With varying degrees of clarity, the classical mechanism design literature gives rigorous mathematical tools from which optimal mechanisms can be derived.  Unfortunately, except for a few cases, optimal mechanisms are complex, highly dependent on the details of the setting, and impractical.  Dr.  Hartline addresses each these critiques in detail, and his project includes a well connected research agenda for developing a theory of mechanism design that is relevant to computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a theory for the design of mechanisms that are universal, simple, and practical.  Mechanisms for computer systems must be universal -- indeed the success of the Internet is owed in part to the fact that most Internet protocols function under a wide range of workloads.  Mechanisms for the Internet must be simple, if they are parameterized by more than a few dimensions, they are too difficult to optimize.  Note in contrast that the classical economic theory gives complicated mechanisms that are inextricably dependent on the the setting.  Finally, mechanisms for the Internet must be practical; this project addresses the disconnect between theory and practice in the computer science literature on mechanism design.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed theory for design and analysis of economic andcomputational systems.  Economic systems are traditionally analyzed bythe subfield of economics called mechanism design; computer systemsare traditionally analyzed by the subfield of computer science calledalgorithms.  Participants in such a system may have an interest in theoutcome of the system and may interact strategically so as to obtain amore desired outcome. Importantly the rules of these systems, whichspecify how the system outcome is obtained from the inputs fromparticipants of the system, must be carefully designed.  A good systemis one that obtains a desirable outcome even when such strategicmanipulation is possible.  This field, at the interface betweeneconomics and computer science, is called algorithmic mechanism design.   The economic theory of mechanism design assumes that the preferencesof the participants are drawn at random from a probabilitydistribution and asks for mechanisms that optimize the mechanismdesigner's objective on average for this distribution.  This approachhas two drawbacks that make it a bad match for computational systems.First, the mechanisms it suggests can be very complex.  Second, themechanisms it suggests are very sensitive to the distributionalassumption.  The project developed the foundations of algorithmicmechanism design by addressing these two drawbacks.  To address the complexity of optimal mechanisms under the economictreatment, the project adopted the perspective of approximationalgorithms and looked to identify simple mechanisms that areapproximately optimal.  As an example of one of the conclusions of theproject is that revenue in a resource allocation mechanism can beeffectively optimized with reserve prices.  This result approximatelyextends the economic theory from simple settings where reserve pricesare optimal to much more complex settings were reserve prices are nolonger optimal.  One interpretation of this result is that theusefulness of reserve prices in revenue management is very robust.  To address the sensitivity of (average case) economic mechanisms tothe assumed distribution of participant preferences, the projectdeveloped a worst-case analysis framework that is compatible with theaverage case framework from economics.  This framework is basedcomparison of the performance of a mechanism with a performancebenchmark.  The mechanism is good if, on every possible set ofparticipant preferences, its performance is close to the benchmark onthe same preferences.  The project gave a systematic way to identify abenchmark so that a mechanism that is good with respect to thebenchmark is also good in comparison to the performance of the optimalmechanism had the distribution been known.  Within this framework, theproject identified system designs that are good in worst case forbroad families of resource sharing settings.  Research results from this proposal were published in the proceedingsof top conferences in theoretical computer science and in topeconomics journals.
