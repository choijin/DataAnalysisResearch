<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) has assembled an international collaboration to test whether coronal mass ejection (CME) build-up can be ascribed to a four-stage process of magnetic field evolution that ultimately leads to the triggering of a CME. This four stage process consists of (1) canceling of magnetic fields along a polarity reversal boundary; (2) formation of a filament channel concurrent with the ascent of horizontal magnetic field into the chromosphere from cancellation sites; (3) thread-by-thread formation of a filament magnetic field and visible filament when the filament channel attains maximum development; and finally, (4) thread-by-thread building of the filament cavity magnetic field as mass drains from the visible threads, thereby incrementally releasing filament magnetic field into the cavity magnetic field until one of many possible triggering mechanisms initiates the CME. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's team will examine these distinct stages and the mechanisms linking them, taking advantage of the synergy offered by new observations, data analysis, numerical modeling, analytic theory, and laboratory plasma experiments. The PI's team expects this project to provide a greatly improved understanding of how CMEs originate and evolve. This improved knowledge of the CME environment is needed to develop predictive tools so that critical space weather events can be accurately forecast.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In collaboration with Helio Research (Award ID:  ATM-0837915) and the California Institute of Technology (Award ID:  ATM-0837910), this project investigated the forces that drive eruptions in the solar atmosphere.  These eruptions, referred to as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), propel mass and magnetic field into interplanetary space.  CMEs often envelop an erupting filament (or prominence) during their early eruptive stage.  The rapid acceleration of both the erupting filament and the CME are accompanied by the explosive phase of a solar flare.  Together CMEs, erupting filament and a flare are called an "eruptive solar event".   The collaborating team at Helio Research has been studying the long-term formation of filaments channels and filaments to better understand what leads to an eruptive solar event.   The University of New Hampshire contribution to this project focused on relating the early observational manifestations of prominence eruption to the state of the pre- eruption field.  A key manifestation of an eruption is the appearance of bright patches of light on solar surface.  These patches (known collectively as a solar flare) correspond to the footpoints of magnetic field lines that map from an energy release site in the atmosphere down to the solar surface.  Understanding the relation between the appearance and evolution of these patches relative to the ejection of the filament into space will allow better predictions of when an eruption will occur and how strong the eruption will be when it does occur.   As part of this project, the UNH investigator participated in a six month long observing campaign at the Dutch Open Telescope (DOT) on La Palma in the Canary Islands in 2010.  (Expenses for this campaign were covered by a separate NSF Rapid Award to Helio Research.)  During this campaign a sequence of three solar flares were observe in association with the eruption of a filament on July 13th (see figure).  The first two flares were relatively small and short-lived (&lt; 30 minutes) and were accompanied by changes in the spectral lines indicative of downflows.  Most of the filament appeared to remain intact during these weak flares.  An eruption with strong upflows finally occurred at the onset of the third and final flare.  This flare was considerably stronger and long-lived compared to the previous two.   The data as a whole seem to suggest that each flare was associated with a release of magnetic energy at different locations in the vicinity of the filament.  Not until the third and final flare did the release lead to the unambiguous ejection of the filament.  Our principal conclusion is that magnetic fields surrounding filaments generally have sufficient complexity to release energy in discrete stages.  This conclusion is consistent with that reported by the Helio Research group concerning the build-up to eruptive solar events.  (See their report.)  Figure caption:  Images from the Dutch Open Telescope obtained on 13 July 2010 using an H-alpha filter.  The left images shows a flare (white feature) occurring in the vicinity of a filament at 8:32 universal time.  A short filament segment (dark gray feature) can be seen just below the flare.  The right image shows a much stronger flare occurring in adjacent regions two and half hours later.  By this time the short filament segment has disappeared.
