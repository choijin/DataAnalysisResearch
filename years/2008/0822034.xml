<AbstractNarration>The purpose of Project Delta is two-fold. One, the PI proposes to extend an existing library of seventeen interacting CDROM digital learning environments on numbers and operations by adding an algebra strand. Two, the PI proposes to evaluate the impact of the new algebra materials on teacher development. Each of the digital environments features classroom sessions that allow for exploration of a mathematics topic, children learning over time, and teachers? instructional techniques. The project's research effort addresses the following questions: What is the impact of Project Delta experiences on elementary teachers? content knowledge, general pedagogy, and pedagogical content knowledge? What is the impact of Project Delta experiences on elementary teachers? practices, including the use of their knowledge in planning for and enacting algebra lessons? Three groups of 60 teachers participate in the study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project DELTA aimed to create digital video and interactive environment materials on Early Algebra that allow for the examining of children at work, opportunities to look at student development over time, and analysis of the teacherÆs decision-making. To that effect, DELTA project developed digital professional development materials aligned with two instructional units in the Contexts for Learning Mathematics series (Fosnot et. al. 2007) &ndash; Trades, Jumps and Stops (grades 2-3) and The California Frog Jumping Contest (grades 4-6).

The digital professional development materials were designed either to be integrated directly into facilitated pre-service or in-service teacher education experiences, or to be used as stand-alone professional development experiences by teacher groups or individuals.  These multimedia and professional development materials were published and have seen been used extensively in workshops nationally.  Additionally, the project aimed to research the effect of these digital professional development materials. The projectÆs research component aimed to study the impact of these two different types of use of the materials on elementary grade teachersÆ algebra content knowledge, knowledge and use of instructional pedagogies, and instructional practice. In particular, the DELTA project research was designed to investigate the efficacy of the DELTA professional development materials when teachers in grades 2-6 engage with them in different formats.  One group of teachers attended a week-long facilitated institute that addressed a Contexts for Learning Mathematics instructional unit.  A second group of teachers had stand-alone, self-guided experiences using a DVD with video and targeted prompts addressing a Contexts for Learning Mathematics instructional unit.   One important finding is that all participants, in all three groups showed significant growth over time in content and in pedagogical content knowledge. However, teachers improved in different ways, depending the experiences they had.  Overall, project DELTA materials are being used extensively nationally and teachers are learning from these materials. Several manuscripts have been submitted for publication detailing the outcomes of the efficacy study.       Last Modified: 10/09/2014       Submitted by: Despina A Stylianou]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
