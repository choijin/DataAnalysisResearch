<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: EMT/QIS:&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Algorithms and Post-Quantum Cryptography&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cryptography is the basic infrastructural element enabling privacy and &lt;br/&gt;security for electronic transactions.  However, when a large-scale &lt;br/&gt;quantum computer is finally built, it will force us to abandon &lt;br/&gt;established methods of cryptography, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman, &lt;br/&gt;which are in common use today.  The proposed research will further &lt;br/&gt;this line of disruptive quantum algorithmic research; but it also aims &lt;br/&gt;to erect a new framework of secure post-quantum cryptography, in order &lt;br/&gt;to maintain this societally critical infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most attractive approach for salvaging modern cryptography would &lt;br/&gt;be to develop classical cryptosystems for which we have compelling &lt;br/&gt;evidence of security even in the face of quantum adversaries. Recent &lt;br/&gt;work by the PIs and their collaborators has shown that certain &lt;br/&gt;algebraic problems possess hardness properties relevant even for &lt;br/&gt;quantum algorithms. We propose to strengthen and leverage these &lt;br/&gt;results in order to develop cryptographic schemes which can be carried &lt;br/&gt;out by today's computers, but which will remain secure even against &lt;br/&gt;quantum attack in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In tandem with this effort, we propose to develop new quantum &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for breaking cryptosystems based on conjugacy in the braid &lt;br/&gt;group.  This is one of the few remaining classical cryptosystems which &lt;br/&gt;has not already been shown to be vulnerable to quantum attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research program is also directly integrated with graduate student &lt;br/&gt;training at all four institutions, undergraduate educational &lt;br/&gt;innovation, educational outreach, and broad scientific dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
