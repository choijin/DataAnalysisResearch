<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The Louisiana State Museum and Tulane University/Xavier University Center for Bioenvironmental Research and the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography, along with several other research collaborators, designers, evaluators, and the Times-Picayune newspaper are partnering to develop a multi-pronged approach on educating the general public, school children, teachers and public officials on the STEM-related aspects of Hurricane Katrina and its implications for the future of New Orleans and other parts of the country. The major products will be an 8,500 square-foot semi-permanent exhibit, smaller exhibits for Louisiana regional libraries, a comprehensive Web site on hurricanes, a set of studies on informal learning, a case study for public officials about the relevance of science research to policy and planning, teacher workshops, and a workshop for interested exhibit designers from around the country.&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the field of informal science education by exploring how museums, universities, and their communities can work together to provide meaningful learning experiences on STEM topics that are critical to solving important community and national issues.</AbstractNarration>

Though terrifying and disruptive, Hurricane Katrina presented a unique and powerful learning experience.

The website and its associated educational resources contain content tailored for specific audiences, including K-16 educators and students, the general public, policymakers, and the media.

While many hurricane websites exist, most target specific aspects of an agencyÆs work. Hurricane scientists acknowledge the need for a website that serves the broader public and educators.

In 2013 the number of visits is approximately double that for the same time period in 2012.     In addition to the development and advancement of the HSS website and its educational resources, the HSS Team has also provided professional development to formal and informal educators through various institutes, national and international conferences, and other opportunities, as well as engage 5th grade classrooms along the U.S. Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Gulf Coasts.  The HSS Team has planned, coordinated, and hosted two webinar series.  The first webinar series was hosted in partnership with the National Hurricane Center (NHC), American Meteorological Society (AMS), Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  These webinars were geared toward informal science educators, instructors of high school, instructors of undergraduate level courses, other educators, policy makers, emergency management officials, and members of the interested public.  Each webinar in this series was designed to provide educators with an opportunity to "meet" some of the top hurricane forecasters and scientists in the country, while learning about their research and being introduced to a range of hurricane related topics.  There were 308 participants in the 5-part, 2012 webinar series and 150 participants in the 3-part, 2013 series, with many participants attending multiple webinars in each series. Participants were from 26 U.S. states.  In post-webinar surveys, participants highly rated the educational value of the webinars, indicated that the webinars met or exceeded their expectations, and most stated they would participate in an HSS web...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
