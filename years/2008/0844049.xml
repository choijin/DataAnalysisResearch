<AbstractNarration>Institution:  Social Science Research Council&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Adrian DeWind&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Capacity Building for International Social Science Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With NSF support, the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) will broaden participation and enhance the capacity of social scientists to contribute to international research, particularly in countries with emerging and transitional economies.  SSRC will organize a meeting to build on earlier international consultations of the SSRC, the International Social Science Council and its Committee on Developing and Transition Economies that have linked social scientists and national funding agencies in advancing the social sciences internationally.  The meeting will advance previous efforts by producing a report that will:&lt;br/&gt;o Identify topics for international research&lt;br/&gt;o Clarify approaches to capacity building;&lt;br/&gt;o Map successful programs; &lt;br/&gt;o Design programs and mobilize resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Capacity building for international social science is an important topic that addresses a critical issue in social science research.  Issues related to comparative and integrated modes of international social science research are addressed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity involves collaborations with emerging and transitional economies to develop international research in social science.  Efforts to build capacity globally with regard to international research are especially needed in today's complex society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
