<AbstractNarration>This team will extend their DEEP2 spectroscopic survey, using high dispersion spectra with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph at the Keck telescopes for galaxies in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. This redshift range represents 85% of cosmic history, over the time when most of the galaxy mass was assembled and galaxies formed their disks. The new DEEP3 survey concentrates on the extended Groth strip, an area on the sky that has been observed with many of NASA's great observatories. The team will use these and other archives to compile a panchromatic catalog describing their survey galaxies over a wide wavelength range from radio to X-rays. DEEP3 will push the limit of observations 2.5 times fainter than DEEP2, tripling the number of measured galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will estimate the rate at which their survey galaxies are forming their stars, by measuring their brightness in the ultraviolet, infrared and radio, and by using diagnostics based on the optical emission lines measured in the DEEP2 and DEEP3 surveys. They will investigate a tight relation found in DEEP2 between the rate of star formation in a galaxy and the mass in stars already present, and examine how galaxy environment and morphology affect that relation. Team members will use observations from the DEEP2 and DEEP3 surveys to study how scaling laws such as the Tully-Fisher relation (between a galaxy's luminosity and its circular rotation speed) change over time as disk galaxies are assembled. They will investigate the role of active galactic nuclei in star formation, and use X-ray observations to search for signs of faint hidden active nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained as they participate in the research. As has been done for the earlier DEEP2 survey, data including redshifts, photometry, and spectra would be released to the astronomical community. Multiwavelength images from DEEP2, along with an interactive redshift catalog, are already available on google sky; more data will be added as the new survey proceeds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit: Key outcomes of this funding have included:  - The completion of a detailed paper describing the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, which remains the largest investigation to date on the Keck Telescopes, providing measures of distance and galaxy properties for tens of thousands of galaxies looking back to just a few billion years after the Big Bang;  - The completion of the DEEP3 Galaxy Redshift Survey, which produced more detailed measurements of the properties of well over 10,000 galaxies.  DEEP3 has filled in more details of the DEEP2 map of the distant universe in the Extended Groth Strip, a region of sky where considerable data from every possible space telescope has been assembled, providing a wide variety of constraints on the development of galaxies;  - Contributions to a wide variety of science papers making use of data from DEEP2, DEEP3, and AEGIS (the broader Extended Groth Strip survey);  - Improved determinations of the total mass in stars and the rate of formation of new stars of the Milky Way Galaxy, which contains our solar system. These are key parameters for studying the development of our Galaxy;  - A variety of measurements of the total energy output and color of our Galaxy as would be measured from outside of it, enabling much improved comparisons of our own Galaxy to external objects.  These measurements were obtained by identifying galaxies with similar mass and star formation history to our Galaxy.  If we make Copernicus? assumption that we should not live in a special place in the Universe, one of those Milky Way Analog galaxies must also match the color and brightness of our own enabling these improved measurements;  - Improved determinations of the rate at which the density of our Galaxy?s disk of stars falls as one moves away from the Milky Way?s center.  This is a key parameter for describing the dominant stellar component of a spiral galaxy;  - Investigation of how the Milky Way compares to the relations seen in other spiral galaxies amongst their energy output (or mass), rotation speed, and disk size.  We have found that the Milky Way has a rotation speed matching expectations for its mass, but its disk is compact by almost a factor of two compared to the typical value for a galaxy of its mass or rotation speed; it is further from the core relation than 90% of spiral galaxies.  This anomaly may be connected to the relative paucity of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way which has been previously noted.        Broader Impacts: This work engaged several graduate students, a number of undergraduates, and one postdoc in forefront astronomical research; the majority of the undergraduates and the postdoc were women.

The work on the color of the Milky Way funded by this grant had an extremely wide impact. It was the subject of an American Astronomical Society press release. The idea that the Milky Way taken as a whole is truly ?white as snow? received press around the globe; for instance, it was the most viewed story at BBC News (the highest-traffic news website in the world) that day.
