<AbstractNarration>The Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA) addresses critical questions in nuclear astrophysics associated with stellar and explosive nucleosynthesis processes. The initial five years of funding for JINA catalyzed the development of new avenues for communication and collaboration between different science communities at the interface of nuclear physics, astrophysics, and astronomy, thus enhancing the discovery potential in nuclear physics as the engine of astrophysical and cosmo-chemical phenomena.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Within this second funding period JINA seeks to address unsolved or new questions in nuclear astrophysics within its unique interdisciplinary environment. The scientific focus has shifted, reflecting past achievements and rapid developments in the field, covering nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution, novae and type Ia supernovae, and the physics of neutron stars. JINA will coordinate the efforts through attracting experts and expertise to (1) move beyond the traditional approach of studying separately singular nucleosynthesis reactions and processes by considering them in the whole concept of Galactic chemical evolution, (2) consider accreting binary white dwarf systems over the entire range of accretion rates from slow (type Ia) to fast accretion (novae), and (3) follow the fate of matter on accreting neutron stars through the entire process, translating the results into observable signatures for the astronomer.  As a center, JINA will be able to take advantage of new synergies in technical and computational developments by sharing expertise and manpower for developing or using new equipment or techniques. Through its involvement in Sloan Digital Sky Survey program SDSS-II and other observational programs JINA is in a key position to participate and influence future major observational programs of relevance for the field. In addition, JINA will draw on a range of theory and modeling expertise to address the specific problems of relevance for all three major research activities, thus enhancing connections between nuclear physics and astrophysical observations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;JINA has created a unique educational environment for students, postdocs, and young faculty, and generated new ways and opportunities for outreach to K-12 students and to the general public and will build upon this past success. The physics and the concept of JINA have attracted a large number of new graduate students at all participating institutions. JINA has invested considerable effort in developing a broad outreach program that triggers scientific interests in students from elementary school to college level. This includes "From Art to Science", a program which seeks to inspire interest in science in elementary school children. The PAN and PIXE-PAN programs are very successful in exposing high school students and teachers to nuclear astrophysics research and will be further developed. JINA also has emerged as a forum for the entire nuclear astrophysics community worldwide and will continue to play an important role in setting goals, facilitating the discussion of priorities and information exchange across field boundaries, and forming interdisciplinary collaborations to address the multitude of scientific questions.</AbstractNarration>

The identification and study of solar neutron sources for s-process nucleosynthesis during the stellar evolution phases associated with helium and carbon burning of stars  The study of nuclear reactions associated with the p-process for probing the nuclear physics parameters used for the statistical model-based prediction of p=process reaction rates The identification of the origins of characteristic galactic radioactivities observed by gamma ray observatories in explosive stellar environments The study of masses and decay characteristics of r-process isotopes  The mapping of the &alpha;p-process for analyzing the peak-structure of XRB light curves The fate of matter on accreting neutron stars and the neutronization of rp-process abundances in the neutron star crust   These projects have been attempted in close collaboration between nuclear physics experimentalists and theorists, astrophysics theorists and modelers, as well as astronomers using a wide variety of experimental and theoretical tools and methods.
