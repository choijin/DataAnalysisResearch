<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Bruce S. Hudson of Syracuse University will investigate the nature of hydrogen bonding, with specific focus on the changes in molecular zero point energies and crystal phase changes that accompany hydrogen-deuterium exchange processes. The major experimental techniques used are vibrational inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The INS data will be collected at ISIS facility in the United Kingdom and the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling methods will be used to compute the INS vibrational spectra.  DFT and other quantum chemical methods will be used to compute the effect of D substitution on 1H and 13C NMR spectra. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this study is to establish the limits of validity of theoretical descriptions of hydrogen bonding in the organic solid state. This is a necessary condition for the rational design of nanostructured materials, nonlinear optical materials and organic electronic devices, for the control of polymorphism in pharmaceuticals and in predicting the structures of globular proteins or designing inhibitors of their function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students participate in this research, as well as postdoctoral research associates. The research will lead to the development of fundamentals of hydrogen bond interaction in self-assembling organic structures, which are the most important structure-specific interactions that are in reversible equilibrium at room temperature under ambient conditions and thus useful for self-assembly. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             The heavy isotope of hydrogen (H) known as deuterium (D) has the same chemistry as that of hydrogen.  Replacement of H by D is generally regarded as having no effect on the properties of a molecule.  Deuterium is used as a stable label in studies of chemical reaction including enzymes. Replacement of H by D results in changes in structure that are very small, often too small to measure.  In a classical picture of molecular structure the atoms sit at the equilibrium positions which are the minima of the potential energy and so no changes occur with a change in atomic mass.  The small changes that are seen are due to the quantum mechanical zero point level, due to the finite momentum of localized particles that gives rise to a zero-point energy in the absence of any thermal energy. At room temperature the most populated vibrational level is the lowest level, the zero point level.              Our research involves several aspects of the energy and the probability distribution of the zero point level of molecules, the unavoidable quantum aspect of matter that results in differences in quantum and classical predictions. Some of these effects involve perturbations due to isotopic substitutions. Others are a change in the way we think about molecular structure.  In the usual view a molecular structure corresponds atomic positions that minimize the energy.  In some cases, however, the zero point level results in an averaging of two minima.              H and D in a molecule may be non-exchangeable (when attached to C) or exchangeable (for H or D attached to oxygen or nitrogen atoms). These exchangeable H or D are usually involved in hydrogen bonds either to other molecules of the same type in crystals or to solvents that dissolve them. Hydrogen bonds, sharing an H between two atoms such as the N-H  O=C H-bond of peptides, are important in biological structures and to the stability of molecular crystals. When an OH or NH group forms a hydrogen bond the OH or NH stretching vibrational frequency decreases in frequency and the zero point energy decreases.               One aspect of our studies is understanding the relative energies of two forms of the same crystalline material called polymorphs. These are very often differences in the hydrogen bonding pattern. This is of importance to the more general issue of designing crystals that have specific macroscopic properties such as non-linear optical activity and is an important problem in the pharmaceutical industry. We have found that the relative energy of polymorphic forms is sometimes changed when the material in question is "exchange deuterated", i.e., all of the OH and NH groups become OD and ND groups when the material is crystallized for a deuterated solvent like D2O, heavy water.  We can compute this effect using quantum mechanical methods. We also investigate the small changes in the internal structure and the properties of a molecule when it forms a hydrogen bond. This is relevant to how protein molecules are stabilized by hydrogen bonding even though they are in an aqueous medium that can form hydrogen bonds of similar energy.              Our studies of the effect of replacing one CH bond in a compound by a CD bond is aimed at understanding at a quantitative level why the NMR chemical shifts of nearby 13C resonances change and how that depends on where the D is in the molecule. This is important because proteins containing CD groups are being used to investigate protein structure.  We are testing our calculations with new experiments.              In classical mechanics "the structure" of a molecule, i.e., the relative position of the atoms, is given by that of minimum energy. In some case there are two equivalent minima. If these minima are equivalent by symmetry then there may be a higher symmetry, higher energy structure. In that case it is possible that the zero point level is above the barrier and the most probably geometry may be symmetric. We have shown tha...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
