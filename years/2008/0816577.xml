<AbstractNarration>Coastal ecosystems are experiencing changes in nutrient loading and species composition much higher than previously measured, undoubtedly affecting productivity and sustainability of coastal regions. Predicting the impacts of these changes is important in salt marshes because marshes are among the most biologically productive areas in the world and provide critical ecosystem services, such as nursery areas for fisheries, removal of nitrogen, and shoreline storm buffering.  This project addresses a critical question: What are the effects of increased nutrients and species change on ecosystem services provided by salt marsh ecosystems? The project is the first to use whole-ecosystem experiments that alter nutrient loading and reduce fish populations to understand the effects on nutrient cycling, species diversity, food webs and the long-term sustainability of salt marshes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The damage by Hurricane Katrina due to degradation of coastal wetlands is one example of the importance of salt marshes to society. A growing appreciation of this role for marshes has led to estuaries becoming the focus of large-scale restoration programs. This project will provide information essential for developing water quality standards and  providing perspective for multi-million dollar coastal management decisions, such as construction of sewage treatment facilities, regulation of fishing, or rebuilding of lost marshes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Saltmarsh food webs are complex and highly interconnected, and many benthic and nektonic marsh residents rely on some combination of locally produced benthic algae, phytoplankton and/or macrophyte detritus as basal food resources.  The influence of nutrient enrichment associated with cultural eutrophication on these food webs is of interest because salt marshes sequester nutrients, removing them from coastal ecosystems.  Elevated nutrient concentrations in salt marshes may cause a bottom-up response in the food web.  A bottom-up response begins with increased primary production that in turn leads to increases in grazing on primary producers and, ultimately, in the population abundance of consumer species.  This increased use of saltmarsh resources may slow the outward signs of eutrophication (such as algal blooms that reduce oxygen concentrations during decomposition) and increase the secondary productivity of estuarine-dependent species such as striped bass.  I focused on two elements of the benthic food chain (sediment-dwelling invertebrates and an abundant omnivorous fish species, the mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus) to ask how nutrient enrichment affects the abundance and growth of consumers and the consumption of benthic food resources.  I also asked if saltmarsh grazers controlled the response of benthic algae to nutrient enrichment by the direct consumption of algae.  This research was done in the 6th year of enrichment of the TIDE project, which fertilized experimental creeks near Plum Island, Massachusetts for entire growing seasons.  First, the response of sediment-dwelling infauna and epifauna to nutrient enrichment was examined.  Benthic invertebrate diets were quantified by the use of natural abundance stable isotope composition and in a dual isotope enrichment experiment.  Per capita and whole-community grazing rates on bacteria and benthic algae were estimated.  Small infauna (nematodes, copepods, ostracods, and foraminifera), the epifaunal snails Melampus bidentatus, Nassarius obsoleta and Hydrobia spp. and the epifaunal amphipod Orchestia grillus were studied because they constitute the majority of benthic grazers.  Although neither the abundance nor community structure of infauna differed among reference and nutrient-enriched creeks, the density of epifauna was 2-4 times higher with nutrient enrichment.  Overall, epifauna consumed about 3-10 x more benthic algae than infauna, and the importance of benthic algae in the diet of benthic invertebrates increased with nutrient enrichment.  The fraction of the total benthic algae grazed under conditions of nutrient enrichment increased largely because of increases in the population abundance of epifauna.  In addition, several infaunal taxa experienced higher per capita ingestion rates of benthic algae in fertilized creeks.  As a result, the fraction of benthic algal biomass grazed daily increased by 235% with nutrient enrichment.  Second, variation in abundance, biomass, body size, growth rate, and resource utilization in mummichogs was linked to nutrient enrichment.  Mummichogs were marked and released in nutrient-enriched (n = 3733 fish) and reference (n = 3894 fish) creeks and recaptured over two months.  Abundance (by 37%), biomass (58%), body size (8%), and herbivory (115%, measured as photosynthetic gut pigment content) on benthic algae were increased in nutrient-enriched creeks.  However, individual growth rates were 43% lower in nutrient-enriched creeks.  Nutrient enrichment stimulated primary production causing a bottom-up enrichment of the food web, which fostered an increased mummichog biomass and body size.  However, the reduction in mummichog growth rate indicates negative impacts from long-term nutrient enrichment, perhaps due to intraspecific competition associated with increased biomass, behavioral changes in mummichogs, changes in diet, or a decline in habitat quality associated with the loss of low marsh, tall Spartina alterniflora habitat.
