<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 0851519&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Narasimhan, Balaji&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three year renewal REU site program at Iowa State University (ISU) will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to do hands-on research focused on two research themes: 1) Biological Materials and Biological Processes. The students will be active members of interdisciplinary groups and will interact with faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and industry.  Some of the students will also participate in an international research experience at the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), Mexico, which will build on an existing partnership with ISU, and provide students with valuable skills in a global environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research experience, a variety of enrichment activities have been incorporated. These include: short courses, joint seminars/meetings, workshops, tours of research facilities, and field trips.  At the end of the program, the students will participate in a joint poster symposium together with students from other ISU undergraduate programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A talented and diverse group of students will be recruited, with special efforts made to attract women and minorities.  The experience some students will get working in a global environment will evolve from dependent to independent status and will enable them to walk away with life-long skills that will impact their contributions to science and engineering and to society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
