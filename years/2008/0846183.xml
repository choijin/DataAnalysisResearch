<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives of this project are to elucidate the mechanisms and importance of nocturnal nitrogen oxide chemistry in the polluted marine boundary layer (MBL) and rural forests via field observations, laboratory studies, and modeling.  Simultaneous, in situ, measurements of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) concentrations will be made during two MBL field campaigns to develop a detailed understanding of ClNO2 production by N2O5, with special attention paid to ship plume chemistry.  In these MBL campaigns, and in an additional campaign in a rural California pine forest, a newly developed, field-deployable apparatus will provide the first direct in situ measurements of N2O5 and NO3 reactivity.  Detailed gas-aerosol chemistry box modeling will be performed to test hypotheses of ClNO2 production mechanisms, and to explore the impacts of this chlorine atom source on the chemistry of coastal and remote marine regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational plan aims to inspire and engage University of Washington (UW) undergraduates, Native American high school students, and K-12 teachers in the appreciation and practice of Earth system science.  A campaign will take place on Makah tribal lands adjacent to Olympic National Park, in which Makah high school seniors will be partnered with UW undergraduates in the collection and analysis of Puget Sound ship traffic and its connection to air quality.  The data will be integrated into inquiry-based analysis exercises for two undergraduate-level atmospheric chemistry courses.  The principal investigator will also work with the Olympic Park Institute to develop curriculum materials for use in their K-12 teacher training programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project had two major goals.
