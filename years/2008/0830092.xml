<AbstractNarration>The prevalence of advanced computing technology has resulted in&lt;br/&gt;&gt; increasingly complex simulation models of manufacturing,&lt;br/&gt;&gt; telecommunication, logistic, transportation, supply chain and other&lt;br/&gt;&gt; engineering systems. Such models often lack mathematical properties&lt;br/&gt;&gt; that have traditionally been essential to the development of efficient&lt;br/&gt;&gt; computational procedures for determining an optimal system design.&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Consequently, the need arises to develop new optimization algorithms&lt;br/&gt;&gt; that remain efficient even in the absence of simplifying mathematical&lt;br/&gt;&gt; structures. This research investigates the analytical and practical&lt;br/&gt;&gt; potential of computationally efficient variants of Fictitious Play&lt;br/&gt;&gt; (FP), an iterative technique from the mathematical theory of learning,&lt;br/&gt;&gt; as an optimization paradigm to achieve this goal.&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; The key idea is to model the optimization problem as a game of common&lt;br/&gt;&gt; interest between artificial "players" that correspond to components of&lt;br/&gt;&gt; a carefully chosen partition of the design variables. The shared&lt;br/&gt;&gt; interest of these players is to optimize the metric of system&lt;br/&gt;&gt; performance. Theoretical justification for this approach is rooted in&lt;br/&gt;&gt; the well-known fact that for games of common interest, limit points of&lt;br/&gt;&gt; FP are Nash equilibria and thus may be viewed as a type of local&lt;br/&gt;&gt; optimum. The research builds on the investigators' earlier work on&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Sampled Fictitious Play (SFP), a modification that replaces the&lt;br/&gt;&gt; exceptionally demanding expected utility calculations in FP with their&lt;br/&gt;&gt; sampled approximations while still preserving FP's theoretical&lt;br/&gt;&gt; properties. The work will culminate in a powerful and rigorous suite&lt;br/&gt;&gt; of algorithms the investigators term Approximate Fictitious Play&lt;br/&gt;&gt; (AFP), where the "players" interact with one another by calculating a&lt;br/&gt;&gt; best response to a sample of strategies independently and adaptively&lt;br/&gt;&gt; chosen from a probability distribution over their history of past best&lt;br/&gt;&gt; responses. A major computational benefit of AFP is that the best&lt;br/&gt;&gt; response subproblems are embedded in and significantly smaller than&lt;br/&gt;&gt; the original optimization problem, leading to a dramatic increase in&lt;br/&gt;&gt; efficiency compared to finding jointly optimal strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Traditionally, simulation models of complex systems have been employed&lt;br/&gt;&gt; as descriptive tools to test "rule-of-thumb" alternatives suggested by&lt;br/&gt;&gt; a knowledgeable user. The AFP paradigm promises to make these models&lt;br/&gt;&gt; prescriptive as its convergence and optimality properties do not rely&lt;br/&gt;&gt; on regularity conditions that such systems and models are unlikely to&lt;br/&gt;&gt; exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
