<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds for the base support for the Utah Cosmic Ray group that serves as host to the Telescope Array (TA) experiment. TA is a large international endeavor, located in central Utah near the town of Delta, aimed at the study of Ultra?High Energy Cosmic Rays. The High Resolution Fly?s Eye (HiRes), the previous successful enterprise of this group, has observed the long anticipated GZK cut?off in the spectrum due to interactions with the microwave background. The first data from the Auger Observatory now appear to confirm this. However, the sources of the highest energy particles and questions about how they are accelerated in the first place are among the most important topics in particle astrophysics today. One suspected source is Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) which are among the most energetic objects known in the Universe. There are tantalizing hints of correlations with BL Lac objects which are AGNs with their jets pointed towards us. The TA experiment draws on the highly successful experience of HiRes and utilizes fluorescence telescopes, a technique developed by the Utah group. TA is a hybrid experiment with the world?s largest surface scintillator array measuring the footprint of the extensive air shower when it reaches the Earth and with multiple fluorescence telescope observatories measuring the shower in the space above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After commissioning finishes later this year, TA will be the most sensitive cosmic ray detector in the Northern Hemisphere. This group plans to continue their activities in support of detector installation, commissioning and operation. With extensive experience with HiRes, the group is also taking a lead role in the analysis of TA data, especially the fluorescence analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASPIRE is the Astrophysics Science Project Integrating Research and Education. Since 1997, ASPIRE has been creating some of the Web?s most engaging and interactive science lessons and labs and provides direct outreach to area teachers, students, and the public. Efforts include providing outreach and support to local groups, running summer workshop sessions for students, and visits to rural schools such as those in Millard and Delta, UT. As an outreach program, ASPIRE has been able to effectively and affordably have a great impact for a number of students and educators.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report  Baseline Support of the University of Utah Cosmic Ray Physics Group (including the Telescope Array)  NSF Award PHY-0848320  Pierre Sokolsky, Charles Jui, and John N. Matthews   University of Utah, Department of Physics and Astronomy  High Energy Astrophysics Institute     Intellectual Merit   This grant funded experimental research studying the physics of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays with two experiments located in the west desert of Utah, the High Resolution FlyÆs Eye (HiRes) and Telescope Array (TA) experiments.  The aim of the research is to understand what ultra high energy cosmic rays are, where they come from, and how they are accelerated.  The ultra high energy regime covers approximately 1x1018 eV &lt; E &lt; 3x1020 eV. Ultra high energy cosmic rays are the most energetic particles in the universe, and the highest energy cosmic ray ever observed had the enormous energy of 51 Joules, the energy of a well-pitched fast ball, all concentrated in a single elementary particle.  (Whereas the baseball is composed many, many lower energy particles)  The highest energy cosmic rays are quite rare, arriving at the Earth at a rate of about one per square kilometer per century.  In order to make a measurement in a reasonable amount of time, very large experiments are needed to observe these events.  HiRes (which concluded in this grant period) and TA (its successor) are the largest such experiments in the northern hemisphere.       There is a theoretical upper limit to the energy of a cosmic ray, called the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff, which is caused by interactions of cosmic rays with photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation.  Our group and others in the HiRes experiment made the first experimental observation of the cutoff (nearly 40 years after it was first predicted).  This observation has been confirmed by additional work done by our group in the TA experiment and another experiment based in Argentina.       Modern cosmic ray experiments use two detector techniques:  observing air shower particles using arrays of particle detectors deployed on the surface, and observing the nitrogen fluorescence light emitted as cosmic ray air showers propagate through the atmosphere and excite the gas molecules.  TA has both kinds of detectors, and is engaged in developing the experimental techniques necessary for better understanding the data which we collect with them.  We made a major breakthrough in the analysis techniques of surface array data.  All such analyses involve making a simulation of the data by the Monte  Carlo technique, and until now simulating air showers has been very inaccurate due to the enormous amount of computer time necessary.  The main approximation technique used, called "thinning", has been inadequate for the needs of experiments.  Our group has solved this problem by inventing a technique we call "dethinning" which restores the information lost in this approximation.  This has allowed us to perform an analysis of TA surface detector data that is of unprecedented accuracy.  Our data is now being used to measure the spectrum of cosmic rays and to search for anisotropy in their pointing directions.
