    <AbstractNarration>This award will support Dr. Mihir Sen and an undergraduate or graduate student of the University of Notre Dame (UND) in two planning visits to Drs. Francisco Gonzalez and Ricardo Romero-Mendez of the Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi (UASLP, Mexico. The objective of the proposed visits is to plan research and train students to advance current understanding of heat transport in biological tissue. Ultimately, the collaborators aim to develop a mathematical model and computer code with potential application to the analysis of a whole range of phenomena that exhibit a thermal signature at tissue surfaces. These applications, for example, are bound to be important in the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of burn victims. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed collaboration will join the strengths of the bio-engineering group at UND in bio-heat transfer, with the expertise at the Mexican UASLP in thermal therapies. Students from both institutions, graduate and undergraduate, will participate in the proposed research. In addition, the collaborators will incorporate the research into new and existing courses at the UND and at UASLP.</AbstractNarration>
