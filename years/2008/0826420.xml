<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop a mathematical framework that will support the design of high performance, robust MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) resonators. The primary focus of the research is on developing methods to design resonator structures with high Quality factors (Q-factors, the most critical design parameter for the performance of MEMS resonators), and reduce the effect of fabrication uncertainties on performance variations. The research approach is to construct stochastic design optimization upon the numerical models of Q-factors and collected test data on MEMS resonator samples. The validity of the resulting design framework will be demonstrated using MEMS gyroscopes. By building a design framework that combines numerical models of Q-factors, design optimization, and testing data, this research will result in methods to achieve design solutions to MEMS resonators with high Q-factors and design robustness, without the need for trial-and-error cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide a framework for designing high performance MEMS resonators. These resonators have widespread civilian and military uses including integrated sensory and wireless communication microsystems, sensing devices, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and consumer/military electronics. Producing MEMS resonators which are robust to fabrication uncertainties has the potential to improve US security and the ability of the US to remain competitive in microsystem design. Based on this research, a K-12 outreach plan will be carried out which includes research projects, an education module for summer camps for local high school students, and field-trips for local elementary school students. Both undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups will be brought into the research, through collaborations with Norfolk State University, an HBCU institution in the same city as Old Dominion University (ODU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
