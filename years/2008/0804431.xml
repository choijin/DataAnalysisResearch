<AbstractNarration>Torquato&lt;br/&gt;0804431&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleagues study a variety of&lt;br/&gt;packing problems.  The following five general areas are explored:&lt;br/&gt;(1) identification and characterization of dense packings of&lt;br/&gt;nonspherical particles for a wide class shapes in two and three&lt;br/&gt;space dimensions; (2) study of sphere packings of maximal density&lt;br/&gt;in high Euclidean dimensions; (3) identification of low-density&lt;br/&gt;jammed sphere packings in various dimensions; (4) studies of&lt;br/&gt;jamming on the unit sphere in arbitrary dimensions; and (5)&lt;br/&gt;pursuit of improved order metrics to characterize the degree of&lt;br/&gt;randomness in a packing.  Important scientific advances and&lt;br/&gt;outcomes are likely to emerge from the proposed research.  This&lt;br/&gt;very multidisciplinary project joins the applied mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;statistical and condensed-matter physics, materials science,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and pure mathematics communities.  Unifying these&lt;br/&gt;different perspectives and goals is a challenging task, but one&lt;br/&gt;that offers great rewards to the scientific community in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Packing problems, such as how densely solid objects fill&lt;br/&gt;space, have fascinated people since the dawn of civilization, and&lt;br/&gt;continue to intrigue scientists because of their connection to a&lt;br/&gt;host of problems that arise in the physical sciences,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, engineering, and biology.  While optimal packing&lt;br/&gt;problems are intimately related to solid states of condensed&lt;br/&gt;matter, disordered sphere packings have been employed to model&lt;br/&gt;the glassy state of matter.  Sphere packings in high dimensions&lt;br/&gt;have relevance in communications theory.  The way that viruses&lt;br/&gt;package DNA in protein containers is a packing problem.  What are&lt;br/&gt;the densest packings of spheres in dimension greater than three? &lt;br/&gt;What are the densest packings of nonspherical objects in two and&lt;br/&gt;three dimensions?  Can random packings ever fill space more&lt;br/&gt;densely than ordered packings (implying disordered or "glassy"&lt;br/&gt;ground states)?  Can "randomness" of a packing be quantified in a&lt;br/&gt;meaningful and precise manner?  A greater understanding of&lt;br/&gt;packing problems has implications for the synthesis of novel&lt;br/&gt;materials, our ability to efficiently design communications&lt;br/&gt;channels to send digital signals over large distances, and the&lt;br/&gt;design of new drugs, just to mention a few examples.</AbstractNarration>
