<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in nanotechnology have discovered that some materials behave differently on a very small scale.  For example, smaller objects are easier to break than larger objects; but small pieces of plastic less than 100 nanometers thick are even easier to break than would be expected by extrapolating from what we know about thicker pieces of plastic.  Plastics are amorphous materials, similar to window glass, and now it is known that many glassy materials behave differently in small enough samples.  However, some become stronger and some become weaker.  This individual investigator award supports experiments to study a model system of small plastic particles in a liquid, which behaves analogously to a glass when the particle concentration is increased.  The experiments will use a microscope to view the motion of the particles and see how this motion changes when the sample is confined between two closely spaced parallel glass plates.  In this way, how the system depends on the spacing between the plates will be directly observed.  This research is important for future nanotechnology applications that rely on tiny structures built out of glassy materials such as plastic.  This project provides training and education for both undergraduate and graduate students.  Additionally, the laboratory will conduct at least one field trip each year for groups of high school school students.  These field trips give students hands-on laboratory experiences, and the visual nature of microscopy makes it easy to get students excited about their visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;The glass transitions of polymer glasses and molecular glasses are usually studied in the context of macroscopically large systems.  However, confining samples so that one or more dimensions are microscopic typically changes the behavior of the sample, for example changing the temperature at which the sample becomes a glass.  This individual investigator award supports a project to study a colloidal suspension confined in thin sample chambers as a model system for glass transitions in confined geometries.  Colloidal suspensions are composed of microscopic-sized solid particles in a liquid; this system behaves analogous to a glass if the particle concentration is sufficiently high.  Experiments will use confocal microscopy to directly observe the motion of colloidal particles and how this motion changes in confinement.  Understanding the physical effects of confinement on materials is increasingly important today as more and more technology is built at the scale of nanometers.  This project provides training and education for both undergraduate and graduate students.  The laboratory will conduct at least one field trip each year for groups of high school school students.  These field trips give students hands-on laboratory experiences, and the visual nature of the research makes it easy to get students excited about their visit.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Are glasses merely extremely slow liquids? Liquids take on the shape of their container, but a glassy material appears solid.  We study colloidal samples composed of plastic particles in a liquid, a model system which acts like a glass when the particle concentration is increased.  We observe the way these particles pack using 3D images taken with an optical confocal microscope.  Furthermore, these particles can diffuse and rearrange due to Brownian motion, and we can take movies of this using our microscope.  In this way we can study in detail how such samples become glassy as a function of the particle concentration.  By directly observing how particles rearrange, we can learn information about how materials become glassy, in a way that is impossible for molecular glasses such as window glass.     In particular, the work for this grant studied how confinement modifies the glass transition for our model materials.  Confinement means that the samples are studied in very thin sample chambers (for example) that are only big enough to fit a few particles inside.  This is analogous to interesting experiments with polymer glasses and small-molecule glasses:  in the past decade, nanotechnology researchers discovered that some materials behave differently on a very small scale. For example, smaller objects are easier to break than larger objects; but small pieces of plastic less than 100 nanometers thick are even easier to break than would be expected by extrapolating from what we know about thicker pieces of plastic. Plastics are amorphous materials, similar to window glass, and it is now known that many glassy materials behave differently in small enough samples. However, some become stronger and some become weaker.     Our NSF grant supported experiments to study confinement effects using our colloidal samples. The experiments used a microscope to view the motion of the particles and see how this motion changes when the sample is confined between two closely spaced parallel glass plates, or in small glass tubes, or in small droplets (see first image included with this report). The key finding is that materials confined in this way become glassier.  This appears to be due to the influence of the glass walls (or the droplet boundary), as particle motion is even slower and glassier near the walls.  This research is important for future nanotechnology applications that rely on tiny structures built out of glassy materials such as plastic.  For example, our results suggest that perhaps coating such materials with a thin layer of another material may strengthen the tiny structures.     This project provided training and education for two undergraduate students, three graduate students, and two postdoctoral fellows.  The undergraduates are now in graduate school (at Duke and Harvard), the graduate students are now postdoctoral fellows (two at New York University and one at Univ. California &ndash; Santa Barbara), and the two postdoctoral fellows both have permanent jobs (one at the University of Tokyo and the other at Dow Chemicals).     Additionally, our laboratory hosted several field trips each year for visiting students, ranging from first-grade classes to high school honors physics classes.  These field trips gave the visiting students hands-on laboratory experiences:  They played with corn starch and water, which is another example of particles in a liquid which can exhibit glassy behavior.  This is known as "shear thickening."   They conducted simple experiments shaking sand in a beaker, and observing that a heavy ball buried underneath the sand rises to the top when the beaker is shaken.  This is known as the "Brazil nut effect."  The explanation is that when the sand and ball rise up in the air a little, due to the shaking, the small sand grains can fall down and get trapped in small pockets of air underneath the ball.  The ball cannot fit into these pockets, so it gradually gets pushed upward by the sand underneath.  This is s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
