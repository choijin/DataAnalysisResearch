<AbstractNarration>The STEP UP project provides 30 full scholarships total over two years to academically talented, low-income students to obtain associate degrees in a STEM discipline and/or transfer to a STEM baccalaureate degree program at a university. It builds and expands on current and previous San Jacinto-National Science Foundation projects including a successful CSEMS. Results from this previous grant include 55 successful students known as Scholars, and improved student support systems. Of these 55 recipients 71% are from underrepresented populations. As validated in the previous CSEMS, the project continues to provide academic and mentoring so that a minimum of 70% of scholarship recipients maintain or exceed a 2.5 grade point average, and persist until associate degree attainment or transfer to a 4-year program. Once selected, Scholars are supported by pairing each one with a faculty member, an industry mentor, and an upper class student in the same major. Scholars can take advantage of several other successful projects at this institution; for example, the Partnership for Innovation in Biotechnology and Life Sciences, the Upward Bound Program, The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program, and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs. Scholars interested in transferring to a 4-year school are helped with an updated transfer guidebook, and with their applications to the schools. Scholars finishing an associate's degree and who want to find a job, are connected to the Career Planning and Placement Office for help with resumes and also linked with area employers. Features specific to this project, and not part of the original CSEMS, are the student recruitment corps, where students in the program help with recruitment; shared counselors, who act as a link between high school seniors and this project; the expanded cohort approach, where STEP Up Scholars participate in a start of semester orientation that will provide information on the program; and expanded business/industry involvement resulting in more job shadowing and internship opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
