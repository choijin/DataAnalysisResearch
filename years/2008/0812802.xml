<AbstractNarration>This project mainly covers three important research areas under the broad umbrella of climate dynamics by focusing on:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) Seasonal and year-to-year variations in the strength of the tropical upwelling in the Brewer-Dobson circulation. A major goal is to determine whether the annual cycle is forced primarily by variations in the upward flux of wave activity at high latitudes or by seasonal variations in the strength of the equatorial tropospheric planetary waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) 20th century climate variability. Possible foci are (i) drought episodes and/or (ii) the pronounced interdecadal variability of extratropical Northern Hemisphere temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c) Structure and dynamics of intermediate frequency (6-20 day period) variability and the degree to which it is dominated by linear Rossby-wave dynamics versus nonlinear processes such as wave breaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this project will also explore preliminarily a strategy for quantitatively assessing the impact of global warming upon snowpack over the Pacific Northwest that is more robust with respect to sampling fluctuations than conventional analysis of trends in snowpack measurements. The temperature sensitivity of snowpack (i.e., the percentage loss in snowpack per Â°C temperature rise) is evaluated using four different approaches. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This research will serve to promote more robust strategies for assessing the impacts of global warming, more useful measures of the impacts of global warming, understanding of mechanisms responsible for the secular trends in temperature and concentrations of trace constituents in the tropical lower stratosphere, a more definitive attribution of 20th century climate change, and a more sound phenomelogical basis for long range weather prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the potential for improved weather and climate prediction and the training and mentoring of several graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       We have illustrated three different novel approaches to  estimating the impact of global warming upon the depletion of the winter snow pack, using the Cascade mountain range in the Pacific Northwest as an example.  The first involves estimating the loss of snow catchment area as the freezing level rises; the second involves the use of a high resolution hydrologic model that predicts snow accumulation and the third involves the use of daily observations of snow accumulation from a network of automated stations in the Cascades. All three methods yield a decline of 15-20% per degree of warming.      We have shown that the same dominant wintertime teleconnection patterns that emerge in analyses of the geopotential height field can also be recovered in analyses of the wind field at the jet stream level and the envelope of day-to-day pressure variability in the vicinity of the oceanic storm tracks. Our results lend credence to the robustness of these patterns, which are widely used in characterizing year to year and longer term changes in the circulation.  We have discovered several additional patterns in an analysis of the Northern Hemisphere wintertime sea level pressure field over the 20th century.      We have laid the ground work for an improved methodology for estimating the dynamical contribution to surface air temperature trends, thereby providing a more reliable estimate of the warming that is directly attributable to the buildup of greenhouse gases. The "dynamical contribution" denotes that temperature change attributable to changing circulation patterns such as shifts in the amplitude and polarity of ENSO and the annular modes, which would vary from decade to decade even in the absence of human-induced climate change. The methodology that we have developed involves the use of partial least squares (PLS), a linear analysis technique that is widely used in other fields.      We have demonstrated that planetary waves originating at high latitudes of the winter hemisphere and propagating upward into the stratosphere play an important role in forcing week-to-week, month-to-month and winter-to-winter variations in the strength of the so-called "Brewer-Dobson Circulation", which draws tropical tropospheric air upward and poleward, thereby ventilating the stratosphere over a period of a few years. Hence, long term trends in the properties of the planetary waves could play an important role in mediating the chemical makeup of the stratosphere.     Based on analysis of data from NASAÃs CALIPSO Mission, we have shown that the time-varying distribution of subvisible cirrus clouds in the Tropical Tropopause Transition Layer (TTL) above 15 km in altitude is largely controlled, not by detrainment from the anvils of deep convective cloud towers, but by the patterns of ascent and descent in equatorially-trapped planetary waves that develop in response to the deep convection in the layer below. Although the cirrus clouds tend to develop in thin layers with mesoscale horizontal dimensions, the pervasiveness of these clouds, as reflected in the field of optical thickness of the layer of the atmosphere above the 15 km level, varies coherently with space and time in association with ENSO, the annual cycle and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The CALIPSO data reveal clearly the eastward propagating Kelvin wave signature of the MJO, which is also mirrored in the fields of temperature, water vapor, ozone, and carbon monoxide.      We have shown that upper tropospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx), as sensed by the data acquired in NASAÃs Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), exhibits day-to-day variations over the marine continent in association with day-to-day variations in the frequency of lightning as sensed by the ground-based, continuously operating World Wide Lightning Detection Network (WWLLN). Both NOx and lightning are modulated by the MJO, with enhancements of both during the "break phase" when rainfall over the marine continen...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
