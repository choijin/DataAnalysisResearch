<AbstractNarration>For researchers and developers of creativity support tools, online spaces of "user-generated content" (UGC) such as the video-sharing site Youtube.com and the photo-sharing site Flickr.com are of particular interest. These systems are massive, diverse spaces for creative production, interaction, collaboration and appropriation.  This project investigates how specific UGC systems, those we call Creative Content Systems (CCS), are being used by literally millions of people to generate and disseminate their creative products.  A better understanding of the dynamics of participation in such systems would allow us to both design more effective system support for creative activities in future UGC system, as well as providing us with a richer model of IT-enabled creativity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's intellectual merit comes from three contributions.  First, this work will generate enhanced models of creative practice in online communities. Amateur/professional interactions have become increasingly prevalent in online communities and the differences between these populations in creative practice and intended audiences needs to be better understood and supported.  Second, the research will generate and assess design recommendations for next generation creative support technology. Generating a better understanding of the common and distinct factors of amateur and professional creative practice is a necessary precondition for evolving the next generation of support tools for creative individuals and creative communities. Third, this work will generate enhanced knowledge of successful facilitation of amateur activity. Via the design recommendations for next generation CCS design, creative professionals will benefit from knowledge and technology to help them leverage amateur creativity and contribution. Leveraging the success of these systems will lead to broader impacts by encouraging innovation and creativity beyond this project's current participants and systems.  Though this project is set in the context of creative cultural activity, the findings will be more broadly applicable to increasing participation in STEM-related projects that wish to enlist amateur contributions and volunteers.   The results from this study will be disseminated broadly to academic communities including, but not limited to, Creativity and Cognition, CSCW, and CHI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past decade, advancements in Internet and Communication Technologies have given rise to what we call online "Creative Content Systems" (CCS).  These large sociotechnical systems are comprised of and influenced by the motivations and practices of both individual users and communities, as well as the characteristics their tools of creative production and dissemination.  Such systems provide examples of success cases "in the wild" of the types of technological interventions into the human creative process, as promoted by the original goals of this funding initiative.  In our pilot project, we sought to better understand the influence of audience conception, both real and anticipated, on the individual creators participating in CCS.  This was addressed by a multi-phase study, which combined quantitative and qualitative data to direct investigative design.   In Phase 1, we conducted a series of field interviews with 26 individual creators in the domain of digital photography.  These interviews allowed us to develop a conceptual model of the use of digital photos as a flexible resource for communication and reflection, (see http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/86284).  In Phase 2, we utilized these formative interviews as a set of directive constraints for a design research process &ndash; the development, iteration and testing of an interactive online tool which allowed us to model different types of realistic audience conditions in an photography-centered social media site (see  Cook, E. C., Teasley, S. D. (2011). Beyond Promotion and Protection: Creators, Audiences and Common Ground in User-Generated Media. Proceedings of the 2011 iConference. Seattle, WA.; Cook, E. C., Teasley, S. D., Wong, P., Kolasinski, M., Waterman, B. M. (2011, October). WhoÆs There?  Supporting Audience Awareness in Creative Content Systems. Poster presented at ASIS&amp;T. New Orleans, LA, USA.)   Phase 2 involved two undergraduate students supported through a REU supplement who contributed to the design, implementation and evaluation of the interactive online tool.  We evaluated both the efficacy of the design of the interactive tool prototype and the robustness of our conceptual model through two panel surveys.  We utilized a novel approach to contextualization of online survey instruments through the use of the respondentsÆ publically available social media data.  In Phase 3, we evaluated the methodological implications of this survey customization technique.  We found survey conditions, customized for respondents vs. generic content, influenced the level of respondent engagement and affective response. In addition, the lack of context in generic questions indicated a greater cognitive load among respondents. These outcomes suggest new opportunities for tailored survey instruments and methods utilizing publically accessible social media data, which may lead to better system design for tools to support online expressions of creativity.
