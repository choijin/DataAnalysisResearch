<AbstractNarration>The Inland Northwest Community Access Network (TINCAN), the Puget Sound Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology (PSCTLT), and Reel Grrls (a community media center) are partnering to involve 6th and 7th grade middle school girls in science-focused after-school club activities in 10 schools in Seattle and Spokane, Washington. The Science Journalism Pathways to STEM Careers project is engaging girls in science journalism through information and communication technologies (ICT) to investigate and publish information about local science issues of interest to their communities. The ICT focus is video, multimedia, and the Internet. Girls are also conducting hands-on activities and interviewing STEM professionals to learn issue-related science content. The goals of the project are to (1) increase girls' ICT fluency, (2) increase girls' science literacy, (3) increase girls' interest in STEM careers, and (4) increase STEM content in non-science courses taught by social studies teachers who manage the after-school clubs.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual merit: Because students learn best when engaged in authentic tasks, the participating students came to understand that science is not a separate subject to be endured in the classroom, but an integral part of the social context of their community.  The focus on place-based, community science within the science journalism framework allowed learners to bring their prior knowledge and experience to bear on science learning. Learners took what they know about their own world and manipulated that knowledge in developing a film that reflects both prior understandings of science as well as newly acquired understanding of the impact and ubiquity of science in their community. The project provided the opportunity to examine how perceptions of science, individual efficacy in problem solving, and identities as citizen scientists form as they students developed their films.     Broader Impacts: The number of girls pursuing STEM careers continues to lag, with interest typically dropping off in middle school. Research on engaging middle school girls in scientific inquiry indicates that after-school programs often enhance their interest in science, and seems to prevent the middle school decline.  But many after school programs are designed for students who are already interested in science. The SJP project was designed to reach girls who were not necessarily interested in science, by engaging them in scientific explorations through their interests in writing and film. To further support the "science for non-science people", the club leaders in the after school programs were not science teachers, but middle school language arts and social studies teachers.
