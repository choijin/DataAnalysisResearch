<AbstractNarration>Nematode-Bacteria Symbioses Research Coordination Network: Promoting Multidisciplinary Research and Expanding Educational Curricula&lt;br/&gt; (Proposal IOS-0840932)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: S. Patricia Stock, University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: David Bird, North Carolina State University&lt;br/&gt; Elodie Ghedin, Pittsburgh School of Medicine&lt;br/&gt; Heidi Goodrich-Blair, University of Wisconsin Madison &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intimate associations between microbes and 'higher' organisms are widespread in nature, occurring in every type of ecological niche. The interactions in these associations range from highly integrated obligatory symbioses to 'loose' assemblages. Given the importance of microbial symbioses to the functioning  of virtually all earth ecosystems, and to gain insights into fundamental processes underlying symbiosis, researchers in this project will focus on one of the most common microbe-animal interactions: that between nematode worms and bacteria.  Associations between nematodes and bacteria range from fortuitous to obligate and from beneficial to pathogenic. The ubiquity and diversity of nematode-bacterium symbioses make them an excellent model to understand the key questions in symbiosis. However, while scientists worldwide from disciplines as diverse as medicine, agriculture, ecology, and genetics are currently studying associations between these two groups of organisms, they do not interact. To address this critical need for crossing disciplinary lines, the four PIs involved in this project will promote the intellectual discourse among scientists studying bacteria-nematode associations by organizing a Research Coordination Network on 'Nematode-Bacteria Symbioses'.  Specific goals are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Foster interdisciplinary collaborations between scientists;&lt;br/&gt;2) Encourage scientists engaged in basic and applied research to explore how cross-talk and networking can enhance and advance science in this field,&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop and distribute educational materials to scientists and educators to promote the study of nematode-bacteria symbioses as model systems in science and education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no other group in the United States or elsewhere that is similar to the proposed research work group in its broad scope of nematode-bacteria interactions. Investigators leading this network will interact with other societies to disseminate knowledge and dovetail with established meetings. Efforts will be made to include postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduates into this enterprise, along with international colleagues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of  NemaSym Research Coordination Network  was  on the study of nematodes (roundworms) and bacteria which are among the most diverse organisms in the planet.  Specifically, this network's interest was on the different interacions nematodes and bacteria have which are quite diverse ranging from fortuituos to obligatory and from beneficial to antagonistic.  The primary goals of NEMASYM-RCN were: 1) foster growth and advancement of the field of "nematode-bacterium symbioses, 2)build a multidisciplinary forum that will facilitate communication, exchange of ideas, and the establishment of strong links for developing long-term collaborations within this research area,3) promote training of a new cadre of scientists with the skills necessary to fully exploit the advantages of studying nematode-bacterium symbioses, and 4) develop and promote the use of nematode-bacterium symbioses as a tool to educate the broader public and community about basic biological principles.   Through NEMASYM we were able to build research and communication bridges between researchers who had been historicallyseparated by categorization of the nematode-bacterium system they study. Scientists and students of 18 countries participated in activities organized by this network.  NEMASYM RCN reached over 100 undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students giving then the opportuunity to attend and present their research at  various scientific  meetings including the Entomological Society of America Pacific Branch  (Tucson, AZ);Entomological Society of America (Portland, OR), 6th International Federation of Nematologists (Capetown, South Africa; American Microbiology  Society ( Boston, MA) and Society for Invertebrate Pathology (Mainz, Germany, Vancoucver, Canada), Society of Nematologists (Corvallis, OR, Knoxville, TN) International Symbiosis Society (Lisbon, Portugal) meetings.    Furhermore, ths network also gave  students and early career investigators the opportunity to received hand-on- training at various laboratories in USA including those of the PIs and other core-participants.  We also created a  number of teaching tools including videos and other education materials to help promote inclusion of nematode and bacteria into classroom lessons.
