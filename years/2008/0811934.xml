<AbstractNarration>The causal linkages between the use of antibiotics in animals and the spread of antibiotic resistance in humans involve complex ecological processes, including the development of resistance, within- and between-species spread, circulation amongst animal and human populations, and the behavioral and economic conditions that foster or inhibit this circulation and spread. This study will look at the ecology and evolution of the spread of antibiotic resistance in northern coastal Ecuador, where road-building and deforestation are leading to an influx of small-scale poultry farming in rural communities. The study area offers a unique opportunity to investigate the role of the environment in the evolution of antibiotic resistance at the household, village and landscape scales and will draw on our expertise in molecular and microbial ecology, epidemiology, mathematical modeling, and ethnography. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intensive antibiotic usage in animal husbandry is a major contributor to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance worldwide, posing threats to both animal and human health. Understanding the ecological processes involved in the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is crucial in designing effective intervention programs. The research team will include graduate students at the University of Michigan and the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ). There will be training and periodic health education workshops for community health workers, and the sharing of findings with health ministry employees at the local, provincial and national levels in Ecuador.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intensive antibiotic usage in animal husbandry is a major contributor to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance worldwide, posing threats to both animal and human health.  The causal linkages between the use of antibiotics in animals and the spread of antibiotic resistance in humans involve complex ecological processes, including the development of resistance, within and between species spread and the behavioral and economic conditions that foster or inhibit their spread.  Our study took place in northern coastal Ecuador, where road building and deforestation are leading to an influx of small scale poultry farming in rural communities.  This context provided a unique opportunity to examine the ecology of antibiotic resistant evolution and spread.  Although traditionally chickens were exclusively free ranging in this part of Ecuador, the introduction of roads in this region has led to an emerging local industry where chickens are farmed using feed that contains antibiotics.  We found farmed chickens were much likelier to have high rates of antibiotic resistance than free-range chickens.  When comparing human resistance patterns with those of chickens we observed that, in general, the prevalence of antibiotic resistant E. coli in chickens is higher than in humans, especially for quinolones and genamicin.  But although chickens had higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance than humans, we saw high resistance levels in animals and humans for the same antibiotic.  For example, the six antibiotics with the highest levels in chickens were also shown to be the highest in humans.  Likewise, the lowest three antibiotics observed in chickens were also the lowest observed in humans.  This suggests that either resistance is flowing from chicken to humans or humans to chickens, or that both chickens and humans have a common selection pressure.  These eocologic data, therefore, provide some evidence for a linkage between chickens and humans.  Because of the noticeable difference in antibiotic use between humans and chickens in the region, the similar resistance pattern seen in humans and chickens is not likely to be entirely the result of the same selection presssure.  In addition we found that antibiotic resistance and virulence were genetically linked within our study region.  This suggests that antibiotic resistant E. coli will more likely cause disease than sensitive E. coli.       Last Modified: 12/09/2014       Submitted by: Joseph Eisenberg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
