<AbstractNarration>The project is for the development of a spectrometer correlator system that will enable high-resolution spectroscopy in the mid-infrared with the Infrared Spatial Interferometer at the Mt. Wilson Observatory. The new capability will allow some unique capabilities, including studying the presence and extent of water and other molecules in environments directly surrounding red giant stars. The work will involve several students and summer interns, and will provide them with hands-on research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary: The NSF-ATI grant 0804338 supported the development and construction of a high-speed digital spectrometer-correlator system for the Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI).  This system enables very high angular resolution and very high spectral resolution observations of stars in their later stages of evolution, i.e. red giant and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.  The ISI is a three telescope system, located at Mt. Wilson, that uses a unique heterodyne detection scheme that downconverts radiation in the 9-11 micron wavelength region (30 THz) to the radio frequency (RF) region (2.9 GHz). The digital spectrometer-correlator system can measure spectral features within the RF detection band making possible spectroscopic-interferometry in the mid-IR.  The new system is based on very high-speed Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) processors. We benefited from both electronic boards and software designed by the Center for Astronomical Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER), an NSF funded center at UC Berkeley.  Likewise, speed improvements required for the ISI system were contributed to the CASPER user community and they have benefited other projects (i.e. the Green Bank Spectrometer).  The ISI measures precisely the sizes and shapes of red supergiant and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and the dust shells that surround them.  In addition, and importantly, the variations of a starÆs size and shape are measured over time scales ranging from much less than a stellar luminosity period to many years. The new spectrometer-correlator subdivides the detection band to obtain a spectral resolution of ~600000 enabling visibility measurements on-and-off individual spectral lines simultaneously.  These studies will probe the formation, distribution and abundance of OH, H2O and other molecules surrounding stars.   Intellectual Merit:  Our understanding of stars has benefited from technological developments in optics, detectors, spectrometer designs, etc. Interferometry now permits individual stars to be resolved and for nearby stars we can observe distortions to spherical shapes and brightness variations across their surfaces. Red giant stars lose material that subsequently form molecules and dust, where this in turn is the material that will condense to form the next generation of stars and planets. The understanding of where molecules form in relation to the stellar photosphere, and the nature of the winds that drive material away from the star, requires high angular resolution (for detailed images), and high spectral resolution (for detailed material identification and velocity information). ISI observations will address in particular the regions of water molecule formation in the extended atmospheres of red giant stars.  Broader Impact:  The technology developments required for the ISI spectrometer-correlator will contribute to a number of additional high resolution remote sensing projects. Among these are interests in "Space Situational Awareness" and in particular the potential for heterodyne interferometry measurements of geo-stationary satellites.  Heterodyne interferometry developments also contribute to future optical/IR interferometry projects such as the Planetary Formation Imager (PFI). In addition, the ISI high spectral resolution capability has attracted interests in the SETI community towards mid-infrared searches for narrow-band continuous wave emitters.   ISI students have received hands-on experience with an array of experimental techniques and instrumentation. Students have developed, used and maintained optics, lasers, electronics, cryogenics, infrared detection systems and computer servo-control systems. The development of the new 5.8 Giga-sample/second digital system has introduced students to advanced electronics signal processing, thereby contributing to the nation's technological and scientific capabilities.
