<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;New, GK-12 Vibes and Waves in Action: A Cross-Disciplinary Network for GK-12 Education&lt;br/&gt;This project connects researchers from the Colleges of Engineering, Education and Arts &amp; Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Lowell to high-school teachers and students in school districts of Lowell and Lawrence, MA.  The project theme, Vibes and Waves in Action, is focused on the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) of sound and electromagnetic vibrations and waves and their interaction with the environment. It anchors the research topics of GK-12 fellows and provides a context for relating core high school Physics and Mathematics curriculum to the research. The project goals are to: (i) connect graduate fellows in interdisciplinary research programs through activities that elicit common learning experiences while delivering science education in urban high schools; (ii) provide leadership training that emphasize mentorship, social impacts and diversity education; (iii) engage visionary teachers to help develop synergy between targeted high school curriculum content, Massachusetts state curriculum frameworks, and the fellows? research projects; and (iv) provide high school students experience in use of high technology equipment and cyber enabled platforms. An industry mentor network will be developed as a resource to the graduate fellows and the high school community.  Cyber-infrastructure will be utilized to maintain a dynamic online presence, afford virtual collaboration, and to connect University compute servers, databases and lab instruments to high school classrooms for web based experiments. The program activities will be integrated into Creating Waves: a graduate course available for training all graduate students in STEM programs. This project will enhance STEM teaching and learning in school districts with high level of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines and create sustainable programs linking local school districts, colleges and regional industry together to improve the scientific and technical literacy of Massachusetts?s workforce. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The GK-12 Vibes and Waves in Action project was conducted at the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) in partnership with five public school districts in the cities of Brockton, Gardner, Haverhill, Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts.  The project goals were to: (i) enhance the technical communication, leadership and mentoring skills of graduate students engaged in research in the Colleges of Engineering and Science at UML; (ii) engage visionary high school teachers to develop a model for integrating the research of GK-12 fellows into the STEM high school curriculum; and (iii) provide high school students experiential learning opportunities focusing on the areas of Acoustics, Wireless Communication and Computational Modeling.    Twenty-six graduate students from the departments of Chemical, Biomedical, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Physics served as graduate fellows in the project.  This group included seventeen male and nine female students with half of the cohort earning doctoral degrees.  An additional ten graduate students assisted the fellows in their activities and participated in the training. The project engaged thirty-five high school teachers, with fifteen serving in the lead capacity. Each year of the project an average of five graduate fellows worked in five different high school classrooms engaging approximately one hundred and fifty students in each semester of their fellowship.

In many cases, the outcome at the end of the semester was a research poster that was co-authored by the graduate fellow and a group of high school students. This work was presented by the high school students at the UML research symposium held in April of each year.  For both the fellow and the high school students, participating in this venue and interacting with the research of other undergraduate and graduate students from all academic disciplines at the University was an enriching experience.  For most of the graduate fellows the project experience was one that began as a difficult exercise but ended with a greater understanding of their own research, its relevance, and an appreciation of the issues faced by public school districts in urban environments that are experiencing economic challenges.   A core group of high school teachers participated in each year of the project, establishing a strong working relationship with the UML faculty and graduate students leading the effort.  For these teachers, a continued partnership with UML has been established through the research and educational programs led by the project leaders.  The teachers have expressed that the introduction of computing in their STEM classes has been a valuable contribution.  The project emphasized the development and integration of computational modeling skills in the traditional Physics and Mathematics curriculum. This was a new learning experience for the teachers and many participated in the computing workshops that were led by the project leaders and graduate fellows. In particular, teachers were introduced to MATLAB and R programming frameworks with emphasis on designing simulations of experiments that students conducted during their Physics laboratory and project design activities.  Another outcome that was beneficial to the teachers was the implementation of an on-line course and learning management system by the graduate fellows.  The edX platform at http://vibesandwaves.org now provides an opportunity for teachers to continue partnering with UML graduate students and faculty through the collaborative design of lesson modules for application in a blended learning environment in their classrooms.
