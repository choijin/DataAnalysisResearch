<AbstractNarration>The project is a collaborative effort between a four-year school (Arizona State University) and five non-metropolitan feeder schools (Arizona Western College, Central Arizona College, Cochise College, Eastern Arizona College, and Mohave Community College). The team is working to significantly increase the number of transfer students, especially women and underrepresented minority students, that graduate in engineering and computer science. In order to accomplish this, they are: 1) providing scholarships to students in the feeder schools and to transfer students at Arizona State University , 2) supporting student outreach activities at the feeder schools, 3) supporting engineering courses at the feeder schools by providing materials, tutoring, local engineering speakers, and tuition scholarships, 4) conducting "Be an Engineer" events at the feeder schools for both students and their parents, 5) providing classes, workshops, and seminars using live broadcast and videotape, 6) providing an engaged community of mentors with extensive experience and commitment for all students, 7) hosting an orientation at Arizona State University for engineering transfer students, 8) managing a center where engineering transfer students can study together and get the support needed to survive, and 9) working with transfer students through a time-tested "career shaping" academic scholarship workshop program. The project is building on an earlier successful program between Arizona State University and a set of metropolitan community colleges with similar goals. Evaluation efforts, involving formative and summative aspects, are being conducted by internal and external evaluators who are developing and monitoring indices for enrollment, persistence, and graduation. Broader impacts include the development and dissemination of models for collaboration between community colleges and four-year schools and the efforts to increase the number of women and minorities in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since 2009, Central Arizona College (CAC) has partnered with Arizona State University (ASU) and a number of rural community colleges in Arizona with both the STEP and METSTEP grants.  The METSTEP grant allowed for the initial gains made at CAC towards resurrecting a pre-engineering program during the STEP grant phase, a reality.  Numerous engineering courses were added and significant increases in engineering course enrollments increased over the life of both grants&mdash;and continues to this day.    During the final year of this grant, the sum of outcomes from the entire grant period (highlighted below) in concert with institutional changes in the final year of the grant have put CAC in a position to move forward with creating an engineering degree program.  The brief history that follows is offered in an effort to explain the evolution of CAC in that regard, as a result of the benefits that accrue to CAC because of METSTEP.  Both grants engaged 158 students in engineering outreach and course-based activities through over $45,000 in tuition scholarship support.  Collaborations with ASU and the community college (CC) teams created a vital synergy that advanced all of our individual causes via the corporate effort.  To put it simply, the ease with which small tuition scholarship support drew students into contact with not only a university like ASU, but also ASU engineering students, was remarkable.  The face-to-face mentoring that engineering majors working in the Motivated Engineering Transfer Student (METS) Center at ASU was likely the largest influence on CC pre-engineering students over the course of the grant.  The clarity and inspirational content of those interactions, as well as some of the amazing resources at ASU that we were able to expose our students to, were the most memorable features of the METSTEP grant.  Perhaps the most relevant outcome of this grant is the realization that typical rural CC degree programs in Arizona are overly laden with general education requirements, whereas university degrees spread those same general education requirements over the entire 4-year degree.  In spite of this, CC transfer students tend to outperform non-transfer students in both academic and graduation rate metrics.  One of the partnering rural CCÆs in METSTEP succeeded in articulating a 2-year associates degree in engineering that more closely matches the first 2 years of the university experience, and have thus established an ideal model for the remaining partnering CCÆs.  During the METSTEP phase, CAC was able to articulate a large fraction of the required curriculum for such a degree, but have delayed implementing a degree program due to a lack of personnel and funding.  CAC is now at a point where we are ready to commit institutional resources towards finally building an engineering degree program.  Lessons learned during the METSTEP grant were crucial to arriving at this point with a willingness to do what it takes to move forward.  The challenge will not be an easy one given funding problems; but CAC is nonetheless committed to creating an engineering degree program, and hiring at least one engineering professor in coming years in order to support this effort.  At present, we have everything that is needed to do this in terms of curriculum&mdash;all that is required is the personnel to support that curriculum.  The opportunity to work with ASU on the METSTEP grant is the main&mdash;perhaps the singular&mdash;reason that CAC is where it is at today relative to the reality of creating a sustainable engineering degree program.
