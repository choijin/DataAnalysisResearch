<AbstractNarration>"RDE-RAD: Collaborative Research: Ohio's STEM Ability Alliance (OSAA): STEM Degrees and Careers for Ohioans with Disabilities" will increase the quantity and quality of students with disabilities receiving associate, baccalaureate and graduate degrees in STEM disciplines and their entry into the STEM workforce. This collaborative project includes the following partners: Wright State University, the Ohio State University, Sinclair Community College, Columbus State Community College and numerous high schools in the Dayton and Columbus regions of Ohio. The overarching objective of the project is to increase the number of students with disabilities entering and completing receiving postsecondary and graduate degree programs in STEM and transitioning to the STEM workforce. The program will pursue the following three specific quantitative goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 1: Recruitment to STEM College Majors. Recruit 225 students with disabilities to OSAA programming in STEM majors at combined alliance university and community college partner institutions by the end of the project award period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 2: Retention in STEM Majors and Graduation. Retain students participating in OSAA college level programming in STEM majors at a year-to-year persistence rate of 70%, or better; and award STEM degrees to a minimum of 70% of OSAA students who complete 4+ years of postsecondary study (2+ years for associates degree programs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 3: Transition to the STEM Workforce or STEM Graduate Programs. Transition 50% or more OSAA STEM graduates to employment or graduate degree training in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation for this collaborative project is provided by Dr. Thomas McKlin and associates of SageFox Consulting Group.  Dissemination of project deliverables and reports will focus on institutions in the Ohio region and on sharing the intervention model with a national post-secondary audience via a web-based diffusion portal, presentations at national conferences and publications in professional journals.</AbstractNarration>

Activities     Ability Advising: Ability Advising was instruction and mentoring provided to OSAA Columbus Quad students by an Ability Advisor, a counselor who focuses on student academic, career, and psychosocial development in order to support successful transition from college to STEM employment. Ability Advisors coordinated the following student supports:  Beginner Student Learning Communities (BSLCs): The BSLC was a 10-week program that helped high school and undergraduate students with disabilities develop skills in using accommodations and assistive technology (AT), self-determination, time management, and STEM career development. Advanced Student Learning Communities (ASLCs): The ASLC was a 10-week program for students at OSU that included activities that expanded and enhanced self-advocacy and internship/career development activities and provided investigation into topics of interest.  Mentoring: Electronic and face-to-face mentoring was established to enhance skills introduced through the SLCs. Internships: Through paid research opportunities in university, business, industry, and government laboratories, student interns acquired valuable work experiences and skills to increase their competitiveness in the STEM workforce.   As the project evolved, other student supports were added such as: the Choose Ohio First (COF) Disability Scholarship program, MOMENTUM support organization for students with disabilities in STEM, an annual student research forum, and AT.     Impacts/Intellectual Merit     Impacts  From Years 1 through 6, 163 graduate, undergraduate, and high school students with disabilities were recruited into the Columbus Quad.  Columbus Quad students reported that the most effective OSAA interventions were Ability Advising, internships, and the COF Scholarship program. From Years 1-6 of the program, $613,983 in COF scholarship funding was awarded to 64 Columbus Quad students.  Of the 46 Columbus Quad graduates, 42 (91.3%) acquired degrees in STEM fields.  For the 42 STEM graduates, the average time to degree from entering a STEM program to gr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
