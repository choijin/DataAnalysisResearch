<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Data-aware Distributed Computing for Enabling&lt;br/&gt;Large-scale Collaborative Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Tevfik Kosar, Louisiana State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications and experiments in all areas of science are becoming increasingly complex and more demanding in terms of their computational and data requirements. Some applications generate data volumes reaching petabytes. Sharing, disseminating, and analyzing these large data sets becomes a big challenge, especially when distributed resources are used. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project proposes a new distributed computing paradigm called ?data-aware distributed computing?, which will include a diverse set of algorithms, models, and tools for mitigating the data bottleneck in distributed computing systems; and will support a broad range of data-intensive as well as dynamic data-driven applications. As part of this project, research and development will be performed on three main components: i) a data-aware scheduler which will provide capabilities such as planning, scheduling, resource reservation, job execution, and error recovery for data movement tasks; ii) integration of these capabilities to the other layers in distributed computing such as workflow planning, resource brokering, and storage management; and iii) further optimization of data movement tasks via dynamically tuning of underlying protocol transfer parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be integrated to literally all levels of education which will include science projects, seminars and summer camps on data-intensive computing with K-12 students (where 99% is minority); curriculum development, mentoring, and international student/intern exchange programs for undergraduate and graduate students; summer internships and workshops specifically for HBCU community including faculty members. &lt;br/&gt;The tools and software developed in this project will be available to public via open-source distribution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
