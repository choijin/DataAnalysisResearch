<AbstractNarration>The Knowledge for Teaching Secondary School Mathematics (KnoTSS) project examines the nature and process of collaborations between mathematicians and mathematics teacher educators engaged in the preparation of secondary mathematics teachers. KnoTSS participants are teams of mathematicians and educators who co-teach two courses (one mathematics course and one methods of teaching mathematics course) aimed at building integrated knowledge of content and pedagogy. KnoTSS research will answer the following questions: How do collaborations develop and evolve? How can they be fostered within institutions? What is the intellectual terrain co-created and traversed by collaborators? How do they negotiate its boundaries? How do they position themselves with respect to it and to each other?&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
