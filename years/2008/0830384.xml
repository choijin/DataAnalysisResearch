<AbstractNarration>Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Micro Systems Technology were developed in parallel with the semiconductor industry, but are now experiencing global growth on their own.  The Southwest Center for Microsystems Education (SCME) provides skill standards, curricula, educational materials, workforce development modules, professional development and outreach activities directed toward increasing the number and quality of technicians who can perform microsystem design and manufacturing.   The Center develops associate degree programs in microsystem technology with industry-specific concentrations.  Designs and specifications for moderately priced learning laboratories for educational institutions are produced, as are interactive multimedia instructional modules for multiple work environments.  Materials are designed for career pathways for secondary school students.  The Center works closely with the University of New Mexico to develop strategies for cross- training technician and engineering students and providing professional development for faculty and industrial trainers.  Sandia Laboratories provides a loaned executive to the Center.  The Center is also supported by ATE centers in biotechnology and semiconductor manufacturing as well as other industries and industry associations.  Hispanic students and others from groups underrepresented in technical manufacturing are made aware of careers in microsystems manufacturing.  A bi-national alliance is fostered to educate faculty at 54 technological universities in Mexico.</AbstractNarration>
