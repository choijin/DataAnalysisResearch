<AbstractNarration>This scholarship project is based at Northern Arizona University, Yuma campus (NAU-Yuma), a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution.  Many of the students are recruited as a result of the 2+2 partnership which allows students to being their studies at Arizona Western College (AWC is a community college) and then seamlessly enroll in upper-division courses at NAU-Yuma. This partnership provides students with diversified courses of study with day, evening, and weekend scheduling and shared facilities co-located on AWC's main campus in Yuma. However, only 7% of the students who complete their two-year degree transfer to the University; cost is one of the reasons they do not transfer. Tuition at the University is much higher than the community college and underserved students, who characteristically have to help support their families, cannot afford to transfer. Responding to an urgent community and national need for a scientifically literate, technically competent workforce, project OASIS (Opportunities to Advance Success In the Sciences) provides scholarships to a total of 30 upper division academically promising, financially needy, students majoring in biological or environmental sciences.  Students join a Science Learning Community and receive academic support in chemistry, writing and statistics skills through faculty mentoring and academic coaches, and develop individual academic plans with the assistance of a Science Academic Coordinator. Industry and community internships are strongly encouraged to provide the students hands-on experience. Students graduate with a degree, a resume, and strong professional references. Best practices concerning effective recruitment and support for these students is collected and disseminated to other programs interested in replicating this model.</AbstractNarration>
