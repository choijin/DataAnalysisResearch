<AbstractNarration>This project will study the D-region electron density, at altitudes less than 95 km, using 3-300 kHz lightning radio emissions as a probe.  In particular, new techniques will be applied to analysis of lightning radio emissions known as Narrow Bipolar Events in order to provide ionosonde-like retrievals of electron density profiles as well as information on the vertical and horizontal structure of D-region perturbations due to solar flares, particle precipitation, and thunderstorms.  The primary research tasks are to develop an improved full wave propagation model which will provide more detailed ionospheric parameter extraction; to apply this technique to archived events to establish baseline D region ionospheric variability under a variety of conditions; and to apply to the results to open questions regarding radiation belt dynamics and lightning-ionosphere interactions.  The theoretical electromagnetic model will be tested against observations of the propagation of lightning-generated radio waves detected simultaneously by multiple wide-band receivers at varying locations.  Application of the model will enable inference of the D-region's horizontally-localized, instantaneous electron density profile in the vertical direction.  This will be studied under a variety of geophysical conditions as well as the time variations caused by external influences such as magnetospheric and interplanetary disturbances, solar flares, and lightning itself.  The tasks to be performed include:  1) Development of improved ionospheric radio-sounding technique using 3-300 kHz radiation from "Narrow Bipolar Event" lightning discharges; 2) Study of the vertical structure of D-region electron density profile in quiet, undisturbed conditions, using the improved sounding technique; 3) Study of vertical and horizontal structure of D-region perturbations due to solar flare activity, magnetospheric energetic particle precipitation and electron heating by the electrostatic fields of nearby thunderstorms and by electron heating by the radiated electromagnetic pulse of lightning strokes.  The databases to be used includes the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) and the Los Alamos Sferic Array.  A graduate student will participate in the project.</AbstractNarration>

(This radiation is blocked by attenuation in the atmosphere, thankfully, from reaching the EarthÆs surface. If it were not, life in the open would be impossible. )     "Ionization" refers to stripping-away a negatively charged electron, so that two charged particles replace the original neutral atom (or molecule): An electron, carrying one elementary negative charge, and an ion, carrying one elementary positive charge.

This selection for a favored displacement direction is referred to as "anisotropy".     The lowermost edge of the ionosphere is called the "D layer" and is found between 60 and 100 km altitude. The D layer causes significant attenuation of radio waves, due to energy loss when an electron collides into a neutral atom (or molecule). The electromagnetic energy flows from the radio wave to the electron and then to heating the neutral gas. This represents a net loss to the radio wave, referred to as "D-layer absorption".

Radio probling of the D-layer  For probing the D-layer from Earth, we seek to measure the downward reflection of radio waves from the D layer. Since frequencies in the AM radio band and higher frequencies are reflected from ionospheric regions higher than the D layer, one needs to use Very Low Frequency (VLF; 3-30 thousand cycles of oscillation per second) radio waves to look at the D-layer.     It is well known that to radiate efficiently, a radio antenna must have a length on the order of half the radio waveÆs wavelength. This can be reduced to a quarter wavelength if the antenna can be mounted at right angles to an extensive, electrically-conducting surface. For a typical VLF frequency, say 10-thousand cycles per second, the radio wavelenth is 30 km. In order to broadcast such a wave to the ionosphere, one would need to build a vertical antenna with a height of about a quarter wavelength above the conducting ground, or with a height of 7.5 km! Constructing such an antenna is out of the question.     Fortunately, very long antennas occur in nature, and this project exploited such natural emissions. Many lightning strokes have very long channels- several kilometers or more. The most powerful part of these signals occurs at Very Low Frequencies, so these signals are ideally suited for reflections off of the D layer.     To implement this concept, we used recordings of lightning VL...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
