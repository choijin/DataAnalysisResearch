<AbstractNarration>Mountains exert a profound influence on the weather and climate. This project will investigate two important aspects of the interaction between mountains and the atmosphere. The first will be to examine how the drag exerted by mountains on an air stream is distributed among different vertical levels in the atmosphere and how that drag feeds back on the larger scale flow. The second effort will examine the circumstances in which low-level blocking can trigger deep convective thunderstorms upstream of a mountain and how the resulting convection evolves in the presence of the mountain and a time-varying large-scale flow.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: When an air stream encounters a mountain barrier, mountain waves may be set up above and downstream of the barrier and the low-level flow may be blocked and diverted around the flanks of the mountain.  These disturbances are too small in scale to be resolved in global weather and climate models, but they produce an important drag on the large-scale flow that must be parameterized.  This project will attempt to place such parameterizations on a firmer theoretical footing and also determine the large-scale responses to orographic drag through the analysis of high-resolution numerical simulations.  Similar high-resolution simulations will be conducted to examine the conditions under which a moist air stream blocked by a mountain can undergo sufficient low-level destabilization and lifting to trigger deep convection upstream of the mountain itself.  The resulting thunderstorms are inherently non-steady, and we will examine their onset and decay in time varying large-scale flows.  Such upstream convective triggering is thought to be a significant factor in regulating the distribution of precipitation in the south Asian monsoon.  The Principal Investigator also will examine the influence of thermally driven circulations on the generation of these convective events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research and professional development of two graduate students will be supported.  Results should help improve the parameterization of low-level gravity wave drag in large-scale models essential for global weather forecasting and much climate research.  Global climate models suggest there will be shifts in winds and moisture fluxes in response to global warming, but the resolution of those models is too coarse to allow them to directly simulate changes in the convection.  Therefore, understanding the role played by mountains in triggering deep convection, both in the south Asian monsoon and in other regions, will be helpful in the management of water resources as the climate warms. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research has explored several ways in which the mountains impact the weather.  In addition we have improved the computer models used in the study of this problem.     Our first focus was on the drag exerted by mountains on airstreams flowing across the ridge line and the impact of this drag on larger weather systems.  In contrast to air flowing over flat plains, the drag generated by mountains is not only due to friction at the ground, but also due to waves that can develop at much higher levels in the atmosphere.  These waves are sometimes made visible by smooth lens-shaped (lenticular) clouds.  The drag associated with these waves is exerted where the waves dissipate.  The dissipation mechanisms for waves that travel straight upward above the mountains (deep mountain waves) is well established, but the factors leading to the dissipation of wave trains that stretch horizontally downstream is not well understood.  Graduate student, Matt Hills, is studying the processes that lead to the dissipation of such horizontally traveling lee waves.  Matt has shown that it is necessary to consider the slow time variations in the cross mountain flow to accurately capture important characteristics of these waves.  (Most previous research made the simplifying assumption that the waves were generated by a completely steady air flow.)  Understanding the coupling between lee waves and the larger scale weather patterns is important for accurate weather prediction.   The second focus of our research was on the precipitation generated when air flows over a mountain range.  It is well known that the windward side of a mountain receives far more rain and snow than the lee side.  Graduate student Nick Siler explored the year-to-year variation in the strength of this "rain-shadow" effect in the Washington Cascades, showing that it is highly correlated with variations in sea-surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.  Strong rain-shadow years are associated with anomalous warm waters (El Nino events); weak rain-shadow years are linked to the opposite conditions (La Nina).  The atmospheric processes responsible for this correlation appear to be related to variations the ability of the large scale flow striking the mountains to support deep mountain waves.  Weaker rain shadowing is produced when deep mountain wave generation is inhibited.  Understanding the factors that regulate precipitation on the lee-side of mountain ranges is important for improving water-resource management, since lee-side land use is often limited by scarce water resources.   Another graduate student, Justin Minder, studied the processes that regulate the movement of the snow line up and down a mountain during winter storms. He showed the snow line descends relative to the freezing level in the undisturbed upstream flow due to the "adiabatic" cooling of rising air along the windward slopes. He also identified  two more process that further lower the snow line in the immediate vicinity of the windward slopes, both of which are driven by the intensification of precipitation near the mountain.  This more intense precipitation cools the near-mountain air relative to that upstream by increasing the amount of snow melting into the air below the freezing level and by generating larger snow particles that fall farther below the freezing level before they melt.  Guidance about the elevation of snow line during winter storms is important for water resource management, and during intense relatively warm storms, it is also crucial for assessing the potential for flooding.  Flooding is much more likely when a large fraction of the precipitation falls as rain instead of snow.   Much of this research was conducted using computer simulations of air streams encountering mountains.  As part of our research we developed improved ways to perform the time-stepping algorithms in such computer models.  We also investigated the relative accuracy of two strategies for introducing finer re...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
