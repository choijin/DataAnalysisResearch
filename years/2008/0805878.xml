<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0805878&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Alejandro Uribe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will study aspects of the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between the semiclassical behavior (i.e. as Planck's constant&lt;br/&gt;tends to zero) of quantum-mechanical objects with their geometric&lt;br/&gt;counterpart in phase space.  More specifically, problems to be&lt;br/&gt;investigated include: Direct and inverse spectral problems for&lt;br/&gt;Schrodinger operators in various semi-classical settings,&lt;br/&gt;rigorous analyses of semiclassical approximations commonly used&lt;br/&gt;in the physics and quantum chemistry communities (Bohr-Sommerfeld&lt;br/&gt;conditions, approximate propagators and computation of&lt;br/&gt;correlation functions), as well as quantum-mechanical analogies&lt;br/&gt;of constructions in symplectic geometry (like symplectic&lt;br/&gt;cutting).  The settings will be both classical (when the phase&lt;br/&gt;space is Euclidean) and more geometric (e.g. when the phase space&lt;br/&gt;is a compact Kahler manifold or the cotangent bundle of a&lt;br/&gt;configuration space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relationship between mathematics and physics is profoundly&lt;br/&gt;important for both the theory and applications of these subjects.&lt;br/&gt;In one direction, mathematics is the language of physics and its&lt;br/&gt;methods can have powerful applications; in the other, physical&lt;br/&gt;problems often give rise to new mathematical problems that can be&lt;br/&gt;extremely fruitful.  The proposed research will study problems at&lt;br/&gt;the interface between quantum mechanics and geometry.  The&lt;br/&gt;problems are generally of two kinds: spectral, meaning related to&lt;br/&gt;the energy of a quantum system, and dynamical, comparing the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of a quantum system with its classical counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;The spectral problems seek to understand the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;the possible energy levels of a quantum system and the geometry&lt;br/&gt;of the corresponding classical system.  The dynamic problems&lt;br/&gt;should result in a better understanding of the underpinnings of&lt;br/&gt;some popular computational methods in quantum chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The research that was conducted under this award is on the mathematical aspects of the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics.  The mathematical theories describing classical and quantum mechanics are very different:  Classical mechanics is based on geometry, while quantum mechanics is based on analysis,  which is advanced calculus.  One is deterministic, the other probabilistic.  Yet there is a very deep connection between these two fields, and the outcomes of this project significantly add to the understanding of that connection.  They also uncover new aspects of the quantum-classical relationship.   Our main results give some answers to the general question:  To what extent the vibrations of an object reflect its geometry?  In our setting vibrations refers to to the quantum energy levels, and we show that in a number of cases the quantum energy levels do determine much of the geometry, or classical mechanics, of the same system.   Other results we have obtained indicate how to extend the classical notion of time to complex-valued notions of time, in classical mechanics.  Complex-valued means that complex numbers (including the square root of (-1)) are now to be considered "fair game" in the classical world. The insight on how that happens comes from quantum mechanics.  Interestingly, this is related to deep problems of geometry (over the complex numbers). We have also obtained results on quantum systems that are subject to evolve within certain energy bounds.  We have constructed a sound mathematical theory for particles subject to such energy bounds.  Further, we have obtained strong numerical evidence that shows that, under such bounds, a quantum particle would split as it reaches the boundary of the allowed energy.  The center of the particle(s) follow the contour lines that represent the classical dynamics of the same system.  This is a new phenomenon we can predict, based on our theoretical resulst as well as on our numerical calculations. In this way our results contribute to the knowledge of the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics, and also suggest intriguing lines of further research.
