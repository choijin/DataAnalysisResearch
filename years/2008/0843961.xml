<AbstractNarration>The proposed work will provide information about the development of memory and academic skills in the context of the elementary school math and language arts classrooms. The project is focusing on the possibility that the kind of mnemonic language used by teachers will affect the kinds of memory strategies used by students which, in term, will influence their STEM learning. By using a combination of longitudinal and experimental methods, the PI will be able to chart the development of memory within individual children across the key first two years of elementary school and to make statements about aspects of the classroom context that serve as mediators of developmental change. The resulting dataset will be unique in the literature. This ongoing experiment represents an important first step in taking basic research outcomes into the schools, but it is essential to expand the extant knowledge base in five critical ways before large-scale interventions can be undertaken profitably. First, given that children's deliberate memory skills most likely build on their earlier competence in autobiographical memory, the project assesses their abilities at school entry to talk with their parents about past events. Second, because of the importance of the initial year of schooling, the project must gauge the impact of instruction in kindergarten on children developing skills. Third, in order to understand more precisely key aspects of teacher's conversations that are associated with children's skill acquisition, the project must expand observations to include small-group as well as whole-group instruction. Fourth, they must replicate the findings obtained to date because they had been derived from a relatively small number of classes. Fifth, they will launch a small-scale intervention study, based on longitudinal and experimental findings, in which a sample of teachers is trained in instructional techniques that are associated with skilled remembering. The students will be assessed on an array of measures of memory skill as well as STEM content learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The research reported here bridges between studies of childrenÆs cognitive development in the laboratory and explorations of teachersÆ instruction in the classroom.  We carry out longitudinal studies of cognitive development in the classroom because this setting &ndash; especially the language used during the course of instruction &ndash; plays an important role in the emergence and consolidation of childrenÆs cognitive skills.  We are also drawn to the classroom because it provides a venue for examining experimentally the linkages between teachersÆ memory-relevant "talk" and childrenÆs cognitive skills that we have observed in our longitudinal work.  An eventual goal of ours is to develop interventions that have the potential to improve teaching and thereby influence the acquisition and refinement of cognitive skills.     This program of work began with an emphasis on the development of memory and has since broadened to a consideration of childrenÆs skills in mathematics.  The initial rationale was based on the observation that over the course of the elementary school years, children become increasingly facile users of an impressive array of techniques for remembering information.  Given the importance of memory for success in school, it is essential that children develop deliberate control over a range of component skills that influence the encoding, consolidation, storage, retrieval, and reporting of information.  These interrelated processes are orchestrated into deliberate strategies for remembering that 1) emerge in the context of the classroom and 2) seem to be transformed over time into the study skills that are needed for progress in school.  Although these strategies and skills are not taught in a deliberate manner, they are nonetheless influenced by the nature of language used during the course of instruction.   Our longitudinal research in the classroom revealed clear associations between features of teachersÆ conversational style and the memory skills of the children in their classes.  In comparison with their low mnemonic colleagues, teachers classified as high mnemonic use more metacognitive language when teaching mathematics and language arts, particularly in combination with requests for remembering that increase the depth to which information is processed.  Moreover, first graders taught by high mnemonic teachers evidence enhanced skill in the use of strategies for remembering than their peers who were taught by low mnemonic teachers.  Importantly, differences between the memory and study skills of children whose first grade teachers used high as opposed to low mnemonic language during instruction were observed through the fourth grade.  In addition, our experimental research indicates that we could train teachers in the use of memory-relevant instructional techniques and that exposure to teachers who taught a special curriculum unit in after-school programs in a high mnemonic fashion led to gains in childrenÆs use of strategies and mastery of the material.   In the project, we extended our work in several important ways.  First, given that the deliberate memory skills that we have studied over the course of the elementary school years most likely build on childrenÆs earlier competence in autobiographical memory, we assessed their abilities at school entry to talk with their parents about past events.  Second, because of increased academic expectations for the first year of formal schooling, we crafted a "downward extension" of our longitudinal study to gauge the impact of instruction in Kindergarten on childrenÆs developing repertoire of skills.  Third, to increase our confidence in the data on which interventions are based, we replicated the key findings concerning teachersÆ mnemonic style that we have reported.  Fourth, building upon our experimental study and the data collected in this new longitudinal investigation, we launched a pilot intervention study in the school context.   Our analyses of the lon...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
