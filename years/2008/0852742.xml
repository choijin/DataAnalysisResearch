<AbstractNarration>In the field of astronomy, adaptive optics are used to correct for the image aberrations that occur as starlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere: Dynamic changes in the refractive index refract the light, causing stars to "twinkle." The adaptive optics that are used in large terrestrial telescopes consist of a wavefront sensor to measure the aberrations of a "guide star," a natural or artificial point source reference beacon in the field of view of the object of interest, and a deformable mirror that can dynamically change its shape correct the image to restore diffraction limited imaging.&lt;br/&gt;The adaptive optics used in astronomy to obtain clearer images of celestial bodies in outer space will be re-applied in the field of biological imaging to correct image aberrations from changes in the refractive index within a cell. A fluorescent bead will be used as the reference beacon and implanted near the object of interest, such as the nucleus of a cell. Expected outcome is the correction of highly aberrated images, thereby obtaining the resolution limit set by diffraction of the imaging system. Once developed, the microscope will be available in a new research center, funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (www.cirm.ca.gov).</AbstractNarration>
