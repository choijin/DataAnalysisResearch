<AbstractNarration>Scambos/0732921&lt;br/&gt;Pettit/0732738&lt;br/&gt;Gordon/0732651&lt;br/&gt;Truffer/0732602&lt;br/&gt;Mosley-Thompson/0732655&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like no other region on Earth, the northern Antarctic Peninsula represents a spectacular natural laboratory of climate change and provides the opportunity to study the record of past climate and ecological shifts alongside the present-day changes in one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth. This award supports the cryospheric and oceano-graphic components of an integrated multi-disciplinary program to address these rapid and fundamental changes now taking place in Antarctic Peninsula (AP). By making use of a marine research platform (the RV NB Palmer and on-board helicopters) and additional logistical support from the Argentine Antarctic program, the project will bring glaciologists, oceanographers, marine geologists and biologists together, working collaboratively to address fundamentally interdisciplinary questions regarding climate change.   The project will include gathering a new, high-resolution paleoclimate record from the Bruce Plateau of Graham Land, and using it to compare Holocene- and possibly glacial-epoch climate to the modern period; investigating the stability of the remaining Larsen Ice Shelf and rapid post-breakup glacier response ? in particular, the roles of surface melt and ice-ocean interactions in the speed-up and retreat; observing the contribution of, and response of, oceanographic systems to ice shelf disintegration and ice-glacier interactions.  Helicopter support on board will allow access to a wide range of glacial and geological areas of interest adjacent to the Larsen embayment. At these locations, long-term in situ glacial monitoring, isostatic uplift, and ice flow GPS sites will be established, and high-resolution ice core records will be obtained using previously tested lightweight drilling equipment. Long-term monitoring of deep water outflow will, for the first time, be integrated into changes in ice shelf extent and thickness, bottom water formation, and multi-level circulation by linking near-source observations to distal sites of concentrated outflow.  The broader impacts of this international, multidisciplinary effort are that it will significantly advance our understanding of linkages amongst the earth's systems in the Polar Regions, and are proposed with international participation (UK, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Argentina) and interdisciplinary engagement in the true spirit of the International Polar Year (IPY). It will also provide a means of engaging and educating the public in virtually all aspects of polar science and the effects of ongoing climate change. The research team has a long record of involving undergraduates in research, educating high-performing graduate students, and providing innovative and engaging outreach products to the K-12 education and public media forums. Moreover, forging the new links both in science and international Antarctic programs will provide a continuing legacy, beyond IPY, of improved understanding and cooperation in Antarctica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The largest single event was the Larsen B Ice Shelf, 3000 square kilometers (the size of Rhode Island) that collapsed in a few weeks in 2002. These ice shelf losses and the acceleration of the glaciers that feed them are triggered by a combination of higher air temperatures, warmer ocean water, and the dynamic movement of the glaciers themselves.     While the exact timing of events like the Larsen B is unpredictable, by understanding the evolution of these systems &ndash; from the lead up to a collapse event to the aftermath &ndash; can help us narrow that timeframe and anticipate the response. Because these ice-shelf collapse events are similar to the bursting of a dam; afterward the glacier accelerates, flowing faster to the ocean. Eventually the system will find a new equilibrium, but that process might take decades  or centuries.     The LARISSA Project was designed as the first truly interdisciplinary study of a glacier system, from the high plateau along the spine of the Antarctic Peninsula to the ocean floor beneath the former ice shelves. We aimed to understand the interconnectedness of the system and the longer term effects of a collapse event, towards being able to foresee these changes elsewhere in the cryosphere.  Contributions from the glaciologists  As a glaciology team, we focused our efforts on making measurements and observations, bringing in theory and modeling, in order to understand the processes driving glacier evolution and change. Up high on the ice plateau, we started with basic measurements of ice depth and accumulation rate, which are key to predicting the age of the ice to help with our collaborators who drilled an ice core. The climate history sets the stage for understanding the changes today. Measurements of ice temperature within the borehole also provide a means to put todayÆs climate warming into a longer term perspective. The results show a significant increase in air temperature over the last several decades. These results were also integrating into model of glacier flow that helps ensure we are interpreting any ice core data correctly.  Downglacier, we deployed a series of geophysical-meteorological stations and GPS stations that transmitted data back to the US so we could observe ongoing changes  and relate them to satellite imagery and our modeling results. Putting local glacier or ice shelf changes in the broader spatial perspective is as important as putting the modern changes in longer term perspective.

Rather than many small calving events happening all the time, the east side produces a few large tabular icebergs every few years, or it collapse in a single dramatic event.  Broader impacts  As a single dramatic event that has caused ongoing changes over the last decade, the 2002 Larsen B Ice Shelf collapse event has provided a strikingly visual account of our chan...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
