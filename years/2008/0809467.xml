<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Marin of Benedictine University, Lisle, IL will perform deep-ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy on the lowest-lying electronic absorption band of water up to and beyond the critical temperature.  Above the critical temperature local clustering of water molecules is thought to occur. Here, spectra will be obtained as a function of density, providing information on how the water electronic states are related to the local solvent environment.  The cluster size is theoretically known to have a large effect on the electronic state energy, so these experiments complement previous work.  Experiments are to be carried out with undergraduate students in conjunction with staff at the Synchrotron Radiation Center associated with the University of Wisconsin-Madison and collaborators at the University of Notre Dame Radiation Laboratory.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The impacts of this project reach beyond fundamental science.  A better understanding of water under supercritical conditions could aid in the development of new, highly-efficient supercritical water-cooled nuclear reactors or in toxic waste mitigation via supercritical water oxidation facilities.  Opportunities to get involved in investigative research and use of contemporary instrumentation and techniques at a premier federal research facility may inspire undergraduate students to pursue advanced degrees and careers in the physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
