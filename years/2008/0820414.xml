<AbstractNarration>The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the Ohio State University (OSU), titled Center for Emergent Materials (CEM), performs integrated research on emergent materials and phenomena in magnetoelectronics. The aim of the Center research activities is to advance understanding of the emergent materials and phenomena and to develop highly sophisticated experimental and theoretical tools required to study them, which will lay down the scientific foundation for building future oxide-based electronic devices that can perform multiple functions, and energy-efficient, fast computers that have integrated memory and logic. The Center has two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). IRG 1, Towards Spin-Preserving, Heterogeneous Spin Networks, will develop a new understanding of electron-spin injection and transport in low-dimensional, spin-preserving materials such as silicon and carbon. This understanding provides a new materials basis for creating novel high-density spin networks for next-generation computing. IRG 2, Double Perovskite Interfaces and Heterostructures, designs and controls multifunctional properties of innovative double perovskite heterostructures through the understanding of structure, defects, and magnetotransport properties at interfaces. This new knowledge of magnetism in metallic oxides enables important advances in the emerging field of oxide-based electronics. The IRGs are complemented by a Seed Funding program, which provides the necessary flexibility and vitality to CEM in responding swiftly and effectively to the rapidly-changing materials research landscape. Integrated with the research activities, CEM enhances classroom education, creates research internship opportunities, widens the Science-Technology-Engineering-Math (STEM) "pipeline," and enhances diversity in STEM. Activities include an innovative education research program aimed at cognition of materials science concepts, K-12 outreach and visitation programs, undergraduate research programs, and graduate-education enhancement programs. The multidisciplinary OSU materials community is already home to major world-class shared experimental facilities, which are brought to bear on CEM research and education. The Center collaborates with the electronics, storage, and instrumentation industries; national laboratories and institutes; other U.S. universities; and international universities and laboratories in China, India, Germany, and United Kingdom.</AbstractNarration>

Interdisciplinary teams of faculty, students, and postdoctoral researchers are addressing the multi-faceted scientific issues this challenge presents by integrating materials synthesis/growth, characterization, novel probe development and theory/modeling. CEM seeks to maintain and enhance the strong scientific community at the heart of this endeavor, so CEM has taken, and will continue to take, vigorous steps to improve participation by the relatively untapped resources of women and underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities. These programs integrate CEMÆs scientific research with education and outreach that dovetails with recruitment and teaching of diverse communities at all levels&mdash;from K-12 students extending through undergraduates, graduates, postdocs, and faculty. Outcomes IRG-1: Towards Spin-Preserving Heterogeneous Spin Networks The roadmap for integration of spin functional materials into applications can be organized in analogy to the development of charge-based devices: materials must be identified with suitable spin properties for different applications, spin must be transduced with other degrees of freedom to facilitate detection and manipulation, and spin currents must be detected and controlled to enable new, energy-efficient technologies. "Spin-preserving" materials, such as silicon and carbon that facilitate spin transport and best preserve spin coherence, and "spin active" materials, such as ferromagnets and semiconductors with high spin-orbit coupling that allow for the direct manipulation of spin ordering and coherence will be important for future spin functional materials. This calls for thorough understanding and control of the behavior of electronic spin in heterogeneous structures. Keystone IRG-1 advances toward this end include: record efficiency graphene spin injection and transport, spin injection in hybrid organic/inorganic heterostructures, atomistic control over dopant interactions in model ferromagnetic semiconductors, spin microscopies with submicron resolution, and pure spin current injection/detection in a variety of multilayer structures. IRG-1 Major Accomplishments: 2014-2015 Recent IRG-1 results continue to build on leadership positions in four targeted areas: graphene spin transport, spin injection in hybrid organic/inorganic materials, atomistic control over dopant interactions and pure spin current injection/detection: Spin conductance matching in YIG based heterostructures &ndash; New IRG-1 results elucidate the mechanism of FMR-driven spin pumping in the canonical insulating ferrimagnet, Y3Fe5O12 (YIG). Variations in the spin pumping efficiency among in YIG/Pt and YIG/W bilayers and YIG/Cu/Pt and YIG/Cu/W trilayers provides direct insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing spin pumping. Graphene spin injection &ndash; Spin pumping into graphene is attractive on account of its exceptional spin transport properties. Our FMR characterization of cobalt grown on graphene revealed increased magnetic disorder, perhaps due to changes in the growth process and an increase in defects. As such, it is not possible to conclude successful spin injection into graphene from FMR linewidth measurements alone.   Spin dynamics in organic magnets - Ferromagnetic resonance measurements of the organic ferrimagnetic semiconductor V[TCNE]x (x ~ 2, TCNE: tetracyanoethylene) grown by chemical vapor deposition revealed very narrow lines: 1.4 G, a promising development for high frequency organic devices.
