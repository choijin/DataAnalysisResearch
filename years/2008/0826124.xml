<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this GOALI award is to develop advanced optimization methods for product design. These methods are based on the mathematics of biogeography, which is the study of the distribution, migration, speciation, and extinction of biological species. Biogeography is nature?s way of distributing species. This research will explore the feasibility of using the concepts of biogeography to aid in general problem solving. The research includes the investigation of biogeography theory, the development of biogeography-based problem-solving methods, the application of the methods to general product design, specifically automotive design, and benchmark testing of these methods. Deliverables include Internet-based biogeography optimization software for general-purpose product design optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide a framework for optimization based on biogeography theory that has the potential to greatly improve our ability to design products which possess a high number of variable parameters. These methods will be used early in the design process, before the detailed product design has been developed, to support the designer in exploring a wide range of design options. The software developed as a result of this research will be available for solving a variety of optimization problems. Close collaboration with the industrial partner, General Motors, will provide the opportunity for the research team to test these methods on industrial problems. Graduate students will gain industry experience through summer internships at GM. The minority population of Cleveland State University provides a rich environment from which to recruit minority students for involvement in this research. Dissemination will occur through journal publications, industrial seminars and presentations at technical conferences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This research has generalized the mathematical models of biogeography and applied them to the solution of engineering problems. BBO is an algorithm that is implemented on a computer, and falls under the broad category known as "artificial intelligence."  Some of the important issues that are related to computer algorithms, and especially optimization algorithms such as BBO, include the following.  (1) Is the algorithm stable? That is, can the algorithm be guaranteed to output reasonable results?  (2) Does the algorithm converge? That is, can the algorithm be guaranteed to eventually find the correct answer to the problem it is trying to solve?  (3) Are there good mathematical models for the algorithm? If this question can be answered in the affirmative, then the mathematical properties of the algorithm (stability, convergence, dynamic behavior, etc.) can be proven without relying on time-consuming computer simulations.  (4) Can the details of the algorithmÆs motivating paradigm (bioegeography, in this research) be generalized to improve the performance of the algorithm?  This research answered all of the above questions in the affirmative.  One of the important BBO applications in this research was the optimization of complex systems.
