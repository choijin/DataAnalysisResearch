    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As computing becomes embedded in the very fabric of our society, the&lt;br/&gt;exponential growth and advances in cheap, high-speed communication&lt;br/&gt;infrastructures allow for unprecedented levels of global information&lt;br/&gt;exchange and interaction. As a result, new market forces emerge that propel&lt;br/&gt;toward a fundamental, cost-efficient paradigm shift in the way computing is&lt;br/&gt;deployed and delivered: computing outsourcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outsourcing has the potential to minimize client-side management overheads&lt;br/&gt;and benefit from a service provider's global expertise consolidation and&lt;br/&gt;bulk pricing. Companies such as Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and Sun are rushing&lt;br/&gt;to offer increasingly complex storage and computation outsourcing services&lt;br/&gt;supported by globally distributed "cloud" infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet significant challenges lie in the path to successful large-scale&lt;br/&gt;adoption. In business, healthcare and government frameworks, clients are&lt;br/&gt;reluctant to place sensitive data under the control of a remote, third-&lt;br/&gt;party provider, without practical assurances of privacy and confidentiality.&lt;br/&gt;Today's solutions however, do not offer such assurances, and are thus&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally insecure and vulnerable to illicit behavior. Existing research&lt;br/&gt;addresses several aspects of this problem, but advancing the state of the&lt;br/&gt;art to practical realms will require a fundamental leap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these challenges by designing, implementing and&lt;br/&gt;analyzing practical data outsourcing protocols with strong assurances of&lt;br/&gt;privacy and confidentiality. It will also l initiate the exploration of the cost and energy&lt;br/&gt;footprints of outsourcing mechanisms. This is essential as the main raison&lt;br/&gt;d'etre of outsourcing paradigms lies in their assumed end-to-end cost&lt;br/&gt;savings and expertise consolidation. Yet, research has yet to explore and&lt;br/&gt;validate the magnitudes of these savings and their underlying assumptions.</AbstractNarration>
