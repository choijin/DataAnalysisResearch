<AbstractNarration>Andrei Gabrielov proposes to investigate homotopy types of definable sets in o-minimal expansions of real closed fields, and the algorithmic complexity of operations with such sets and their families.  The fundamental question is to estimate the topological complexity of a definable set in terms of the structural complexity of its defining formula.  Recent developments in algorithmic real algebraic geometry and topological o-minimality suggest that an answer to that question can be obtained for a wide class of sets definable in o-minimal structures with the Bezout-type finiteness property. Notably, a combinatorial-geometric construction suggested by A. Gabrielov and N. Vorobjov allows one to approximate arbitrary definable sets by homotopy equivalent definably compact sets, simplifying considerably the study of their topology. Furthermore, homotopy colimit construction allows one to approximate a set defined by a formula with existential quantifiers by a homotopy equivalent simplicial object defined by a quantifier-free formula, and to employ the descent spectral sequence to compute topological invariants of the original set.  The proposed research will advance our understanding of the topological properties of the sets definable in o-minimal structures, and of the algorithmic complexity of operations with such sets and their families. It will provide new tools for the o-minimal algebraic topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to develop new upper bounds on the topological complexity of semialgebraic sets (defined by formulas with equations and inequalities between polynomials in several real variables)and their generalizations known as definable sets in o-minimal structures.  Given an appropriate measure of complexity, such as Bezout theorem bounding the number of zeros of a polynomial, the topological complexity of a definable set depends on the structural complexity of its defining formula.  Recently A. Gabrielov and N. Vorobjov suggested a construction replacing a general definable set with a homotopy equivalent compact set, applying a simple combinatorial procedure to the defining formula of the original set.  Thus the problem of the topological complexity of the general definable sets can be reduced to the more tractable problem for the compact sets.  The proposed research will establish new connections between o-minimal theory, topology, combinatorics, and real algebraic geometry.  It will provide new combinatorial and topological tools for development of faster computational algorithms in real algebraic and analytic geometry and its applications in control theory, visualization, and computer-aided design.</AbstractNarration>

The main goal of this project was to prove a conjecture ('the main conjecture') on approximation of a set definable in an o-minimal structure ('definable set') by a monotone family of compact definable sets.  The compact sets are homotopy equivalent to the original definable set, and the complexity of their defining formulas is related in a simple way to the complexity of the original defining formula. This approximation allows one to reduce the study of the topology of a general definable set to the more tractable case of a compact definable set.  The o-minimal theory is a generalization of the theory of real semialgebraic sets, i.e., sets defined by equations and inequalities between real multivariate polynomials. The main conjecture applied to a semialgebraic set provides the best known upper bound on the topological complexity of such a set in terms of its defining formula. Such upper bounds are important in applications of o-minimal theory to control theory, robotics, visualization, and computer-aided design.  As a result of this project, the main conjecture has been verified for two-dimensional definable sets, and for definable sets in the three-dimensional space. Although the conjecture remains open in higher dimensions, new fundamental tools for the study of definable sets have been developed as the steps towards its proof.  One of these tools is a notion of a monotone definable map, generalizing the ordinary univariate monotone function.

Triangulation of a definable family provides a partition of such a graph into 'standard' graphs. This can be viewed as a 'resolution of singularities' of a definable function.  2. Spectrum of the Schrodinger operator with a quartic polynomial potential. A novel approach to this classical problem of quantum mechanics, based on a combination of real algebraic geometry and the theory of functions of a complex variable, provided detailed information on the structure of the spectrum, including explanation of 'level crossing' of the eigenvalues discovered numerically by physicists.  For the even potential, a long-standing conjecture that the spectrum in the complex domain consists of two connected components (corresponding to even and odd eigenfunctions) have been proved.  General conditions for convergence of the spectrum under singular perturbation has been established. Singular perturbations play a fundamental role in quantum mechanics, as they allow one to study the spectrum of a complex system via its degeneration to a simpler system (with a potential of a lower degree). Previously, convergence of the spectrum under singular perturbations was established only for self-adjoint problems.   3. Complex laminations. A complex lamination is a partition of a space Y into complex analytic manifolds, with possibly non-analytic dependence on parameters. For a partition into hypersurfaces, the following finiteness result reminiscent of o-minimality has been established: Any complex analytic mapping of a complex analytic manifold X to Y may be tangent to the leaves of the lamination only along a locally finite family of complex analytic varieties. The result is important in complex dynamics. It was previously known only for a one-dimensional manifold X.  4. The B....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
