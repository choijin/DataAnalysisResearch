<AbstractNarration>URM:?Integrative Biology For Future Researchers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding will establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring Program in the Department of Biological Sciences at Florida Atlantic University (FAU). The objectives of the URM program are to attract, mentor, and prepare undergraduate students historically underrepresented in scientific research for graduate studies in life sciences. FAU is a minority institution as well as a Hispanic serving university. The undergraduate scholars will participate in weekly meetings with the PIs (academic mentoring) to discuss their projects and receive feedback on their research experience and in activities aimed at strengthening their science related skills. Each student will also be paired with a faculty mentor (research mentoring) who will train and guide the student in the specific area of research of the mentor. The areas of research include; a) Conservation Biology, b) Marine Biology and Behavior, and c) Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. These areas will be linked together by judicious choice of projects that will highlight the integrated nature of the program. The FAU-URM program will train students in a variety of research areas that will facilitate their movement into, graduate programs In addition; this URM will enhance the workforce development for SE Florida in anticipation of growing employment opportunities in life science institutions. For example, Scripps of Florida, the Torrey Pines Institute the USGS are adding facilities on or adjacent to FAU campuses as well as a variety of nearby state and federal laboratories. PIs: Rodney Murphey, Florida Atlantic University, Chair of the Department of Biological Sciences rmurphey@fau.edu ; Evelyn Frazier, Florida Atlantic University, Department of Biological Sciences, efrazier@fau.edu.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PI: Rodney Murphey and CoPI: Evelyn Frazier  The demographics of our country have been changing over the last few decades such that African Americans, Hispanics, Indo Pacific Islanders and Native Americans are becoming a significant portion of the population. In spite of this they continue to be under represented in science.  Innovation through scientific discoveries has always been a key component of the American economic success and to maintain that position we need to train more scientists. The main goal of this grant proposal was to attract, mentor and prepare undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups for a successful career in science.

Undergraduate research experiences are known to increase student academic achievement, critical thinking skills, communication skills and their decision to pursue a post-graduate education.  Several aspects of the research experience contribute to these outcomes. The first being that research is conducted through mentoring in small groups and when successful it results in a positive relationship between the research mentor and his/her mentee that fosters intellectual growth. There is a sense of belonging to a community of peers and the sense that your project is important to answer a small part of a bigger puzzle.  This sense of belonging is very important, and especially so to minority students, in engaging students into taking ownership for their own learning and being responsible for solving their part in the bigger puzzle.
