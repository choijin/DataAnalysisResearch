<AbstractNarration>The project is continued development of the Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization, which is a sophisticated radio array designed to measure highly-redshifted spectral lines from neutral hydrogen emanating from one of the earliest epochs of the formation of the universe. This version of the array will be placed at a very remote and radio-quiet location in Western Australia.</AbstractNarration>
