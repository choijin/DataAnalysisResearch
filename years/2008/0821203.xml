<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to The Cleveland Museum of Natural History to &lt;br/&gt;update an aging microscope facility that supports research and training &lt;br/&gt;across multiple scientific disciplines. Currently, the Museum openly &lt;br/&gt;offers all Museum departments and colleagues (and their students) from &lt;br/&gt;other institutions microscopes with digital cameras and computer &lt;br/&gt;software for scientific analysis of images of Museum specimens. This &lt;br/&gt;grant will fund the purchase of two new microscopes with digital cameras &lt;br/&gt;and the computers and software needed for image analysis. A third camera &lt;br/&gt;will be purchased to update the existing equipment. The Museum intends &lt;br/&gt;to continue allowing access to visiting researchers. The original &lt;br/&gt;research will allow for continued work in diverse areas of invertebrate &lt;br/&gt;zoology, including 1) descriptions of new species of wasps; 2) &lt;br/&gt;elucidation of the biology of the immature stages of various insect &lt;br/&gt;groups; 3) the application of entomological data to crime scene &lt;br/&gt;investigation; and 4) the use of aquatic insects as indicators of &lt;br/&gt;ecosystem health in wetlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Museum is committed to obtaining a better understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;natural world and our place in it. Research in the broader areas of &lt;br/&gt;biodiversity and ecosystem health will provide descriptive data that &lt;br/&gt;will generate hypotheses to be tested. Data obtained using modern &lt;br/&gt;microscopy equipment and image analysis will generate data for &lt;br/&gt;application to practical questions, such as forensic entomology and &lt;br/&gt;conservation biology. One of the new systems will be mobile, allowing it &lt;br/&gt;to be used in Museum galleries for public interaction and incorporation &lt;br/&gt;into the Museum's Distance Learning Studios for remote classroom &lt;br/&gt;experiences. All equipment will be stored and used in a room visible to &lt;br/&gt;the visiting public to ensure they understand the behind-the-scenes &lt;br/&gt;world of Museum research and public service.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
