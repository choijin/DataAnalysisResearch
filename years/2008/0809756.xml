<AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry supports Prof. Christa Colyer and her group at Wake Forest University to develop rapid and sensitive assays based on capillary electrophoresis (CE) methodologies and employing rationally designed bioprobes for protein targets. Applications include quantitative assessment of the noncovalent binding properties of novel squarylium and triazolylcoumarin dyes towards proteins based on CE affinity, and comparison with solid phase microextraction methods (in collaboration with Dr. Hiroyuki Nakazumi of Osaka Prefecture University in Japan; David Silcott of S3I, LLC; and Dr. Janusz Pawliszyn of the University of Waterloo, Canada).  Application of affinity CE to ligand-receptor interactions essential to the function of the B7 family of proteins involved in the regulation of immune responses is also being assessed (in collaboration with Dr. Lieping Chen of Johns Hopkins University). CE-based assays employing designed boronic acid-based bioprobes are being developed (in collaboration with Dr. Qian Wang and Dr. Karen Fox of the University of South Carolina) to identify carbohydrate-based residues unique to the surfaces of viral and bacterial agents of importance to human health and security, such as the influenza virus and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) spores.  Improved bacterial analysis will support differentiation and quantitation of various intact cyanobacteria species, their constituent phycobiliproteins, and their tetrapyrrole bilin pigments.  This unique three-pronged CE methodology should enhance understanding of the role of cyanobacteria in the global carbon cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In conjunction with this research, Dr. Colyer is engaged in various community and academic outreach ventures, such as a summer research program for undergraduate students at High Point University and the creation of a workshop entitled "Electrophoresis Working Weekend" for the academic enrichment of faculty and students from regional colleges and universities. An international student exchange between Wake Forest University and Osaka Prefecture University in Japan will better prepare students for the increasingly interdisciplinary and globalized nature of scientific research. Additionally, a series of case studies based on research results will be developed to provide college-level instructors with the resources necessary to teach modern separation science and biosensing methods. This series of case studies, to be called "Separation Shorts," will be submitted for publication in the peer-reviewed collection of the NSF-funded National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report NSF Award ID 0809756 C.L. Colyer, Wake Forest University     Analytical tools capable of adaptation to a wide range of analyte types and sizes are invaluable in an increasingly interdisciplinary scientific landscape. To this end, the NSF-funded project entitled "Affinity-based CE studies to facilitate bioprobe design and microbe detection," (NSF award ID 0809756) involved the development of novel separation methods distinguished by their strategic use of probe molecules to modify some property of the target of interest upon binding to the target. An international collaboration with Osaka Prefecture University in Japan, which involved a graduate student research exchange program, was pivotal to the success of this project.  Analyte targets ranging in size and character from simple anions (such as benzene sulfonate and monochloroacetate), to monosaccharides (such as glucose and fructose) and proteins (such as mucin), all the way to intact microbes (such as Bacillus globigii spores), were studied. Probe molecules ranging from ionic liquids to fluorophores, were used to modify the targets, thus rendering the targets suitable for separation and detection by modified capillary electrophoresis methods. For example, a dicationic ion-pairing reagent, N,NÆ-dibutyl 1,1Æ-pentylenedipyrrolidinium, was shown to bind to anionic contaminants in tap water samples, yielding complexes with increased net mass and positive charge, which could subsequently be detected at concentrations as low as about 10-20 ppb. Other probes studied in this work were fluorescent dye molecules shown to bind their targets by some combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. For example, two new polymethine dyes possessing a cyclobutene ring structure at their cores and identified as "bis-SQHN-4d" and "SQHN-3c," were able to bind to model proteins human serum albumin, myoglobin, and transferrin, yielding fluorescent complexes, which were subsequently resolved and quantified by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection. Noncovalent interactions between the fluorescent dye probe molecules and their protein targets could be facilitated by either pre-column labeling or on-column labeling methods, with the latter yielding greater sensitivity.  Finally, the success of these squarylium dye probes was exploited for sugar-based analytes by incorporating a boronic acid functionality into the dye, which then selectively bound to cis-diol groups possessed by monosaccharides, glycoproteins, and even bacterial spores. For example, a new boronic acid functionalized squarylium dye "SQ-BA" was shown to be superior to other sugar probes by binding selectively to fructose with a high affinity constant, enhancing fluorescence by a factor of more than 18 times.  This same dye was able to bind selectively to glycoproteins in the spore coats of gram positive bacteria, including Bacillus globigii (a simulant of anthrax) and S. cerevisiae (bakerÆs yeast). However, to be able to separate labeled bacteria from one another, it was necessary for us to develop a highly efficient, hybrid capillary electrophoresis method dubbed "PectI," or "polymer-enhanced capillary transient isotachophoresis."

This highly sensitive analytical method allowed for the trace detection of down to three bacteria cells per injection. The new PectI method has also been used in preliminary studies to resolve different strains of marine cyanobacteria, such as Synechoccocus.  Cyanobacteria are picophytoplankton that are both primary producers and participants in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. They contain phycobiliproteins, which themselves have constituent flu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
