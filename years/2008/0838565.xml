<AbstractNarration>Observations from seismology reveal two large regions of the lowermost mantle, beneath Africa and the Pacific, that exhibit slower-than-average seismic wavespeeds. Additional observations infer the cause of these anomalies to include both thermal and compositional heterogeneity. A few, competing hypotheses exist to explain them, each of which have significant consequencestoward our understanding of mantle convection patterns, &lt;br/&gt;thermal transport, geochemical evolution, and cooling of the Earth?s interior. Here, we test the hypothesis that the large seismic anomalies beneath Africa and the Pacific are due to the interaction of ancient, subducted oceanic crust with plumes of hot, upwelling mantle that are expected to form in these regions. By performing 3D numerical modeling studies of mantle convection, combined with processing our results in a manner that best reproduces the distortion inherent to seismological techniques, we will examine whether this hypothesis is dynamically feasible. If so, we will investigate the important thermal and chemical transport properties associated with it, comparing and contrasting them to those of competing ideas. We will investigate how well this hypothesis fits numerous geological, geochemical, and seismological constraints, with the ultimate goal of understanding the nature of large-scale mantle convection. Combined with advances from other research, this research will work toward the larger goal of understanding how mantle convection causes plate tectonics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of this project is to perform a comprehensive fluid dynamical study to better understand the fundamental dynamics associated with multiple plumes in the presence of compositional heterogeneity. Using numerical finite-element modeling in 3D, spherical geometry, we will investigate the morphology, time-dependent dynamics, heat transport properties, and expected surface expression of mantle plume clusters in an environment &lt;br/&gt;dominated by external stress forces (i.e., background convection) and various degrees of compositional heterogeneity. Secondly, we will investigate whether compositionally-heterogeneous plume clusters are consistent with observations from seismology and geology. Employing Earth?s plate history to guide subduction patterns in thermochemical numerical models, we will investigate how subducted oceanic crust is segregated into upwelling mantle regions. Through tomographic filtering of geodynamical model results, we will investigate how well plume clusters, combined with compositional heterogeneity, fit observations of seismic tomography, compared to other conceptual thermochemical mantle models. Furthermore, we will investigate the expected surface expression of plume clusters, determining their consistency with characteristic patterns of hotspot islands observed on Earth?s surface.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant partially funded 4 PhD graduate students in the field of geological sciences toward their dissertation research.  Teresa Lassak defended in 2009 and is currently working at Exxon Mobil.  Abigail Bull defended in 2009 and is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Norway.  Curtis Williams and and Mingming Li are currently finishing their dissertation research here at Arizona State. This grant also funded the collaborative work between the PI, Allen McNamara, and seismologist colleagues Ed Garnero and Sebastian Rost.  In all, the research associated with this grant led to 5 scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals.  The work performed primarily used computational fluid dynamical modeling of mantle convection in collaboration with seismology.  The overarching theme of this research centers upon understanding the compositional structure of EarthÆs mantle, particularly whether the mantle is composed of multiple, physical reservoirs of different materials (as hypothesized, based on seismic observations and geochemical data) or whether the mantle lacks such reservoirs (as also hypothesized, based on seismic observations).  This is important to distinguish because the presence (or lack of) of these reservoirs would dramatically influence the nature of heat and chemical transport within EarthÆs mantle.  Such an understanding forms the foundation of recognizing the thermal and chemical evolution of the planet as well as the driving forces causing plate tectonics at the surface.  Work supported by this grant worked toward this community-wide goal.  In Lassak et al. (2010), we investigated how seismic observations of the topography on EarthÆs core-mantle boundary could be used to distinguish between mantle models that included or lacked such compositional reservoirs.  We found that current seismic observations were insufficient, but we were able to provide seismologists with insight regarding the character of core-mantle boundary topography that should be investigated in future seismic studies in order to make this determination.   Seismic tomography is used to map the temperature structure of EarthÆs mantle.  Such maps can be used to estimate density patterns, which lead to mantle convection flow patterns.  However, seismic observations are incomplete and provide only a blurred view of the interior.  In Bull et al. (2010) we investigated whether the current resolution of seismic tomography is adequate to predict mantle flow patterns.  We demonstrated that it is, to first-order.  Seismic observations reveal small patches at the base of the mantle that are characterized by high density and dramatically reduced elastic moduli.  These are named ultra low velocity zones (ULVZs).  In McNamara et al. (2010), we investigated whether the locations of ULVZs can be used to map the locations of large compositional reservoirs in EarthÆs lower mantle.    We found that ULVZs are expected to be located along the margins of compositional reservoirs, which is consistent with seismic observations of ULVZs being located along the margins of large low shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the lowermost mantle (beneath the Pacific and Africa).  This provided evidence toward the hypothesis that the observed LLSVPs are compositional reservoirs.  Seismic tomography reveals large regions of the lowermost mantle with lower-than-average seismic wavespeed.  These regions are located beneath Africa and the Pacific and are named the large low shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs).  The LLSVPs have been hypothesized to be caused by compositional reservoirs, yet the cause of this compositional heterogeneity is unclear.  Competing hypotheses are that they are caused either by remnants of an early primordial layer formed early in EarthÆs history or that they are caused by the accumulation of oceanic crust that was subducted long ago.  In Li et al. (2013), we investigated this latter hypothesis, and found that it is unlikely for oceanic cr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
