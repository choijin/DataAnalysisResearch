<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds for two groups to participate in the planning for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST is a facility under consideration that will address the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are observed to be fundamental components of the Universe that do not fit within the otherwise stunningly successful Standard Model of particle physics. LSST will address these issues in a uniquely powerful way and is planned to be the most ambitious sky survey in the visible band. It will be a large, wide-field, ground-based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky. The survey will feature precision astrometry and photometry and thus will be ideal for measurements of weak lensing and the construction of transient object light curves which is ideal for Supernovae Ia cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are members of the LSST project and besides their work on the LSST calibration system they are also members of the LSST Supernova and Large Scale Structure Science collaborations. They are working on a simulation of the LSST calibration to define parameters for design and construction, and during the time frame of this award this work will transition to implementation of a calibration pipeline which will be tested on both simulated LSST raw data and real sky data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several broader impacts of this activity. At Wayne State, undergraduates are included in research via an REU/RET program. At Cincinnati, there is an active QuarkNet program which involves K-12 teachers in research and develops content that they include in their class rooms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main outcomes of this project are students with degrees. Matt Taylor a PhD student, who studied the rate of Core Collapse Supernovas with the Sloan Digital Sky survey.  The paper describing the most precise measurement of this rate based on his work is in review at a journal.  Matt has gone on to work in the IT industry.  Reba Coles works on the production of CCD camera chips in collaboration with Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.  She revived a device that measures how well these chips detect light of different colors which is crucial for turning their data into useful images.  She received an MS for her work and is continuing on for a PhD.  Shane Walton, an MS student, studied the galaxy hosts of Core Collapse Supernovas as compared to the hosts of Type Ia Supernovas.  He noted that the hosts of Type Ia Supernovas are generally redder, older, and less star forming than Core Collapse Hosts.  Shane now teaches astronomy and physics at a community college.  An undergradaute, Rachael Merritt, is continuing this work by comparing galaxies that host supernovas with all galaxies.  Laura Shishkovsky worked on comparing model Core Collapse Supernovas with observed Core Collapse Supernovas.  She received a degree in physics and went on to become a graduate student in astrophysics.  We also studied a variant of the Large Synoptic Survey's calibration system, producing a software model, which proved inferior to the system being adopted by the project, and improved a software package that is used to analyze supernova data mainly by interfacing it to the Large Synoptic Survey's observing plan.
