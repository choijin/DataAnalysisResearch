<AbstractNarration>Lewicka&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0846996&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A unifying theme in this project is the asymptotic behavior&lt;br/&gt;of given equations as the domain approaches a "degenerate" region&lt;br/&gt;in the limit.  The considered problems are nonlinear variational&lt;br/&gt;or partial differential equations, and the degeneracy in question&lt;br/&gt;can take various forms: loss of dimension, loss of regularity, or&lt;br/&gt;unboundedness.  The first set of questions relates to the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory of nonlinear elasticity, which studies large&lt;br/&gt;mechanical deformations of three-dimensional elastic bodies.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator undertakes a long-term research program, with the&lt;br/&gt;scope of: deriving lower-dimensional shell theories through the&lt;br/&gt;methods of Gamma-convergence and understanding their connections&lt;br/&gt;with the geometry of the mid-surface, analyzing the&lt;br/&gt;(infinitesimal) isometries of surfaces and the effects of&lt;br/&gt;rigidity on the derived theories, studying nonlinear phenomena&lt;br/&gt;such as buckling and blistering for a given shell under&lt;br/&gt;compression (one application is related to plant growth).  The&lt;br/&gt;second set of questions in this project relates to fluid&lt;br/&gt;dynamics.  Boundary irregularities of various structures and&lt;br/&gt;scales are considered in the limit when the boundary behavior&lt;br/&gt;becomes degenerate.  Other problems concern traveling fronts in&lt;br/&gt;combustion in unbounded channels, and the dynamics of solutions&lt;br/&gt;with large initial data under the Navier boundary conditions in&lt;br/&gt;thin three-dimensional shells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Because elastic thin (or otherwise "degenerate") objects of&lt;br/&gt;various geometries are ubiquitous in the physical world, the&lt;br/&gt;precise understanding of laws governing their equilibria has many&lt;br/&gt;potential applications.  For example, many growing tissues&lt;br/&gt;(leaves, flowers, or marine invertebrates) exhibit complicated&lt;br/&gt;configurations during their free growth and one would like to&lt;br/&gt;reproduce them with man-made means.  A related long-standing&lt;br/&gt;problem in the mathematical theory of elasticity is to rigorously&lt;br/&gt;predict theories of such lower-dimensional objects starting from&lt;br/&gt;the nonlinear theory of full three-dimensional objects.  For&lt;br/&gt;plates, a very recent effort has lead to rigorous justification&lt;br/&gt;of a hierarchy of such theories, depending on the magnitude of&lt;br/&gt;the applied forces and resulting in stretching, crumpling,&lt;br/&gt;bending, or a combination of these.  For shells (when the&lt;br/&gt;mid-surface is curved), despite extensive use of their ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;generalizations in the literature and engineering applications,&lt;br/&gt;much less is known from the mathematical point of view.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator identifies several nonlinear problems in continuum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics of solids and fluid dynamics, naturally posed in&lt;br/&gt;specific degenerate domains, with the intention of rigorously&lt;br/&gt;understanding the behavior of the system based on general&lt;br/&gt;principles.  At the heart of the program are interesting&lt;br/&gt;connections between calculus of variations, differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, geometry, material science, fluid dynamics, numerical&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and even biology.  They have a potential to deliver&lt;br/&gt;useful observations in e.g. structural mechanics, while&lt;br/&gt;integrating the goal of exposing scientific results to a broader&lt;br/&gt;community at various education levels. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
