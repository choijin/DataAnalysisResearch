    <AbstractNarration>This project develops an educational pathway for audio video systems specialists. These specialized multimedia technicians meet the industry needs of such organizations as conference centers, hotels, sports arenas and other venues requiring integrated, high technology communication needs. Specialized courses are developed in Audio Visual Technology Systems to complete the curriculum. In consultation with an advisory committee, business and industry representatives, and trade organizations, an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree is created that provides the foundation for the audio visual systems specialist. In addition to creating and implementing a curriculum for an AAS degree for audio visual systems specialists, customized business training is offered for incumbent workers. This project 1) meets industry's growing demand for entry and advanced level audio visual systems specialists, and 2) develops the educational opportunities that allow these highly specialized technicians to climb educational and career ladders. Specific activities include 1) developing curriculum, courses, and training materials; 2) recruiting students into AAS and certificate programs and corporate training; 3) developing, maintaining and strengthening industry relationships; 4) strengthening the educational continuum; and 5) disseminating the program development model, curriculum, best practices and outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
