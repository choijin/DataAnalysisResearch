<AbstractNarration>The Alma College PRISM project, Positive Routes Into Science and Mathematics, is designed to increase the number of STEM graduates through a positive retention program that creates a first-year STEM learning community and engages students by a focus on undergraduate research in the first year of study. This learning community is based upon a progressive series of freshman seminars and research opportunities. Selected STEM students are invited to participate in a summer research experience prior to their freshman year. All potential STEM enrollees will be invited to begin their PRISM experience with a pre-term PRISM seminar that occurs during the week long orientation session held for all new students preceding the start of the fall term. PRISM seminars will continue in the fall and winter terms. These seminars are especially designed to engage students in scientific inquiry and to introduce them to the excitement and opportunities available in the natural sciences. Alma's unique four-week spring term is being used to offer PRISM inquiry-based courses that are designed to provide direct laboratory and field research experience. STEM students may then apply for a summer research opportunity under the direction of a faculty member. In addition to the PRISM Program, curricular changes, especially at the freshman level, are being made to introduce innovative improvements in teaching and learning in the STEM classroom and laboratory. A college-wide PRISM research community has been created to support research efforts at a variety of levels involving students and faculty mentors. To attract students and faculty into the research community and extend the reach of PRISM, high school teachers, along with some of their best rising seniors, are being invited to participate in summer research teams.  &lt;br/&gt;High school students entering Alma are recruited into the PRISM program by engaging them in research activities and by creating an exciting vision of joining a STEM learning community that focuses on undergraduate research as soon as they walk onto Alma College's campus. This design of this project has developed by a variety of campus constituents and from expert advice received by faculty members employed on other campuses.  &lt;br/&gt;Few colleges are currently offering research opportunities to first year students. The Alma College PRISM program (either selective aspects or in its entirety) has the potential for becoming a model for other colleges and universities, especially small liberal arts colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major Outcomes from NSF-STEP Award to Alma College     1. First year STEM enrollment went from 147 in 2008 to 178 in 2014.      2. The number of STEM majors graduating increased from 82 to 123 in 2015.  The % of all graduates that were STEM majors increased from 28% in 2008 to 42% in 2015.  Graduation rates for students who participated in the 10-week summer research program and ASPIRE (one-week research experience for incoming students) are summarized below:     10 week summer research graduation rates:   2013 100%  2014 94.4%  2015 87.5%  Overall average = 94%     ASPIRE graduation rates:  2014 87%  2015 79.5%  Overall average  =  83%     These data compare to the overall graduation rate of 55%(2013), 59%(2104), 57% (2015).     3. The number of students doing undergraduate research in the summer has increased from 12 in 2008 to 42 in 2015.            Dissemination:     Over the five years of the grant, we have disseminated the results of the program at a number of conferences, via the STEMcentral website, and at our PRISM website as indicated below.     Presentations:  AAC+U STEM Conferences 2011, 2013  CUR Conference 2014  NSF-STEP Conference 2009-2014     STEMcentral:  Undergraduate Research Group (John Davis moderator)  Webinar, Fall 2014 on First-Year Undergraduate Research        Sustainability:     One of our goals this year was to focus on sustainability.  Key aspects of the program have been sustained as indicated below.  ASPIRE:  Recognizing the importance of the ASPIRE program, Alma College is now funding the ASPIRE program beginning with Summer of 2015.  FIRST-YEAR SUMMER RESEARCH PROGRAM  First-year students can use their Alma College Venture Award ($2500 awarded to every student at Alma College) to support their summer research experience.  PEER MENTOR PROGRAM:  With significant assistance from the Center for Student Opportunity(CSO), the PRISM Peer Mentor program is now very effective in our PRISM Seminars and Summer Research Program.  The CSO has taking over the PRISM peer mentor program including funding the program.  Leveraging of NSF-PRISM program     Successes from our NSF PRISM program were used to obtain a $5 million grant from the Dow Foundation in the Fall of 2014. The grant entitled "e-STEM: Enhancing STEM Education and Practice" addresses deficiencies in the K-16 STEM pipeline by building on past success. Its multifaceted approach strengthens student interest in STEM fields by enhancing opportunities at Alma College and K-12 schools to engage in STEM research.

In these ways the project engage students with contemporary STEM issues, linking them with the problem-solving foundations of science, and propelling them toward STEM careers.
