<AbstractNarration>Abstract: Automated intrusive algorithms for numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulation of partial differential equations via software-based&lt;br/&gt;Frechet differentiation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computers were invented to automate tedious and error-prone numerical&lt;br/&gt;computations; ironically, programming computers is itself a tedious&lt;br/&gt;and error-prone task. Given the importance and expense of developing&lt;br/&gt;scientific simulation programs, it is worth studying whether computers&lt;br/&gt;can improve the development, as well as the execution, of these&lt;br/&gt;programs.  This project focuses on the open-source software Sundance,&lt;br/&gt;which automates transition from high-level mathematical abstractions&lt;br/&gt;to high-performance, parallel partial differential equation (PDE)&lt;br/&gt;simulation code, freeing users from the burden of low-level&lt;br/&gt;programming.  This approach can reduce simulator development time from&lt;br/&gt;months or years to days or even hours. Less obvious, but equally&lt;br/&gt;important, benefits of basing software firmly on mathematical&lt;br/&gt;abstractions are that internal performance improvements can be&lt;br/&gt;automated, and that intrusive algorithms -- algorithms that require&lt;br/&gt;transformation of the equation set to produce nonstandard operators --&lt;br/&gt;can be implemented much more easily because such transformations can&lt;br/&gt;be carried out automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is enabled by formulating programming tasks as mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems whose solutions are then automated. Central to this is a &lt;br/&gt;theorem establishing Frechet differentiation as a ``bridge'' between&lt;br/&gt;high-level symbolic programming and high-performance numerical&lt;br/&gt;computing.  Previous work has laid the foundations for this; this&lt;br/&gt;extends those results work to other aspects of PDE simulation and to&lt;br/&gt;non-PDE paradigms such as density functional theory (DFT), and &lt;br/&gt;investigates intrusive preconditioners for coupled multiphysics&lt;br/&gt;problems.  The combination of automatic high performance and&lt;br/&gt;the ready availability of efficient intrusive algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;preconditioning, sensitivity analysis, and PDE-constrained&lt;br/&gt;optimization makes it possible for a high-level, general-purpose tool&lt;br/&gt;such as Sundance to actually outperform hand-coded special-purpose&lt;br/&gt;simulators.  The ready availability of advanced optimization&lt;br/&gt;algorithms with finite element discretizations for nonlinear coupled&lt;br/&gt;systems, all with efficient implementation and a short development&lt;br/&gt;cycle, will be transformative to how computational scientists work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
