<AbstractNarration>A Darwin 2009 Celebration Meeting will be held at the American Museum of Natural History and Stony Brook University over a 5-day period to honor the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin?s Origin of Species.  The meeting will combine public outreach and teacher workshop activities at the Museum with formal presentations and informal discussions at the University.  The goals of the meeting are to analyze history of ideas in evolutionary biology, discuss contemporary fields of inquiry and future research directions, analyze the impact of evolutionary thinking for disciplines outside biology, such as philosophy, sociology and humanities, and promote translation of science to the general public and media through education and outreach.  The meeting is designed to provide opportunities for intellectual discourse and development of evolutionary biology in a broad sense with potential impact on research agendas and funding priorities for the near future.  The meeting also will include significant outreach components targeted at science teachers and the general public with the goal of increasing understanding of science.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
