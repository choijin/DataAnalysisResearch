<AbstractNarration>This project will develop and operate a community infrastructure, CRCNS.ORG, to enable the sharing of data needed by the computational neuroscience community, to enhance and foster collaborations among theoretical and experimental researchers, and to further the development and testing of computational theories of brain function. This infrastructure will widen the spectrum of techniques applied to brain data, enabling discoveries that go beyond the scopes of individual laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infrastructure targets the communities of neuroscience and related fields such as computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics, and engineering in which investigators seek access to high-quality neurophysiology data, including electrical, magnetic, and optical recordings from single neurons, neural ensembles, and brain regions. Development activities are aimed at lowering the barriers to contributing, accessing, and using neurophysiology data.  Standardized methods will be developed for storing and annotating data in a self-describing, hierarchical format, and enabling flexible on-line access. Scalable methods will be developed to enable users to find potentially useful data and to provide means for online visualization and some on-line analysis. Operations activities will support users and data contributors as well as community outreach activities. Three summer training courses will be held to introduce students and researchers to methods and conventions concerning organization, visualization, and analysis of neuroscience data, and how to use the specific resources of the repository.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tackling one of the remaining grand challenges of mankind, understanding the function of the brain, will require the concerted efforts by individuals with diverse expertise to analyze neuroscience data.  To better enable analysis of neuroscience data, this project supported three main activities:  a) development and operation of a community infrastructure to make neuroscience data publicly available; b) development of standards for storing neuroscience data to make it easer to use shared neuroscience data; and c) presenting courses to train students and researchers in methods for analyzing neuroscience data.  The community infrastructure established as part of this project is CRCNS.org.  This repository makes neuroscience data publicly available so it can be widely used for research, teaching and learning purposes.  CRCNS stands for "Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience".  The name describes one of the goals of the initiative, which is to facilitate collaborative research between experimental neuroscientists, who gather neuroscience data, and computational neuroscientists, who develop theories of brain function.  Data at the resource is also used by researchers in mathematics, statistics, machine learning, computer science, as well as by instructors and students.  The resource was established in 2008 and now hosts about 3.1 TB of neuroscience data that are contained in 58 data sets.  This data has been downloaded and used to create at least 116 publications.  New data is periodically being added to the repository.  To allow efficient use of the data, standard formats for storing the data must be developed so that those who access the data will be able to start analyzing it with a minimal investment required to learn the format of the data.  As part of this project, effort has been devoted to develop standard formats for different types of neuroscience data.  These results have been coordinated with the INCF (International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility) and more recently, the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) initiative.  This has produced a requirements document available at the INCF website and also the NWB alpha format for neurophysiology data, which is described at nwb.org.  Effective analysis of neuroscience data requires using state-of-the art techniques, which are continuously being developed and refined.  To train individuals in methods of analyzing neuroscience data, this project hosted four times (in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015), a two-week summer course titled "Mining and modeling of Neuroscience data."  The course is "hands on" in that it includes exercises in how to use and modify existing software tools, and apply them, to data sets, such as those available in the CRCNS.org repository.  Each year, from six to eight instructors taught, all were renowned experts from the US or Europe.  In addition to the main course faculty, there were also evening lectures given by neuroscientists from the larger San Francisco Bay Area presenting their research using quantitative approaches.  Approximately 30 students attended each course.  About half had a background in a quantitative field outside neuroscience, such as physics or mathematics, and the course was instrumental in helping them to start a career within neuroscience.  Surveys taken after the courses showed that majority of students who completed each course consistently ranked it as excellent.  The neuroscience data made available as part of this project is very expensive to obtain and typically requires the use of laboratory animals.  By making this data publicly available, this project enables the maximal usage of this data and also minimizes the need to collect such data again.  The project improves human resource allocation in neuroscience because it enables experimental data gathered in a single experiment to be analyzed from many different angles by multiple research groups.  Analysis of the data and the training provided as part of this pro...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
