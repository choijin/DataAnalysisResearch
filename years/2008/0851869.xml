<AbstractNarration>The University of North Dakota REU Site, a partnership of the North Dakota Association of Tribal Colleges (NDATC) and the University of North Dakota (UND), will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009 through 2013. Ten students will be selected each summer to work on neuroscience projects under the mentorship of UND faculty. Students from Tribal and rural colleges will be recruited to participate in the program. All students will be paired with faculty mentors and will conduct their research at the University of North Dakota. The primary objectives of the program are to (1) foster academic and social independence, (2) promote an interest in research and science careers, and (3) encourage professional development for student participants. Students will initially receive one week of training in cell, molecular and imaging techniques, and then develop their own research project under the mentorship of faculty. Students will attend weekly professional development sessions that will include instructions in oral and written presentations, data analysis, and proper research conduct. Students will be expected to present their findings at an end-of-session Symposium, which will prepare them for professional scientific presentations at a regional or national meeting. Salary, travel, room and board will be provided for all students. Childcare funding is available from UND, if needed. The hope is that participating American Indian and rural students will choose to pursue graduate degrees in the sciences and return to their communities to help strengthen science education, research and literacy. Applications and other relevant information are available at http://www.und.nodak.edu/instruct/spyle, or from Drs. Bennett (bbennett@ndatc.org), Van Doze (vdoze@medicine.nodak.edu) and Sally Pyle (sally.pyle@und.nodak.edu).</AbstractNarration>

This summer 10-week REU program leverages institutional resources and NSF supplements to include additional students, a limited number of repeat experiences, and child care for participants who could not attend without it. This REU continues through summer 2018 in a new form with two tribal college partners and an expanded research focus on gene regulation. Special emphasis is placed on recruiting students with limited research opportunities, women and underrepresented minorities.</p> <p>This report covers 2009-2014. During this grant period, 55 students completed 60 summer experiences (5 &ldquo;repeats&rdquo;). Of these 55 students, 15 (27%) were from tribal colleges, 4 (7%) from other community colleges, 22 (40%) from primarily undergraduate institutions that have only limited research opportunities, 6 (11%) from larger universities, and 8 (15%) from the host institution which included 4 transfer students from tribal colleges who did repeat experiences. Overall, 34 (62%) of the REU participants were from institutions located in rural areas/small towns; one (2%) was from a historically black college<strong> </strong>and two (4%) from Hispanic-serving institutions. Over half of the REU participants had completed two years or less of college. Of these 55 students, 30 (54%) were white, 21 (38%) American Indian, 2 (4%) Hispanic, 1 (2%) black, and 1 (2%) Asian; 40 (73%) were female; and 17 (31%) will be the first in their families to graduate from college. In addition, one (2%) student had a disability and one (2%) was a military veteran.

Each summer since 2010, REU participants completed a pre and post survey, reporting demographics, personal characteristics, and satisfaction with the summer research experience, its impact on them, and their academic and career intentions. REU participants have been highly satisfied with the summer research experience, including their responsibility, their lab and mentor, and the project on which they worked (see Chart 1.
