<AbstractNarration>DMR-0847535&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop novel nanostructured inorganic materials with programmable physical and chemical properties. The approach involves new chemistry for solution-based fabrication of inorganic functional materials from nanoscale building blocks. Specifically, functional nanostructured phases will be synthesized by combining colloidal inorganic nanomaterials (metal and semiconductor clusters, nanocrystals, nanowires, etc) and molecular metal chalcogenide complexes. Various molecular metal chalcogenide complexes, such as SnS44-, Sn2Se64-, In2Se42-, Ge4S104- will be used to completely replace original hydrocarbon surface ligands at the surface of colloidal metal and semiconductor nanostructures. After formation of a nanostructured assembly, new surface ligands will be converted into an inorganic solid, linking individual nano-building blocks into a macroscopic array of strongly electronically coupled functional modules. The project will combine the development of synthetic methodologies, detailed structural, electronic and optical characterizations of new materials and fabrication of prototype electronic and optoelectronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop a generalized methodology for preparation of nanostructured inorganic materials through ?modular? self-assembly of nanoscale functional building blocks. This approach may lead to a novel class of solution processed semiconductors for the applications ranging from solar cells to thermoelectric heat converters, light-emitting devices and printable electronics. The integration of research and educational components will generate broad outreach and educational activities including participation in the conceptual design and development of the Nanoscience exhibit for Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. The Museum attracts approximately 2 million visitors per year, nearly 280,000 children in school groups and youth organizations visited the Museum in 2007. Aimed at inspiring youth to consider education and careers in the physical and biological sciences, the objective of new exhibit is to convey the excitement of modern scientific research, its multidisciplinary nature, and the synergy between different areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Within this NSF CAREER project we worked out ideas for designing nanomaterial surfaces in a way that was very different from everything tried before. Instead of traditionally-used organic surface coatings, we introduced fully inorganic ligands for colloidal nanomaterials. As a first example, we used "metal chalcogenide complexes" (MCCs), shown in Figure 1, which are a rich family of molecular species combining only metals and chalcogens. We found that MCCs have a very high affinity to surfaces of different nanocrystals (NCs) and nanowires (Figure 1B). The nanostructures with attached MCC ligands can be used as all-inorganic building blocks that form stable colloidal solutions.

We also used NC-MCC chemistry to fabricate thermoelectric Bi2?xSbxTe3 nanostructured (Figure 2C).    Broader impacts:   Contribution to the development of human resources. This project helped my students and postdocs to develop intellectual leadership in science and engineering. Two high school students have been introduced to research and worked my lab.

Four of postdocs started independent academic careers in leading institutions.   Outreach to policy makers and business leaders at the Science and Technology in Society (STS) Forum in Kyoto, Japan. The STS Forums is a platform for dialogue between scientific, industrial and political leaders. In 2011 the Forum participants represented over 90 countries, including 30 Ministers in charge of science and technology policy, 9 Nobel Laureates, over 100 top business executives and 17 Science Academy Presidents. I was selected by the New York Academy of Sciences to represent young scientists of North America.
