<AbstractNarration>The MVZ Genetic Resources Collection currently is maintained in electrically powered ultra-cold freezers, but will be transitioned in this project to liquid nitrogen freezers. Liquid nitrogen freezers are superior to ultra-cold freezers in several respects, including (1) lack of dependence on electricity to maintain temperature (a critical safeguard should there be an extended loss of electricity following an earthquake on the nearby Hayward Fault), and (2) samples are maintained at -150 degrees C (eliminating tissue degradation that persists at -80 C ultra-cold temperatures). The entire collection (encompassing ~100,000 tissue vials) also will be inventoried and bar-coded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genetic resources collection is among the largest tissue collections in the world, with worldwide geographical coverage. It is a resource for researchers throughout the world who undertake genetic studies of vertebrate species, and includes samples representing extinct species, as well as populations extirpated by anthropogenic habitat modification and infectious disease. This project will substantially reduce the energy usage and carbon footprint of the Berkeley campus. The UC Berkeley Office of Sustainability, the Campus Climate Action Partnership (Cal CAP), and the Strategic Energy Plan will showcase it as an example of how careful management of energy emissions can be undertaken without compromising academic research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary objective of this project was to transition the University of California, Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology's Genetic Resources Collection from an aging bank of ultracold freezers to liquid nitrogen-cooled cryofreezers. We had six primary motivations for making this conversion. First, the UC Campus straddles the Hayward Fault, which is considered to be one of the most dangerous urban fault zones in the U.S. An extended electrical power outage resulting from a major earthquake could have resulted in catastrophic loss of the entire genetic resources collection. LN2 freezers do not require continuous electrical power and are therefore much safer under these circumstances. Second, LN2 freezers maintain samples at -150&deg;C in vapor-phase, which effectively eliminates thermally-induced tissue degradation. In contrast, ultra-cold freezer storage at -80&deg;C allows continued (albeit very slow) tissue degradation. Third, ultra-cold freezers have substantial electrical requirements and large maintenance costs that were eliminated by taking them off-line. Fourth, by taking these ultracold freezers off-line, we substantially reduced our carbon footprint. Not only did we eliminate the electricty usage that was required by the freezers themselves, but we also substantially lessened our impact on our building's climate control system (we were told by our campus facilities team that the combination ofr direct electricty usage and overtaxing of our climate control system was consuming ~3% of the VLSB's power - and this is the largest building on the UCB campus). Fifth, the aging bank of nine ultra-cold freezers that housed the MVZ tissue collection required replacement, making this an opportune time to switch to a more appropriate storage procedure. Sixth, the space that previously housed the tissue collection limited further growth of the collection because there was no room for additional freezers, and electrical usage in the room had reached maximum capacity. With the transition to LN2 storage, the MVZ tissue collection was moved to a facility on the first floor of the Valley Life Sciences Building with more space for growth, and without need for major electrical and climate control improvements.</p> <p>To complete the transition to LN2 storage, we renovated and re-purposed an&nbsp;existing&nbsp;ground floor workspace, including upgrading the space's ventilation system, installing rack mounting, wiring the room for internet service, installing oxygen sensors, and installing the three massive LN2 freezers. Once the facility was prepared, we processed approximately 95,000 tissue vials, many of which required new cryovials, and all of which were bar-coded, inventoried, and linked to the MVZ&rsquo;s Arctos database (which is fully searchable on-line) prior to installation in the LN2 freezers. This project resulted in the training of a project manager, 17 undergraduate students who were involved in tissue curation, and one postbaccalaureate student who worked on all aspects of the project and assisted in the management of undergraduate student workers. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/03/2013<br>      Modified by: Jimmy&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mcguire</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/0846349/0846349_10027048_1370292844094_LN2_Lab_reduced--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/0846349/0846349_10027048_1370292844094_LN2_Lab_reduced--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MVZ LN2 facility"><img src...]]></DRECONTENT>
