<AbstractNarration>The ?Integration of Education and Mentoring Programs at Louisiana State University? is an&lt;br/&gt;institutional effort designed to integrate a large number of on-going programs at LSU, especially those led by the newly established Louisiana State University (LSU) Office of Strategic Initiatives and LSU?s Gordon A. Cain Center for Scientific, Technological, Engineering and Mathematical Literacy.  The PI/Co-PIs have altogether 50 on-going education/mentoring/research grants; the majority of those are funded by NSF.  These projects are currently supporting over 50 Ph.D. students, 300 undergraduate students, hundreds of high school teachers, and thousands of K-12 students. Therefore, an integration of those programs under the umbrella of NSF/Innovation through Institutional Integration (I3) is appropriate. While all other projects on campus will be invited to participate, we will ensure that, under the overall leadership of OSI, the integration and coordination of a critical pool of core projects will be made through their PI/Co-PIs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integration of the various projects will be a challenging bureaucratic, cultural and programmatic enterprise. It will be necessary to cross department and college boundaries, address different academic cultures and norms, and ensure the integrity of the programs, especially with regard to adding to and not diluting their impact.  To accomplish this, the integration efforts will be coordinated by OSI and led by the PIs/Co-PIs of the various projects.  The I3 project will focus on the following: (1) Consolidation of Summer Workshops and Camps for Students, Teachers and Faculty Members; (2) Leadership Training in Academics through a Student-Governing Organization; (3) High School Math Tutoring Program by College Students; (4) Mentoring High School Louisiana Science and Engineering Fair Projects by College Students; and (5) Integration of Research into Education in Materials Engineering and Science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Integration of Education and Mentoring Programs at Louisiana State University (I3 Initiative) was an institutional effort designed to synergistically integrate a large number of on-going education and mentoring programs at LSU, especially those led by the Louisiana State University (LSU) Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI) and LSUÆs Gordon A. Cain Center for Scientific, Technological, Engineering and Mathematical Literacy (CC). To date, the integration of those programs under the umbrella of NSF/Innovation through Institutional Integration (I3) has forged strong connections across the LSU campus through its many research and outreach programs.  I3 Goals  Nurture our students in an interdisciplinary environment so that they will become inspirational teachers, exemplary mentors, and effective leaders; Raise LSUÆs academic standing through outstanding achievements by students and faculty; Create and implement programs that broaden the participation of more diversified students and faculty; and Enhance the academic environment to better support LSU students, who will subsequently transfer their service to K-12 education.   I3 Objectives  Educate and mentor our students and the public to have sufficient knowledge of what lies across these boundaries; Innovatively integrate all education and mentoring summer programs for college faculty and students as well as high school teachers and students; Provide a higher level of leadership training for LSU students; Integrate the STEM research between college and high school students; Establish a mechanism for college students to volunteer their effort in tutoring high school students; and, Establish an interdisciplinary curriculum in materials science and engineering at LSU as well as collecting and demonstrating its relevant facilities for students.   All activities toward these goals and objectives were organized under five tasks:  Consolidation of Summer Workshops / Camps for Students, Teachers and Faculty Leadership Training in Academics through a Student-Governing Organization High School Math Tutoring Program by College Students Mentoring High School Science and Engineering Fair Projects by College Students Integration of Research into Education in Materials Engineering and Science       The intellectual merit of this project is to: (1) build a successful integration model in the STEM disciplines based upon the breadth and depth of leadership and infrastructure provided by the LSU Office of Strategic Initiatives; (2) assist students in their professional development towards advanced degrees; (3) create an interdisciplinary curriculum in materials engineering and science; and (4) develop a Hierarchical Mentoring Ladder system involving faculty members, graduate/undergraduate students, and high school teachers/students.  The broader impacts of this project include the following: (1) The establishment of collaborations among faculty members in different disciplines and different academic settings, from high schools, to community colleges and comprehensive research universities; (2) An increase in the number of well-prepared high school, undergraduate, and graduate STEM students; (3) Broadening participation of women and under-represented minorities in the STEM disciplines; (4) Promotion of inter-cultural participation among non-minority and minority students and faculty members; and (5) Outreach activities by providing tutoring or teacher assistant service to high schools during the academic year.
