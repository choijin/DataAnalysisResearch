<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award focuses on the evolution of the human brain, cognition, and related behavioral responses to environmental change. The program integrates cross-disciplinary research training in a unique mix of disciplines, namely archeology, biomechanics and engineering, cognitive science, comparative and experimental functional morphology, ecology, evolutionary and developmental biology, genetics, geochemistry, morphometrics, life history, molecular biology, neuroscience, and paleoclimatology. Innovative educational and training aspects include an emphasis on collaboration via group problem-based learning approaches, required laboratory rotations in two different disciplines, and seminars in ethics and professional conduct. The program combines George Washington University?s PhD program in Hominid Paleobiology with the Howard University PhD in Physiology and Biophysics, together with faculty from the Smithsonian Institution and Johns Hopkins University?s Center for Functional Anatomy and Evolution, The collaboration with Howard University (an HBCU) and existing and planned internship programs for undergraduates will increase the recruitment of underrepresented minorities. Outreach activities include a required internship in the public understanding of science, in conjunction with area institutions such as the National Geographic Society, USA Today, NPR, the National Academy of Sciences, American Anthropological Association, local schools and others. The program offers research-training opportunities at major international institutions in Europe (e.g., Max Planck Institut für evolutionäre Anthropologie (MPIEA); Swedish Museum of Natural History; Università degli Studi di Firenze?s Laboratori di Antropologia; University of Bordeaux), China and Africa.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
