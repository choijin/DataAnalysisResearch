<AbstractNarration>Stratigraphic, Geochemical, and Paleobiological Tests of the Co-Evolution of Multicellular Life and Environment in the Late Ediacaran Period &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alan J. Kaufman, University of Maryland&lt;br/&gt;Shuhai Xiao, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&lt;br/&gt;Dima Grazhdankin, Russian Academy of Sciences &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The PIs will undertake a basin-wide stratigraphic, geochemical, and paleobiological study of the carbonate-dominated Khatyspyt Formation in remote northern Siberia.  Ediacaran fossils in this unit are remarkably preserved in fine-grained carbonates, promising a much enhanced anatomical and paleoecological view of Earths earliest animals.  Insofar as the Ediacaran biota may have required abundant free oxygen to sustain metabolic activities, we hypothesize that their distribution may track environmental conditions, and propose tests of this linkage through high resolution time-series analyses of carbon and sulfur isotopes in multiple equivalent sections across the Khatyspyt depositional basin as well as other biological, elemental and isotopic indicators of redox conditions. The Khatyspyt Formation contains a wide range of unique carbonate-hosted Ediacaran organisms, as well as carbonaceous macrofossils, small shelly fossils, trace fossils and planktonic microfossils all in a single, 450-m-thick continuous succession cropping out along the Olenek, Khorbosuonka and Lena rivers.  Results of the study should provide insights to the phenomenon of soft tissue preservation, increase the ecological resolution of the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, and provide important constraints on the history of Earths earliest metazoans and the oceans in which they originated, diversified, and ultimately perished.  The primary aim of this field and laboratory based proposal is to test whether the geologically brief Ediacaran experiment in complex multicellular life was controlled by the oxidation state of shallow marine environments. The proposed research will establish a new international collaboration with colleagues in Russia, and require two month-long field seasons above the Arctic Circle in northern Siberia.  Graduate students from both U.S. institutions will accompany the PIs in the field, providing them with an enhanced learning experience that will promote both scientific and cultural exchange.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our field research documented that the succession in the Olenek  Uplift of arctic Siberia was stratigraphically truncated by a thick  boulder-bearing and poorly-sorted diamictite of mixed glacial and  volcanic origin near the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary (around 542 million  years ago).   High resolution time-series carbon and sulfur isotopic measurements  of carbonate rocks below this critical transition, which contain a  unique fossil assemblage of EarthÆs earliest complex multicellular  animals, reflect significant fluctuations in environmental conditions  through the end of the Ediacaran Period.  These include strong  surface-to-deep gradients in the abundance of oxygen and of sulfate &ndash; an  important oxidant used by a class of micro-organisms that consume  nearly half of the organic matter in Modern ocean sediments &ndash; in the  depositional basin. The chemical gradients in seawater were likely  harnessed by other micro-organisms, including photoautotrophs that  utilized hydrogen sulfide rather than water for a source of electrons to  reduce carbon dioxide to organic matter, and heterotrophic bacteria  that consumed methane or oxidized toxic hydrogen sulfide to run their  metabolic activities. Insofar as the enigmatic soft-bodied animals that  populated this shallow marine environment were able to survive in  oxygen-deficient and potentially hydrogen sulfide-rich seawater, some  may have harbored bacteria within their bodies in a symbiotic  relationship, similar to Modern day tube worms living near hydrothermal  vents.  The Ediacara biota in the Siberian strata disappeared abruptly  in strata below the diamictite, which we associate with the glaciation  and a profound disturbance in the carbon cycle.  On the other hand, above the diamictite the Siberian sedimentary  rocks we studied preserve fossil evidence of the æCambrian ExplosionÆ of  animals &ndash; the geologically sudden appearance of the basic biological  patterns and body plans that would form the basis of Modern animals. A  volcanic ash horizon near the top of the succession was discovered  during our stratigraphic investigations.  Zircons extracted from the ash  were characterized and age dated using two different but complementary  U-Pb techniques.  Both resulted in ages around 530 million years for the  volcanic ash. The new age constraint coupled with biostratigraphic and  isotopic data from the same succession indicate that the fuse for the  Cambrian was several million years shorter than previously predicted,  burning for perhaps 9 to 10 million years after ignition following the  potential glacial episode near the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary.  Comparative paleontological and isotopic analysis of time-equivalent  terminal Ediacaran Period strata in South China and in Early Cambrian  aged strata in Newfoundland were conducted as part of this project.  For  the Ediacaran, we find important contrasts in the time series  geochemistry of the sedimentary archives in Siberia and South China that  suggest chemical heterogeneity between ocean basins. The inter-basinal  contrasts complicate the correlation of sedimentary horizons and the  reconstruction of the general oxidation state of late Ediacaran ocean  masses. For the Early Cambrian, our paleontological, sedimentological,  and isotopic evidence from Newfoundland suggests that Early Cambrian   environmental conditions may have been progressively stabilized by   animals that were the first to stir up and ventilate the sediments in   the search for food and shelter.
