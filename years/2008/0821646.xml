<AbstractNarration>0821646&lt;br/&gt;Lefticariu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding (69%) to acquire an IRMS system and three sample preparation peripherals for research, education and training. The instrument will support multiple disciplines (geology, zoology, wildlife science, fisheries, chemistry, biochemistry, plant biology, anthropology, coal research, engineering and microbiology). Specific are: 1) Thermo Delta V with dual inlet, 2) Gasbench II, 3) an EA and 4) a TC-EA for compound-specific and &amp;#61540;D analysis. Specific science questions to be addressed include: Radiation chemistry studies involve the study of energy transfer from radiological particles to water procuring ionic and hydrated and radical forms. These oxidizing species form be the basis of chemoautotrophy. This process may leave a fingerprint in terms of oxygen and sulfur isotope fractionation. Results may lead to better predictions for uranium deposits. Illinois is a large supplier of coal, but it is relatively high in sulfur content (&gt; 2%). The PI intends to perform representative analyses of (C, N, H, and S isotope) Illinois coal deposits. Benthic foraminifera O and C isotope ratios will be assessed and used to define paleoclimate proxies in Antarctica (specifically the Larsen Ice Shelf). IRMS resources will be used for elemental rock geochemistry, fluid inclusion thermometry, and radiometric dating. In-house instrumentation will allow more rapid production of preliminary data ? feeding more timely proposal and paper submissions and greater graduate student training and support. Stable carbon isotope analysis would be applied to samples from the event horizon coinciding with human settlement into sub-Arctic North America. Isotopes would be able to differentiate between natural and extraterrestrial carbon species in the sedimentary record. Stable isotope analysis in otoliths will be used to understand fish diets and environmental history. Emphasis will be on the impacts of agricultural runoff on fish diets. 15N will be used to study food web dynamics in streams and its relation to amphibian extinctions Trophic structure will be elucidated relative to primary plant producers (C3 vs C4). Colloid/particle partitioning of contaminants will be studied taking advantage of the natural variations in stable isotope ratios in contaminants. The management plan the IRMS housed in the SIUC Mass Spectrometry Facility. A dedicated staff scientist will be hired to support the instrument. A salary support commitment for the technician (3 years) has been offered by the administration. The staff scientist will be responsible for supporting instrument maintenance, scheduling, training, and collaboration. Sample remuneration will be one means of in-house support. Charges will be based on the level of sample pre-preparation. In-class lecture/lab will be supported. The acquisition would support 20 projects supported y 10 different agencies spanned over 9 PIs and their 45 students. The instrument will be incorporated into Research Experiences for Undergraduates and SIUC-Undergraduate Workshop programs. Support will be given to 23 female and 7 underrepresented students. The IRMS is planned to support 18 courses within 4 departments at SIUC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
