<AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. John Conboy of the University of Utah. Prof. Conboy and his students will study the origin of phospholipid asymmetry in simple model membrane systems. Compositional asymmetry in the lipid membrane is thought to play a crucial role in membrane structural stability, intercellular signaling, and the organization of membrane-associated components. Prof. Conboy and his students will use sum frequency vibrational spectroscopy (SFVS) to directly measure the trans bilayer movement of phospholipids and asymmetry in a variety of membrane models to determine the rate of exchange of native phospholipids.  SFVS will also be used to measure membrane asymmetry, kinetics of transmembrane migration, and thermodynamic analysis of the transition state barrier to migration. Success of the proposed studies will have wide-reaching implications in molecular and cellular biology. The study will provide excellent educational training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees in a highly multidisciplinary research area involving the development and application of state of the art no-linear spectroscopic methods in complex biological systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All life as we know it is cellular in nature.  One of the crucial components of cells is the membrane which separates a cell from its environment.  A cell membranes is composed of a variety of components (proteins, carbohydrates, cholesterol) supported in a lipid matrix only two molecules thick, (Figure 1). All lipids share the same basic structure: a polar headgroup and a fatty, non-polar tail. This physical structure of a lipid allows them to organize spontaneously into the characteristic two layer or "bilayer" structure where the polar headgroups point outward and the fatty tails point inward to form a non-polar core.   The specific location (inside versus outside layer) of a lipid in a cell membrane plays a direct role in the function and health of cells. Specifically, it is known that cellular membranes contain a nonrandom and unequal distribution of various lipid types between the two layers of the membrane. The asymmetric distribution of this lipid in the membrane has been linked to  a myriad of diseases, including AlzheimerÆs, TangierÆs disease, and Scott syndrome.   Despite our growing knowledge about where and why lipids are distributed within a cell membrane, there is a lack of information about how lipids are arranged in a specific distribution. A fundamental understanding of lipid behavior is required to fully understand lipid asymmetry. The research funded by this NSF grant directly investigated native lipid behavior as well as biological interactions that may contribute lipid asymmetry within a cell membrane.
