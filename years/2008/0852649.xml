<AbstractNarration>Fabian Monrose&lt;br/&gt;John Hopkins Unversity&lt;br/&gt;0546350&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Several fundamental security mechanisms for restricting access to&lt;br/&gt;network resources rely on the ability of a reference monitor to&lt;br/&gt;inspect the contents of traffic as it traverses the network.  However,&lt;br/&gt;with the increasing popularity of cryptographic protocols the&lt;br/&gt;traditional means of inspecting packet contents to enforce security&lt;br/&gt;policies is no longer a viable approach as message contents are&lt;br/&gt;concealed by encryption. This project encompasses the first major&lt;br/&gt;component of a principled investigation into the feasibility of&lt;br/&gt;protocol identification based solely on those features that remain&lt;br/&gt;intact after encryption---namely, the packet size, inter-arrival and&lt;br/&gt;direction. More specifically, this work attempts to provide a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the limits of protocol recognition based on a&lt;br/&gt;thorough statistical analysis and information theoretic assessment of&lt;br/&gt;the available features in protocol behaviors observed in the&lt;br/&gt;wild. Specifically, this project advances the current state of the art&lt;br/&gt;and contributes to the scientific community by building efficient&lt;br/&gt;mixture models for detecting protocols with multi-modal behaviors,&lt;br/&gt;designing practical tools for visualizing behavioral motifs in TCP&lt;br/&gt;sequences, providing new information-theoretic decision policies for&lt;br/&gt;assigning protocol class labels to these sequences, and imparting new&lt;br/&gt;notions for assessing realistic masquerading attacks and the&lt;br/&gt;appropriate defenses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
