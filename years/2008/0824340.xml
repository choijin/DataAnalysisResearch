<AbstractNarration>0824340&lt;br/&gt;Jeremiah T. Abiade, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&lt;br/&gt;BRIGE: An Integrated Research and Educational Approach to High Efficiency Nanocomposite Thermoelectric Materials and Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The demands for efficient and clean energy are driving the intense search for nonpolluting, renewable energy sources to replace dwindling supplies of oil, coal, and gas. Thermoelectric devices can harvest waste energy and directly convert it into electrical energy, which is crucial as approximately 70% of our total primary energy is lost as waste heat. To date, thermoelectric materials and devices have been relegated to niche applications because of the low efficiency of the energy conversion process. Significant improvements in the thermoelectric materials? properties are required to realize the full potential of thermoelectric energy conversion devices. In this research we will focus on a class of promising thermoelectric materials called oxides. We will use pulsed laser deposition to deposit oxide thin/thick film thermoelectric materials with self-assembled nanoparticles embedded in the bulk of the films. Oxides are attractive because of their stability in high-temperature, high-humidity environments. The unique features of our proposed research are: 1) Emphasis on oxide thermoelectrics, a relatively new research field; 2) Use of self-assembled nanoinclusions to minimize thermal conductivity in oxide thermoelectrics through pulsed laser deposition; and 3) Integration of optimized structures into thermoelectric devices for waste heat recovery and low-power applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  This NSF-BRIGE project will be used as a platform to launch our program, Success Through Enthusiasm and Awareness of Materials Engineering Research (STEAMER). Project STEAMER is a summer research program for women and ethnic minority students. The outreach component of this project will prepare students from underrepresented groups for careers in engineering research. We believe that the mentoring and skills the students receive during this project will encourage them to pursue doctoral degrees and eventually develop research programs worthy of NSF support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
