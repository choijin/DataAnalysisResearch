<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The University of Central Oklahoma, in collaboration with eight other universities and community and technical colleges, is continuing to enhance a statewide network of institutions to increase recruitment, retention and graduation of students in STEM disciplines.  The Oklahoma project, STEM Double Bridge: Connecting High Schools, Community Colleges, and Universities for Tomorrow's Leaders in Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics, has used their experience with a previously funded STEP award to develop activities and initiatives that target incoming high school students and community college transfers.  The project's Summer Bridge program will provide a four-week, residential lecture and research experience to incoming freshmen who have expressed an interest in a STEM discipline.  New to the Oklahoma program, this program element will incorporate five area high school teachers who will serve as advisors to the program and who will work with the students on their research projects.   A second bridge, called the Fall Bridge, will target community and technical college students who are entering four-year programs.   This one-week residential program will provide the students with a campus orientation and academic advisement, provide assistance in developing writing and mathematics skills, introduce the students to the library system, and provide sessions on research methods and guidance in reading scientific articles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The STEP Double Bridge program at the University of Central Oklahoma created research experiences for incoming college freshmen and community college transfer students.  Three Oklahoma universities were partners with UCO on the STEP grant: Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant; East Central University in Ada; Langston University in Langston; and Northeastern State University in Tahlequah.  Since 2009, a total of 413 freshmen and 49 transfer students participated in the STEP program. Key findings emerged from an external evaluation of all years from 2009 through 2015 and demonstrate STEP's success in achieving its goals:  STEP met its enrollment targets by averaging nearly 60 students per year from 2009 to 2013 with the participation of the 4-year partner institutions. Approximately 89% of all post survey respondents indicated they planned to major in a STEM field, an increase of 2% from pre survey data. Statistically significant increases from pre to post program were found for several survey items measuring interest in science and research. STEP had the greatest impact on students' understanding of the process of scientific inquiry, their ability to generate research ideas, and their enthusiasm for research. Smaller but still important effects were found for comfort level with asking instructors for help and perceived usefulness of science to society. Participants across all years gave high ratings to the overall STEP Summer Bridge program. Of post-program survey respondents, all but two students out of 385 agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with the program. STEP effectively piqued student interest in continuing research, with 93% of participants across all years indicating they would like to continue research over the next year. In addition, 84% indicated they would continue throughout the duration of their baccalaureate program if given the opportunity.   STEP provided a valuable experience that increased student interest in research, broadened their awareness of various STEM opportunities, fostered relationships with faculty and other STEM majors, and, in general, strengthened their enthusiasm for careers in STEM. Based on the analysis of all years of STEP data, it is clear the program met its goal of increasing the number of undergraduate students in Oklahoma pursuing STEM degrees.
