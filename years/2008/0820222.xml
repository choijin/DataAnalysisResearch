<AbstractNarration>NSF Proposals: 0820222/0820170&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Recombinant Services -- Recasting the Web for Continuously Evolving Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIs:  Richard N. Taylor and Nenad Medvidovic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad features of many real-world systems belie the assumptions of classical systems and software engineering: there is no single overarching authority, change is managed by many independent organizations, the many systems serve many masters, and evolution is independent and uncoordinated. Ongoing improvements in the scale and reach of pervasive network infrastructure and the brisk development of diverse Web-accessible resources will play pivotal roles in future systems of systems. Apropos of this future, this project offers a radical rethinking of service abstraction that integrates modern network structures, computation as a fundamental unit of network exchange, and network-wide system awareness to deliver recombinant Internet-scale services for which service composition, reuse, autonomy, context-free interaction, and monitoring are first-order effects. This project pursues a set of architectural principles addressing the challenges, then developing infrastructure consistent with those principles, for the implementation, deployment, and operation of systems of systems. The engineering methods reifying recombinant services---CREST---will refashion the Web, from an architecture that is predominantly data-driven and reactive to one that is computation-driven and autonomic. Our results will be given to the open source community and external collaborating organizations, a technology transfer with the potential of transforming the Web.</AbstractNarration>

The World-Wide Web is a prime example of such systems.  For instance, e-commerce transactions over the Web involve multiple organizations whose interactions are governed by communication protocols and shared understandings. Coordinated evolution of the various elements of a decentralized system&mdash;such as an e-commerce application&mdash; to meet changing demands may be difficult, if not impossible.  This is because individual organizations evolve their service offerings in response to their individual organization- and service-specific pressures, including market demand, technology, competitive and cooperative interests, and funding. Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any one single organizational boundary.  However, client-driven service customization and tailoring is a powerful tool for meeting conflicting, independent client demands in an environment where disorderly and uneven service evolution predominates. To this end, this project has contributed an architectural style, COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST), designed to provide extensive, safe, and secure client-directed customization of decentralized services. COAST combines mechanisms from software architecture, cryptography, security, and programming languages, granting application architects flexible provisioning of their core services and assets while protecting those services and assets from attack and misuse.  COAST is an intellectual descendent of the REST architectural style which provides the foundation for the World-Wide Web and its multitude of applications.   COAST is a powerful model of web-based distributed computation that allows service providers and service users to name, exchange, and communicate with services as easily as they might now exchange a web site URL. We anticipate that COAST will have significant applications in forms of distributed e-science that require a blend of high- performance distributed computation (grid-like services in the context of the Web) and ongoing adaptivity (for research and scientific experimentation).  Additionally this project has contributed to the on-going development of the current World Wide Web.  Among the many technologies supporting the current Web are the Apache Web Server, the Serf library, and the Subversion source code control system.
