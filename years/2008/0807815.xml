<AbstractNarration>This research project investigates problems on the interface between continuum physics and applied partial differential equations, with emphasis on analysis of physically relevant solutions of the nonlinear systems that arise in the description of fluid flow and continuum mechanics.  The project has three primary components: (a) The investigation of hydrodynamic models for compressible and incompressible fluids.  Issues to be addressed include large-data existence theory for physical systems, issues of stability and asymptotic analysis, and singular limits in hydrodynamics.  (b) The analysis of material structures with focus on fluid-solid interaction problems as well as fluid-particle models arising in biology and environmental sciences.  (c) The investigation of inviscid models with emphasis on hyperbolic balance laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enormous range of spatial and temporal scales that arise in the description of compressible fluids, nonlinear materials, multi-phase flows, astrophysical systems, and biological systems makes analysis of the associated models challenging.  Use of explicit integration or even numerical approximation for generic solutions to the governing equations is impractical for the majority of applications.  This research explores alternative approaches that will contribute to the further investigation of a wide variety of important physical systems and to the design of high performance computational algorithms.  One of the goals of this project is to contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by providing mentoring and advanced training for young researchers and by organizing a framework for interdisciplinary interactions with researchers from related fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research activity deals with investigation of a wide spectrum of physical systems  in compressible and incompressible fluiddynamics, nonlinear materials sciences, combustion, multi--phase flows, astrophysics, biological  and  geophysical sciences as well as systems of hyperbolic balance laws arising in continuum physics.                            HYPERBOLIC BALANCE LAWS  Hyperbolic balance laws result from the balance laws in continuum physics and are relevant to a variety of applications in sciences and engineering.  A major  accomplishment of this research activity is the establishment of  sharp decay rates. Historically, sharp decay rates have been able to provide quantitative information on the solutions only in the scalar case. By quantitative information here it is meant: results on uniqueness, regularity and convergence rates. For system of hyperbolic conservation laws the earlier results on decay estimates  were able to provide only qualitatively information on the solutions.   By qualitatively information here it is meant: a way to visualize the behavior and decay of waves associated with a solution but without further information on issues relevant to uniqueness, regularity, or precise rates of convergence.   The sharp decay result presented in the work of the PI   relates the measure that corresponds to  the solution of the system of hyperbolic balance laws to the measure that corresponds to the solution of the  Burgers' (scalar) equation  with impulsive source term and shows that the latter is in fact more singular. This comparison estimate is extremely meaningful because it enables us to obtain powerful results for systems of hyperbolic balance laws that were previously unattainable. One such result is the establishment of precise rate of convergence of vanishing viscosity approximations.  The addition  of a viscosity term to a hyperbolic system yields a parabolic system having smooth solutions.  Certain computational methods (namely, multigrid methods) have proved to be efficient  for such  parabolic systems, even in several space dimensions (cf. Xu et al (2003)). It is therefore natural to view solutions to the parabolic problem as  a first approximation  to the solutions of the hyperbolic system. The analysis presented in this work  (Christoforou and Trivisa (2011)) will assist in the development of high performance computer algorithms.                                          HYDRODYNAMIC MODELS  Multiphase flows: Global in time existence with large initial data. The objective of this research activity is the  investigation and mathematical analysis of a wide spectrum of physical systems in compressible fluids, nonlinear materials sciences, biological sciences, medicine and other applied areas. The systems under investigation are governed by the Navier--Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates and related models. The work presented in a series of articles by   the PI et al is significant because it extends earlier work by Lions and Feireisl in order to accomodate a  variety of significant physical  applications in materials science, biological sciences, phase transition (combustion, liquid-vapor phase transitions) and ecology.    Fluid-particle interaction models arise in many practical applications inbiotechnology, medicine, reactive gases formed byfuel droplets in combustion, recycling andmineral processes, and atmospheric pollution. The main focus of this research activity is on systems derived by formal asymptotics from a mesoscopic description. Dealing with  the primitive conservation equations has several advantages. One such advantage is the fact  that the numerical investigation is computationally less expensive since one needs to monitor the average motion of particles instead of the indivindual movement described in the microscopic setting. The analytical results have been produced in (cf. Carrillo, Karper and Trivisa (2011)).     Singular limits in hydrodynamics. Multicomponent reactive flows...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
