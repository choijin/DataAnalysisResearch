<AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Fundamental Studies of Advanced Sustainable Iron and Steel &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0832427 Michigan Technological University; S. Kawatra &lt;br/&gt;0832700 University of Utah; H. Sohn &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC entitled "I/UCRC for Fundamental Studies of Advanced Sustainable Iron and Steel" to develop new knowledge, tools, hardware, and personnel required for the iron and steel industries.  The proposed center will be a collaborative project between Michigan Technological University (MTU), and the University of Utah (UoU).  The proposed center will promote research to improve the understanding of iron reduction and steelmaking processes.  The research to be conducted at the center has the potential to develop new process methods that should break away from the process restrictions imposed by the current blast furnace steelmaking operations. It would also involve investigation of different ways to convert iron oxides to metallic iron, and to investigate methods for conducting life cycle analysis and the reduction of wastes and emissions generated by the steel making process. The proposed projects will take advantage of the tremendous strides that have been made in instrumentation, materials characterization, and reaction modeling to advance the understanding of iron oxide reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposal are that the processing operations of other alloys have the potential to benefit from the information gained in studying the iron and steel systems. The staff and students of the educational institutions and member companies will benefit by learning and understanding the mechanisms involved with the reduction of iron oxides. The industry will, in general, benefit as the close cooperation between the two universities and the member companies will accelerate the dissemination of information. The proposal has a well defined outreach program to broadening participation and ensuring diversity of involvement by partners, student outreach to under represented groups, and teachers at various institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
