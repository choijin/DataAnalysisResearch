<AbstractNarration>CBET-0836625&lt;br/&gt;M. Anderson, University of Wisconsin Madison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merrit: &lt;br/&gt;It has been shown that a phosphate sensor can be fabricated using a microporous iron oxide thin film electrode. The reduction potential of Fe (IIII) to Fe (II) is shown to be a function of phosphate concentration. The adsorption of phosphate to the surface of the iron oxides alters current vs. voltage behavior of the electrode. Phosphate levels in solution as low as 10-9M and several orders of magnitude have been measured. The hypothesis of the proposal is that the potential of the oxidation-reduction peak of iron is a function of phosphate adsorbed as well as its speciation in solution. Coupled with an in-situ pH probe and chemical equilibrium modeling using it may be possible to develop a unique sensor capable of measuring the concentration and speciation of additional analytes such as arsenates, silicates, carbonates, acetates, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The importance of phosphorus as the limiting nutrient in aquatic systems was first documented in whole lake fertilization experiments conducted by Schindler in the Ontario Experimental Lakes Area in 1974. Excess phosphorus can lead to undesired growth of algae and other aquatic vegetation, ultimately causing the eutrophication of natural water bodies. The development of an in-situ electrochemical phosphate sensor would allow for near-instantaneous measurements in natural waters, making analysis more convenient and less expensive. A real-time sensor would allow for the synchronization of phosphate monitoring data with transient weather events, and would facilitate rapid feedback for phosphate control strategies. While commercially available sensors exist for the nitrogen nutrients, no such sensor exists for phosphate. This proposal addresses this need. In this project, Prof. Anderson, and Dr. Isabel Tejedor, will train one PhD student. Dr. Tejedor serves as a role model for young undergraduate and graduate students and especially for woman in science and engineering. As a native Spanish-speaking person, Dr. Tejedor provides not only the academic and laboratory skills as a mentor but as well the cultural and language exposure that the students would otherwise not obtain working under the guidance of other English-speaking individuals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Excess phosphorus in lakes and streams can cause a common environmental problem called eutrophication, where there is an overgrowth of aquatic plants and algae leading to decreased water quality and fish die-off events.  The ortho-phosphate anions are the most biologically relevant form of phosphorous in natural waters, since these molecules can be taken up directly into plant cells. Unfortunately, the quantification of ortho-phosphates requires many laborious steps and generally requires the sample to be removed from its natural environment and analyzed in a lab setting.  There has been no real-time sensor able to measure ortho-phosphates at concentrations low enough to monitor concentrations in healthy, non-eutrophic waters.  Our work approaches the need for an ortho-phosphate sensor by developing and evaluating iron oxy-hydroxide and iron oxide minerals (collectively called (hydr)oxides) as phosphate-sensitive and selective electrode materials in electrochemical experiments.  Ortho-phosphate anions strongly bind to oxide mineral surfaces and can change surface chemistry enough that electrochemical techniques may be used to analyze how much of the molecule is in solution.  We produced electrodes with nanoporous iron (hydr)oxide coating using sol-gel methods.  These coatings have pores only tens of nanometers (10-9 m) in diameter, which can lead to a very high surface area with maximum exposure of mineral surface for interaction with phosphate molecules.  We found that in cyclic voltammetry experiments, where the current response to cyclic voltage changes is measured, a higher concentration of phosphates leads to an increased current peak with these electrodes.  This current peak for a ferrihydrite (oxy-hydroxide) coated electrode was sensitive enough to phosphate concentration that it could be calibrated from 10-9 mol/L to 10-3 mol/L phosphate in a pH 4 electrolyte solution.  However, this electrode had a problem of losing its signal after hundreds of measurements.  An improved hematite (iron oxide) coated electrode did not lose its signal significantly over 1500 measurements, but its signal was weaker overall and could not be used to be reliably calibrated to very low phosphate concentrations (less than 10-6 mol/L).  Furthermore, neither electrode gave a sensitive signal at near-neutral or basic pH.  We improved our analytical technique by using the iron oxide electrode for a different type of electrochemical experiment called electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).  In an EIS experiment, the voltage is alternated at changing frequencies around a mean voltage value, and the response of the current is measured as impedance (Z).  When we used our electrode, the components of impedance showed a very strong relationship with phosphate concentration at certain frequencies.  These components are pH dependent but can be used to calibrate for solutions of 10-9 mol/L to 10-4 mol/L phosphate in pH 7 and pH 4 electrolyte solutions with the same ionic strength as hard water lakes.  Some reversibility of signal is observed when measuring high-to-low phosphate concentrations when cyclic voltammetry steps were used between impedance measurements.  Nanoporous titania (titanium dioxide) coated electrodes also showed sub-micromolar sensitivity to phosphate concentration using EIS analytical methods, but the overall impedance response to high phosphate concentrations was not as dramatic as with using iron oxides.  Nanoporous alumina (aluminum oxide) coated electrodes did not show significant response to phosphate concentration.  With its great sensitivity and its ability to detect at natural pH values and ionic strengths, nanoporous iron oxide electrodes using EIS techniques may be a good component of a future analytical sensor for ortho-phosphate which would reduce the need for time-consuming laboratory procedures, which would greatly benefit aquatic scientists who monitor waters for this important molecule.
