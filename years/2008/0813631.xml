<AbstractNarration>EEC-0813631&lt;br/&gt;Luster-teasley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRIGE awards maintain global competitiveness by increasing the diversity of ENG researchers, who are initiating research programs early in their careers.  BRIGE awards further the broaden participation of engineering researchers by increasing the number of engineering graduates, by improving the representation of women and minorities in engineering, and by understanding how to improve recruitment and retention of engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BRIGE award will investigate controlled-release polymers for subsurface soil remediation. The PI plans to utilize chemical oxidation to inject highly reactive liquids or gases into a contaminated zone.  The chemical oxidants rapidly react to oxidize and breakdown subsurface contaminants to less toxic byproducts.  The research will investigate a new method of chemical oxidant delivery that is expected to provide significant advantages over methods currently in use. The investigator will test a novel delivery system that uses biodegradable polymers to encapsulate a solid oxidant.  The basic concept is to encapsulate an oxidant in biodegradable polymers in the form of solid pellets that slowly release the oxidant after application. Like an "environmental pill", the oxidants can be placed subsurface to slowly deliver treatment to the environment.  This new method effectively extends the ability to provide chemical oxidation treatment for remediation in a fashion similar to drug formulations delivered using biodegradable medical implants which provide controlled and extended release of their active components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 200,000 sites in the United States require some form of environmental remediation. Of these sites, the most difficult to remediate are locations in which contaminated subsurface soils and groundwater are present. This research will benefit society as a whole by providing a safer method to treat subsurface contamination and a new method to protect and treat water and soil. This research will serve as an example for using biomaterials to improve water and soil treatment practices in environmental engineering.  Additionally, this project will provide research opportunities to minority undergraduate and graduate students from the underrepresented populations served by North Carolina A&amp;T State University.  The PI will also develop an environmental engineering module for this research, environmental remediation, and novel uses for biodegradable polymers for an on-line education program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BRIGE grant will broaden the participation of and increase opportunities for all engineers including those from groups underrepresented in the engineering disciplines.  This BRIGE grant will also encourage the PI to become actively and competitively engaged in research as an independent investigator.</AbstractNarration>
