<AbstractNarration>The research objective is the theoretical and practical design and implementation of new computational data models and query languages for the trajectories (both historical and predicted) of moving objects in both constrained and unconstrained environments. One aspect is to include the modeling and querying of current and predictive movement (e.g., the prediction of the future evolution of hurricanes and wild fires) into databases. This especially introduces the inherent feature of uncertainty of moving objects, incorporates the database support of prediction models independent of applications, and includes a homogeneous and seamless integration of both historical and predictive moving objects in unconstrained environments that allow free movement. Another aspect relates to the special situation of moving objects in constrained environments, and here especially in spatial networks (like vehicles in transportation networks). The main issues here are how spatial networks as well as moving objects in them can be designed, queried, and implemented within a database system. The solution approach is based on three fundamental algebras or type systems that are embedded into database systems: (i) the Moving Balloon Algebra (MBA) for predictive moving objects in unconstraint environments, (ii) the Network Algebra (NETALG) for geometric networks in spatial databases, and (iii) the Moving Object in Network (MONET) Algebra for moving objects in spatial networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resuls of this research are expected to have applications in areas where dynamically evolving spatial objects -- which change their location, shape, and extent over time -- play a role. Examples are meteorology, hurricane research, fire management, disaster management, navigation systems, environmental monitoring, transportation and distribution, emergency services, telecommunications, to name only a few. The educational component of this project includes specialized classes that focus on important aspects of this project, the creation and use of new GIS educational materials, and the involvement of students in interdisciplinary research. The project Website (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mschneid/Research/FundedResearchProjects/NSF-IIS-0812194/)is used for the dissemination of research results, educational material, publications, generated data sets, produced software, and other information of interest.</AbstractNarration>
