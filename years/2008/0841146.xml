<AbstractNarration>Molecular Biology Initiative in Rural Southeast Georgia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Molecular Biology Initiative (MBI) program is to enhance the education of biology students pursuing advanced degrees (M.S.) by providing fellowships, long-term mentoring, on-going professional development activities, and rigorous molecular biology training.  As part of their professional development, MBI fellows are partnered with biology or chemistry high school teachers; and the fellow-teacher teams work together to design hands-on, inquiry-based molecular biology activities for the classroom.  A unique feature of the program is the ability of fellow-teacher teams to link their projects with on-going university research.  The MBI program provides team support through workshops, seminars, intensive mentoring, and an annual symposium.  The overall outreach program design considers inquiry-based learning educational research and the outcomes of a two-year pilot program conducted by the PI.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The MBI program will have sustainable impacts at the university and high schools.  The program will pilot a transformative graduate program model for professional development and close mentoring of fellows.  This approach will contribute to the education of outstanding and diverse cohorts of graduate students with strong communication, pedagogy, leadership, time-management, and discipline-specific skills; and an intimate knowledge of issues facing K-12 science education.  It will enhance university molecular biology research programs and improve the quality of science education in rural high schools via in-service teacher training and infrastructure improvements.  Each year the MBI program will directly impact 11-14 graduate students (at least 30% from traditionally underrepresented groups) and over 1000 high school students from high-need schools (45% economically disadvantaged students, 37% minorities).  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Molecular Biology Initiative GK-12 Program (MBI) goals included: 1) facilitate graduation of outstanding M.S. Biology students with strong communication, leadership, and teaching skills; 2) prepare STEM graduate students to engage in collaborative classroom activity development and delivery with Partner Teachers for science students in high schools in rural counties near Georgia Southern University; and 3) build awareness of and a desire to participate in issues facing K-12 education.  The success of the (MBI) Program was centered on the strong partnerships developed between Georgia Southern University Graduate Fellows and faculty with area K-12 teachers, administrators, and science students.  MBI fostered partnerships with 18 Partner Teachers to engage and excite high school students about topics in molecular biology.  Eight high schools in rural communities in southeast Georgia collaborated in the program.  A total of 43 Master?s students were supported and given training to enable them to successfully communicate their research, and to use their research expertise to design engaging hands-on learning activities for high school science students.  Each MBI Fellow provided additional scientific expertise to their Partner Teacher as they led active learning labs throughout the academic year in the Partner Teacher?s classroom.  MBI Fellows were able to impact over 7,000 high school science students over a 7-year period.  Graduate Fellows reported improved oral communication skills, organizational skill, time management skills, and collaboration skills through participation MBI.  There was also increased understanding of K-12 educational classroom management issues. Fellows also gained increased understanding of the importance for scientists to connect with their community schools and communicate science research and findings in ways that broad audiences can appreciate.  MBI fellows were involved in 43 research publications, &gt;190 conference presentations, and 85 funded Fellow-generated travel or research grants during MBI Program involvement.  Partner teachers reported the MBI project workshops and working with Graduate Fellows has increased their science content knowledge, confidence in teaching molecular biology concepts, confidence in facilitating molecular biology labs, knowledge and use of new science technology, and new science lab skills.  Teachers and school administrators report that partnership with GSU and the MBI program has greatly increased students? interest in science as a possible area of study, but that it has also given them confidence that they can be successful in a university.  One of the most valuable products of the MBI Program is the active learning modules and lesson plans designed by the Graduate Fellows in collaboration with Partner Teachers. Efforts were made to align all activity modules with the Georgia Performance Standards because they are required to cover all standards for their courses. Over 100 activities and lesson plans available for educators at the MBI website (www.georgiasouthern.edu/mbi).  On the website, activity modules are categorized under 43 topic categories to aid in dissemination.  In addition, teacher preparation videos are available.
