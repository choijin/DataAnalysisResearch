<AbstractNarration>TECHICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extensive research in nanocrystalline and ultrafine-grained materials has revealed that they have impressive combination of strength and ductility in the absence of processing defects. However, the thermal stability and high temperature creep resistance of these materials in single phase form are unfavorable. In this work, a new and innovative approach in which these properties can be enhanced by creating a high melting point microstructure consisting of ultrafine grains decorated with nanosize ultra-hard and stable particles is proposed. The objective of this research is to intelligently design ultrahigh temperature light alloys based on the Ti-Al-Nb-Cr-X (X = Mo, B) system for applications in engines used in aviation. The combined room temperature toughness and high temperature strength will be achieved by creating a microstructure consisting of ultrafine-grained &amp;#61543;-TiAl phase with nano-size &amp;#61555;-Nb2Al particles distributed effectively and at grain boundaries. The &amp;#61543;-TiAl phase is not ductile at room temperature for several reasons, including localized deformation owing to the lack of activation of enough slip systems. Refining the grain size and alloying are anticipated to homogenize plastic deformation and reduce the probability of fracture of the &amp;#61543;&amp;#61472;phase through modifying the local stress state and affecting intrinsic parameters such as bonding. The presence of the nanocrystals of the ultra-hard sigma phase combined with the additions of refractory metals will allow achieving high temperature phase stability and creep resistance. State-of-the-art computational techniques and intelligent, sophisticated and advanced experimental methods will be employed to reach the goals of the proposed work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scarcity of fossil fuels and the increase in air travel frequency owing to the demands of industrial globalization require economically feasible high-performance aircraft. The performance of gas turbine engines can be improved by increasing the gas temperature and decreasing the weight of the engine. Material limitations are among the road blocks to building engines with higher performance levels. The results of this research will impact the society with the prospect of creating a new family of high temperature metallic materials. The education activities will include both graduate and undergraduate students. A diverse group of students will be involved in this project, including one minority and one female graduate student. Emphasis will be placed on the involvement of undergraduate students in research. The undergraduate students will be involved through two different programs, namely Research Experience in Materials, a new program at the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) Department at the University of Florida, and the required Undergraduate Senior Thesis course in the MSE department.</AbstractNarration>

The presence of nanosize sigma-phase at the grain boundaries reduces the probability of grain boundary sliding during high temperature creep without being detrimental to the room temperature toughness.  Intellectual Merit  Optimization of the Ti-Al-Nb Phase Diagram: Experiments and Calculations  A thermodynamic description for the Ti&ndash;Al&ndash;Nb system was developed taking into account experimental data on &beta;-phase extension, tie-lines and triangles, and the solidification path of selected alloys. Using this dataset, the liquidus and solidus surfaces were calculated to evaluate the extension of the &beta;-phase and to compare this extension with available experimental data. This work represents the most recent and accurate assessment of this ternary system.  Effect of Boron on Microstructural Evolution  Difficulties in retaining the high temperature parent beta-phase in these alloys led to the addition of boron, which could modify the grain boundary such that the lower temperature gamma-phase would not readily form upon quenching, though.  It was determined that as the boron content increases, the formation of the gamma phase occurs even more readily. Boron was ineffective in retaining the beta phase to room temperature.  Mechanical Behavior of TiAlNb+(Cr,Mo) Alloys  Alloys designed based on the optimized assessed phase diagram resulted in fine gamma+sigma microstructures of varying volume fraction and scale depending on composition and aging temperature respectively. Results from compression testing showed that in absence of prior beta grain boundaries, ie. single crystal specimens, plastic strain to failure increases with a limited reduction in strength as compared to the polycrystalline alloys where fracture initiated on the parent phase boundaries.

Additionally, in single crystal alloys, finer gamma+sigma microstructures distribute plastic strain more homogenously than coarser microstructures resulting in higher plastic strain prior to microcracking and failure despite having higher yield strengths.   High temperature compression testing of TiAlNb+(CrMo) alloys at a variety of temperatures and strain rates revealed significant increases in high temperature strength as compared to conventional gamma+alpha2 alloys. While the gamma+sigma alloys did have faster flow rates than alloys with a continuous sigma-phase of 0.6 volume fraction at 1000 degrees C, the combination of enhanced room temperature properties and high temperature strength makes these novel gamma+sigma alloys an intriguing prospect for aerospace applications.
