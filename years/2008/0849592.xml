<AbstractNarration>The primary purpose of the PIPESTEMS project is to increase the number of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines by: (1) building on programs focused on increasing retention and graduation; (2) enhancing existing student support services to fit specific needs of STEM scholars; and (3) offering learning enrichment activities such as science seminars, field trips/site visits to partner universities and businesses, and faculty mentoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The primary aim of the project is to expose students at the college's four campuses to the PIPESTEMS opportunity as well as to an array of student support services and activities available in support of the program. A unique combination of activities are being offered that provide educational and research opportunities for PIPESTEMS scholars in partnership with the University of Tulsa, University of Oklahoma-Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, and OSU Center for Health Sciences. This project complements and builds on an NSF supported biotechnology program (0602744).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The activities from this project are resulting in increased enrollment, retention, and degree completion of STEM students, especially underrepresented and female populations. There are intensive collaborations with existing student support services departments at the college, similar student-focused programs such as Tulsa Achieves Scholarship, Honors Scholars, and Achieving the Dream program student cohorts, and higher education institutions and business partners who assist with transfer and career placement upon degree completion.</AbstractNarration>
