<AbstractNarration>The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Harvard University is a highly multidisciplinary research Center with participants from seven different schools and departments. The Center has a broad range of research activities from soft materials to biological materials. The research of the Harvard MRSEC is organized into three interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs):&lt;br/&gt;IRG 1:  Micromechanics to explore the fascinating and technologically important mechanical behavior of systems where phenomena at very short length scales impact the materials properties and mechanics at macroscopic length scales.&lt;br/&gt;IRG 2:  Droplet Templated Materials utilize microfluidic devices, or devices that control the flow of fluids at micron length scales, to produce new structures that are of use for delivery of drugs and other active ingredients that must be protected from their environment prior to delivery. &lt;br/&gt;IRG 3:  Active Soft Materials addressing materials science required to create soft robotics, which are machines that can adapt to new geometries while still providing function. &lt;br/&gt;The MRSEC supports a vigorous program to educate and inspire the public about materials science. The MRSEC offers novel programs for high school teachers and research opportunities for undergraduates from all over the US. A collaborative Partnerships in Research and Education in Materials program with University of New Mexico attracts underrepresented minority undergraduates to a Summer Program at Harvard. The rigorous scholarship emblematic of the Harvard MRSEC ensures that the excellent students and postdoctoral fellows in the Center will become leaders of the next generation of scientists and engineers. &lt;br/&gt;The MRSEC has extensive collaboration with industry, both with large, established companies and with start-up firms that are inspired by the work of the Center. The MRSEC also collaborates with some equipment manufacturers to build an enhanced shared experimental facility for soft materials research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Harvard Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) pioneered many new scientific concepts that provide leadership in the scientific community by establishing new fields of research through the support of the National Science Foundation over the period 2008-2016.  These include the development of high-performance surfaces that are highly resistant to fouling through incorporation of a very thin liquid film on the interface, and gels that exhibit remarkable toughness and can be stretched to nearly twenty times their length before they fail.  In addition, MRSEC faculty members established soft machines as major research direction:  Robotic devices are constructed from soft materials that can interface much more readily with the human body than can more traditional robots made from hard materials.  Faculty members from the MRSEC also pioneered drop-based microfluidics, the precision control of drops of one fluid immersed in a second, immiscible fluid, produced and controlled using microfluidic devices.  These drops were used to fabricate new types of materials that have great potential for encapsulation, and subsequent controlled release, of active ingredients.  They can also be used as microreactors that enable ultra-high throughput screening of millions of compounds using very small quantities of reagents.  The MRSEC maintained the highest level of scholarship, and the intellectual merit of the project was evident in the more than 600 publications, including well over 100 in very high-impact journals.  The Harvard MRSEC emphasizes scientific excellence, integrity and ethics, and its alumni, both graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, populate academic and industrial positions across the country and across the world.  To share the excitement of science with the wider community, the Harvard MRSEC developed a suite of programs based on the very popular Science and Cooking class developed by MRSEC faculty members at Harvard.  The MRSEC emphasized diversity in its memberships, and developed new programs to help returning veterans transition to productive scientific careers.  The MRSEC also inspired a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship among its members.  The broader impact of the Harvard MRSEC was most evident in the 14 start-up companies that resulted from MRSEC-supported research, and that led directly to the creation of more than 350 new, high-tech jobs, providing important career opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows, and directly contributing to the NationÆs economic competitiveness.
