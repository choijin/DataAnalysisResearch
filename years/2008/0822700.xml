<AbstractNarration>Freshwaters are ecologically important and socially valued elements of landscapes and a nexus of hydrological, biogeochemical, biotic and human social interactions. The North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research project has been operating since 1981 in lake districts of southern and northern Wisconsin. During that time it has amassed an impressive long-term data set and understanding of the ecology of lakes and also been a leader in developing concepts for use in long-term ecological research, such as ecosystem services and ecosystem resilience.  This renewal proposal builds on 33 years of prior research to examine integrated socio-ecological dynamics in the two study areas, focusing on the ecological, climatological and social processes that affect lake districts and the interactions among these processes. Four interrelated questions guide the proposed research: How and why have lake districts changed, and how will they change in the future? What are the major ecological and social responses of lake districts to climate change? How do multiple interacting drivers affect regional change in lake districts at multiple scales? and What are the magnitudes, interactions, and potential future flows of ecosystem services in lake districts? A diverse group of natural, social, and information scientists will undertake the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New synthetic understandings of the causes and consequences of ecological and social-ecological change in lake districts will be produced relevant to decisions of individuals and institutions concerned with the future of the region and the welfare of its residents. Results are integrated in K-12, undergraduate, graduate and continuing education, and data will be available and provided to individuals, non-governmental organizations, local, state and federal agencies, and to assist in global assessments of environmental and ecological change.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The North Temperate Lakes (NTL) Long-Term Ecological Research Program seeks to understand long-term change in lakes and lake districts. This is an ongoing program that began in 1981 and focuses on two sets of study lakes; one group of lakes resides in Wisconsin&rsquo;s Northern Highland Lake District (forested landscape) and the other is in the Yahara Lake District (urban and agricultural landscape) in the south-central region of the state. During the 2008-2014 funding cycle, we focused on four interacting themes:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Perception of long-term change</strong>: How and why have lake districts changed, and how will      they change in the future?</li> <li><strong>Climate forcing of change</strong>: What are the major ecological and social responses of      lake districts to climate change?</li> <li><strong>Interacting Drivers, Scales of Space and Time, and      Regional Change</strong>: How do multiple interacting      drivers affect regional change in lake districts at multiple scales?</li> <li><strong>Ecosystem Services: Past, Present and Future</strong>: What are the magnitudes, interactions, and potential      future flows of ecosystem services in lake districts?</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Pursuit of these questions resulted in: 262 journal articles plus book chapters, 1 book, 24 graduate theses/dissertations, development of a suite of new tools to facilitate research and environmental monitoring, multiple data sets that are easily and freely downloadable,&nbsp; direct and indirect support for hundreds of students, enhancement of K-12 and university-level educational activities, diverse outreach activities including an art-science initiative and open houses to share science with the public, and inspiration for several new, affiliated research initiatives.&nbsp; Examples of project outcomes for each of the four study themes include the following:</p> <p>A. construction of phosphorus (P) budgets for Lake Mendota over a 30-year period revealed substantial inter-annual variability, and despite aggressive management efforts, there has been no notable decline in P inputs to the lake.
