<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a fully functional color "transparent display screen" prototype, based on a set of outdoor stable nano-phosphors with very high fluorescent quantum efficiency and well-controlled nano-particle sizes. With these advanced nano-phosphors, a color display windshield prototype will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This novel "transparent display screen" technology will enable an entire vehicle windshield or building glass windows to act as an electronic display screen, without affecting the optical clarity. This innovative display technology will leverage and create a broad spectrum of commercial applications and fundamentally change the way that people use "glass" in many designs.</AbstractNarration>
