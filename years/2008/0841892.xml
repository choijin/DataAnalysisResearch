<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The loss and fragmentation of habitat is a primary cause of species extinction and loss of biodiversity. However, there are few studies of the long-term effects of a direct experiment in which habitat has been fragmented at the large spatial scales that typify the effects of land use on the landscape; such experiments provide direct tests of the mechanisms that are thought to make species more or less tolerant of habitat fragmentation. Short-term responses to experimental habitat fragmentation are more commonly documented, but these may be transient and so may not predict fates of species in the longer term. How many species that initially decline eventually go extinct? Do species that do not respond initially to habitat fragmentation go extinct in the longer term? This project will answer these questions in the Wog Wog fragmentation experiment (Australia), the longest running large-scale fragmentation experiment in temperate forest. Existing data from the first five years of the experiment will be combined with a matching series of new data to be collected now, 23-26 years after fragmentation, to determine whether the initial transient dynamics of beetle species predict their fates in the long term and to test which characteristics predict vulnerability or robustness to environmental habitat change.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Habitat loss and fragmentation continue at an accelerating rate and account for most biodiversity loss. Understanding their roles as drivers of extinction is of increasing importance to conservation and land management. The long-running, large-scale Wog Wog experiment provides a unique opportunity to understand why and how species go extinct, and which species are most at risk. A technician, a graduate student, and six undergraduates will receive interdisciplinary training in biology and mathematics through participation in this project, and outreach materials will be developed for high school students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

B. Results and accomplishments: intellectual merit  The Wog Wog experiment is one of just a handful of long-term, large scale habitat fragmentation experiments globally. The scientific value of these experiments is increasingly recognized as many of them enter their third and fourth decades. Basic questions about extinction still plague the field of ecology, and the fragmentation experiments continue to provide the best setting to study extinction experimentally, outside of micro/mesocosms and the laboratory.  Therefore, bringing the Wog Wog experiment out of retirement, in collaboration with CSIRO, has been a major achievement of this grant.  To this end we have: 1) gained access to the experiment, 2) recovered and curated a range of historic data, including abiotic data, vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants, 3) exactly reestablished all 188 historic sampling sites, and added environmental sensors at each site, 4) collected four years of invertebrate data (three seasons per year, 12 sample occasions in total), 5) processed sorted and identified the speciose beetle fauna to species and matched beetle species with an historic reference collection for 410 species (13,012 individuals) for the first two years of data collected.  This project was structured around two overarching questions:  Question 1: Do the short-term dynamics of beetle species through 5 years post experimental fragmentation predict their long term dynamics (24-25 years post fragmentation)? Yes and no. One group of species that was declining in the short term has continued to decline with some species now extinct in fragments, another group declined and then leveled off so that populations became lower but stable in fragments. Another group recovered in fragments. As more data are added, we will have greater power to report on these findings.  Question 2: In the absence of "detailed" population dynamics data, do traits of species that predict short-term dynamics also predict long term dynamics? Traits that predicted species declines in response to fragmentation short term &ndash; natural rarity and isolation&ndash; predict fragment level extinctions in the long term. These results are based on only two years of data and should become clearer as more data are added. C. Results and accomplishments: broader impacts  The project has been successful in undergraduate training. 1) Early in the project, a talented REU student created a 12 minute film about the Wog Wog experiment (vimeo.com/21249067). Both PIs teach eight weeks of Introductory Biology every spring to ~1300 students, collectively. A homework assignment based around the Wog Wog...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
