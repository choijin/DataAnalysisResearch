<AbstractNarration>The PI plans to work on problems in harmonic analysis linked by the interplay among local Tb Theorems, singular integral estimates, Poisson kernel estimates, square function estimates, and the regularity of boundaries.  The goals of the proposed research are:&lt;br/&gt;1) to develop and apply ``local" Tb theorems to study the regularity of free boundaries and the solvability of elliptic boundary value problems; &lt;br/&gt;2) to develop techniques to study the solvability of boundary value problems for complex elliptic equations, or more generally, for strongly elliptic systems, with bounded measurable coefficients;&lt;br/&gt;3) to investigate the relationships among boundedness of layer potentials, properties of harmonic measure, and uniform rectifiability;&lt;br/&gt;4) to continue to develop the theory of Hardy spaces adapted to a second order divergence form elliptic operator; in particular, this work may be viewed as an attempt to find a sharp solution to the Kato square root problem ``below the critical exponent."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project lies within the field of harmonic analysis and its application to, and interaction with, geometric measure theory and the theory of elliptic partial differential equations and systems.  Roughly speaking, in harmonic analysis one investigates properties of functions and ``operators" (i.e., mappings which transform one function into another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces, which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the pieces.  The name itself arose by analogy to the decomposition of a musical sound into its various frequency components (``harmonics").  Geometric measure theory involves the study of the relationship between geometric properties of sets, and their ``measures" (the latter are generalizations of the notions of length, area, and volume).  Partial differential equations and systems of elliptic type describe a wide variety of phenomena in the real world, including electrostatics, and steady-state temperature distributions and elastic deformations.  In the last decade the interplay between these different subfields of mathematics has turned out to be a fertile ground for investigation, with much exciting work remaining to be done.  Progress on the problems to be considered would in all likelihood open up further avenues of investigation in these areas. All such progress will be disseminated by the PI via lectures at conferences, seminars and graduate courses, and via electronic preprints posted on his website and on the ArXiv.  The PI plans to involve two postdocs and two graduate students in work related to this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, the PI considered several problems whose solutions have shed considerable light upon the interplay between "harmonic measure", and geometry, using techniques of Harmonic Analysis and Geometric Measure Theory. Let me begin with a discussion of the meaning of these terms, suitable for the nonspecialist. Roughly speaking, in Harmonic Analysis one investigates properties of functions (one might think of functions in terms of their pictorial representation as curves or surfaces) and "operators" (i.e., mappings which transform one function, or curve or surface, into another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces, which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the pieces. The name itself arose by analogy to the decomposition of a musical sound into its various frequency components, or "harmonics". "Harmonic measure" can be understood as follows. Consider the propagation of heat through a fluid in a container. Heat is conducted through the fluid by the transfer of kinetic energy (the energy possessed by an object in motion) from molecule to molecule. A particle suspended in the fluid will be buffeted by these molecular collisions, causing it to move along a random path. This phenomenon, the theory of which was developed in large part by Einstein in 1905, is referred to as Brownian motion. Now let us fix some specified point P inside the container (that is within the fluid), and imagine a region (letÆs call it "R") on the inner surface of the container. The harmonic measure at P, of the region R, is just the probability that a "Brownian traveler" starting from P eventually reaches the region R before it touches any other part of the container surface. Thus, the harmonic measure at any given point P describes the ease or difficulty with which heat can communicate between P and the region R. Therefore it serves to convey geometric information about the shape of the container: if the harmonic measure at P, of a region R, is relatively small, it means that Brownian travelers coming from P are somewhat "screened" from R by other portions of the surface of the container, and this in turn implies that the container must be rather irregular in shape. On the other hand, if the container is a perfectly round ball, then a Brownian traveler starting from the center of the ball is equally likely to end up anywhere on the surface of the container. Not surprisingly, this circle of ideas has many practical applications, and not just to matters of heat conduction. For example, there is recent work in acoustical engineering in which an understanding of harmonic measure has been used to help design a room with desirable acoustic properties: say, with sound emitted from one area focussed in certain receiving regions, or for that matter screened from certain regions. The principle goal of this project was to understand in quantitatively precise ways the relationship between harmonic measure and geometry, using tools of harmonic analysis.
