<AbstractNarration>Demand for fuel is increasing, while petroleum production levels are near their peak and there is a growing awareness of the problem of greenhouse gas generation.  Alternative, renewable, and sustainable energy sources will be needed to meet future energy demands.  Biofuels, produced from plant-based materials, are an attractive option.  However, the biofuels industry must be developed in an integrated manner so that the goals of economic, environmental, and sociological sustainability are achieved.  This will require a new generation of scientists and engineers who understand the entire spectrum of biorefining technology and also appreciate the ecological, economic, and social impacts of their technological decisions.  Similarly, economists with exposure to the technological aspects of the biorefining industry will be better poised to develop accurate policies.  Such interdisciplinary training does not currently exist.  This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the development of the Integrated Graduate Education in Biorefining and Biofuels  program, which will prepare PhD graduates to have a comprehensive perspective on the biofuels industry.  Four focus areas define this integrated and comprehensive training:  crop sciences and plant biotechnology; biomass conversions; product engineering; and economic and environmental assessment.  This program incorporates cross-disciplinary teamwork, coursework in multiple disciplines, and research projects that span focus areas.   The program will work to increase the numbers underrepresented students receiving doctoral degrees in science, technology, and engineering, and will include a collaboration with Colorado State-Pueblo.  Graduates of this IGERT program will be uniquely prepared to have high-impact careers and to contribute to the biofuels industry. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bioenergy refers to a set of renewable energy resources that involve the conversion of biomass to energy and fuel.  The production of bioenergy can provide significant reductions in greenhouse gas production compared with fossil fuel sources, and biofuels are the only renewable liquid transportation fuels.  However, bioenergy production is complex, spanning from agriculture to conversion engineering to product evaluation, all impacted by issues of policy, economics, and environmental impact.  For this reason, traditional, single-discipline PhD programs are inadequate to train students to do meaningful bioenergy research and to become employees who help bioenergy companies succeed.   The IGERT Program in Multidisciplinary Approaches to Sustainable Bioenergy (MASB) was designed to address these needs.  The goal of this program was to prepare PhD graduates who are trained as interdisciplinary scientists with a full understanding of the technical challenges facing the emerging bioenergy industry. Within this framework, four different focus areas were defined: (1) Crop sciences and plant biotechnology; (2) Biological, chemical, and thermal biomass conversion; (3) Product engineering; and (4) Environmental assessment, policy, and economics. The MASB program had five educational components in addition to the student's research activities: (a) a two-course bioenergy sequence, (b) required cross-disciplinary courses, (c) an internship, (d) research rotations (short experiences in at least three laboratories, and (e) a weeklong trip to Washington, DC to learn about bioenergy policy.    Thirty-six PhD students participated in the MASB program, and more than 40 faculty members were involved as instructors, research mentors, and advisors.  These students conducted research on a diverse set of projects in the four MASB focus areas, with many interdisciplinary projects that would not have happened without the MASB program.  Examples of significant research accomplishments include the development of new, regionally specific models that track soil carbon changes as a result of biofuel feedstock production, the characterization of advanced biofuel combustion in new engine configurations, and the development of new tools for metabolic engineering of algae.   The broader impacts of this project relate primarily to the multidisciplinary educational framework that was developed.  In their end-of-program interviews, MASB students appreciated the program as a whole for its emphasis on multidisciplinary education and for providing a comprehensive education on bioenergy issues. A video with several of these interviews can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aa9ZVnfI68&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLQAdOhTtvyo6kULHGMj3aA3-nOMNz1gnU.

The second course, "Bioenergy Policy, Economics, and Assessment" focuses on policy, education, and environmental assessment, and also features a group project.  In the end-of-program assessment, two aspects of these courses were particularly noteworthy: First, the bioenergy courses were rated by fellows as very or extremely important for expanding fellows' understanding of the bioenergy (100%), building relationships with other interdisciplinary doctoral students (67%), increasing their interest in interdisciplinary research (72%), developing their identity as interdisciplinary scholars (61%).
