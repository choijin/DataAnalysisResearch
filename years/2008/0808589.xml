<AbstractNarration>PI Lynne D. Houck&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: IOS-0808589&lt;br/&gt;Pheromone Chemoreception in Salamanders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with visual and tactile stimulation, chemicals are often used for communication between animals.  In vertebrates, chemical signals can elicit powerful behavioral responses, including mate attraction and aggression.  However, the neurological and physiological pathways from signal reception to behavioral response are poorly understood in most vertebrate systems. The red-legged salamander (Plethodon shermani), will be used to investigate the neural basis for female behavioral response to male-produced courtship pheromones. The aims of the proposed work are to determine (1) whether the male courtship pheromone stimulates the female by activating a specific class of accessory olfactory receptors, and (2) what areas in the female brain are activated by natural courtship behavior that includes the delivery of male courtship pheromones.  The research approach to addressing these questions will involve the use of molecular biology tools (such as polymerase chain reaction, PCR), as well as physiological tools.  This work will be one of the first studies to show how a chemical signal affects behavior in amphibians.  The results will have broad scientific impact by providing information on how the processing of chemical signals occurs in an under-studied vertebrate group (amphibians).  In addition, the research results will be interpreted in terms of genes, physiology, behavior, and evolution and integrated into lectures for rural community college students.  Interested students will be recruited to help with behavioral trials.  These college students also will gain exposure to women pursuing scientific careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
