<AbstractNarration>The plant hormone salicylic acid (SA) affects many diverse processes in plant growth and development and plays important role(s) in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. Its role(s) in disease resistance has been the most extensively studied but is still only partially understood. To obtain insights into how SA carries out its varied functions, a large number of putative SA-binding proteins (pSABPs) have recently been identified in Arabidopsis by affinity chromatography using SA attached to a matrix. The investigators will use two powerful high throughput screens, an Arabidopsis protein micro-array and a yeast three hybrid system, to identify additional SABPs, as well as confirm the SA-binding activity of the already identified pSABPs. These SABPs will be characterized using biochemical, genetic, molecular, bioinformatic, and biophysical (X-ray crystallography) techniques to decipher their functions in growth and development and/or responses to abiotic and biotic stresses, and the effects of SA binding on these functions. Based on current data and the results obtained, an SA signaling network model(s) will be constructed, tested by more detailed characterization of putative signaling or regulatory modules, and refined in order to produce an exemplary model of the SA signaling network of SABPs which may serve as a paradigm for other plant hormones (and other small ligands). The project will also facilitate development of the two new, less proven approaches for large scale identification of proteins that bind small molecules (like hormones), for their use in characterization of other hormones or small molecule signaling networks in animals as well as plants. Moreover, the SA targets (SABPs) identified in plants may have counterparts in humans that are important in mediating SA's and aspirin's (aceto SA) diverse therapeutic properties including reduction in fever, pain, inflammation, and risk of heart attack, stroke and cancer. The project will provide a stimulating training environment for graduate and postdoctoral students, where they are exposed to a large repertoire of biochemical, molecular, genetic, structural, and bioinformatic approaches to address fundamental questions in plant biology. It also will provide high school students and undergraduates with opportunities to experience first-hand the excitement of discovery under the close mentorship of a postdoctoral fellow, research associate or graduate student. Research results will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed articles in journals that allow broad electronic access. Moreover, the identity of new SABPs (once their binding is verified by two independent assays) and their possible involvement in various plant processes will be made available through a new website before publication in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
