<AbstractNarration>Kapitula&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0806636&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The governing equations for the wave function of a&lt;br/&gt;Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) are Hamiltonian; in particular,&lt;br/&gt;they are a variant of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation known as&lt;br/&gt;the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.  The analysis of this physical&lt;br/&gt;system leads to several intriguing fundamental mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems for Hamiltonian systems which deal with the existence,&lt;br/&gt;spectral stability, and nonlinear stability of waves.  The major&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems to be addressed in this proposal include&lt;br/&gt;(a) the construction and spectral stability of fully&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional waves in the presence of a cigar magnetic trap&lt;br/&gt;via the technique of spatial dynamics, (b) the construction and&lt;br/&gt;spectral stability of two-dimensional periodic waves in the&lt;br/&gt;presence of an optical lattice, and (c) a careful study of&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues with negative Krein signature.  Regarding (c), there&lt;br/&gt;are two avenues that are to be explored: (1) the determination of&lt;br/&gt;embedded eigenvalues of negative sign in the case that the&lt;br/&gt;solitary wave is realized as a limit of a family of periodic&lt;br/&gt;waves, and (2) the determination of the exact number of&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues with negative sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Especially since the 1997 Nobel Prize winning work of S.&lt;br/&gt;Chu, C. Cohen-Tannoudji, and W. Phillips on the exotic quantum&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon known as BECs, there has been a great deal of exciting&lt;br/&gt;experimental and theoretical work in the study of BECs.  In order&lt;br/&gt;to form a BEC, it is necessary that the matter is cooled to&lt;br/&gt;billionths of a degree above absolute zero; hence, BECs are&lt;br/&gt;extremely fragile, and it is likely to be some time before any&lt;br/&gt;practical applications are developed. Nevertheless, they have&lt;br/&gt;proved to be useful in exploring a wide range of questions in&lt;br/&gt;fundamental physics.  Examples include experiments that have&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated interference between condensates due to&lt;br/&gt;wave-particle duality, the study of superfluidity and quantized&lt;br/&gt;vortices, and the slowing of light pulses to very low speeds. &lt;br/&gt;Vortices in BECs are also currently the subject of&lt;br/&gt;analogue-gravity research, studying the possibility of modeling&lt;br/&gt;black holes and their related phenomena in the lab.  The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical results of this proposal will help both&lt;br/&gt;theoreticians and experimentalists better understand the dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of not only patterns such as vortices, necklaces, and solitons in&lt;br/&gt;BECs, but also the dynamics of waves and patterns in Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;systems which are used to model interesting phenomena such as&lt;br/&gt;waves in fluids and light propagation in optical fibers.  The&lt;br/&gt;inclusion and training of undergraduate students is an integral&lt;br/&gt;part of this proposal. Introducing students to the interplay&lt;br/&gt;between applications and experiments, numerics, and formal and&lt;br/&gt;rigorous analysis, will lead them to being excited about seeing&lt;br/&gt;the connections between the physical world and the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;world.  This will further lead the participating students towards&lt;br/&gt;a deeper appreciation for the usefulness of mathematics in other&lt;br/&gt;disciplines, and perhaps then allow them to be open to the idea&lt;br/&gt;of doing more serious applied mathematics at the graduate level. &lt;br/&gt;Calvin College has a history of producing successful Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;students in mathematics and statistics. Approximately one-third&lt;br/&gt;of these students have been women, who are significantly&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;Calvin has been very successful in the education and training of&lt;br/&gt;secondary education teachers.  As a consequence of this award,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator will be able to fruitfully support the&lt;br/&gt;college-wide effort in training future researchers and educators&lt;br/&gt;in the mathematical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
