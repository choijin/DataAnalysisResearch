<AbstractNarration>Objectives:  The objectives of this research program are: 1) to obtain efficient spin injection into InAs at elevated temperatures by exploiting favorable structural, magnetic and electrical properties of ferromagnetic MnAs contacts grown in the zinc-blende structure on InAs-based materials;  2) to develop a usable all semiconductor spin injector by exploiting the Rashba effect in InAs and employing resonant tunneling from an InAs quantum well into an (InGa)As detector under a bias-created electric field;  3) to improve the efficiency and temperature robustness of spin injection  from  recently developed Fe/GaAs spin light emitting diodes (LEDs) which incorporate ultrathin InAs layers embedded in the GaAs Quantum wells. The approach is to measure the circular polarization of the electroluminescence emitted by these devices from which the injected electron spin polarization and therefore the device efficiency will be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: There are considerable challenges in the design and growth of suitable structures for each of the projects to be undertaken. These challenges include the growth of the necessary structures, and understanding how the various growth parameters affect the outcome and how they can be controlled.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact : If this research is successful, it will have a significant impact on the field of spintronics, and thus possible future generations of information technology, by providing suitable efficient injection structures for both GaAs-based and InAs-based devices.  An outreach program directed at high school students with the objective of providing them with exposure on the principles of wave-mechanics and its applications in nanostructures will be offered.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ a.  The optical Aharonov-Bohm effect has been observed during photoluminescence experiments in InGaAs quantum wells in which a laser beam excites electron hole pairs. This type of excitation using light is known as "photo-excitation".  Following excitation, one electron recombines with one hole resulting in the emission of a photon, as the quantum of light is known.  This photon is a particle of zero mass that travels at the speed of light and carries with it the energy of the electron-hole pair that disappeared (or "annihilated" ).  During growth of the InGaAs quantum wells islands of higher Indium concentration form, as revealed by high resolution cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy.  Each of these islands localize a photo-generated hole, while on electron orbits about the island held by the electric force between the positive hole and the  negative electron.  Thus the electrons moves on orbits whose are is equal to A. In the presence of a magnetic field  B applied normal to the orbit plane of the photo-generated electrons, quantum mechanics predicts that the intensity of light emitted when the electron recombines with a hole exhibits maxima when the product BA  (known as the "magnetic flux" through the orbit) is a multiple of  &pi;?/2e.  We have observed the predicted effect in InGaAs quantum wells as is shown in fig.1.   Analysis of the magnetic field values at which the maxima occur  yield an electron orbit radius of 170 &Aring;.  The optical Aharonov-Bohm effect shows that the emission of light in semiconductors such as InGaAs is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics.     b.  Injection of spin-down electrons in GaAs and InAs semiconductor structures.  Electrons can be thought of as small magnets for which the line that connects the north with the south pole either points up or points down.   This is known as the "spin" of the electron.  The basis of the operation for most electronic devices is the charge of the electron.  In these devices the electric current is a 50:50 mix of electrons with spin-up and spin-down.  During the last 15 years an effort is being made to designs and fabricate devices in which the spin as well as the charge of the electrons play a role in the operation of the device.  Such devices are expected to be faster than current devices and consume less power.  Special methods are required to modify the 50:50 ratio of spin-up and spin-down electrons so that a majority of either spin-up or spin-down electrons can be injected into a semiconductor and form the device current.  One such method is to use ferromagnetic metals as contacts.  In these materials there is a built-in imbalance between the two electron spin states and thus they are suitable for the task of injecting a current in which the ratio of the spin-up and spin-down electrons is not 50:50 any more.  This type of current is known as "spin-polarized".   We have investigated the use of the ferromagnetic metal MnAs as a generator of spin polarized currents in two semiconductors: GaAs and InAs.  In both materials the electrons recombine with holes and emit light which has the property of being "circularly polarized" if the electrons are spin polarized.  In circularly polarized light the electric field associated with the emitted light is rotating either clockwise (right circularly polarized) or counterclockwise (left circularly polarized) in a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light.  Such a device is known as "light emitting diode" (LED).  The light emitted by these LEDs is collected and separated into its right and left polarized components.  The difference of the intensity of the two components divided by their sum is called the "degree circular polarization" (P) of the emitted light.    Below we describe briefly our results.  In fig.2 we plot P versus magnetic field B  for a GaAs-based LED for T = 7, 50, 100, 200 , and 300 K. At all temperatures the polarization increases with B saturates at B=1.25 T and re...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
