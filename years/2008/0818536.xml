<AbstractNarration>This project is concerned with how the human visual system is able to maintain an up-to-date representation of the world when the world and the position of the person in the world are constantly changing.  Consider, for example, a driver on a busy street.  As the car moves down the road, new objects come into view and other objects go out of view.  At the same time, objects out it the world, such as pedestrians and other vehicles, are independently changing course.  This example highlights how critical it is that visual information be dynamically updated.  This project will test the hypothesis that the updating process is guided by the viewer's current interpretation of what objects are out in the world and where they are relative to each other.  The implication is that the updating process is active and viewer dependent.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the dynamic process of representational updating can facilitate the design of human-machine interfaces, roadways, and other artifacts by allowing designers to take into account the strengths and weaknesses of human visual processing.  Knowing how the visual representations are updated can also guide educational programs for drivers, lifeguards, air traffic controllers, heavy machine operators, airport security screeners, and others who rely on careful scrutiny of a visual environment.</AbstractNarration>
