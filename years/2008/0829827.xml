<AbstractNarration>EMT: Collaborative Research: Primate-inspired Heterogeneous Mobile and Static Sensor Networks &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although previous bio-inspired models have concentrated on invertebrates (such as ants), mammals such as primates with higher cognitive function are valuable for modeling the increasingly complex problems in engineering. Understanding primates? social and communication systems, and applying what is learned from them to engineering domains is likely to inspire solutions to a number of problems.&lt;br/&gt;This research involves studying and modeling modes of group behavior and communication of coppery titi monkeys, rhesus macaques, and other primate models, and applying what the investigators learn to the distributed control of heterogeneous mobile and static sensor networks. The investigators will model the social and communication behavior of these primates, which will provide biological inspiration for solving problems in communication and networking. The phases of this research include: 1) identification, interpretation, and translation of primate behavioral models, 2) assessment of the effectiveness of small and large group formations based on primate grouping models in heterogeneous mobile and static sensor networks, 3) development of bio-inspired message-based communications, and 4) development of bio-inspired behavior-based communications. This research aims to achieve a deeper understanding of effectiveness of bio-inspired communications and networking by studying primates, and to establish interdisciplinary research and education in the fields of biological modeling, sensor networking, and robots control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
