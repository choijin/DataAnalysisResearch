<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a novel optical fiber sensor of temperature, pressure,  extension, axial twist and various environmental factors, including liquid level, in harsh  environments. The optical fiber sensor will be free of electromagnetic interference and of the  hazard of igniting combustible fuels and will be capable of remotely monitoring temperatures up  to and beyond 750 Â°C and of tolerating high-radiation levels. Conventional long period gratings  fiber (LPGs) formed by exposing photosensitive doped optical fibers to patterned ultraviolet  illumination cannot operate in harsh environments because of the fragility of the imprinted  periodic structure. In contrast, the glass fiber in the dual-twist chiral fiber sensor (CFS) need not  be photosensitive and will be chosen for its robustness. The chiral long-period grating (CLPG)  structure of the CFS will be created in a glass-forming process in which signal and scaffolding  optical fibers are twisted together to form a helix in the signal fiber as the fibers pass through a  miniature oven. Transmission dips due to coupling of the light between the core and surrounding  glass cladding by the chiral grating and their shift with environmental factors will be measured  and calculated using an increasingly sophisticated sequence of perturbation theories.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CFS based on the dual-twist CLPG structure overcomes the disadvantages of the LPG and  of the CFS based on twisting single birefringent fibers. If successful it is ideally suited for demanding  applications such as found in nuclear reactors, outer space, and oil wells, as well as in medical  diagnostics and treatment and in the automotive and aerospace industries. The CFS may  therefore become a pervasive part of modern technology and everyday life which relies  increasingly on sensing and automated decision making. By substantially raising the operation  temperature of optical fiber sensors, substantial savings can be realized. Conventional power  generators could run at higher temperatures where they are substantially more efficient and the  recovery rate in oil reservoirs can be increased considerably. The use of high-temperature and  radiation-resistant CFSs in nuclear power plants can make these facilities more efficient and safe.  The enhanced range of conditions in which the CFS can function relative to conventional  electrical and optical sensors will have an impact across the economy and will make the CFS a  rapidly growing segment of the multi-billion dollar sensor market. The novel glass forming  fabrication methods and computational approaches may find use in diverse fields including  photonics, microfluidics and medical diagnostics.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
