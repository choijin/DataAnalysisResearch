<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Oxygenic photosynthesis is the major solar energy conversion process in the biosphere consequently it is at the very foundation of life on planet Earth. Photosystem II (PSII) may be considered to be the key enzyme of this process since it uses light energy to split water (water oxidation) liberating the tightly bound hydrogens from the oxygen of water and, at the same time, renders these hydrogens in a form used for producing energy-rich organic carbon compounds from inorganic carbon (carbon dioxide). This project investigates the water-oxidation enzyme of PSII, the replacement of damaged PSII proteins, and assembly of Mn and Ca into the active site.&lt;br/&gt;PSII is a dynamic structure that is under a constant state of repair owing to the incessant photodamage it incurs during its normal operation. The repair occurs via a complex assembly pathway involving the removal of damaged D1 protein, insertion and proteolytic processing of the nascent D1 protein precursor and the assembly of the metal atoms of the manganese cluster (4Mn-Ca), which is the heart of the water oxidation reaction.  The D1 protein is the locus of most of the above mentioned photodamage. A dedicated and conserved D1 damage detection and replacement mechanism has evolved to repair the damage, but remains to be understood. &lt;br/&gt;1. Mechanism of 4Mn-Ca assembly.  The active site of water-oxidation contains a cluster of four manganese and one calcium ions (4Mn-Ca) most of which are bound by the labile D1 protein.  The assembly of the 4Mn-Ca requires light to drive the assembly into an active metal cluster.  For reasons that remain unclear, this assembly process occurs with very low quantum efficiency.  Previous NSF-supported analysis revealed new kinetic features of this process.  Hypotheses regarding the origin of these new kinetic features will be evaluated using site-directed mutagenesis together with sensitive biochemical and biophysical techniques that follow the assembly process.  The metalloprotein assembly process is being considered in a kinetic framework, that if valid, would represent a new, stochastic concept of metal cluster assembly.&lt;br/&gt;2. Detection of structural changes during the removal and replacement of damaged D1 protein during the PSII repair cycle.   The D1 protein is buried deeply within the large PSII complex and, consequently, major rearrangements of the PSII complex must occur during the replacement of damaged D1 and the insertion and activation of a new copy of the protein. How is internal damage within the PSII complex detected and what are the signals to initiate repair?   What is happening to the D1 protein during replacement?  What are the structural changes associated with the assembly of the metal cluster? Two complementary approaches to experimentally address these questions are used: targeted structure-reactivity approaches using mutant strains containing non-native cysteines that will be reacted with thiol-reactive reagents to quantitatively probe site-specific changes in surface exposure.  This directed approach will be complemented using powerful mass spectroscopic methods which have the potential to discover assembly associated changes in exposure at other locations in the protein.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Educational impacts include student exposure to a multidisciplinary attack on an interesting biological problem and training to utilize, operate, and understand advanced mass spectrometers.   An education collaboration with the Native Americans in Biological Sciences (NABS) program is planned.  The project incorporates a teaching module tentatively entitled: "Light and Life".  It will contain exercises and materials for the "Biological Dilemma" (a multi-faceted real-world issue) and for secondary school teachers to utilize in their home science classes.  These will borrow materials from the research project and be modeled on the most successful activities of earlier programs, which involved close collaboration with the high school teachers visiting the campus during the summer academies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Essentially all the energy the runs all living systems on planet Earth, is obtained from the Sun through the process photosynthesis by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria (formerly known as æBlue-Green AlgaeÆ).  Whether we discuss the fossil fuels (oil, coal), which are the products geological forces transforming ancient plant and algal materials to hydrocarbons, or whether we are discussing the current biosphere, where eco- and agricultural systems are powered by the sun, photosynthesis is at the very foundation of the global energy budget.   Not only is it the source of energy, but it is also the source of oxygen on the planet.  At the heart of photosynthesis is a complex protein, photosystem II (PSII), which is responsible for using solar energy to to produce the activated hydrogen for food and energy production throughout the biosphere and generate the oxygen as the by-product.  Despite its critical importance, research has established that PSII a remarkably dynamic structure that is under a constant state of repair owing to the incessant photodamage PSII incurs during its catalytic activity. The D1 protein is effectively the æAchilles HeelÆ of the photosynthetic mechanism since it is the locus of most of the above-mentioned photodamage. This project has been dedicated to understanding the assembly process necessary for building and re-building this powerful, but delicate, solar energy machine.  Additionally, researchers on this project have obtained new insights on how the water-splitting process occurs and this should have direct implication towards the development of artificial catalysts capable of water-splitting.  Such æbiomimeticÆ devices likely hold the key to the development of industrial-scale devices for the production of fuels from sunlight.  Key Research Outcomes:  1. Mechanism of Mn4-Ca assembly.  It turns out that light energy is not only powers the water-splitting reaction, but it is also used to help build the catalytic metal cluster (Mn4-Ca ) that then performs this reaction. It was found that calcium, Ca2+ functions as a æguiding and cappingÆ mechanism enabling the formation of an active cluster by catalyzing the incorporation of not the first Mn atom, but the incorporation of the remaining three.  2. Is there a molecular signal to detect PSII damage and initiate the removal and replacement of damaged D1 protein during the PSII repair cycle.   The D1 protein of PSII is recognized as the main target of photoinhibitory damage and exhibits a high turnover rate due to its degradation and replacement during the PSII repair cycle. To determine if D1 degradation is targeted to damaged D1 or generalized to all D1, we developed a genetic system involving simultaneous dual D1 expression of wild-type (WT) and mutant versions of the protein.  A unique genetic engineering approach was developed to determine whether a damage signal exists paving the way for the determination of the molecular features of the signal.  3. Role of the protein environment in channeling protons away from the water-splitting reaction.  While it is clear that the water splitting reaction essentially involves the removal of hydrogens from the central oxygen atom of H2O, what has not been determined is how this light-driven catalysis occurs. Based on the hypothesis that removal of the electrons and protons composing these hydrogens needs to be coordinated (to avoid uncompensated charge) and that the amino acids of the protein surrounding the catalytic Mn4-Ca are responsible for handling the protons as electrons are pulled away by the photo-processes of the PSII complex, project researchers used genetic engineering techniques to study the role of surrounding amino acids.  Surprisingly, these æsecond sphereÆ amino acids have some of the most profound effects on the dynamics of water-splitting.  This points to critical structural principals that engineers can utilize to develop the more efficient artificial catalysts of the future.  Broader Impacts  ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
