<AbstractNarration>A program of theoretical research on the interaction of light with optically thick atomic ensembles will be undertaken. Quantum control of the interface between light fields and atomic matter is essential for future quantum information systems which have application to the secure sharing of information between remote parties. The successful implementation of atomic ensembles in quantum information depends on the ability to control and interconvert matter-light and matter-matter entanglement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The promise of quantum mechanics to improve information processing and computing systems, demands that physicists find practical ways of realizing such quantum hardware.   One such system is the quantum repeater, a long-distance quantum communication device. For communication over thousands of kilometers, light could be used to carry signals along fiber networks linking storage nodes, or quantum memory elements. In order that the system preserve its quantum mechanical integrity, it is crucial to (1) minimize light energy losses in the network, and (2) extend the quantum memory storage time of the nodes as far as possible.   In this project we investigated theoretically, a promising realization of the quantum memory storage node, based on a cold clouds of billions of rubidium atoms suspended in electromagnetic fields. In the laboratory these clouds are prepared at microkelvin temperature and atomic motion is very slow by comparison with room temperature speeds. As the gas is also very dilute, with density around 100 billion atoms per cubic centimeter, the individual atoms are particularly well isolated. The quantum state of the atomic ensemble may be changed by application of sequences of laser light pulses at frequencies and polarizations precisely matched to the atomic energy levels. The light pulses serve to arm the memory when an incoming signal causes a well defined change in the internal quantum state of the atoms. A quantum memory seeks to preserve this state for as long as possible, while motion of the atoms and ambient electromagnetic fluctuations tend to destroy it.  We investigated methods to avoid the ruinous effects of atomic motion and ambient noise, involving subtle changes in the preparation of the atoms and new cloud suspension schemes less sensitive to external fields. Such modifications are constrained by the need to coherently extract the quantum information from memory with good efficiency. This process involves the delicate physics of electromagnetically induced transparency, specifically, the ability to control the speed and transparency of a light signal propagating through the cloud, by means of a suitably timed laser pulse. From this perspective, the information stored in the atom cloud quantum state may be thought of as a light signal momentarily stopped inside the medium. By changing the control field amplitude, the signal propagates out of the medium, and the stored quantum information is extracted coherently to the light signal.
