<AbstractNarration>Many of the most species-rich ecosystems on Earth, such as coral reefs and tropical rain forests, are characterized by high plant and animal productivity despite an apparent lack of the nutrients required to sustain plant growth.  The east African rift valley lakes may be the only high-productivity, low-nutrient freshwater ecosystems. The profusion of life in these lakes is concentrated at their edges, where sufficient light reaches the lake bottom to allow for high rates of photosynthesis of the algae growing on the rocks.  But how is high algal productivity maintained in the face of 1) the extreme scarcity of critical nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in the environment and 2) the intense grazing pressure imposed by high densities and rich diversity of herbivorous fish?  The answer may lie in the grazing fish themselves. The hypothesis that the negative impacts of fish on their algal food resource are offset by the positive effects of fish on nutrient availability will be tested. Lab and field experiments will be used to test whether fish promote ecosystem productivity by 1) slowing the loss of nutrients to deeper waters by storing nutrients in their bodies; 2) rapidly recycling dietary nutrients between algae, animals, and the environment; and 3) promoting the growth of types of algae that are able to use and retain forms of nutrients unavailable to most algal species. Thus, algae-eating fish may encourage the growth of their own food resources by speeding up the nutrient cycle, stockpiling nutrients, and increasing the influx of new nutrients into the ecosystem.  Testing the importance of fish in sustaining lake productivity requires measuring nutrient storage and recycling by fish, experimentally testing whether algae grow faster when fish are present, measuring inputs of nutrients from the depths of the lake, and using theoretical models to compare the importance of fish and other nutrient inputs.  This combination of activities will be pursued both under field conditions in Africa and in laboratories in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help to guide efforts to protect the hundreds of unique species and the globally-important fishery of Lake Tanganyika by clarifying two critical issues.  First, fishermen are catching too many fish in many lakes worldwide, including Lake Tanganyika.  This overharvest may remove too many nutrients from the lake, or reduce the rate of nutrient recycling so that algae grow more slowly.  By that mechanism, fishing could actually undercut the future productivity of the lake.  Second, climate change is warming the surface waters of the lake and reducing the seasonal winds that cause cold, nutrient rich waters to periodically well up from the depths of the lake. Reduction in the frequency of influx of these deep-water nutrients is cutting off the algal growth that sustains the fish.  This research will offer the first thorough evaluation of how these human-imposed factors will affect the productivity of Lake Tanganyika, which supports a regional human economy. The project will increase public awareness of Lake Tanganyika?s aquatic life through a website, an article for an aquarium hobbyist magazine, and a popular science article.  Finally, many students from Wright State University and the University of Michigan will gain professional experience through involvement in the project.  This will include students from Africa as well as Americans. Partnerships with African and global non-profit organizations will further broaden the impact of the research.</AbstractNarration>

A Nature Conservancy report based on our research was used to promote conservation research in Lake Tanganyika. The report has been presented to governments, donors, and conservation experts to educate audiences about environmental concerns in Lake Tanganyika.  ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
