<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North America contains the highest diversity of aquatic species of any temperate region on Earth.  Unfortunately, aquatic ecosystems in North America are experiencing ongoing human-induced impacts from land use transformations and climate change.  Not surprisingly, aquatic species are some of the most threatened taxa in North America.  Geographic information systems (GIS) facilitate the organization, manipulation, and analysis of biological and environmental data in a spatially explicit manner.  The development and application of GIS techniques in aquatic systems offers a much needed framework to assess the impact of environmental variability on the distribution of aquatic organisms.  The goal of this research is to develop GIS-based research tools to investigate the climatic and landscape characteristics regulating aquatic biodiversity at continental, regional, and local geographic scales.  At the continental scale, GIS environmental data, including precipitation, temperature, and landcover, will be used to identify the factors regulating the distributions and diversity of all North American fish species.  At the regional scale, climate data will be integrated with a hydrologic model to assess the influence of hydrologic variability on fish assemblages in Illinois and Alabama.  At the local scale, fine-scale GIS data will be developed to examine the relationship between intra-annual habitat variability and fish abundance. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work will be realized through the generation of data and techniques that facilitate an understanding of the impacts of climate variability and land use characteristics on the diversity and abundance of species in aquatic systems.  In addition, annual workshops will be developed that provide GIS-based training to aquatic scientists from universities, government agencies, and non-profit organizations.  The primary goals of these workshops include the enhancement of the technical and intellectual infrastructure for GIS-based studies of aquatic biodiversity, and the generation of a community of interactive scientists focused on GIS applications in aquatic sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Freshwater species represent some of the most ecologically and economically important groups of organisms in North America.  Nevertheless, freshwater resources in this region are impacted by human activities, thus resulting in aquatic species being one of the most imperiled groups of organisms on the planet.  Understanding the environmental factors that are important to freshwater species is critical for maintaining this valuable resource.  Geographic information systems (GIS) are computer-based research tools that allow for the mapping, visualization, and analysis of the environmental factors regulating species distributions and diversity across the surface of the earth and through time.  While much work has applied GIS techniques to the study of terrestrial biodiversity, the use of GIS to study freshwater systems has lagged far behind.  The goal of the research supported by this grant was to develop GIS techniques for the study of freshwater biodiversity ranging from analyses of fish habitat use in local stream systems in Missouri, statewide assessments in Illinois and Alabama, up to continental studies across North America.  Findings from this research suggest that climate, river discharge, and local stream conditions are all extremely important for the persistence of freshwater fishes.  Moreover, results indicate that both the type of habitat and the variation in types of habitat are important predictors of the number of individuals and species in an area as well as the distribution of species across the continent.  Results also demonstrate that changes in land use due to urban expansion and directional changes in temperature and precipitation could have significant effects on the distribution and diversity of freshwater species.  This work has resulted in 16 peer-reviewed manuscripts as well as numerous presentations at professional meetings.  In addition, two postdoctoral researchers, three graduate students, and several undergraduate students were trained by the grant.  Six 3-day aquatic GIS training workshops were also offered over the course of the project, which provided training to 118 scientists from across the United States.
