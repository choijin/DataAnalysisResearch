<AbstractNarration>The two objectives to this BRIGE project are: (1) The initiation of the Principal Investigator?s long-term research in dynamic soil-structure interaction and (2) The motivation of a diverse spectrum of students to become engineering practitioners, researchers, and educators. Modeling intrinsic damping, a measure of a materialÂ´s ability to dissipate energy, is critical in predicting a soil-structure system?s dynamic response. However, it is unclear how to mathematically model the intrinsic damping characteristics of both the natural earth and manmade components of a typical infrastructure system. This is a significant shortcoming, as many civil engineering structures subjected to dynamic loading must be considered in conjunction with their soil foundations to appropriately predict dynamic response.  The BRIGE research will: (1) Validate an equivalent linear modeling procedure for nonuniform intrinsic damping in soil-structure systems using experimental data gathered from resonant column tests and instrumented centrifuge models and (2) Result in an accessible, robust finite element framework for rationally modeling soil-structure dynamics. By advancing the state of knowledge in predicting infrastructure systems? responses to typical (e.g., traffic and wind) as well as extreme dynamic loads (e.g., earthquakes and blasts) and disseminating an accessible finite element algorithm incorporating these advances, civil engineering systems may be more effectively designed to safely protect their human occupants and users.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The diversification efforts involved in this BRIGE project will consist of creating positive engineering experiences for a wide variety of students through research participation, outreach service, recruitment, and education geared toward fostering an inclusive engineering community.   Specifically, the PI will: (1) Create undergraduate and graduate engineering research opportunities that support a diverse group of engineering students; (2) Participate in outreach activities aimed at encouraging interest in engineering for females at local, predominantly minority middle and high schools; (3) Actively recruit female and minority undergraduate and graduate students; and (4) As a female faculty member with experience in mentoring engineering students, act as a positive role model who implements teaching techniques to retain interest in engineering, particularly in those students from traditionally underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
