<AbstractNarration>Dr. Romeel Dave' (University of Arizona) will carry out a theoretical study of feedback tomography using state of the art hydrodynamic simulations that dynamically incorporate outflows and sophisticated chemical evolution. Building on highly successful models of cosmic-scale galactic outflows, this program will focus on the environs of galaxies to better understand the complex interplay between inflows, outflows, and ambient gas in and around galactic halos. A primary goal will be to connect observable absorption-line tracers with physical properties of the gas such as kinematics, density, temperature, and metallicity. Through careful comparisons of models with available and forthcoming data, a cosmologically framed scenario will be developed for how mass, metals, and energy cycle in and out of galaxies. Implications will be investigated for how such cycling jointly establishes key properties of the inter-galactic medium and galaxies across cosmic time. Additionally, avenues will be explored for improving and optimizing the modeling of outflows on large scales within current codes, using carefully constrained test problems.  Through this multi-faceted effort, the understanding of galactic outflows and their impact on galaxy properties will be greatly advanced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a part of this work Dr. Dave' will produce an educational movie on the principles of galaxy formation, with a focus on how observations and simulations work together to increase our understanding of galaxy formation. This pedagogical tool, which will be designed to be used in classrooms or viewed as a stand-alone film, will be used to help spur interest in the increasingly important subfield of extragalactic astronomy, both among teachers and the general public.  In addition, Dr. Dave' will help develop and conduct an astronomy study abroad program in Ghana for advanced undergraduates from the United States and Africa. The program will teach basic concepts of extragalactic astronomy in the first week, and then teach students to utilize online observational and simulation databases to ask and answer questions about current problems in galaxy formation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How do galaxies grow?  This is a fundamental question in astronomy that remains a mystery despite decades of impressive progress in telescope data and theoretical work.  An emerging paradigm from supercomputer simulations is that galaxies live within a cosmic ecosystem that includes their surrounding gaseous environment.  Galaxies exchange mass, energy, and heavy elements created inside of stars with their surrounding "circum-galactic medium".  Hence to make fundamental progress in understanding galaxy growth, we must learn how to study and interpret how inflow and outflow processes operate within circum-galactic gas.  This grant funded a 5-year study to utilize state-of-the-art gas dynamical simulations to examine how best to probe circumgalactic gas around galaxies.  A promising new approach is called "feedback tomography".  Feedback is collectively the set of energetic processes that expel gas from galaxies, which regulate the growth driven by gas inflows brought in via the galaxy's gravity.  In growing galaxies, feedback is typically associated with new star formation, because young stars emit copious energetic radiation and end their lives in an energetic supernova explosion.  The supernovae concurrently distribute elements such as carbon and oxygen ("metals") created inside the stars into the surrounding gas.  Because such circum-galactic gas is diffuse, it is best probed via absorption against bright background objects such as quasars.  With sufficient line of sight probes, one can construct a tomographic map of the heavy elements around galaxies, thereby gaining insights into the physical processes that regulate galaxy growth.  This is feedback tomography.  Our project focused on feedback tomography in the present-day universe, while concurrently trying to better understand and constrain the physical processes that enriched circum-galactic gas from galaxies at higher redshifts.  We began by examining the statistics of low-redshift hydrogen (Dave et al. 2010) and metal-line (Oppenheimer et al. 2012) absorbers to confirm the viability of our supercomputer simulations.  To better constrain feedback, we examined galaxies properties in our simulations, and compared them to observations of galaxies from the early Universe until today.  We determined that a feedback model based on momentum-driven winds provided the best match to the galaxy stellar masses and star formation rates (Dave et al. 2011a), and gas and metal content (Dave et al. 2011b).  We subsequently tweaked this model to better match the stellar and HI mass functions by changing to energy-driven winds in dwarf galaxies (Dave et al. 2013b).  As a side bonus, this work led to the development of a simple analytic framework called an equilibrium model that is able to explain the observed trends in star formation rate, metallicity, and gas content of galaxies based on inflows and outflows, quantifying the new baryon cycling paradigm for galaxy evolution (Dave et al. 2012).  We then used our best-fitting simulations to develop the first comprehensive suite of simulated metal-line absorbers in circumgalactic gas for comparison with the COS-Halos and COS-Dwarfs projects, which utilized Hubble Space Telescope's new COS spectrograph to map circum-galactic gas around nearby galaxies spanning the Hubble sequence (Ford et al. 2013,2014).  We found that the wide suite of observable metal lines provides stringent constraints on the baryon and metal content of circumgalactic gas, although current data was not yet greatly constraining.  Nonetheless, our simulations highlighted how HI and metal absorption lines could be used to interpret the physical conditions of circum-galactic gas, and we helped to do so on numerous COS-Halos team papers.  Thus we demonstrated that feedback tomography yields valuable constraints on the physical conditions of circum-galactic gas, and we have developed a toolkit to help interpret such observations within the context of a comprehensive galaxy for...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
