    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0801375 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Travel Grant related to a Research Proposal Writing Tutorial for the NSF Workshop at the November 2007 AIChE Annual Meeting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: James M Lee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Washington State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an individual travel grant that provides funds for the principal investigator (PI) to work with a NSF program officer, Dr. John Regalbuto, to help prepare a presentation and participate in the "Proposal Writing Tutorial" for the NSF Workshop to be held at the 2007 AIChE Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah (November 4-9, 2007). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For over 25 years, the Division of Chemical, Biological, Environmental, and Transport System (CBET) has held workshops at the AIChE Annual Meeting to introduce individual programs and NSF-wide initiatives, explain organizational changes, and provide opportunities for interactive communication between program directors and faculty. This year, CBET has changed the workshop format to include the "Proposal Writing Tutorial," and "Interactive Breakout Panels of NSF Program Directors." The PI has been asked to work with a NSF program officer to help prepare, present, and evaluate a "Proposal Writing Tutorial." The requested budget includes travel expenses for the PI to attend the AIChE Annual Meeting and travel to NSF for discussions leading to the preparation of the presentation before the meeting and evaluation after the meeting. Since this is the first time the "Proposal Writing Tutorial" is included in the workshop, extra effort is required to prepare the tutorial, so that it can be used as a template for the future presentations. The proposed topic of the tutorial is "Strategies for Successful Grant Writing," which tentatively will be composed of three main parts: (1) Learning more about funding agencies, program officers, competitors, and the process, (2) Making a proposal competitive, and (3) The benefit of employing interdisciplinary and transformative research. This travel funding will also allow the PI to be available with Dr. John Regalbuto for individual Workshop appointments with faculty at the NSF Hospitality Suit during the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
