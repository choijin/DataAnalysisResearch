<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to experimentally verify that nonlinear optical processes are achievable in strained quantum cascade laser structures for 3-5 &amp;#61549;m photon emission. The approach is to (i) synthesize (via molecular beam epitaxy) arsenic-based structures with strained active and unstrained injector regions, (ii) compare experimental data with simulation data for 3-5 &amp;#61549;m laser structures, and (iii) explore orientation-patterned substrates for improved phase matching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit includes expanded utilization of free space optics communications, which has critical applications for security as well as last-mile access in remote locations. If nonlinear optical processes are demonstrated in strained quantum cascade laser structures, then the potential for temporary high-bandwidth communication links between moving platforms can be achieved with greater performance than current technologies. Currently, free space optics suffers from significant performance issues that are attributed to water absorption of the laser beam in atmosphere and short distance limitations. Appropriately, this research effort serves to experimentally verify the feasibility of nonlinear, high-power 3-5 &amp;#61549;m devices that will operate in the water transparency window of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is suitable for free-space optics communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research effort includes strong educational components as experiments aim to confirm existing theory about nonlinear optical processes and explore phase matching strategies. It emphasizes quality research experiences for the next generation of scientists, including traditionally underrepresented students by creating unique opportunities for recruitment, hands-on experiences, and support. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
