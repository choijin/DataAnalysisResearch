<AbstractNarration>The Northern Arizona University (NAU) REU Site will provide a research experience for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2013. Eight students will be selected to participate in a 10-week hands-on research experience in environmental science or a related field under the guidance of an experienced faculty mentor. Recruitment will focus on tribal and community colleges that have large Native American and Hispanic enrollments. Existing relationships with institutions such as Din√© College, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, Navajo Technical College, Fort Lewis College, and Arizona Western College will facilitate the recruitment of students from these colleges. Students will be selected based on satisfactory performance in at least one science course, lack of access to research opportunities, attendance at a tribal or community college, interest in pursuing a scientific career, match of students' interests to mentors, and overall academic performance and potential. The first week consists of an intensive field-based group research project at a  local research station, which will help prepare the students for their individual research projects. A variety of academic and social activities are scheduled to foster personal relationships among students and mentors, to encourage the exploration of relationships between Native American cultures and science, and to enhance the understanding of environmental issues facing communities on the Colorado Plateau. Research mentors often have significant external research funding; therefore, it is anticipated that REU students who continue on to a 4-year degree program at NAU will be able to continue their research during the academic year. Moreover, it is anticipated that a significant number of participants will become co-authors on scientific publications. Students receive a stipend, single dorm room housing, a dining allowance, and other support. More information is available at http://www.mpcer.nau.edu/reu/, or by contacting the Program Director, Diana Anderson (928-523-1276; Diana.Anderson@nau.edu)</AbstractNarration>
