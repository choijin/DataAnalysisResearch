<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: PHANTOME: PHage ANnotation TOols&lt;br/&gt;and MEthods&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: San Diego State University Foundation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 03/09/09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet. Since the most&lt;br/&gt;abundant living organisms on Earth are bacteria, the majority of these viruses are&lt;br/&gt;phages, the viruses which infect bacteria. Through their diverse lifestyles and gene&lt;br/&gt;products, phages play important roles in horizontal gene exchange, in structuring&lt;br/&gt;natural microbial communities, and in global biogeochemical cycles. Phages carry&lt;br/&gt;genes for some of the deadliest toxins known and can also carry genes which confer&lt;br/&gt;adaptive advantages to the hosts they infect. Furthermore, phage genes and the&lt;br/&gt;proteins they encode are the outcome of evolution over eons, the products of which we&lt;br/&gt;would be able to exploit if only we could decode the information in the phage DNA&lt;br/&gt;sequences. The number of available phage genome sequences is increasing rapidly; on&lt;br/&gt;the other hand, they represent the largest global reservoir of uncharacterized genetic&lt;br/&gt;material. Bioinformatic tools necessary for interpreting this data has lagged behind the&lt;br/&gt;growth in genome sequences. Grants to develop a platform and toolbox of&lt;br/&gt;computational tools for phage genome analysis have been awarded to support&lt;br/&gt;collaborative research in the laboratories of Drs. Robert Edwards, Department of&lt;br/&gt;Computer Sciences, San Diego State University, Mya Breitbart, College of Marine&lt;br/&gt;Sciences, University of South Florida, Jeffrey Elhai, Biology Department, Virginia&lt;br/&gt;Commonwealth University and Matthew Sullivan, Department of Ecology and&lt;br/&gt;Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona. Dr. Elhai is an Associate Professor, the&lt;br/&gt;other three investigators are Assistant Professors. This collaborative project is creating&lt;br/&gt;new computational tools to establish a consistent nomenclature for phage genomes, to&lt;br/&gt;annotate phage sequences, both from completely sequenced phage genomes and from&lt;br/&gt;environmental phage metagenome sequences. Most importantly, this project will&lt;br/&gt;engage a wide spectrum of researchers, regardless of their computational background,&lt;br/&gt;to access the wealth of information contained in phage genomes through familiar&lt;br/&gt;graphical interfaces. These collaborators have developed an extensive and far-reaching&lt;br/&gt;education plan that targets high school students, undergraduate students and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students. The students trained in the use of the tools will rotate into trainer roles via user&lt;br/&gt;forums and workshops. The postdocs will be working across all the labs and thereby&lt;br/&gt;gain an unparalleled panoramic view of phage biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0850356 PI Name:Edwards, Robert&lt;br/&gt;Printed from eJacket: 03/10/09 Page 1 of 1</AbstractNarration>

BioBIKE makes use of familiar conventions, e.g. menus and drag-and-drop that enable users to use existing tools and to construct new tools, all through the same graphical interface. Graphical programming languages, in general, have the potential to overload the screen. BioBIKE addresses this problem by allowing users to collapse portions of the screen at will, replacing them with user-supplied labels and expanding them only when needed. Most importantly, BioBIKE functions return results not only in a form that is comprehensible to the user but also in a computer-readable form, so that the results of one function may be used as the input to another.  The PhAnToMe database includes over a thousand bacterial and viral genomes, including descriptions of their proteins. Genomes are accessible through menus by their common names. Because BioBIKE provides an environment in which the data is integrated with analytical tools, an important barrier to genome analysis is thereby eliminated: searching for appropriate genomes and converting them to formats that are required for a desired tool. The genomes are already in BioBIKE, and format conversion...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
