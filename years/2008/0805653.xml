<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology.  The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Tyrell Carr is "Biochemical and genetic characterization of a regulator protein of sugar signaling in Arabidopsis."  The host institution for this research is the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Alan M. Jones.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plants require sugar as an energy source and as a chemical messenger to regulate growth. How plants sense and use sugars is important to a better understanding of the basic biology of plants and may lead to improved crops.  This research investigates an encoded regulator of a G-protein signaling protein that has been identified as a D-glucose sugar sensor and that mediates plant growth in the plant model system Arabidopsis thaliana.  This protein is the first of its kind to function as a sugar sensor in growth regulation. Extensive biochemical and genetic studies are being employed to examine in detail how this protein senses D-glucose to regulate plant growth and other cellular processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training objectives for this research include techniques in biochemistry, cell biology and bioinformatics to better understand plant growth regulation in preparation for an independent research program. The broader impacts include increasing the number of minorities at the post-doctoral level and at the pre-doctoral level through innovative outreach programs. Results will impact basic as well as applied plant research, for example, increasing desirable traits and providing by-products for agriculture, energy applications, and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Arabidopsis thaliana </em>seedlings that lack the regulator of G signaling (AtRGS1) protein are tolerant to high levels of D-glucose that impair the growth of wild-type seedlings that contain AtRGS1. Additionally, <em>Arabidopsis thaliana </em>seedlings that lack AtRGS1 have altered gene expression. Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that D-glucose directly binds AtRGS1 to regulate plant growth by altering signal transduction. Results from this project have provided biochemical and cellular evidence that AtRGS1 has affinity for D-glucose. In addition, a potential D-glucose binding location on AtRGS1 was identified. Using a high-throughput and <em>in planta</em> protein-protein interaction approach, several AtRGS1 interacting proteins were identified that will be beneficial in unlocking AtRGS1-mediated signal transduction. Overall, the results obtained from this project are potentially beneficial for the genetic modification of plants to increase plant biomass and the yield of plant by-products used in energy applications, agriculture and forestry. The training objectives of this project included obtaining advanced skills in biochemistry and cellular biology. This outcome has led to numerous collaborations and access to high-end instrumentation. Educational outcomes of this research included, training undergraduates and participating in science presentations at high schools, colleges / universities and organized events. In conclusion, this research award has provided various professional development opportunities in addition to research opportunities, which has led to a tenure-track faculty position at a primary undergraduate institution.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/05/2011<br>      Modified by: Tyrell&nbsp;Carr</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
