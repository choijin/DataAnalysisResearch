<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inability of incoming students to successfully advance past the traditional freshman calculus sequence is a primary cause of attrition in engineering programs. This project is transforming engineering mathematics education across the nation, with the goal of increased student retention, motivation, and success in engineering. A highly successful introductory engineering course was developed at Wright State University with previous NSF funding and it is now being adapted at partnering institutions on this project. The engineering mathematics course includes lecture, laboratory, and recitation components with content designed to satisfy prerequisites for a significant number of core entry-level engineering and science courses. Students still complete their required mathematics courses, but are now able to do so at a later time in the curriculum while still making progress towards their degree. The research team includes award-winning teachers and innovators in curriculum development at the collaborating institutions. A total of 15 diverse institutions are adopting and assessing aspects of the model course and are broadly reporting on their findings.</AbstractNarration>

the</strong><strong><em>&nbsp;in</em>troduction of EGR 101 has more than doubled the graduation rate of students enrolled in the course, with the greatest impact on those from underrepresented groups (women and minorities).&nbsp;</strong></em> Moreover, it has done so without watering down the caliber of engineering graduates, who have actually enjoyed a slight (but statistically significant) increase in graduation GPA. &nbsp;The introduction of EGR 199 (now running under semester course number EGR 1980) as a precursor to EGR 101 for initially underprepared students has further strengthened the approach, and has made the core engineering curriculum accessible even to substantially disadvantaged students.</p> <p>The transformative impact of the project has been effected through dozens of publications, presentations and workshops across the country. &nbsp;<em><strong>The publication of a nationally marketed textbook along with a complete set of asynchronous online course materials has facilitated adoption by institutions at all levels of engineering education. &nbsp;</strong></em>To date, nearly 200 institutions have ordered at least one copy of the text, and
