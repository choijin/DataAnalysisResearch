<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to provide a theoretical foundation for defining design targets and conducting design assessments to improve the design of products, tasks, and environments, enabling accommodation of populations that are increasingly diverse. Three research tasks will contribute to achieving this objective. First, in collaboration with an industry partner, methods will be developed to adapt existing anthropometric databases to new populations to account for changes in the population due to aging, obesity, and distributions of ethnicity. Second, multivariate and univariate modeling techniques will be explored and compared to assess the validity of these methods for modeling human variability. Third, a methodology for conducting "virtual fits" using large populations of simulated users will be developed and validated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will overcome limitations in existing design methods that do not adequately consider the differences in human variability that occur in certain user subgroups such as the elderly, people with disabilities, or people of a particular ethnicity. Designers will have the tools they need to design products to accommodate specific populations. This research will have an immediate impact on undergraduate students by providing them with design tools and a series of web-based teaching modules to be used in project-based design courses. Through these experiences, students will gain an appreciation for the need to design to accommodate various populations and the skills to do this. Other activities, including academic/industry workshops and an annual weeklong design experience for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will disseminate the results to members of industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to facilitate the improved design of products with which people interact. Design for human variability--DfHV--is a "DfX" capability focused on design practice supporting the consideration of variability in body size, shape, performance, and preference exhibited by individuals within target user populations. This research effort built on previous efforts in human factors, ergonomics, statistical modeling, robust design methods, optimization, and many other areas. The intellectual merit and broader impacts of this work resides in six key outcomes.  Multivariate Analysis Multivariate analysis was shown to be a better estimator of user acceptance than the prevalent univariate approaches. Multivariate analysis requires the simultaneous consideration of all of the relevant body measures and performance predictions and acceptance criteria. Practice was found to rely upon intuition, design for a hypothetical "average" user, or tabulated data. To increase the broader impacts of this work, web-based tools that enable this analysis were developed and deployed (www.dfhv.org, discussed below). Additional tools that explicitly facilitate multivariate analysis should be developed.  Disproportionate Disaccommodation The practice of creating designs that exclude individuals in the extremes of the distribution (e.g., the shortest, tallest, widest, etc., individuals) disproportionately disaccommodates individuals based on demography. For example, a design that does not work well for the shortest adults in the US civilian population will be problematic for Hispanic women at a much higher rate than other segments. This can result in higher injury rates and other serious consequences for the disaccommodated group. Some recommendations for mitigating these issues were developed.  Secular Trends The rapid changes in body size and shape in the US civilian population are a source of concern for designers. The changes create two particularly relevant challenges: maintaining up-to-date data for designers and designing products that will be robust to changing body size and shape over their lifetime. This is particularly relevant for long-lifetime products like trucks and airplanes which can be in service for decades. We created new methods for estimating the anthropometry of populations. This makes it easier to maintain updated databases as a population changes. We also found that products that do a good job of designing for both men and women will have considered enough variability to generally be robust to changes due to secular trends.  Body Size and Shape of Children Publicly available data on the body size and shape for children in the US are from the 1970s. Our research into the statistical modeling of anthropometry identified new approaches for estimating detailed body dimensions (e.g., arm length, leg length) using more commonly available measures like stature, mass, and BMI. Since the US maintains up-to-date data on these (stature, mass, and BMI) for its civilian population, we were able to create a new database of detailed anthropometry for US children. This has been published and is available online at www.dfhv.org. Designers can use these data to improve their work for children. They also provide evidence of a need for a new detailed survey.   Internal Anthropometry While the initial focus of our efforts was on external anthropometry, we also began to examine internal anthropometry. Through a collaboration with the Hershey Medical Center, we created a new method for modeling bone geometry and the effects of disease like osteoarthritis. Quantification of internal anthropometry can provide insight into the design of tasks (surgery) and products (implants).  Dissemination The final major result is the www.dfhv.org website. It contains data and design tools that support the design best practices identified through this research. These include relevant  information such as body dimensions and implementation guides...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
