<AbstractNarration>A person moving through the world must judge his or her own path of motion, locate moving objects and judge the direction of motion of those objects.  In theory, the brain can accomplish these tasks using visual motion information as well as the depth information from binocular stereo vision.  However, it is not known how these two sources of information are combined.  In this project, a computational model of neural processing will be developed to investigate how the brain combines motion and stereo cues to identify moving objects for a moving observer.  Concurrently, experiments will examine how moving observers use motion and stereo to identify and judge the 3D direction of motion of an object.  The results of this research will provide needed information about how neurons combine motion and stereo cues to locate and judge the direction of moving objects for a person who is moving.  This will increase our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of the visual system.  It will be useful in understanding how drivers make judgments about the motion of cars or pedestrians as they drive on busy streets, which could aid policy decisions regarding drivers and traffic rules.  Additionally, because the research will be conducted at an undergraduate college, its educational impact is substantial.  Undergraduates will have an opportunity to participate in leading-edge scientific research and perform their own research projects.  This will expose them to fields of scientific endeavor that they would not otherwise encounter during their college years.  Recruitment of women undergraduates and other underrepresented minorities to engage in this research will be a priority.  Finally, the results and examples from this research will be incorporated in a course in computational vision, taught by the PI, so that the results will be disseminated to students who did not work directly on the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of this research is to understand how the human visual system processes the image motion generated by a moving observer to determine information about the world.  In this project, we are investigating how one can detect moving objects and judge their trajectories relative to the observer.  To investigate this question we have developed a computational model of neural processing to test how neurons in the brain combine motion and binocular stereo information to detect moving objects in a scene through which the observer is moving.    Because of the observer's own motion, the images of both stationary and moving objects in the scene move across the observer's retinas.  Thus, determining which objects are stationary in the world and which are moving is not a simple task.  In this research, we have developed a computational model that simulates how neurons in the brain identify moving objects in the scene by combining motion information and information from binocular stereo vision.  In addition, we have shown how these neurons can process the motion of images on the retina to determine the trajectory of moving objects relative to the moving observer.  This research helps us understand how the brain processes visual information to determine information about the world around us.  The research also may help inform the development of mobile robots that need to interpret the scene through which they are moving.  The second approach we use in this research is to run experiments that test how people are able to judge whether or not a moving object is present is a scene through which they are moving.  We have run experiments that show that people can use speed or direction of motion to detect a moving object.  Unfortunately, speed is an ambiguous piece of information, because the images of stationary objects that are closer to us move faster than the images of objects that are farther away when we are moving past them.  One can experience this effect when driving in a car and noticing that the trees lining the roadway appear to be moving quickly past the car, while mountains in the distance appear to move very slowly, if at all.  We tested whether adding information about the distance of objects, in the form of binocular stereo (the same effect that is used in 3D movies), can improve people's ability to detect moving objects.  We showed that people generally rely predominantly on motion information, unless this information is unreliable, in which case people will make use of the binocular stereo information.  The results of this work can help us understand what features of the visual image are important for people to navigate through a scene.  This may help in the development of systems to aid drivers in collision detection and other aspects of driving.  One big impact of this work is in the training of undergraduate students in the scientific method.  Because this work was done at an undergraduate college, it provided opportunities for undergraduates to perform all aspects of the research, from experimental design and testing, to the collection and analysis of data.  Without this project, these students would probably not have had this hands-on experience with science.  Two of these students have gone on to graduate school and several are working in a computer science related field.  One is teaching a course on computer technology at a public high school.  The opportunity to perform hands-on research was a valuable part of their education.       Last Modified: 09/30/2013       Submitted by: Constance S Royden]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
