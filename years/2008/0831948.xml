<AbstractNarration>Lead Partner:  Michigan Technological University&lt;br/&gt;Core Partner: Grand Rapids Public Schools (GRPS)&lt;br/&gt;Supporting Partners: Grand Rapids Area Pre-College Engineering Program (GRAPCEP), Midwest National Parks, Cass Technical High School, American Geological Institute, Grand Valley State University Geology Department, Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Michigan Teaching Excellence Program (MITEP) is a multi-year program of teacher leadership development that empowers middle-grade science teachers to lead their schools and districts through the process of systematically improving science teaching and learning. The project uses Earth Systems Science(ESS)content and inquiry-based instructional practices to emphasize themes that unite all sciences and mathematics. MITEP includes both summer and academic-year components, and uses a variety of on-site, residential, field, distance, and in-service delivery methods. Components promote leadership skills, collaboration, urban place-based inquiry, access to cutting-edge data and materials, technology, engagement of diverse learners, study of key scientific concepts that cross disciplinary boundaries, pedagogical innovation. The project will also implement and test lessons and units that challenge students and prepare them for further science study. Teachers receive stipends and credit as incentive for participating in the project and testing its approach to reform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The project is based on the premise that successful reform depends on the full involvement of teachers who have the skills to lead their colleagues through the process of developing and implementing new instructional approaches. MITEP teacher-leaders and research university faculty are full partners in the process. Teacher-leaders are at the forefront of their schools' and district's efforts to evaluate, design, implement, and test new inquiry-based instructional programs. MITEP teacher-leaders help develop common pacing schedules and  course assessments. They assist with planning  professional development activities and providing ongoing assistance to colleagues. MITEP teacher-leaders are encouraged to disseminate information about the project through presentations at state and national conferences, to submit papers for publication.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Teacher-led reform is strongly supported by the administration of the core school district partner as an innovative way to generate enthusiasm for curricular and instructional change. To encourage development of leadership skills, school administrators give teacher-leaders progressively increased responsibility for strengthening curriculum, improving instructional strategies, and designing assessments. District administrators are providing the resources required for teachers' success in implementing and coordinating the project by assisting with the selection of teachers with exceptional leadership qualities for participation in MITEP;assisting in the design of professional development activities that meet the needs of teachers and their students; providing flexibility in teachers' schedules; utilizing middle-grade teachers' expertise in the dissemination of information to primary and high-school teachers; recognizing, rewarding, and encouraging teachers who serve as leaders; fostering growth of a teacher network; and creating a district-wide atmosphere that nurtures teacher-led reform efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Michigan Teaching Excellence Program (MITEP) (2009-2016) was a multi-year program of teacher leadership development that empowered urban earth science teachers to lead their schools and districts to improve science teaching and learning, particularly in the area of Earth Science. Michigan Technological University was lead partner on the project. Core partners were three medium-sized urban districts in the state--Grand Rapids Public Schools, Kalamazoo Public Schools, and Jackson Public schools.   Supporting partners included National Parks in the Midwest, Grand Valley State University, and Western Michigan University.     The project provided 58 science teachers from the three districts with targeted professional development activities that included two-week summer Earth Systems Institutes taught by Earth Science professors; school-year workshops emphasizing pedagogical skills; online courses in action research; science learning through inquiry, and assessment; and summer internships at midwestern National Parks.     Project goals were to develop teachers' content knowledge in Earth Science, to enhance their commitment to learner-centered teaching, and to improve their skills as teacher leaders.  Additionally the project sought to encourage university scientists to become more involved in K-12 science education and to result in changes within the university that would encourage collaboration and connections between university faculty and K-12 teachers.     As a result of the MiTEP project, many of the goals for teachers were attained. Teachers showed marked increases in Earth Science content knowledge, measured by the Earth System Concept Inventory, developed and validated by project personnel.    To determine if teachers increased their use of active learning strategies, project personnel observed teachers in their classrooms utilizing the Science and Mathematics Program Improvement instrument, developed at Western Michigan University.  The results indicated significant gains in teachers' overall practice.     Participating teachers provided data on leadership attributes prior to and at the conclusion of their participation in the project.  Survey results showed statistically significant changes in leadership skills, such as taking additional initiative within their schools, becoming involved in school improvement beyond their own classrooms, and modeling instructional improvement for colleages.  This was mirrored in their participation in professional organizations.  Most of the participants presented results of their research at annual conferences of the Michigan Science Teachers Association, and several also presented at conferences of the National Science Teachers Association and the Geological Society of America.     University faculty interest in K-12 science education has grown in recent years, in part as a result of research funding agencies requiring scientists to demonstrate the broader impact of their work on society, including K-12 teachers and learners.  At Michigan Tech, nearly 100 faculty members now report that they have submitted research proposals that include a K-12 or STEM education component.       At Michigan Tech institutional change was also shown in the development of the Institute for Research and Innovation in STEM Education, which will coordinate K-12, undergraduate, and graduate initiatives in science education.  The university now also supports faculty K-12 activities by enabling faculty to detail their activities in support of K-12 education on their applications for tenure and promotion.       MiTEP faculty, graduate students, and teacher participants have become leaders in statewide efforts to develop a middle school science curriculum that is aligned with new science education standards, utilizing many of the approaches developed in MiTEP.  These include an emphasis on the integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) components in science instruction; focus on student-centered learning; attention to student mis-conceptions in curriculum development and classroom instruction; and teacher reflection on student learning.     MiTEP provided the foundation for a follow-on initiative, Mi-STAR--Michigan Science Teaching and Assessment Reform. That project, developed by MiTEP researchers from Michigan Tech, and funded by the Herbert H. and Grace L. Dow Foundation, is a partnership that includes K-12 teachers and administrators from around the State of Michigan; higher-education faculty, staff, and graduate students from multiple universities; and representatives of scientific and engineering professional societies.      Mi-STAR continues MiTEP?s efforts to develop teacher leaders by engaging teachers in curriculum development, professional development, and in-service teacher training. Mi-STAR is fostering a broad group of teachers from across Michigan to become leaders in designing learner-centered curriculum and utilizing methods to implement new standards for science education.      MiTEP has enabled a significant number of teachers to become leaders in Michigan science education through their participation in professional conferences, development of their Earth Science skills, and their willingness to contribute to ongoing science education reform efforts.  It has also helped to identify some of the opportunities for, as well as the challenges to, improving science education in urban school districts.
