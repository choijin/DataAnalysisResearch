<AbstractNarration>One of the most remarkable events in development of the nervous system is the construction of the diverse and complicated array of neural circuits that underlie behavior, from the simple circuit of a motor reflex to the complex circuits that underlie learning and memory.  The research objective of this project is to understand how neural circuits are initially established during development and how they are modified by sensory experiences.  Specifically, the goal of this project is to identify the patterns of neural activity that act to stabilize newly formed circuit connections in the mammalian brain.  Advanced imaging techniques and electrophysiology will be used to stimulate individual synaptic connections and to monitor their strength and stability, in order to identify those activity patterns that lead to stabilization of neural circuits.  Neural activity patterns that lead to increase in the strength of individual synaptic connections are expected also to lead to stabilization of circuit connections.  Results from these experiments will advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which neural circuits are established and stabilized during development of the nervous system.  In addition, this research project will provide training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students in the laboratory.  The educational objective of this project is to develop an outreach program at UC Davis in order to advance public awareness about the progress and benefits of brain research and to encourage grade school students to choose scientific career paths.  This program will serve to increase participation in outreach activities from a large and diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students with the goal that these students will be encouraged to continue outreach activities throughout their scientific careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
