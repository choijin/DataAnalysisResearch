<AbstractNarration>This research and education project, supported by the Ethics Education in Science &amp; Engineering program at NSF, will design and refine innovative instructional models for graduate students in emerging areas of science and technology.  The project will assess the strengths and limitations of each instructional model, and develop models that reflect a recent imperative of ethics education in science and engineering: the integration of microethical and macroethical issues.  "Microethics" refers to moral dilemmas and issues confronting individual researchers or practitioners.  "Macroethics" refers to moral dilemmas and issues that collectively confront the scientific and engineering community, as well as broader societal issues in science and technology.  The project's goals are to: 1) formulate educational outcomes for the integration of micro- and macroethics in graduate science and engineering education; 2) develop and pilot different models for teaching micro- and macroethics to graduate students in science and engineering; 3) assess the comparative effectiveness of the instructional models; 4) facilitate adoption of the instructional models and assessment methods at other academic institutions; and 5) provide for widespread dissemination of course materials and assessment results in the engineering, science, and ethics education communities. The project has four components: a Coordination Workshop; development of four instructional models for integrating micro- and macroethics in graduate science and engineering education; comprehensive project assessment; and a Results Dissemination Workshop. The instructional models include a stand-alone course on societal implications of science and engineering, micro- and macroethics material embedded in a required science course, online instructional modules, and engagement of ethics in laboratory settings.  Assessment research will focus on student outcomes in moral judgment maturity and sensitivity to ethical issues in science and engineering, efficacy of learning outcomes for integration of micro- and macroethics, and the influence of instructor-student communication on learning.  The project team includes faculty in ethics, science, engineering, science &amp; technology studies, and communication at Arizona State University, an Advisory Council of faculty from four other universities; and three consultants with national reputations in science and engineering ethics education.</AbstractNarration>
