<AbstractNarration>Abstract for Dr Alyssa Apsel&lt;br/&gt;An integrated low power radio transceiver combined with a backend processor in a single networkable node enables applications that are not possible with traditional sensor node platforms. If such a node can be mass produced in a CMOS process without a costly external crystal such that the network formed by a set of homogenous nodes is robust to network changes or any node failing, then reliable ad-hoc networks may be formed from sets of these nodes with group intelligence akin to a distributed machine. This project focuses on the development and exploitation of a distributed computing machine formed out of a network of integrated single chip microsystems that combine both communication and computation functions with a total power budget that is under 50Ã¬W. Low power performance, critical to long lifetimes is achieved through duty cycling of the transceiver and establishment of a global clock via natural phenomenon of pulse coupled oscillators (PCOs) as well as the use of simple event driven computation. Although each node has limited computing capability, the power of such a network will arise from aggregate capabilities to perform distributed computing tasks. This project explores three issues; the construction of the network from simple nodes, communication within the network, and the computing potential for such a constrained platform. The final goal of this work is to develop a complete network with computing models and primitives capable of exploiting the network?s unique features.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Massively distributed ad-hoc sensor networks have the potential to blend electronic intelligence seamlessly with the everyday world and improve quality of life. Such networks provide advantages in applications such as healthcare, where they can aid in patient care and monitoring. It is important that such networks be battery-powered and stay operational for long periods of time.  We have developed new wireless communication protocols and radios (the combination of which is analogous to WiFi) as well as with a new microprocessor such that a wireless network node can operate with a power consumption that is more than 10x lower that required by even the simplest low-power radio that is commercially available.  A number of ideas were used to achieve our results: (i) the creation of a very efficient implementation of wireless synchrony, inspired by the way fireflies synchronize in nature; (ii) the creation of new wireless communication protocols that leverage this synchrony;  (iii) the creation of a microprocessor that can operate without the conventional clock signal used in traditional design.  In addition to writing technical papers that highlight the original contributions of our ideas, we created hardware prototypes of both the radio and the microprocessor so as to show that our ideas are practical and have demonstrable benefits. These hardware prototypes make it easier to showcase the contributions of this project, as they can be used to evaluate our ideas without having to resort to a detailed technical evaluation of the ideas themselves---the benefits can be directly measured.  Recognizing that we can have a larger impact on society if these ideas are adopted by commercial companies, a large part of the effort of this project was devoted to training graduate students. On graduation, these students join other companies and can apply the knowledge gained during this project to practical problems faced by their employers.  In addition to these activities, we have taken some of the concepts developed during our investigations and incorporated them into our normal teaching activities as faculty members at Universities. By showing the value of our work to students, we hope to attract them to pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering.
