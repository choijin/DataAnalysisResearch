<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to integrate important contributions to the ongoing research at Jefferson lab (Jlab) with an educational experience for promising undergraduate students. A UNCW group with a team of undergraduate students and one full time faculty member has been actively involved in Jefferson lab research in the past seven years. The primary goal of this project is to optimize the undergraduate experience while making important contributions to our understanding of the fundamental properties of QCD at low energy by studying the three lightest neutral pseudoscalar mesons, pion-zero, eta and eta'. This research project consists of several experiments to measure the radiative decay widths and transition form factors of these three particles via the Primakoff Effect, and development of new experimental program to search for eta and eta' rare decays. The results of these measurements will have a significant impact on fundamental aspects of QCD. It will open a new window to determine the fundamental parameters of QCD in a model-independent manner, such as the light quark-mass ratio and the mixing angle of eta-eta' mesons. In addition, the measurements of branching ratio or upper limits for various rare and forbidden decays of eta and eta' will provide sensitive probes to test fundamental symmetries (P, PC and C), and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will engage undergraduate students as key contributors. It will create a research-enriched learning environment, explore new approaches to recruiting prospective students, and develop new courses which are research related. Students working in an international collaboration will enhance their international experience and gain global perspectives. As a woman physicist active in research, the PI will be a role model to attract female students into science. The involvement of undergraduates has become one of the trademarks of the UNCW research group and matches the university's commitment to provide a high quality undergraduate learning experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major challenges in contemporary physics is to understand the confinement properties of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  QCD is a theory describing the strong force that holds the quarks together in the proton and neutron, and also holds the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom. The atoms are the seeds of all observable matter in the universe. The quarks cannot be liberated. They are permanently confined in combinations such as protons and neutrons. This phenomenon is known as confinement.  Since traditional perturbation theory breaks down at the confinement energy scale, a quantitative understanding of the strong interaction in this region remains one of the greatest intellectual challenges. A study of QCD symmetries, including dynamical and anomalous chiral symmetry breakings, provides a promising framework to understand the QCD confinement.  As the lightest particle in the hadron spectrum, &pi;0 plays an important role in understanding the fundamental symmetries of QCD at low energy. The &pi;0&rarr;&gamma;&gamma; decay is a key test of the QCD predictions based on the chiral anomaly and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. Theoretical activities over the last decade have resulted in a high precision (at 1% level) in the calculations of the decay amplitude of the &pi;0 into two photons. The experimental measurement of this parameter with a comparable precision will provide a stringent test on the fundamental QCD predictions. PI and her students have played significant role in the PrimEx experiments, precision measurements of the &pi;0 radiative decay width via the Primakoff effect at Jefferson Lab (Jlab). The published result in 2011 from the first experimental data set (PrimEx-I) has a 2.8% total uncertainty in the &pi;0 radiative decay width, which has improved the accuracy of our knowledge of this important parameter (the particle data group average value) by a factor of two and half. The second experiment (PrimEx-II) was carried out in fall 2010 with the final goal of 1.4% precision. A significant progress in the PrimEx-II data analysis has been achieved during this funding period.  It will provide a stringent test on the fundamental QCD prediction and shed light on our understanding of confinement QCD.  With the support from this award, PI and students designed and developed the low granularity detector arrays for the pair spectrometer in Hall D at Jefferson lab. The detector construction was completed recently in Aug. 2013. It will be a critical photon beam line diagnosis tool for the future 12 GeV physics projects.  This project engaged undergraduate students as key contributors. Nine students had directly worked on this project and spent at least two months at Jefferson Lab during the summer.  Four students completed independent study course requirement based on their research results related to this project.  The involvement of students in research has also lead student presentations at the university and several national conferences.  In addition, working in the international collaborations has offered students opportunities to gain global perspectives.
