    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop methods for modeling and design of complex vibration dampers (CVDs). A CVD consists of a large number of light vibration elements to be attached to a small region of a dynamical system to mitigate damage that would otherwise obtain because of the action of a complex forcing. The research will result in an analytical framework to provide the basis for prediction models, and thereby design strategies, for a broad range of applications. The research approach progresses from the protection of relatively simple structural elements, e.g. beams and plates, subject to idealized external forces to more complicated structural systems, e.g. structural frames, subject to highly complex and uncertain forces acting. Deliverables include an increased understanding of the role of CVDs in controlling the introduction of energy to a dynamical system by a complex external forcing; a parameterization of the asymptotic regime that defines the potential uses of CVDs, distinguishing sub-regimes for which the potential is greatest; and, the identification of system measures for the purpose of design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide an opportunity for the design of a new class of damage mitigating systems, for a range of structural systems and forcing conditions. One possible application would be mitigating the damage of a civil engineering structure, a high-rise building or bridge, subject to an earthquake force. Another would be enhancing the crash worthiness of vehicles. Still another would be reducing the severity of the interior of a military transport vehicle, subject to the blast force of a nearby explosion. Successful demonstration of the efficacy of CVDs for any and all of these applications will be disseminated to the appropriate engineering community for commercial exploitation.</AbstractNarration>
