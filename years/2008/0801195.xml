<AbstractNarration>The problems to be investigated are in the area of the theory of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups.  One of the main objectives is to continue the program of establishing a homogeneous space approach as a powerful tool in number theory.   Special attention will be given to the problem of "effectivization" in Oppenheim conjecture and its quantitative generalizations.  It is also proposed to continue to study recurrence properties of random walks on Lie groups and their discrete subgroups on homogeneous spaces, manifolds and general metric spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups is one of the central fields in mathematics.  During the last few decades, it was realized that some aspects of the theory can be applied to solve certain problems in number theory and related topics, which could not be tackled by other methods.  This proposal is related to rigidity theory that studies phenomena when rather weak data about geometric and mathematical objects determines completely or almost completely the structure of those objects.</AbstractNarration>
