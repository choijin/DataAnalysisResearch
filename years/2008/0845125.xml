<AbstractNarration>Wood, or xylem, is a globally important commodity that has been important to humans for building material, shelter, and fuel for millennia.  In plants, wood makes up the water transport tissue that is crucial for moving water and chemicals throughout the plant body to maintain healthy functioning.  Understanding how wood functions not only enables more efficient use of this important resource, but it is also important to the understanding of how plants are adapted to the environment, how ecosystems function, and how plants evolve.  Wood has important functions besides transport of water such as structural support of the plant body and storage of water and nutrients.  These functions are largely interdependent such that wood that is proficient at one function may necessarily be poor at another function giving rise to tradeoffs.  Understanding these tradeoffs, their structural basis, and evolutionary consequences is a central objective for plant biologists.  Although storage is an important wood function, research is lacking on how wood storage integrates with the water transport and mechanical support functions of wood.  The proposed study will examine xylem functional tradeoffs with an emphasis on how storage interacts with transport and biomechanical traits among plants in California's biodiverse Mediterranean type climate region.  To get a broad understanding of this topic, sampled species will include woody plants with evergreen and deciduous leaf habits, and plants that either sprout after fires or those that do not sprout.  Analyses will include both stems and roots.  This project will aid in the teaching of undergraduate and Master's students, and a post-doctoral scholar at a minority serving institution, California State University, Bakersfield.  The educational impact will be heightened by presentation of the ongoing research at an on campus Environmental Study Area, which hosts about 6000 visitors annually ranging from school children to seniors.  A summer program will also be initiated for high school/community college students and teachers to conduct plant research related to wood function.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The woody tissue of plants is commercially and ecologically important, yet many aspects of wood function remain a mystery.  Scientific interest in wood has mostly been aimed at understanding the water transported through and mechanical properties of this vital tissue.  Much less is known about the role that wood plays in storing nutrients.  It is likely that, in many cases, these three functions of wood, water transport, mechanical support, and storage, are interdependent, such that wood that is proficient at one function may necessarily be poor at another function giving rise to tradeoffs.  Understanding these tradeoffs, their structural basis, and evolutionary consequences is a central objective for plant physiologists and the topic of this award.  A key emphasis of this work has been to elucidate the relationship between storage of carbohydrates compared to other wood functions.  This work has become increasingly important in the context of understanding how the worldÆs woody vegetation responds to drought.  This is because when plants are water-limited they cannot acquire enough energy from the environment to support their base metabolic needs and must rely on the presence of stored carbohydrates to varying degrees to make it through lean times.  The hypothesis motivating this study was that storage of carbohydrates in wood has been a partial evolutionary driver among woody shrubs adapted to semi-arid landscapes.  By sampling a large number of woody species that represent a wide range of responses to water-limited conditions, we were able to evaluate how carbohydrate storage relates to other xylem functions.  Our data suggest that there is an association between carbohydrate content of wood and dehydration tolerance.  During water limited conditions, dehydration tolerant species do not maintain high levels of starch, whereas dehydration avoiding species do.  This relationship does not appear to be strongly driven by anatomy, i.e. dehydration avoiding species do not have much higher levels of the cells used to store starch.  Thus, the relationship is likely driven by physiological differences in water and solute balance, maintenance of water transport, and regulation of water loss from leaves.  In this context, this relationship does not describe a tradeoff per se, but instead represents an evolutionary divergence between species that differ in drought resistance characteristics.  This finding is important because it offers novel insights into how carbohydrate storage fits with the continuum of plants that are dehydration avoidant and tolerant.    A second objective of this study was to provide educational opportunities for students in science.  California State University, Bakersfield serves a large and diverse population in Kern County that is one of the least educated in the state.  As part of this award, five high school students, two high school teachers, 14 undergraduates, 3 graduate students, and two post-doctoral scholars were supported and gained experience in conducting scientific research.  One of the key activities was a summer research program in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in which my students participated.  This provided local high school students a unique inquiry-based experience where they got to participate in the research related to this award.  It also provided the college and post-doctoral studentÆs opportunities to develop teaching and mentoring skills as they shared their work with the high school students.  The involvement of local high school teachers helped to develop their skills in inquiry-based education activities.  Students presented posters of their work and presented them in a culminating experience held on campus and attended by family and students in all STEM fields.    The impact on education of this award has been high.  For example, assessment of the summer program suggests that it met many key objectives.  This is evident by the number of student participa...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
