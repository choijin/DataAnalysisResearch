<AbstractNarration>The project is to develop and evaluate longitudinal models that examine what and how students learn in the school setting.  With a focus on mathematics, it draws on a unique data set gathered by the existing Promoting Rigorous Outcomes in Mathematics/Science Education (PROM/SE) project.  This Comprehensive NSF/Math and Science Partnership (MSP) effort involving over 300,000 students in grades 3 through 12 and approximately 4,000 teachers in over 50 districts from the states of Michigan and Ohio collected data over the past 4 years, 2004-2008.  It consists of multi-grade curriculum measurements at different time points of (a) student knowledge in multiple content topics and of (b) student's opportunity to learn those topics.  The sample of students mirrors that of the nation both in demographics and socio-economic factors. &lt;br/&gt;The longitudinal models will involve three important issues: the exposure to important mathematics content students experience over time, (ii) the change in student mathematics knowledge in specific curricular sensitive content areas over time, and iii) how the relationship between these two changes.  This enables researchers to develop statistical models and evaluate them for three different longitudinal designs: i) one for synthetic cohorts involving multi-grade measurements at a single time point; ii) a second for true grade cohorts with repeated measurements at multiple time points; and iii) an individual longitudinal model involving repeated measurements at multiple time points. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The longitudinal models incorporate three important educational issues : i) students opportunity to learn (OTL) curriculum content, i.e., the exposure students experience over time, ii) the change in student achievement in specific content areas over time, and iii) the relationship between OTL and achievement.   The fit with the statistical models developed for each is to be explored, and compared and contrasted for results and conclusions that lead to policy implications. The results promise to inform a national model for the improvement of student achievement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined alternative approaches to studying the effect of content coverage in mathematics on student learning. Consolidated student and teacher data collected over an 8 year period for PROM/SE and this grant from grades 3 to 12, provided an opportunity to examine three different approaches to quantifying gain and its relationship to content coverage (Opportunities to Learn (OTL)). Gain is generally estimated using matched data over time at the student level (LG). As OTL was measured at the group (class or classes) level, the project focused on two alternatives to estimating gain: Cohort-Longitudinal (CL) and Synthetic Cohort-Longitudinal (SC) data. Instead of following each student, matching assessments at two time points, the SC approach used group data from adjacent grades that are assessed in the same year.  The assumption is that the two groups are equivalent in their demographic backgrounds and make-up.  The group level aggregates were then related to the OTL that the group received. Similarly, CL utilized group level aggregates except that the assessments were obtained from the same cohort measured over time.  This necessitated the administration of assessments in two different years and to the same group but without matching and tracking the individual students themselves.  It is clear that LG was the most expensive mode of collecting the data, followed by CL and SC.  An inspection of the combined file made it abundantly clear that obtaining student level matched data in a research project context is difficult. Seventy-four percent of the students were assessed only once.  After matching students with available OTL, more than 10 times the number of SC groups were available than LG or CL groups.  These groups were from different districts and schools.  To illustrate the comparison of the three approaches, grades 5 and 7 were chosen as each grade had more than 20 groups in common to all three approaches.  There were 26 groups with an average of 31 students per group for 5th grade, and 35 groups with an average of 56 students per groups for 7th grade, indicating that teachers typically taught more than one class in middle school.  In total, data from 2,768 students were included in the LG analysis.  Estimates for both gain and its relationship to OTL were comparable among the three approaches, particularly for the 7th grade. The standard errors of estimates, however, were greater for the CL and SC than LG.  This also confirmed that both Cohort-Longitudinal and Synthetic Cohort-Longitudinal designs would lead to similar results as the true Longitudinal design.
