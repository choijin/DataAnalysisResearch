<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 (DR-K12) proposal Effective Science Teaching for English Language Learners (ESTELL): A Pre-Service Teacher Professional Development Research Project Across Three Universities in California is submitted for consideration for a full research and development project in the Frontier Challenge Strand a ? assuring all students the opportunity to learn STEM content. Project investigators will conduct an experimental design study on the impact of an ESTELL elementary teacher education designed to prepare novice teachers to teach science to English Language Learner (ELL) and a qualitative study on program implementation. The ESTELL project builds on prior research in two areas: the integration of inquiry science, language and literacy practices; and the CREDE Five Standards for Effective Pedagogy which have identified a common set of teaching practices associated with increased achievement of ELL. This project will adapt this approach to pre-service teacher preparation. The ESTELL model of pre-service teacher education will be integrated into every stage of teacher preparation and induction from the science teaching methods courses in the post-baccalaureate credential programs, to the clinical setting of student teaching and the first two years of teaching. Researchers will focus on three research questions: (1) What is the impact of the ESTELL teacher education program on novice teachers beliefs and practice? (2) What is the relationship between the use of ESTELL by program graduates and the science achievement of 4th-5th grade students? and (3) What is the impact of the ESTELL program on the beliefs and practice of the participating science methods faculty, teacher supervisors and cooperating teachers?</AbstractNarration>

Prior research on this approach has been conducted in the classrooms of experienced teachers. This project extended the work to pre-service teacher education.  We compared pre-service teacher candidates in an treatment and a "business-as-usual" comparison group. The primary research questions posed were:  (1) Are there significant differences between the knowledge, beliefs and practice of elementary student and beginning teachers who participate in the ESTELL pre-service teacher education program when compared to student and beginning teachers who are not trained in the ESTELL model?  (2) Is the use of ESTELL teaching practices by ESTELL teacher education program graduates associated with higher K-6 student science achievement when compared to the achievement K-6 students in the classrooms of non-ESTELL beginning teachers?    The treatment involved two components: 1) An ESTELL-infused teacher education science methods course for pre-service teachers seeking certification to work in K through 8th grade classrooms and; 2) Placement of pre-service teachers in the treatment condition in a clinical site where the cooperating teacher participated in ESTELL-focused professional development (PD) activities. These PD activities paralleled those experienced by the pre-service teacher in the science methods course and also included a component of effective mentoring strategies.  Our study participants included a baseline control from 2008-09, in 2009-10 we conducted Phase One implementation, and in 2010-2011 Phase Two of our ESTELL treatment, with a total sample of 554 pre-service teachers.  We analyzed data gathered from a researcher constructed and tested attitudinal survey and classroom observation instrument. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to examine the study results. Since other factors can influence the implementation of the ESTELL pedagogy, we also tested whether or not the impact of the treatment was moderated by other contextual factors such as teacher demographic characteristics (ethnicity, gender, age), schooling information (undergraduate major in college), and information about the racial diversity of the neighborhoods where participants grew up.  In order to provide a more robust examination of the impact of the ESTELL intervention, we examined the effects of the treatment outcomes on the teacher beliefs survey among the intervention group, the control group, and the baseline control group. We found that the treatment condition pre-service teachers held stronger beliefs about the efficacy of the ESTELL practices than the comparison group and baseline comparison group. More specifically, the survey results showed that pre-service teachersÆ beliefs about the ESTELL pedagogy were higher on five of the six practices in relation to the comparison groups.  In order to examine the level of implementation of the ESTELL practices, teacher candidates were observed during their student-teaching practicum by a trained observer using an observation instrument. The ESTELL treatment group scored higher on all six domains of the ESTELL pedagogy, relative to the comparison group. Analysis of these results suggest that the ESTELL intervention preservice teachers scored higher and were able to make more connections between studentsÆ home/community/personal and ecological experiences as well as being more successful at integrating science talk to science instructional activities.
