<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Armstrong Atlantic State University (AASU) is developing STEM learning communities that focus on both undergraduate research and on targeted freshman experiences that include significant faculty and peer mentoring.  Twenty students will be selected each year to participate in a pre-freshman summer undergraduate research experience and participate in an intense one-week skill enhancement program in applied mathematics.  With university support, additional math tutoring will be continued through the students' freshman year.  These students, who will be joined by 52 additional AASU students, will participate in an academic year learning community experience that will include research supportive courses (inquiry-based format), experiential activities (field trips, community service projects, etc.), a monthly colloquium, and faculty and peer mentor tutoring and counseling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ STEP: Bridging the Gap: Using Research and Learning Communities to Increase STEM Majors at Armstrong State University was a highly successful initiative to increase the number of STEM graduates.  The intellectual merit of our program was that we used the current literature on learning communities, undergraduate research, peer-mentorship and summer bridge programs to design a two-summer program that fit the needs of our student body, an urban university with a high population of minority students, female students and students on financial aid (~50% Pell-eligible).    The broader impacts of our project include:     48% of the 86 STEP students were female, and 36% were minority students.  This is a higher percentage than the general STEM student population at Armstrong. The retention of STEP students to the university is higher than STEM students not in STEP.  The 1-year rate is 82% versus 70% and the 3-year rate is 56% versus 45%. The retention rate in STEM fields is also higher.   The 1-year retention is 72% versus the college average of 55% and the 3-year average is 46% versus the college average of 30% While over this grant program we only have 21 cohorts of 5 year graduation rates, the rate at which STEP students graduate with a STEM major is 29%, versus the general STEM student population of only 11% The number of STEM degrees has increased 50% since 2008, the year prior to STEP.  We now produce 191 degrees per year, up from 127, an increase of 64 degrees. College of Science and Technology (CST) enrollment has increased or remained steady since the STEP program began.  Our peak enrollment was in 2011 with 2002 majors, up from 1439 the year prior to STEP.   Since 2002, CST has followed the university's decline in enrollment and now sits at 1700 majors.  This represents a full 18% (261) increase in majors, even when the overall enrollment has decreased or remained flat. Culture change is evident in the increase in undergraduate research (UR) participation in the college. UR participation has increased 182% since the inception of the STEP program, from 72 participants prior to STEP to 203 participants each year. Student presentations of research increased 257% from 33 to 118, and students were co-authors on 41 publications.   Based on the success of the STEP program, the University hired a College UR Coordinator and committed funds to sustain the summer research program.  Georgia Power donated funds to establish the Georgia Power Scholars program.  This program also funds small UR grants for students each year and is an important step in UR sustainability at Armstrong.  Dz77%6-atlx?
