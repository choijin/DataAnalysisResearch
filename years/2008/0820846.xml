<AbstractNarration>PI: Sergey Nuzhdin, University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Eric von Wettberg, University of California, Davis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legume plants, including the agriculturally important species soybean, alfalfa, pea, and bean, collaborate with rhizobium bacteria to convert atmospheric nitrogen to biologically available ammonia. This property has enabled legumes to colonize marginal habitats and provides an ideal system to study how coevolution promotes adaptation to stressful environments. The model legume Medicago truncatula is a close relative of alfalfa and grows naturally in both highly saline soils across North Africa as well as on normal soils. In collaboration with Tunisian and French researchers, this research project will use genomic resources to understand how Medicago and its partner Sinorhizobium have adapted to saline soil. The main goal of this research is to identify both the genes and the genetic and biochemcial networks that underlie ecological differences between saline-adapted and non-adapted populations. By measuring the effects of these genes and networks under the natural conditions that plants experience, this research has the unique potential to bridge genetics, ecology, and evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statement broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;Soil salinisation is a growing problem with the potential to impact up to one third of agricultural land world-wide. Thus, understanding how abiotic factors, including salinity, impact symbiotic efficiency represents an important challenge for agriculture both in the developed and developing world.  Since Medicago truncatula is a model species, the genes and pathways identified in this research will be directly applicable to breeding efforts to improve many agriculturally important legumes and more broadly to plant biology as a whole. The interdisciplinary and inter-continental nature of this project further provides an exceptional training opportunity. This project will integrate Tunisian and American teams-facilitated by generous matching funds from public (UC Davis) and private (USC) institutions-by cooperatively performing field experiments in Tunisia and through the exchange of personnel. Tunisian students and scholars will be hosted at the US institutions where they will engage in research, undertake individually-tailored coursework, and make contacts that will spur their professional growth. American undergraduate and graduate students will benefit via hands-on research experience, individual mentored projects, and the opportunity to participate in workshops and conferences in North Africa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All data generated by this research will be made publicly available at http://nlab.usc.edu. The project website will be publicly accessible with released data and project updates. The genotyping array, and the genotype and phenotype data collected will serve as a community resource enabling future work on Medicago. The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed open-access journals, made accessible to the American and African media, and presented by junior members of the team at international meetings across the globe.</AbstractNarration>

For many traits, including biomass production and flowering time , plant genotypes had distinct responses to PE.  Four Mtr genotypes were analysed for PE contributions to maternally-derived transcripts in  mature seed. Among 4,358 expressed genes, GO analysis pointed to stress response, epigenetics, postembryonic development, protein and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, catabolic and biosynthetic processes, DNA and protein precursors and translation.  6) Mtr-Rhizobium epistasis for salinity response: To investigate the role of rhizobial symbionts on salt tolerance, we grew six Mtr genotypes factorially with fully sequenced strains Sinorhizobium melioti Rm1021 and Sinorhizobium medicae WSM419 at three salt concentrations in aseptic nutrient agar; finding a Mtr x strain x salt interaction for shoot length.  7) The core and pan-genomes of legume symbiont populations: To study legume-rhizobium coadaptation, we characterized the draft genomes of a collection of wild symbiotic Mesorhizobium isolates with known nickel tolerance profiles.  8) Transcriptome analysis of the Medicago relatives Melilotus siculus (Mes) and Melilotus albus (Mea): To gain insight on highly salt tolerant relative of Mtr, Mes, we took a transcriptome approach. Water-logging treatment causes massive shifts in the transcriptome in Mea, including upregulation of central metabolism.  9) Mtr-M. littoralis (Mli) hybrid zone in Portugal: Mli occurs in sandy shores and Mtr in moderate to heavy soils, overlapping with intermediate hybrid forms. These hybrids may reveal novel sources of adaptation to soil salinity/texture. We found a species by treatment interactions where hybrids had a lower decrease on root growth rate with increasing salt concentration and where roots tend to get thicker at a higher rate than the "pure" parent species.  10) Development of a Generic Model Organism Database phenotype schema and prototype web interface: To facilitate our research while simultaneously contributing synergistically to the broader community of biologists working to develop interoperable databases for phenotype data, we co-developed the Chado "Natural Diversity" module.  11) Broader Impacts.
