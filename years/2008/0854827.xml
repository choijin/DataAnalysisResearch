<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutrinos offer a new way to look at the sky. As a new generation of experiments is being developed, the detection of neutrinos from core collapse supernovae and stellar jets finally is within reach, with unprecendented potential to learn about these sources and about the properties of the neutrinos as a particle. This proposal has the main goal to contribute to  the theory of neutrinos from astrophysical sources, in guidance and support of this new phase of neutrino astrophysics research. Being based at a large public university, it has the potential to actively involve postdocs and students. This mentoring activity will contribute to educating a new generation of neutrino theorists that is urgently needed in this exciting time.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
