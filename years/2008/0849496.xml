<AbstractNarration>Rare economic disasters, such as the Great Depression and World War II, play a central role in assessing the uncertain macroeconomic future and in  understanding the pricing of assets. The PI's previous cross-country research back to 1870 used existing and new macroeconomic data to quantify the role of rare disasters in explaining major asset-pricing puzzles, including the high equity premium and low risk-free rate of return. The current project plans a substantial expansion of the long-term national-accounts data for up to 40 countries. These data are integral to the current project but will also be of great value for studies carried out by many economists. The current application will use the new data to study further the interplay between rare macroeconomic disasters and asset markets.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; One part of the research considers asset pricing at the super-national level, such as the OECD or various regional aggregates. This application requires the construction of measures of per capita consumer expenditure and GDP at super-national levels. Another part fits the distribution of disaster sizes to a power-law density function, thereby allowing for potential disasters that exceed any observed within the large cross-country sample back to 1870. This extension makes it possible to explain the observed equity premium with a lower degree of risk aversion. Further work will use the full cross-country time series of per capita consumer spending and GDP to estimate the probability of disaster, the evolution of macroeconomic aggregates during disasters, the probability of returning from disaster to normalcy, and the extent to which disasters have only temporary effects on GDP and consumption (because of strong post-disaster recoveries). This analysis will show how asset pricing depends on the likely duration of disasters and on the partly temporary nature of disaster effects. Further work will use stock-index options prices and quality spreads in interest rates to derive measures of time-varying disaster probabilities. This analysis can explain the volatility of asset prices and also allow for time-varying equity premia. A final extension will study in detail the Great Influenza Epidemic of 1917-20 as a shock that led to a widespread macroeconomic contraction with troughs typically in 1920-21.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Broader Impacts. The recent international turmoil in housing, financial, and commodity markets and the strong responses of the Federal Reserve and other policymakers reflect fears of a new Great Depression. Further study using long-term, cross-country national-accounts data is needed to understand the frequencies, sizes, and macroeconomic role of these kinds of rare economic disasters. This study seeks to clarify the significance of these events for asset markets, economic fluctuations, welfare, and optimal government policies. The first research need, critical for understanding rare events, is the construction of more long-term data. This need has been addressed in research to date and in planned future efforts for several countries, including the United States. These data are central for the present study but will also have numerous uses for other macroeconomists. The second research need, a central part of the proposal, involves further progress in the underlying theoretical and empirical analysis of rare disasters, economic fluctuations, and asset pricing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One side effect of the macroeconomic and financial crises of 2008-10 is that economists became more receptive to models of asset pricing and macroeconomic dynamics that emphasize rare macroeconomic disasters.   A key component of these models is that the perceived probability of future disasters has important implications for the pricing of assets, such as stocks and low-risk claims.  Moreover, changes in perceived disaster probabilities matter a lot for changes in asset values and for the evolution of the macro economy.  My research on rare macroeconomic disasters was greatly assisted by advances by Jose Ursua (part of this research project) in the construction of long-term national-accounts data for many countries.  We now have useful annual data back at least to 1913 and in many cases to 1870 for 40 countries for gross domestic product and 28 countries for consumer expenditure.  These data show that the prominent historical examples of macroeconomic disasters&mdash;declines in per capita GDP by 10% or more&mdash;include the devastation of many economies during major wars, notably World War II and World War I, and financial crises, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s.  Otherwise, the main isolated in these data is the Great Influenza Epidemic of 1918-20.  In contrast, the Great Recession of 2008-10 is much milder than the historical examples of macro disasters.  My research from 2006 through 2011 shows that a baseline theoretical model of rare macro disasters, when calibrated with the historical experience of actual disasters, can explain important asset-pricing puzzles featured in the finance literature.  These puzzles include the large equity premium (excess of average returns on stocks over those on low-risk assets such as Treasury Bills) and the low average return on nearly risk-free assets.  One key aspect of the match between theory and data is the "fat-tailed" nature of macro disasters&mdash;the contractions are very large, ranging up to 60% of GDP, although they occur rarely, with an average frequency around 4% per year.  Another central element is that the typical economic agent has a substantial though not astronomical degree of risk aversion.   Subsequent research by other economists has substantially extended the list of finance puzzles that can be explained by rare-disaster models.  Other research has generalized the underlying theory.  For example, a paper that I published with co-authors in 2013 extends the basic framework to allow for a varying duration of disaster events (for example, around four years for the Great Depression) and for the recovery that typically follows the ending of disasters (such as the strong economic growth in many countries following World War II).  Other research has allowed for variation over time in perceived probabilities of disasters and in long-run rates of economic growth.  My recent research has extended the baseline rare-disasters framework in several ways.  In a paper presented as the Phillips Lecture at the LSE in 2014 and forthcoming in Economica in 2015, I viewed potential environmental disasters as analogous to the rare macro disasters observed in the long-term data.  Environmental investment was viewed as a mechanism for reducing the likelihood or potential size of these disasters.  Because of the fat-tailed nature of these events, combined with a reasonable degree of risk aversion, substantial environmental investment can be warranted even allowing for reasonable long-run discount rates.  Thus, the case for mitigating environmental risks does not depend on the unrealistically low discount rates assumed in the famous Stern Review.  In another study, forthcoming in the Economic Journal in 2015, I apply the rare-disasters framework to returns on physical commodities, such as gold.  The model accords with the low long-term average growth rate of goldÆs real price (around 1% per year) and with goldÆs failure to serve as a reliable hedge against disaster events.
