    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0847524&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jian Song&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on a number of projects on canonical metrics&lt;br/&gt;and stability, geometric flows and complex Monge-Ampere&lt;br/&gt;equations. Such problems are fundamental in complex analysis and&lt;br/&gt;complex geometry, in tight relation to partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. The&lt;br/&gt;recent progress and influx of new ideas from Ricci flow,&lt;br/&gt;pluripotential theory and the minimal model program in algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry have unravelled a deep, rich and unifying structure.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate the limiting behavior of the Kahler-Ricci&lt;br/&gt;flow and its connection to the classification theory for&lt;br/&gt;algebraic varieties, inspired by Perelman's breakthrough in&lt;br/&gt;Hamilton's program to resolve the geometrization conjecture by&lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow. In particular, the PI aims to study the relation&lt;br/&gt;between the formation of finite time singularities of the&lt;br/&gt;Kahler-Ricci flow and the algebraic surgery in the minimal model&lt;br/&gt;program in algebraic geometry. The PI also intends to continue&lt;br/&gt;his study on canonical metrics of Einstein type on algebraic&lt;br/&gt;varieties and understand the analytic and geometric aspects of&lt;br/&gt;the singularities of such special metrics. The PI also plans to&lt;br/&gt;study the uniform approximation problem of the Monge-Ampere&lt;br/&gt;geodesics in infinite dimensional symmetric space by those in the&lt;br/&gt;finite dimensional Bergman spaces. The precise understanding of&lt;br/&gt;this problem will give new insight into Yau's conjecture on the&lt;br/&gt;relation between Kahler-Einstein metrics and certain stability in&lt;br/&gt;the sense of geometric invariant theory. The outcome of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will develop new tools and give profound&lt;br/&gt;insights and understanding of geometry and the structure of the&lt;br/&gt;universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems in the proposal arise naturally from our attempts to&lt;br/&gt;understand nonlinear differential equations from geometry and&lt;br/&gt;physics. The solutions to these problems will have strong impact&lt;br/&gt;on other fields of sciences such as physics and cosmology in the&lt;br/&gt;deep understanding of our universe. The method of analyzing&lt;br/&gt;singularities of nonlinear equations will have wide applications&lt;br/&gt;in physics, engineering and economics. Furthermore, the PI plans&lt;br/&gt;to disseminate the exciting research at the interface of geometry&lt;br/&gt;and analysis to a broad audience through lectures and&lt;br/&gt;workshops. The proposed project will bring in research and&lt;br/&gt;teaching innovation in mathematics from various disciplines and&lt;br/&gt;have an immediate beneficial effect on undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students at Rutgers as well as in the regional mathematical&lt;br/&gt;community. The PI will also organize and participate in the&lt;br/&gt;integrated research/education programs and activities that will&lt;br/&gt;promote the education level of the nation.</AbstractNarration>
