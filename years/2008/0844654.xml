<AbstractNarration>The proposal offers an innovative approach to automatic music audio analysis using signal processing and harmonic methods. This is a contribution to the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) based on isolating chord sequences in western tonal music archives. The approach is modeled in part on work in bioinformatics, particularly work in structure alignment. The proposed work intends to expand on current approaches to music analysis whcih are limited because of insufficient attention to temporality - a key aspect of musical composition. A new signal processing method is proposed for the isolation of chords and chord sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
