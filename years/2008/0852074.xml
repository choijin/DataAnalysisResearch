<AbstractNarration>This award supports an REU / RET site in physics at Brigham Young University. Participating students will engage in a ten-week summer physics research program in computational plasma physics, ultrafast nonlinear optics, experimental and computational condensed matter physics, x-ray and XUV sources and optics, microfabrication technology, metrology, astronomy, or materials science. Participating students will have the opportunity to experience the joy of research by being involved in all aspects of a research project from proposal presentation through performing the research and reporting their results. The program will focus on developing students' abilities and interest in physics research by hands-on experiences. There will also be some direct mentoring and group training to help the students acquire the skills they will need to get started in their research projects. Group training will include instruction in experimental and computational techniques, sensitivity to experiences of underrepresented groups in the disciplines, preparation for graduate school, and scientific writing and presentations. Students will also benefit from close and direct mentoring by faculty members involved in their research projects. This contact will give them role models for professional ethics and standards and opportunities to discuss many aspects of graduate school opportunities and careers in physics and related fields. Special efforts will be made to recruit and accommodate women and minority students in physics and those from two-year and four-year colleges in our geographical region. The site will also include an RET program involving three secondary school teachers. The teachers will work alongside the REU students in similar research projects under the supervision of faculty mentors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our Research Experience for Undergraduates Program in Physics at Brigham Young University was designed to give undergraduate students (REU) and secondary science teachers (RET) an opportunity to participate in a ten week mentored research experience.  Over the three year period of this contract, we involved 36 undergraduate students and 7 secondary teachers in our program.  They came from across the U.S. from Hawaii to Massachusetts but were predominantly from the Western United States.  The participants were given an opportunity to see a research project from its proposal and inception to completion and final reporting.  All of the participants presented the results of their work to the entire group in written and oral form.  Most of them also had an opportunity to present a paper based on their work at a regional or national conference.   Some of them were co-authors of journal articles based on the work they did during the summer.  Many of our participants hadnÆt had any research experience prior to joining our program.  To help them bridge the gap between classroom physics and research physics, we offered short mini-classes throughout the course of the experience.  These included topics such as laboratory safety, scientific software, ethics, graduate school (preparation, application, and selection), vacuum systems, machine shop use, detectors, and research surveys.  The most valuable learning experience for participants came from their interaction with faculty mentors while conducting their research projects.  Almost every participant mentioned this as the most valuable part of their REU or RET experience.  One of our project goals was to particularly encourage participation from people who might not otherwise go on to careers in physics.  So, for instance, we worked hard to get applicants from groups which are underrepresented in physics (women and certain minority groups, for instance).  We also emphasized involvement of students from schools without large research programs.  The RET participants were encourage to find ways to leverage their summer experience to improve their classroom teaching.  We had discussions with them as a separate group on ways to do this and helped them get some laboratory supplies they could bring back with them to their home schools to help give their students experiences related to what they did during the summer.  The participantÆs projects were in a wide variety of areas across the sub-disciplines in our Department of Physics and Astronomy.  A few representative ones are highlighted below.  We had a number of interesting acoustics projects.  In one, a participant studied the noise from the exhaust of a fighter airplane.  His studies will help the Air Force minimize hearing loss from personnel working near the planes.  Another student studied with directivity of the music from a flute and a concert grand piano.  Her data will assist designers of concert halls to improve the listening experience across the hall.  Several other participants measured how the sound travels from an exploding balloon in a large open area in the Bonneville Salt Flats.  The exploding balloon is a commonly used demonstration in physics labs which could damage student hearing if done incorrectly.  Their data will provide information to physics and chemistry instructors on how to reduce the dangers of such a hearing loss.  A number of other students looked into novel applications of carbon nanotube "forests."  Carbon nanotubes are long thin chains of carbon atoms with novel mechanical and electrical properties.  They can be grown to form a "forest" or twisted tubes.  One participant investigated how to use such a forest as a water or air filter.  It promises significant advantages over current commercial filters.  Another looked into using a carbon nanotube forest to analyze the different materials in a mixture.  The forest acts like wick when a liquid is put on one part of it.  The different constituents in the liqui...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
