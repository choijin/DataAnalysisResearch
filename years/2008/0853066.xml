<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is the development of single wall carbon nanotube photo-mechanical actuators for the development of nanotube based sensors and actuators.  Single wall carbon nanotubes have been recently demonstrated as a new class of actuator materials that require only small voltages for actuation. While much work has gone into the area of nanotube based electrical actuators, the field of optically driven nanotube actuators is at best nascent. The approach of this research is the fabrication and combination of nanotubes with material systems such as electro-active polymers to transduce the light energy that is incident on the nanotube sheet to actuate the polymer and develop wavelength selective photo-actuators. Finally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The impact of this research is in the area of sensors and actuators. Currently piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials used for actuators require electronics that have to generate hundreds of volts for actuation. The photonic actuators are light- weight and can actuate remotely that can be utilized in interplanetary space missions. Further, the development of nanotube based micro-opto-mechanical systems can be utilized for label free genetic analysis of biomarkers in cells that can be used for monitoring autoimmune diseases with high ultra-high sensitivity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The success of this proposal will demonstrate the applications of this technology for micro-opto-mechanical systems for label free genetic analysis in cells. The research brings in opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student training in nanotechnology. Industrial partnerships through this research can potentially be used for commercialization of this technology and can bring greater benefit to the society and economy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
