<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: While the oxidation of Mn(II) has long been recognized as microbially-mediated, the role of bacteria in this process has only been attributed to direct enzymatic mechanisms. Recently we have discovered an alternative Mn(II) oxidation pathway, which occurs via reaction with soluble, photo-active factors produced by bacteria during heterotrophic growth. These findings introduce a new redox currency in the cycling of Mn and illustrate that the pathways responsible for Mn(II) oxidation are more diverse than originally thought. Here we propose to interrogate this pathway using Roseobacter AzwK-3b as a model bacterium. Due to the numerical abundance, ecological diversity, and geochemical relevance (e.g. DMSP degradation) of Roseobacter species in surface environments, AzwK-3b will serve as an environmentally relevant model organism. Furthermore, AzwK-3b is genetically tractable and the genome is now available allowing for complementary studies on the genes and gene products involved in light enhanced Mn(II) oxidation. The proposed research will address three objectives, which are to (1) identify and purify the photo-active factor, (2) determine the intermediates and byproducts, and (3) define the rates and solid-phase products of light enhanced Mn(II) oxidation. Obtaining these objectives will elucidate the intricacies of the geochemical reaction progression and the environmental impact of this coupled biotic-abiotic process. The rates and products of this pathway will be compared to other abiotic and biotic oxidative mechanisms to determine if chemical and/or mineralogical (bio)signatures exist that may aid in delineating the relative importance of the various Mn(II) oxidative mechanisms in the environment. We predict that this research will introduce a novel, ubiquitous secondary metabolite involved in the cycling of Mn and the formation of distinct, reactive oxide phases within surface environments. Information gleaned from this research will have immediate, transformative impacts on our understanding of the cycling of Mn and provide the foundation for future explorations into the diverse and complex world of microbially mediated redox cycling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this research are environmental, educational, and professional in nature. The oxidation of Mn(II) has sweeping environmental ramifications, impacting the transport of contaminants, degradation of carbon, cycling of nutrients, and function of anaerobic-based metabolisms. In particular, Mn oxides are among the strongest sorbents and oxidants in the environment and consequently impact the cycles of nearly all other elements. Passive Mn(II) removal systems are currently being employed to remediate metal-laden acidic mine drainage from coal mine sites throughout Appalachia. As we continue our current efforts to explore the applied aspects of light enhanced Mn(II) oxidation, the research proposed herein will provide the mechanistic understanding of this pathway that will, ideally, lend insight into how to optimize these remediation approaches for peak Mn(II) oxidation and sequestration of associated contaminants. The proposed research will involve a cooperative effort by the PI, a postdoctoral scientist, and two undergraduate students. The undergraduate students will play an integral role in this research and will spearhead a portion of the experimental tasks while under the guidance of the PI and postdoctoral scientist. This research will fund 3 female scientists, which includes the PI and a postdoctoral scientist and undergraduate student currently in the PI?s laboratory. Underrepresented groups will also be the focus for the other undergraduate student recruitment. The postdoc and undergraduates will be encouraged to present their findings in at scientific meetings and local seminar groups at Harvard. The results of this research will be further disseminated to the scientific community through publications within high profile, peer-reviewed scientific journals. Lastly, this proposal will support the work of an early-career faculty member and results of this research will be integrated into the undergraduate and graduate level courses currently being developed by the PI.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
