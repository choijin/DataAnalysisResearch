<AbstractNarration>Shepler and Witherspoon will develop a theory of deformations expanding that for graded Hecke algebras.  They will study deformations of skew group algebras that combine groups of symmetries with algebras of functions. Particular deformations of these algebras arose independently in work by many prominent mathematicians in representation theory and noncommutative geometry, but many open questions remain.  Shepler and Witherspoon will answer some of these questions using new tools created by blending methods from invariant theory, combinatorics, homological algebra, and representation theory.  They also will solve some basic open problems about the structure and cohomology of Hopf algebras and prove several conjectures on modular reflection groups, invariant theory, and arrangements of hyperplanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objects throughout the natural world reveal themselves through their symmetries, for example, crystals, molecules, DNA, and quantum systems.  When we deform an object, we alter or even break the symmetry.  Remarkably often, we discover new attributes of the object after studying its deformations. Shepler and Witherspoon's research program on graded Hecke algebras and related deformations addresses a variety of mathematical fields and grows from the exploding interest the mathematical community shows in graded Hecke algebras. Hecke algebras are pervasive throughout mathematics, appearing in algebra, geometry, number theory, combinatorics, topology, statistics, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, special functions, quantum groups, knot theory, and conformal field theory. Shepler and Witherspoon are active in the mathematical community, mentoring students and postdocs, collaborating with international experts, and organizing conferences and workshops. Their research program supports these broader activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award supported Principal Investigator Anne SheplerÆs work in theoretical mathematics.  Scientists gravitate toward symmetry in biological and physical systems, such as the internal blueprint of a simple starfish or String TheoryÆs depiction of the universe as a Calabi-Yau manifold.  We tend to sweep symmetry aside by focusing on one rigid copy of a repeating pattern, or we ignore the template completely to fixate on ways of gluing one copy of a pattern to another.  Shepler considers Smash Product Algebras, which interweave gluing rules and template patterns in order to turn geometric problems into algebraic challenges.      Shepler proved several new mathematical theories as a result of this award, combining tools from geometry, invariant theory, homological algebra, and combinatorics to decode the deformation theory of Smash Product Algebras.  Deformation Theory allows scientists to insert control knobs (parameters) in complicated systems of information and then twist those knobs independently (alter parameters) to explore hidden properties.  With collaborators, the PI discovered new theorems on the structure of cohomology, proved new results on quantum polynomial rings, and isolated tests for finding deformations of quadratic algebras.  This research resulted in several scientific articles in international research journals and several invited talks at various institutions and professional conferences.     The NSF award also supported SheplerÆs outreach, training, and mentoring activities.  During the grant, Shepler served as Ph.D. advisor to three students (one who graduated in 2012), organized a summer Research Experience for Undergraduates, worked with junior faculty/postdocs/graduate students at other institutions, and initiated three graduate student workshops with nearby institutions.  In addition, Shepler worked with faculty at nearby universities to start a new regional conference series (serving on the Scientific Committee and as local coorganizer) called "TORA, Texas-Oklahoma Representations and Automorphic Forms".  The TORA series of meetings fuels collaboration among researchers working in number theory and representation theory in the south-central area of the US and provides support and training to regional graduate students.
