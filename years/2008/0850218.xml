<AbstractNarration>The College of Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) will implement FORCES (Focus On Retention in Cohorts of Engineering Students) to create two cohorts each with  21 engineering students supported by scholarships in their freshman and sophomore years. FORCES cohort students will take classes together and a peer counselor-taught class covering academic skills and engineering topics. Additionally, the FORCES program will provide student support academic activities during all semesters. The FORCES cohort program will be open to all incoming freshman engineering majors with financial need who have acceptable admission credentials and test ready for Pre-Calculus I; emphasis will be placed on recruiting students historically underrepresented in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The College of Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington  (UTA) has implemented FORCES (Focus On Retention in Cohorts of  Engineering Students) since Summer 2009 to support cohorts of  engineering students with scholarships and academic services in their  freshman and sophomore years. FORCES cohort students take a number of  classes together, which includes a peer counselor-taught class covering  academic skills and engineering topics.  Attrition in engineering majors at UTA and elsewhere occurs largely  in the first two years. FORCES seeks to retain engineering students  through these years by ensuring they use peer mentoring, participate in  study groups, attend selected extra-curricular activities, and complete a  success skills program, as well as attend classes with their cohort.  Requiring these activities creates a unique cohort that can be compared  to students participating/not participating in other cohort programs.  This assessment research will lead to better understanding the value of  support services and clearer indications of how to best use these  programs to support engineering students at UTA and elsewhere.  The program objectives were:  1. Increase  educational opportunities for financially needy undergraduate  engineering Students, with emphasis on those from typically  underrepresented groups (females, ethnic minorities and persons with  disabilities).  2.. Improve retention of engineering students in the  coursework leading up to the engineering Professional Programs through a  combination of cohort placement and required participation in support  activities.  3. Increase students' knowledge of career opportunities in industry, academia and elsewhere through actual experiences.  4. Assess the effectiveness of the required support activities as they relate to retention in engineering.    The  project appears to have achieved its first objective of increasing  educational opportunities for underrepresented students because the  percentage of underrepresented students receiving financial assistance  is greater than their overall representation within engineering; female  representation in the Fall 2010 cohort appears to be the exception to  this accomplishment.  The study made every effort to increase studentsÆ  knowledge of career opportunities; at this time, this particular  objective does not have any direct measures of effectiveness.  However,  anecdotal student responses and interactions indicate project success  for this objective as well.  The second and fourth research objectives  center on retention.  As stated earlier, the FORCES program shows some  significant impacts both in overall retention to the professional  program (third year of study) across all cohorts and graduation rates  for a particular cohort.  While these gains appear promising, they  require further investigation to identify and evaluate the factors that  help some cohorts perform better than others.  The overall retention in  the third year does not appear to have fully translated into  significantly greater overall graduation rates, which makes further  investigation into the causes of this phenomenon critical.
