<AbstractNarration>This project probes the relationship between the 3-dimensional structure of organic molecules that carry an electric charge and their chemical reactivity.  A key objective of this program is to compare the behavior of ions in the gas phase with those in condensed phases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The picture of how ions behave in the gas phase in relation to their behavior in condensed phases remains incomplete, although there are many parallels.  Some ions cannot be made in solution and can be explored only in the gas phase, but others can be made under a variety of conditions.  Comparison reveals the effects of solvent and of pairing with opposite charges.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity&lt;br/&gt; Undergraduate instruction plays an important role in disseminating new results. The PI has invested much effort in teaching small sections (beyond his assigned teaching load) to communicate insights from research.  Offered through the UC Riverside's Honors' Program, these sections introduce students to hypothesis testing based on conformational analysis and ion chemistry of small molecules. The PI has developed a course in which, from fall 2006 through the end of 2008, approximately 120 sophomores and juniors (of whom &gt;25% are under-represented minorities, including 8 Chicana/o, 9 other Latina/o, 11 Pacific Islander, 3 African American) have been instructed how to perform molecular modeling on a computer independently, with a view towards comparing computed predictions with experimental data.&lt;br/&gt; In regard to research publication, development of mass spectrometric methodology for analyzing how bacteria oxidize alkanes is germane to environmental issues regarding worldwide extraction and transportation of petroleum. With respect to peptide mass spectrometry, development of MS/MS methodology for detecting and quantitating amino acid and peptide stereoisomers will make it possible to assess more routinely how widespread post-translational modification via amino acid epimerization may turn out to be in biological systems.&lt;br/&gt; In the research laboratories, a major objective is the education of Ph.D. students to combine organic chemistry with instrumental methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT: CHE0848517    T.H. Morton, Principal Investigator        Molecules are held together by chemical bonds, which can be classed into several different categories.  When a molecule carries an electric charge it is called an ion.  Ions can be separated by mass in the gas phase and suspended in a vacuum for many seconds.  In this way, ions can be probed in order to understand the nature of their chemical bonds.        Chemists usually classify bonds as single, double, triple, etc., which correspond to what is known as the bond order.   In other words, most chemists think of bond order as having an integer value (1, 2, 3, etc.).  The investigations supported by this grant have looked at bonds that have to be described, in some cases, as possessing fractional bond order; indeed, in several examples, as having bond order less than 1.        One of the best ways to determine bond order experimentally is through vibrational spectroscopy.  Most commonly, this technique looks at the absorption of infrared radiation at specific frequencies, which gives an experimental idea of the stiffness of a chemical bond.  In the example of ions derived from the reaction of para-fluoroacetophenone (and its isotopically substituted analogue) with the trifluoromethyl cation in the gas phase, the infrared spectrum (recorded using a technique called IRMPD) of the reaction product in Figure 1 exhibits two types of carbon-fluorine bonds.  One is a C-F single bond (bond order = 1) between the benzene ring and a fluorine atom attached to it.  The other is the bond created by the transposition of an oxygen atom for a positively charged fluorine (two species with the same number of electrons) in a reaction known as fluoronium metathesis.  The carbon-fluorine bond created by the fluoronium metathesis reaction has a bond order that lies between bond order=1 and bond order=2.  There are some slight differences between the blue trace and the black trace, but the most important peak (between 1400 and 1450 cm-1) in the present discussion does not shift position, although it becomes somewhat narrower in the isotopically substituted ion.  The chemical bond is much stiffer than a C-F single bond and corresponds to a bond order of about 1.4.        Another way to produce bonds with fractional bond order is to substantially weaken a double bond.  This has been achieved experimentally by adding a trifluoromethyl cation to the oxygen of a carbonyl (C=O) group.  Figure 2 shows the infrared spectrum of acetone to which a trifluoro-methyl cation on the oxygen. The carbon-oxygen bond is weakened to such an extent that its bond order is between 1 and 2.       Experimental studies with hydrogen bonds (such as those that hold DNA together) in positive ions display molecular vibrations characteristic of bonds with bond order between zero and 1.  The intramolecular proton bridge represented in Figure 3 illustrates an example, where the fractional bond order is revealed by the low frequency observed for the N-H stretch.
