<AbstractNarration>In this award funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor John B. Asbury of the Pennsylvania State University will use two-dimensional infrared spectroelectrochemistry to study the molecular structures of defects in organic electronic materials.  When electrons or positively charged carriers (termed holes) become trapped at defects in organic electronic materials, the electrical functionality of the materials is significantly reduced.  The research funded by this award will use the dynamics of molecular vibrations in conjunction with their frequencies to elucidate the structures of defects in organic photovoltaic materials.  In particular, defects will be charged electrochemically allowing them to be examined with two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy.  The vibrational dynamics and 2D line shapes of charged defects will be compared to the corresponding features of the neutral materials for which structural assignments are known, thus facilitating structural elucidation of the defects.  This approach will be used to establish predictive relationships among the structural and electrical characteristics and the corresponding defect structures and energetic distributions in organic photovoltaic materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy as an analytical tool to examine defects will impact the organic electronics field by developing predictive structure-property relationships.  Knowledge of these relationships will guide the rational design of organic photovoltaic materials that resist the formation of or are tolerant to defects, leading to the development of inexpensive solid state solar cells with greater than 10% power conversion efficiency.  The understanding of charged defects will also facilitate the development of inexpensive lighting and display technologies based on organic electronic materials.  The interdisciplinary nature of the research program will stimulate graduate and undergraduate researchers to work at the interface of ultrafast spectroscopy and materials disciplines.  The educational plan is firmly rooted in the recommendations of the National Academies for enhancing the science and technology enterprise in the United States.  Special emphasis is placed on targeting secondary school science education by involving in-service high school teachers in the research program supported by this award and by developing summer curricula for students from under-performing high schools through the Upward Bound Math and Science program of the U.S. Department of Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With support from this award, the Asbury group has developed a new experimental technique, ultrafast Solvatochromism Assisted Vibrational Spectroscopy (SAVS), to examine charge carrier dynamics at buried interfaces in organic photovoltaic materials.  Using SAVS, Asbury's team positively identified and time-resolved the fundamental processes leading to solar energy conversion in an emerging class of solar energy material known as organic solar cells.  The unique approach developed by the PI's team enabled them to elucidate the role that molecular structure has in determining the mechanism of solar energy conversion in these materials.  The PI's findings reveal that molecular systems capable of supporting efficient charge photogeneration at interfaces of electron donating and accepting materials that lie at the heart of organic solar cell operation.   Furthermore, these observations provided a new conceptual framework with which to understand the molecular structure dependence of the quantum yield for photocurrent generation in organic photovoltaics and to guide the selection of alternatives to fullerenes as electron acceptors in these materials.  The ability of a molecular system to efficiently generate photocurrent is related to the topology of the conjugated frameworks and to the intermolecular order within the molecular assembly.  The PI's findings indicate that fullerenes, and in general molecules with three-dimensional topology, are able to support significant electron delocalization even in the presence of significant intermolecular disorder.  In contrast, conjugated molecules with planar conjugated frameworks such as perylene diimides require a greater degree of intermolecular order to support electron delocalization that is comparable to that of disordered fullerenes.  The research provided a fertile environment in which to engage underrepresented high school students in research of direct relevance to solar energy conversion.  In partnership with the Summer Experiences in Eberly College of Science and the Upward Bound Math and Science Program at Penn State, the PI's team led groups of underrepresented high school students from underserved schools in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and Reading.  These students presented their findings before an audience of more than 80 other high school students, their graduate mentors and participating faculty.  The group in the PIÆs lab from 2012 won the competition for the best presentation that was judged by graduate students and facutly members associated with the program.
