<AbstractNarration>Nicolas Polfer from the University of Florida (UF) is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division to investigate the collision-induced dissociation (CID) of peptides, a cornerstone in mass spectrometric sequencing and identification of peptides and proteins.  Under the high-energy conditions of CID, some fragments can undergo rearrangement processes, such that the original sequence information is lost.  This "scrambling" process is thought to operate via a cyclization reaction from the N-terminus.  Dr. Polfer's group employs infrared photodissociation spectroscopy to identify the fragment structures formed, and ion mobility mass spectrometry to separate and quantify the often heterogeneous mixtures of CID products.  The studies seek to determine whether sequence "scrambling" and/or other processes are pervasive and thus a concern for peptide misidentification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project exposes undergraduate students at UF and high-school teachers in Florida to life sciences and life science-enabling technologies (such as mass spectrometry) via the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Science for Life program, where undergraduates are introduced to highly interdisciplinary approaches and techniques important for biotechnology.  The PI is also developing modules focused on the application of cutting-edge technologies related to protein identification and mass spectrometry for summer teacher workshops organized by the Center for Precollegiate Education and Training at UF.  Teachers are encouraged to transfer derived knowledge and skills to their high-school classrooms; a follow-up spring workshop follows their progress.  The project supports participation by teachers from disadvantaged areas.</AbstractNarration>
