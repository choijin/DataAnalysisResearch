<AbstractNarration>This international award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) at NSF and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in Germany supports Professor David A. Vicic of the University of Hawaii for the development of new methods of chemical bond formation using one-electron redox processes.  The researchers will rationally manipulate alkyl-alkyl cross coupling reactions so that new, saturated carbon-carbon bonds can be formed.  The spectroelectrochemical analyses of terpyridine-based nickel complexes are being studied under catalytically-relevant conditions and preparative-scale, electrocatalytic cross-coupling reactions will be explored.  Professor Axel Klein of the University of Cologne in Germany will collaborate on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurements and spectroelectrochemical studies.  U.S. graduate students will be trained in his laboratories.  The introduction of a new EPR spectrometer (co-funded by the University of Hawaii) will be unique in the state and will greatly enhance the infrastructure of this geographically-remote location.  The alkyl-alkyl cross coupling reactions represent high risk / high reward chemistry that may play crucial roles in synthesis of saturated carbon-carbon bonds, important feedstocks for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Many of today's new materials, drugs, and agricultural products can be prepared more cheaply using abundant and environmentally benign metals such as iron, nickel, and copper.  However, these metals tend to perform chemistry via one-electron redox events that often lead to intermediates that are high in energy and unselective for synthetic transformations.  In order to develop more sophisticated synthetic methods for using these metals to produce high-value chemicals, a deeper mechanistic understanding of the one-electron redox chemistry must be obtained.     We have collaborated with scientists in Germany to receive special training on how to generate reactive metal intermediates containing unpaired electrons and then study them spectroscopically in real time.  The idea is that if we can monitor their reactivity the instant that they are produced, we will be able to systematically probe structure/reactivity relationships and design better catalysts.        We have prepared new metal complexes that can not only bind to organic substrates, but also happen to contain a chiral environment suitable for preparing high-value chemicals with specific geometries.  We have shown that these complexes can be oxidized by one-electron and have published the energies needed to perform these oxidations.  This data will be important in the development of any electrocatalytic processes developed with these new metal complexes.  Our training has also enabled us to identify the spectral features of these short-lived intermediates which will be useful for a mechanistic understanding of new reactions.  Moreover, through these spectroscopic studies, we have shown that organic co-ligands bound to the oxidized form of the metal are readily cleaved to form organic radicals, which may go on to do further chemistry.  Oxidized metals with organic substrates containing fluorine were found to be less prone to cleavage from the metal center, indicating that these substrates may be better suited for the development of new electrocatalytic methods.   Finally, with this grant, a state-of-the-art electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer was purchased, thus creating the only EPR center in the state of Hawaii. This instrument will help researchers in the state study molecules and materials that contain unpaired electrons       Last Modified: 08/17/2011       Submitted by: David A Vicic]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
