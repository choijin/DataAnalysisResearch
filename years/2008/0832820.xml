<AbstractNarration>We are rapidly moving into a new age of widely-deployed, inexpensive, Internet-enabled mobile computing and communication devices.  This has the potential to give rise to a whole new generation of services, applications, and modes of behavior to benefit society based on openness in ubiquitous wireless and mobile computing.  But this requires re-thinking the computing and communication infrastructure--from the servers in the computing cloud, to the desktop, to the individual handheld devices, to the network that interconnects them all.  This Expedition aims to promote innovation and competition by breaking down barriers and constructing bridges for enabling the creation of a truly programmable and open mobile internet (POMI).  Expanding on the ubiquitous computing model in which users have unencumbered access to distributed computational and storage resources, this timely experimental systems Expedition will create a virtual data system to enable users to take ownership of their data; a three-tiered computational infrastructure to ease the entry of new web services; an open network to promote network innovation and make wireless capacity available across heterogeneous and abundant radio networks within a vicinity; and open-source software to promote existing efforts in opening the cell phone and other such handhelds.  An at-scale prototype system of infrastructure, devices and applications will be deployed across the Stanford campus--perhaps the most comprehensive experimental deployment of mobile technology for research ever performed by a university.  Outreach includes the development and distribution of POMI kits to students at small and underrepresented universities, K-12 schools, and undergraduates at Stanford to engage in creative and inspired discovery through mobile-based education and exploration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We conceived POMI during 2007-2008 (Apple announced its first iPhone in June 2007) and at the time we had observed our society was on the verge of a new computer and communication revolution where billions of users will carry smart handheld devices with high-speed network connectivity. Low-cost open handheld computing platforms, with ubiquitous high-bandwidth connectivity, create an opportunity for innovation in software services and applications not seen since the advent of the World-Wide Web. Similarly, as networks are upgraded and replaced, there is an opportunity to create a network that is open to more competition and continued innovation.  We were also concerned about real structural barriers to openness and innovation: (1) loss of data privacy to major web companies, (2) barrier of entry for new web services, (3) inaccessible wireless capacity, and (4) a closed network infrastructure.  Industry has too much vested interest to break down these barriers, and we believe a university team is ideally placed to tackle them through technical innovation. We thus proposed an expedition to break down the barriers mentioned above and focused on  Open Social Networks: Creating a social internet allowing open competition of service and application providers.  The world of communication and social networking has become more closed than ever before, with Tencent dominating China and Facebook owning the data of over 1.4 billion users.  We have created Omlet, an open social OS based on a novel distributed semantic file system, where users can keep their data in the repository of their choice.  A new open mobile social ecosystem is emerging as Omlet is being distributed in millions of Android devices to power up a "natively social" experience where users can share photos, albums, songs etc. with any group in the usersÆ address book.  We have developed the notion of experience-infused apps that leverage a userÆs complete digital history to create fully personalized tools (e.g. browser and search engine).  This technology is being used by librarians to manage email archives and medical researchers to analyze memory loss.  We have also developed SociaLite, a language for domain experts to analyze large graphs on parallel and distributed machines.    Open Networking with SDN. We proposed software defined networking (SDN) as a way to open up networks, making them more amenable to innovation and evolution. Key aspects of SDN include: separation of data and control planes, a vendor agnostic interface (e.g. OpenFlow) between control and data planes, a logically centralized control plane, and slicing and virtualization of the underlying network.

In SDN a researcher, network administrator, or third party can introduce a new capability by writing a software program that simply manipulates the logical map of a slice of the network bringing much needed flexibility and programmability to networking. We developed scientific foundations of SDN, created several open source SDN tools and platforms that are widely used in the community, and developed many network control and management applications enabled by SDN that are not possible otherwise.  SDN has a growing and vibrant ecosystem comprising the research community, venture-funded startups, large and small software and equipment vendors, and enterprise, cloud and telecom network operators. We have been playing an important role in creating and shepherding the ecosystem with a significant technical, economical, and societal impact.  SoftRAN and Full Duplex. We created SoftRAN, a software defined and virtualized substrate for building and deploying mobile wireless networks. SoftRANÆs modular architecture enables operators to quickly deploy LTE and other mobile network services on heterogeneous commodity hardware as well as implement tightly coord...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
