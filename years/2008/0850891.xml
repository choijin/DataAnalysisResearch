<AbstractNarration>Among the world's western boundary currents the Agulhas Current has a uniquely global significance. Its variability has been linked upstream to tropical Indian Ocean Dipole events which are largely coupled to Pacific winds and ENSO (El Nino- Southern Oscillation). Downstream, it feeds an inter-ocean transport of warm and saline waters into the South Atlantic which directly impacts the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. This makes the Agulhas Current an effective link between the Indian and Atlantic tropical arrays of the Global Ocean Observing System. It is of significance not just to Indian Ocean variability, but to global climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The goal of this project is to build a multi-decadal time series of Agulhas Current Transport (ACT). This will be done in a manner similar to what was started in the mid nineties for monitoring Kuroshio transport via satellite altimeter. The first phase of ACT requires deployment of an array of instruments across the Agulhas Current and along an altimeter (TOPEX/Jason) ground track, to obtain a three-year time series of transports via in situ measurements. The second phase involves calibrating the along- track altimeter data with these measured transports to produce a time series of Agulhas Current transport from 1992 and into the future, for as long as altimeter missions continue to along this track. Jason-2 has just been launched (June 2008) ensuring a continuing time series through 2012. This twenty-year time series will provide an important climate index for the Indian Ocean, which can be compared to other climate indices and to the Florida Current and Kuroshio time series. The importance of understanding climatic variability on decadal time scales has come to the forefront over the last decade with the need to distinguish natural modes of variability of the atmosphere/ocean system from anthropogenic changes. In response, the international oceanographic community, particularly through the CLIVAR (Climate Variability and Predictability) program, have developed a collaborative plan for a global ocean observing system, consisting largely of tropical moored arrays, sub-surface floats, repeat XBT (eXpendable BathyThermograph) sections, and satellite data. The CLIVAR Indian Ocean Panel recognizes that western boundary observations of the Agulhas Current are an important and missing element to this observing system. Both the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream transports are continuously monitored, providing a link from tropical to mid-latitude variability in their basins. However, there is no monitoring capability for the Agulhas Current, which has links not only to the tropical Indian Ocean, but also to Pacific variability through the Indonesian throughflow and Tasman leakage, and to the Atlantic via Agulhas Rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project concerns the societal value of monitoring a current that has climate and marine impacts on Africa, a region lacking the capacity to monitor the current themselves. African scientists and students will benefit from active participation in the project, in particular through participation on cruises and via a student exchange between the University of Cape Town and the University of Miami. These collaborations will build local oceanographic experience and knowledge. Finally, the ACT array itself, and subsequent long-term time series of Agulhas transports, will allow a broad assessment of the relationship of the Agulhas to other observed climate indices, making an important contribution to the Global Ocean Observing System by building long-term regional capacity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SUMMARY  The Agulhas Current Time-series project (ACT) was a six-year research program to measure and analyse the variability of the Agulhas Current in the southwest Indian Ocean. We deployed an array of current meters that captured the transport of the current directly over the course of three years and combined these data with a 22-year record of sea level from satellite altimeters to approximate the longer-term variability and trend in transport of the current. Our most important outcome from this project was to find that the strength of the Agulhas Current has not increased over the past two decades, despite expectations based on rapid warming and intensifying winds. Instead, the current has broadened and its flow has become more turbulent, with similar trends suggested in the Kuroshio and East Australia Current. Our findings question accepted understanding of how western boundary currents respond to changes in wind forcing and how they are projected to change in the future with climate change.     WHY THE AGULHAS CURRENT?   The Agulhas Current, like the Gulf Stream, is a western boundary current, carrying vast amounts of heat away from the tropics to moderate climate in the mid-latitudes. Unlike the Gulf Stream, the Agulhas Current also feeds an interocean exchange of waters, called Agulhas leakage, which escape the Indian Ocean around the tip of southern Africa to balance heat loss in both the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Western boundary currents and their extensions have been the fastest warming regions of the ocean over the last one hundred years.  Rapid warming of the Agulhas Current has been related to an intensification and/or poleward shift of the system. Variability in the Agulhas Current and its leakage are thought to influence mid-latitude storm tracks and African rainfall, as well as the Atlantic overturning circulation and global climate.      WHAT WE DID  We deployed an array of instruments across the Agulhas Current off the coast of South Africa in the Indian Ocean for three years. The mooring array was located along a satellite altimeter ground-track so that we could synthesize the in situ and satellite data to obtain a longer time series. Moorings were deployed, turned around, and recovered during three scientific cruises aboard US research vessels, about eighteen months apart. Standard hydrographic (salinity, temperature, pressure) and underway (currents, winds, and surface temperature) datasets were also collected during each cruise.      MOST SIGNIFICANT OUTCOMES  The most significant variability in the structure of the current is associated with meander events on time-scales of around 50-100 days, whereby the current is diverted 100 km or more offshore, as noted in previous research. These events are triggered by eddyÆs emanating from the Mozambique Channel or East Madagascar Current and impinging on the Agulhas Current upstream. Using results from the ACT array we found that there is little detrainment of waters during a meander and hence the transport of the current is largely unaffected. Moreover, the local growth of a meander is consistent with barotropic instability, where energy is transferred from the mean flow to the fluctuation through horizontal shear stresses. We also found that meander events occur less frequently than previously thought - about once or twice per year - and therefore can have only limited impact on Agulhas leakage variability downstream.  We characterised the seasonal variability of the Agulhas Current for the first time. Its transport is strongest in austral summer, similar to the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio, although it is not yet clear why. In general, strong transport events are characterised by a deepening and broadening of the current and weak events by a shoaling and narrowing of the current.   To explore decadal variability of the Agulhas Current we combined our mooring array data with satellite measurements of sea level to estimate changes in the current over 22 ye...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
