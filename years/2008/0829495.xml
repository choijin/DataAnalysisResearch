    <AbstractNarration>The Yellowstone Ecological Research Center is awarded a grant to support construction of a carbon-neutral, multifunctional building to support established biological research and education activities in the GYE. The proposed 6900 square-foot structure (to replace existing outdated structures already on site) will provide overnight accommodations for 18 people, a meeting room/lecture hall for 50, two lab/classroom areas for groups of up to 16 students, areas dedicated to computers and data management, a garage/shop/staging area, and areas dedicated to equipment storage and maintenance. It is designed to meet or exceed ADA compliance and be carbon-neutral to the extent possible given the extreme climatic regime of Cooke City winter seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yellowstone Ecological Research Center (YERC) is a non-profit organization that began in 1993 as a program of research and education in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), a 7.3 million hectare (18 million acre) area centered on Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and surrounding National Forests and Wildlife Refuges. The mission of YERC is to conduct and support collaborative research and education to advance the role of science in the Yellowstone region.</AbstractNarration>
