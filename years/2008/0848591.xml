<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will continue studies on the development of new methods for the direct formation of C-N bonds via activation of C-H and C-C bonds.  Four new aspects of catalytic nitrogenation reactions are targeted for study during the next funding period: 1) cyclocondensations of nitro- and nitrosoarenes with olefinic nitrosophiles and application of nitrosoarene/acetylenic alpha-dicarbonyl reactions in the construction of the indolocarbazole skeleton common to several classes of biologically-potent natural products; 2) identifying the reactive intermediates and mechanism of ligand-assisted, copper-catalyzed benzylic aminations, and expanding the reaction scope and utility, including the development of enantioselective variants; 3) establishing metal-, Lewis acid- and proton-catalyzed nitrogenation reactions of typically unreactive saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons; and 4) finding metal complexes capable of reductive cleavage of azo compounds leading the way to establish azo compounds as convenient and effective nitrogenation reagents.  A coordinated experimental and computational program will be conducted to accomplish these objectives.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Kenneth M. Nicholas and his co-workers of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Oklahoma.  Prof. Nicholas' research programs focus on the development of new catalytic reactions and elucidation of their reaction mechanisms.  These new catalytic reactions will provide novel, direct, and selective routes to several classes of valuable organonitrogen products. The metal-mediated processes leading to these compounds proceed from readily available starting materials and are expected to be highly regio- and chemoselective, functional group tolerant, economical, environmentally benign, and complementary or superior to existing methods.  Moreover, the products derived from these studies are of immense value chemically, technologically, and societally.</AbstractNarration>
