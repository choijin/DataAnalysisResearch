<AbstractNarration>0846324&lt;br/&gt;Gray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this project is to create computational tools which can accurately predict the structure of proteins when they interact with interfaces. The specific goals are (1) to develop and apply techniques for sampling protein conformations in the presence of a solid, (2) to develop and apply techniques for exploring the relevant structural variations in the solid substrate in the presence of protein, and (3) to elucidate the nature of molecular recognition for proteins on solid surfaces relative to other biomolecular interactions. The PI will apply the developed techniques to natural mineralization proteins which have been well studied and offer some structural data for validating the PI?s approaches. Successful creation of predictive tools for determining protein structure on surfaces will be invaluable to the progressive growth and evolution of devices at the interfaces of biology and solid-state (nano)technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the broad impact of these scientific studies on interfacial chemistry, biotechnology, biomaterials, and bionanotechnology, the PI proposes an accompanying educational program which includes new courses, computational modules for broad distribution, and outreach to young scientists within Baltimore. The PI will create a new course on computational design of biomolecules and continue to redesign the undergraduate modeling and control course, contributing to the transformation of the chemical engineering field as it incorporates biology in the curriculum.  Computational modules will teach structure prediction tools from basic energetic calculations and structural manipulations to prediction of complex structures and design of custom biomolecules. Software developed from this research will be distributed freely via the Rosetta Commons consortium. Outreach in Baltimore will have a direct impact on minority and low-income populations through the Ingenuity Project which targets exceptional high-school and middle-school students from at-risk populations for advanced curricula and research mentorship.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the development of tools for the prediction of the structure of proteins on solid surfaces.  Protein interactions with solid surfaces are important in biology, biotechnology and nanoscience.  For example, in the human body, proteins interact with bones and teeth, and in nanotechology, proteins have the potential to guide the assembly of nanostructured materials.  Intellectual Merit. The major product of this research is an algorithm called RosettaSurface, a multiscale modeling tool for searching peptide and protein conformations upon adsorption on a solid surface.1,2 The approach uses an all-atom Monte Carlo-plus-minimization search algorithm that rapidly and simultaneously optimizes rigid-body, backbone and side-chain conformations to identify low-energy structures. To demonstrate our algorithm, we applied RosettaSurface to study statherin, a salivary protein, adsorbing to hydroxyapatite (HAp), the major component of tooth enamel. The models revealed a molecular recognition motif where the N-terminal &alpha;-helix of statherin places all four of its basic residues to match the periodicity of the open phosphate triad clusters across the surface of HAp. Further, the data suggested that statherin bound preferentially to the (010) and (100) faces of HAp. We combined our structure prediction method with solid-state NMR measurements from Gary DrobnyÆs lab at the University of Washington to create the first experimentally-supported all-atom models of a protein on a solid surface.3  Thus, this work helped elucidate how, at a molecular level, these proteins help maintain the integrity of the teeth.  In further related work, we designed peptides to specifically recognize calcite and modify its crystal growth.4,5  The goal of this work is to exploit the specificity of proteins to be able to grow custom materials.   Broader Impact. Graduate student David Masica completed his Ph.D. thesis, and additional training was provided for postdoctoral researcher Kosta Makrodimitris and undergraduate students Sarah Schrier and Moon-Young Liza Lee (both now at MIT), Marianna Sayeg (now at BU), Emily Koo (now at NYU), Elizabeth Specht (completed Ph.D. at UCSD), and Eleanor Small (completed Ph.D. at Drexel). Ten manuscripts were published,1-10 and collaborations were established with biomineralization labs at Pacific Northwest National Labs8,10 and McGill University.6,7,9 The PI served on the Board of Directors of the Ingenuity Project to facilitate interactions between Johns Hopkins and the Baltimore public school research program (helping match students to research labs, facilitating intercampus transportation, providing programmatic advice, etc.).     1.
