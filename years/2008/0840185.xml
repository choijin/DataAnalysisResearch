<AbstractNarration>The Golden Gate Bridge Highway Transportation District (GGBHTD), in collaboration with the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE), and in partnership with Princeton University, Stanford University, San Jose State University, the Sciencenter (Ithaca, NY), the Exploratorium (San Francisco), Eyethink, West Wind Laboratory, EHDD Architects, the American Public Works Association, and the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, is conducting a multi-faceted project about the science and engineering of the Golden Gate Bridge and about how public works facilities around the country can potentially become sites for public understanding of and engagement with science and engineering.  GGBHTD, which operates and maintains the bridge, ferries and buses, hosts over 10-million visitors annually to their current visitor center at the south end of the bridge (San Francisco), serves an additional 2-million users of their ferries, and hosts a popular Web site (http://goldengatebridge.org/).    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project deliverables are scheduled to coincide in 2012 with the 75th anniversary of the 1937 opening of the bridge. Educational products include: outdoor exhibits at the Golden Gate Bridge; exhibits about the bridge on the District's ferries; indoor exhibits at the Exploratorium; an expanded Web site with educational material about the bridge; an international conference in San Francisco around the time of the anniversary about public works as sites for informal science education; educational documents and a professional development program for public works staff from around the country; and a suite of publications for the public and professionals on public works research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves a coordinated evaluation effort.  Front-end and formative evaluation activities are being conducted by Inverness Research Associates.  Summative evaluation will be conducted by David Heil &amp; Associates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Intellectual Merit  Innovative ways were developed to encourage the public to learn about the engineering of the Golden Gate Bridge through outdoor exhibits installed at the south visitor area of the Bridge.  Visitors coming to see the Bridge can see the actual structure while learning about the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) associated with the design, construction, and maintenance of the Golden Gate Bridge     Broader Impact              A conference titled Public Works for Public Learning was held that brought together people from both the engineering/public works field and informal education specialists. Lessons learned were shared in presentations about visitor services provided at major engineering tourist destinations, such as Hoover Dam, the Eiffel Tower, the Panama Canal, and Sydney Harbour Bridge. Presentations also dealt with  small-scale  public works facilities, such as a small hydroelectric plant, WaterWorks at Arizona Falls, that was remodeled to provide a venue for science fairs and arts festivals.     Outcomes              The project was funded by an award to the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District; the District's General Manager, Denis Mulligan, was the principal investigator. CUREE was the primary subawardee, providing project management and overall design of the exhibition. The project resulted in the design and installation of over two dozen permanent outdoor exhibits in the visitor area at the south (San Francisco) end of the Golden Gate Bridge.    In Image 1 is an example of an exhibit that helps to explain the engineering rationale behind decisions made about how to construct the Bridge. That tactile depiction of the Bridge includes a profile of the seafloor that shows why the towers of the Bridge were placed so far apart. The difficulty of underwater construction is featured in a nearby tabletop display (Image 2), one of nine tabletop displays about the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge.     The exhibit in Image 3 explains the thought process of engineers in comparing design alternatives. The visitor can experiment with the difference in cable tension (pulling force) in three models that mimic three different heights of the towers of the Bridge.        The engineering and mathematics of wind pressure are experienced (Image 4) in an interactive exhibit where a visitor pushes on a plate and sees the force they are experiencing related to wind speed as shown on an indicator.   Another exhibit design principle successfully implemented in the project was to exploit the place-based learning opportunities, by pairing an exhibit about the Bridge with a view of the nearby actual structure (Figure 5).              Information on each of the exhibits is posted at www.goldengate.org/exhibits in nine languages in addition to English.
