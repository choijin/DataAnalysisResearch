<AbstractNarration>The principal investigators will conduct two research cruises to measure carbon dioxide, dimethyl sulfide, and acetone using the eddy covariance technique over a broad range of oceanographic conditions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tropical cruise in the equatorial Pacific upwelling region will capture the moderate to low wind speed conditions characteristic of most of the world's oceans.  A main goal of the Pacific cruise will be to study the increase of the gas exchange coefficient with wind speed.  A high latitude North Atlantic Ocean cruise will focus on areas of high biological productivity and higher wind speeds.  On the high latitude cruise the impact of phytoplankton blooms on gas exchange and the role of bubbles as a factor in gas exchange rates will be studied.  These cruises will add to the current database of direct flux studies in the oceans, which is extremely small, and insufficient to rigorously characterize the variability in gas transfer coefficients as a function of wind speed, sea state, biological productivity or seasonality in the major ocean basins.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research include the participation of students from various levels of education from high school interns to undergraduate and graduate students.  Underrepresented students will be included through an external program.  There will also be an effort made to include an undergraduate student and a high school teacher from a minority school district on a research cruise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The exchange of gases across the air/sea interface is a significant, but poorly understood aspect of the earth system.  This project is aimed at making direct measurements of gas fluxes at sea, in order to improve our undersanding of the physical processes involved in gas transfer and the environmental factors that influence gas transfer rates.  This project involved the development of new analytical instrumentation for the continuous measurement of dimethylsulfide (DMS) in seawater, and for fast response, high sensitivity measurements of DMS in air.  Shipboard measurements were made on cruises in the eastern Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Ocean.   The major findings of this study are:  1.  A linear relationship was observed between mean wind speed and the gas transfer velocity of DMS under low and intermediate wind speed conditions.  This implies a linear relationship between wind-driven surface divergence (or tangential stress) and wind speed.  2.  A weakened dependence of gas transfer on wind speed was observed at high wind speeds.  This phenomenon was apparently linked to the presence of large wind-driven seas and not due to the onset of wave breaking and bubble formation.   To our knowledge, this study provides the first observational evidence of wind/wave interactions influencing gas transfer in the open ocean.  The data are limited, however, and further studies are needed in order  to validate and generalize this finding, and to understand the  underlying physical cause.  If such interactions prove to be a widespread phenomenon, then global biogeochemical models will require parameterization of wave physics in order to adequately simulate gas transfer.
