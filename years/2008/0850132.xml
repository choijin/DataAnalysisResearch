<AbstractNarration>The RISE (Research, Internships, Scholarship and Engagement) program encourages students to engage in STEM majors by providing scholarships to academically talented but financially disadvantaged students.  The RISE program enhances retention of incoming STEM majors and broadens the student body through recruitment of new Americans and students of color.  The RISE program supports two cohorts of twelve students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, or physics.  Recipients receive an annual scholarship of $6000 for all four years of their studies.  RISE scholars participate in a first-year experience where they co-enroll in a critical thinking inquiry seminar and a written communication course.  At the end of their college career they enroll in a senior capstone course.  Throughout their studies, students have opportunities to participate in i) academic success workshops, ii) independent research projects, STEM conferences, and internships in local technology-based companies, iii) workshops on career and graduate school placement, iv) meetings with invited campus speakers and v) a specially designated senior capstone course.  Taken together, these activities increase both retention in STEM disciplines and placement in STEM careers and graduate schools. Upon graduation RISE scholars undertake careers in STEM fields where they are engaged in science and technology in responsible and meaningful ways.</AbstractNarration>
