<AbstractNarration>Animals are exposed to myriad external stimuli and must prioritize this information and respond appropriately in order to survive and reproduce. This study investigates how this fundamental capacity is encoded in an animal's genes and mediated by circuits of the nervous system. The nematode worm C. elegans is an ideal model for investigating this question because it has a simple nervous system and genome. A striking example of sensory reprioritization is seen in the mate recognition behavior of the C. elegans male. Passing contact between a male and prospective mate causes the male to instantly halt ongoing behaviors and attempt mating. The specific objectives of this project are to define the neural circuitry that enables the male to respond, and to identify the genes that control circuit function. Circuit mapping tools include state-of-the-art light-inducible protein channels that can test a neuron's function simply by turning the cell off or on with a pulse of light. Forward and reverse genetic approaches will be used to identify genes required for circuit function. The results of the study will provide important insights into the genetic control of sensorimotor integration and also potentially contribute to the fields of reproductive physiology, evolutionary and computational biology. Graduate and undergraduate students will carry out the research. Because the project involves a combination of genetics, molecular biology, statistics and mathematics it will provide these developing scientists with exposure to a broad range of fields and a fuller understanding of biological phenomena. In addition to publication in scientific journals, the findings of the study will ultimately be added to an established, publicly-accessible and free C. elegans web site targeted to students interested in nervous system development, function and cell biology.</AbstractNarration>
