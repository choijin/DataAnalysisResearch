<AbstractNarration>The Indiana University REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during summers of 2009-2013, though support provided by NSF Directorates of Biological Sciences (BIO) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE). Ten students will be selected each year to participate in an intensive research program in an area of animal behavior. Students from biology, neuroscience, psychology and anthropology are welcome to apply. The goal is to increase students' likelihood to successfully enter a graduate school or a job in science. Students are matched with individual labs and have the opportunity to perform and complete their own research projects--including analyzing data, preparing findings in a poster format, and presenting at a concluding symposium. The program emphasizes an interdisciplinary environment beginning with introductory seminar meetings with a range of Animal Behavior faculty, and includes exposure to techniques of conducting genetic and neuroendocrine assays, collecting data in zoos, and making science accessible to the public. Students receive training in reasoning applied to the conduct of science with an emphasis on basic and applied animal behavior research, assistance in how to present research, strategies in taking GRE tests, and career options in science and education. Because the core emphasis is on the research experience, the scheduling of training events is designed to allow students to begin work in their host laboratories during the first week of the program. Students from institutions with limited research opportunities for research and those from groups under-represented in science are especially encouraged to apply. More information is available at http://www.indiana.edu/~animal/REU, or by contacting Linda Summers  (812-855-9663 or cisab@indiana.edu) or the Program Director, Dr. Emilia Martins (812-855-1646 or emartins@indiana.edu).</AbstractNarration>

Many projects that our interns have conducted in the last award period represent research that would not have otherwise been performed in their home labs, or the initiation of new collaborations.
