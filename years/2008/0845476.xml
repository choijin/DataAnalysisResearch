<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CNS - 0845476&lt;br/&gt;Nguyen, Thinh&lt;br/&gt;Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Network Coding for Media Transmission and Storage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to advance Network Coding (NC) theories and practices for multimedia transmission and storage in best-effort networks.  NC has been shown to be a promising approach to enhance networking performance.  However, many benefits of NC will not likely be realized fully when they are used naively with the existing wired and wireless infrastructures.  This research consists of two primary efforts, aimed to develop theories and methodologies for optimally incorporating NC to a large body of existing coding, signal processing, networking and communication techniques.  The first effort will investigate the NC-based techniques for efficient multimedia delivery from the Internet to receivers in a wireless access network such as Wi-Fi or WiMax. This effort will focus on the optimal integration of NC to the network stack, from media compression techniques at the application layer, to packet schedulers at the link layer, to channel coding and modulation methods at the physical layer, in order to improve quality of wireless multimedia networking applications.  The second effort will explore a scalable, NC-based, Peer-to-Peer architecture for multimedia storage and delivery.  The focus will be on developing network protocols and NC-based data replenishment techniques to support high quality video streaming.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These two efforts will provide an in-depth understanding of when, where, and how to apply NC techniques for multimedia networking applications. The specific research goals are 1) to  understand and quantify the effects of the interactions among network layers and NC techniques,  2) to develop theories and methodologies for jointly optimizing NC techniques with the existing infrastructures, and 3) to develop software platforms for enhancing wireless multimedia networking applications, and for building robust, scalable, distributed multimedia storage and streaming systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. Integral to the research will be efforts to increase enrollment and retention of electrical engineering and computer science students through exciting projects and class materials, to promote inter-community collaborations among researchers in the fields of networking, signal processing, and coding theory through a series of workshops, and to create societal wealth through innovations via industrial collaborations and start-up ventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The project: "Network Coding for Media Transmission and Storage" has led to many practical techniques, insights, and theories that can help increasing the speed  and resiliency of communication networks  with efficient uses of resources.  One of the notable outcomes of research is a prototype for a distributed video streaming and storage system, similar to YouTube.  Unlike YouTube,  the prototype is designed to allow uploaded videos to be stored on millions of computers on the Internet rather than on a centralized YouTube server farm.  This novel design  enables scalability and increases resiliency against  bottelneck failures.  The research components on network coding (NC) and protocol designs have also led to the initiation of another separate project called  WiFO.  WiFO is a light-based indoor communication systems that provides orders of magnitude improvement in speed over the current WiFi networks.  The project has contributed to the succesful training of many MS and Ph.D students.   In particular, 4 PhD students went to become leading engineers at many companies and 2 PhD students became faculty members.  The work has received multiple IEEE awards.  Specifically, the development of NC techniques and protocols for wireless networks that led to the Jack Neubauer Award for the Best System Paper of the Year in the IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology (2012).  The proposed adaptive NC technique for elastic traffic model was a runner up for Best Paper Award at the IEEE ICCCN (2010).  The work on publish-subscribe distributed system also led to  the Best Paper Award at the IEEE ICCCN (2008). The work on queue management for WiFO  also partially contributes to  therunner up Best Paper Award at ACM MsWiM (2014).  Key outcomes or Other achievements:   One patent related to NC technique and WiFO was filed in 2015.            Last Modified: 09/16/2016       Submitted by: Thinh P Nguyen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
