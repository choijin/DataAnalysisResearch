<AbstractNarration>PI: Frank White, Kansas State University&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Adam Bogdanove, Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Bing Yang, Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;Collaborator: Dan Nettleton, Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rice, the major food source for a large portion of the world population, is a premier species for genome-enabled crop research. The interactions of rice and associated pathogens are an important topic and an excellent opportunity for in-depth analyses of the adaptive processes of plant disease susceptibility and defense. The two pathovars of Xanthomonas oryzae, the causal agents of bacterial blight and leaf streak of rice, cause disease in part by modulating host plant gene expression. Global changes in rice gene expression will be characterized during the disease process and during successful defense responses to identify the host genes that control host susceptibility and resistance (R) to bacterial infection. Additionally, since pathogen populations have evolved over time in response to new genetic mechanisms of resistance in the host, the project will characterize the diversity of adaptations based on host responses to infection by different pathogen strains. Mutant rice lines and manipulation of host gene expression by inhibitory RNA (RNAi) will be employed to determine the functional significance of selected candidate host genes involved in disease and defense responses. The project will carry out (1) profiling of host transcriptional responses in rice cultivar Nipponbare, as well as other diverse host genotypes (domestic rice and wild relatives) to three sequenced strains of the pathogens using microarray gene chip hybridization and quantitative, real time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods; (2) profiling of responses of a set of rice lines near-isogenic for either recessive or dominant R genes to define pathways for susceptibility and induced innate immunity; and 3) functional analyses of candidate host susceptibility and defense genes and associated gene families using gene transfer, RNAi, and mutagenesis techniques. Array data will be deposited to PlexDB (http://www.plexdb.org/)and other project outcomes will be available through http://www.oznet.ksu.edu/plantpath/whiteslab/welcome.htm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will elucidate the processes in rice susceptibility and resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak, and establish important, broadly relevant concepts of plant-pathogen interactions. The results will provide insight into strategies for achieving durable and broad resistance against disease, which, in itself, can have wide-reaching impacts on the environment and quality of life. The work will enhance the educational environments at Iowa State University and Kansas State University and strengthen international collaborative research. The participating research programs will foster the participation of scientists at all levels of education and internationally. Each of the investigators contributes strongly to research programs for both resident and visiting undergraduate students, including the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SUROP) at Kansas state University, REU and RET programs at Iowa State University, and individually tailored research and supplemental coursework. Workshops will be conducted including members of all labs and interested national and international students and researchers in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT.  The project profiled the changes in the expression of rice genes after challenge by the important rice bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae and conducted functional characterization of pathogen effectors and the cognate host targets.  Two versions of the pathogen were used for the study.  X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a serious vascular pathogen of rice in most major rice growing regions of the world.  X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is an emerging pathogen of rice in many of the rice growing areas.  The bacteria are remarkable in that they contain large numbers of genes for transcription factors, proteins that bind and regulate expression of the host rice) genes, that are secreted into the host cells.  Some of the factors, which are termed TAL effectors, are critical for the induction of host susceptibility. The critical genes were identified among the gene expression profiles of plants challenged with either Xoo or Xoc. The project revealed the ability of bacterial pathogens to directly make complex changes in gene expression in the host organism. An understanding of TAL effector targets and functions led to new insight and techniques for editing the rice genome, specifically, for improved yield and disease resistance to bacterial blight and streak, and, more generally, for all eukaryotic genomes.  BROADER IMPACT.  The project has contributed to a revolution in genome modification.  The information will allow innumerable new advances in crop health, genetic therapy of genetic diseases, and genetic approaches to human health. The project contributed to forty publications in high quality journals of science including Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy, Plant Cell, and Nature Communications.  Project funds assisted the education and support of all or in part eight graduate students and five postdoctoral trainees.  Numerous under-represented undergraduate students were provided the opportunity to participate in research activities and programs for the enhanced experiences for secondary school teachers were conducted.  Discoveries will continue for years based on the data provided by the study.       Last Modified: 12/02/2013       Submitted by: Frank White]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
