<AbstractNarration>Technical. This project aims to improve fundamental understanding of the composition, structure, interface, and electrical properties of thin dielectric films used as gate dielectrics for amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) channel transparent thin film transistors (TTFTs). The approach involves synthesis of novel multi-constituent and stacked (laminate) high dielectric constant films on AOS substrates (including In2-xGaxO3, InGaZnO, ZnSnO, ZnInO, ZnO, etc.) via conformal atomic layer deposition (ALD) and low temperature mist vapor deposition (MVD). Materials properties as a function of synthesis method and adjacent AOS material will be inves-tigated using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Simple capacitor test structures and complete TTFT devices will be fabricated. Electrical measurements made on these structures will be used to assess the impact of materials properties on dielectric constant, breakdown strength, dielectric trap density, interface trap density, stability, and electron mobility in the channel. Strong fundamental understand-ing of the Si/SiO2 system (complementary metal/oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) devices) and the a-Si/Si3N4 system (TFT devices) has played a large role in allowing these materials to dominate microelectronics and liquid crystal display applications. A similar understanding of novel dielectrics and their interface with new channel materials will help AOS electronics to approach com-mercialization. &lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. Basic understanding gained is expected to lead to improved device performance, and to allow design of new electronic and photonic components. Potential applications include windshield navigational displays and possibility of low cost, high performance transparent alternatives to a-Si TFTs for the display industry. The project will provide opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art thin film synthesis techniques and a broad range of so-phisticated fabrication and analytical characterization techniques while working in a new and exciting field. Results from the proposed study will be disseminated widely in journals and conferences as well as be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses taught by the PI. The PI and students involved will participate in two existing high school outreach programs in place at Oregon State University, giving young students early exposure to leading edge research through presentations and hands-on experience. Students will experience broad exposure to multiple disciplines including materials synthesis, analytical characterization, and electrical characterization of materials and devices. Through PI coordination, opportunities will also be available for under-graduate internships in industry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The electronics industry has entered an age of materials limited scaling.  Instead of being limited by how small they can be made,  the performance of transistors and other devices is now limited by the fundamental properties of the materials from which they are constructed.  Work in this project has been directed towards developing new oxide based thin film materials and improving the fundamental understanding of the influence of their composition, structure, interfaces, and electrical properties on their application as the gate dielectric and active layer for new novel amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) channel transparent thin film transistors (TTFTs), resistive random access memories (RRAM) / memristors, high dielectric constant capacitors, diffusion barriers, and metal-insulator metal tunnel diodes.  The research from this project has been incorporated into undergraduate and graduate student course work, presented at local workshops, invited seminars, national, and international scientific meetings, and published in high quality scientific journals, as well as in a chapter of a book.   The findings from this project are making a broad impact on new and imagined consumer technologies such as transparent electronics, ultra-high speed electronics beyond CMOS, solar cells that scavenge energy in the dark by  harvesting in the infrared part of the spectrum, ultra-high density high speed non-volatile memory beyond the ubiquitous flash memory found in USB sticks, and even as diffusion barriers for dental devices to improve bio-compatibility.   Specifically the project has focused on the development of atomic layer deposition (ALD).  ALD is a nano-manufacturing technique in which the substrate is alternately exposed to precursor reactants and oxidants in a temperature regime that allows for self-limited surface reactions. Films are thus deposited one atomic monolayer at a time.  The benefits of ALD include inherent atomic scale control of thin film composition and thickness and highly uniform deposition of dense conform films over high surface area, high aspect ratio substrates.  ALD is inherently suited for the synthesis of nano-laminate thin films.  Nanolaminate thin films comprise two or more different materials and can be designed to exploit the advantages of each material to produce a material that shows improved overall properties than the constituents.  This work has shown that these nanolaminate films are useful for a variety of applications.  Notable accomplishments include the first report of resistive switching in the amorphous oxide semiconductor zinc tin oxide (first ZTO memristor device); determination that an AOS channel / gate dielectric interfacial layer can dominate the performance and stability of ZTO TFTs; demonstration of step tunneling (quantum mechanical tunneling of electrons) in metal-insulator-insulator-metal tunnel diodes; finding that even for a fixed overall composition and amorphous materials, varying the number of bilayers in an ALD nanolaminate can impact the electrical properties; ALD coated aerogels that show improved oxidation resistance; and ALD coating of dental materials for reduced friction and improved wear resistance.              This project has greatly expanded the professional development not only of several graduate students, but also of numerous undergraduates (through and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) supplements.  These students have experience cutting edge research in a state of the art laboratory.  Their experiences have included materials characterization techniques such as x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), spectroscopic ellipsometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; electrical techniques such as capacitance vs. voltage, current vs. voltage, and transistor measurements to assess dielectric constant, breakdown strength, dielectric trap density, interface trap de...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
