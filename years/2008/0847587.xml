<AbstractNarration>Margetis&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0847587&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator focuses on research and education goals at&lt;br/&gt;the crossroads of mathematics with materials science and physics. &lt;br/&gt;This research links macroscopic principles for crystal&lt;br/&gt;interfacial phenomena to microscale processes.  The physical&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms are described by discrete "particle" schemes for&lt;br/&gt;atomic line defects.  However, mesoscopic and macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;consequences are best understood via continuous models.  Linkages&lt;br/&gt;between models are sought by kinetic theory, partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, and stochastic analysis.  The education part includes&lt;br/&gt;the training of a graduate student, development of innovative&lt;br/&gt;courses in applied mathematics, activities for mathematics&lt;br/&gt;awareness and outreach, authorship of a book on integral&lt;br/&gt;equations, and organization of working group seminars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project addresses fundamental issues in nanotechnology&lt;br/&gt;and materials modeling.  The investigator uses tools of applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics to study systematically how nano-structures decay on&lt;br/&gt;surfaces of technologically important materials.  This work is&lt;br/&gt;motivated by the pressing need to design increasingly smaller and&lt;br/&gt;faster, yet more reliable, devices.  The proposed work advances&lt;br/&gt;the ability to model and predict by theoretical methods the&lt;br/&gt;reliability of devices for the next generation of applications in&lt;br/&gt;microelectronics and information technology.  The project&lt;br/&gt;integrates research and education: Interdisciplinary concepts of&lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics are shaped into instruction tools that reach&lt;br/&gt;out to students and science experts in diverse areas.  This Career&lt;br/&gt;award is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences&lt;br/&gt;and by the MPS Division of Materials Research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
