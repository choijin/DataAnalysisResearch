<AbstractNarration>The awardees have performed a deep ground-based narrow-band survey for Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs, possible progenitors of ordinary galaxies like the Milky Way) that has produced a sample of 259 galaxies, one of the largest sample of LAEs yet acquired. The funded work will extend the survey by 1) exploring the evolution of LAEs by studying a complementary sample at lower redshift; 2) measuring the 3-D distribution of the LAEs; 3) probing the stellar winds, dynamics, and HI column densities of LAEs via extensive high-resolution spectroscopy with the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on the South African Large Telescope (SALT) and the LDSS3 spectrograph on Magellan, and 4) performing near-infrared spectroscopy with FLAMINGOS-2 on Gemini-South to measure systemic redshifts and LAE metallicities. The research promises significant progress towards a complete picture of the birth and early growth of the precursors of present-day L* galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work include research training for undergraduates, release of data to the astronomical community, and participation in the "Astrofest" activity of public lectures at Penn State.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This was  a Collaborative Research Project led by PIs Caryl Gronwall (Penn State University,  AST-0807885) &amp; Eric Gawiser (Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, AST-0807570).    The primary goal of this research was to understand the formation and early growth of typical present-day  galaxies like the Milky Way.  Our previous research had identified a particular type of distant galaxies called Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) as progenitors of Milky-Way type galaxies in the present-day universe.  We had observed these LAEs at an epoch 2 billion years after the beginning of our universe.  In the research  conducted here, we performed expanded analyses on that sample of LAEs and also added parallel analyses on a new sample of LAEs observed one billion years later i.e., three billion years after the beginning of the universe.  This means that the light from these LAEs traveled for almost 11 billion years before reaching Earth, making them some of the earliest galaxies to have formed in our universe.       Intellectual merit:     We published 25 peer-reviewed journal articles to which our contributions were supported by this research grant.  Our new sample of over 200 LAEs was studied extensively; we found from analysis of their clustering on the sky that they also represent progenitors of typical present-day galaxies like the Milky Way.  We also used the FORS spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope to study the rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of these LAEs and to compare them with those of more massive galaxies at the same epoch called Lyman Break Galaxies.  Then we performed near-infrared spectroscopy on these galaxies with the MMIRS instrument on the Magellan Telescope to measure more precise distances and star formation rates for these galaxies.       Understanding the process of galaxy formation is a key goal of extragalactic astronomy.  LAEs are also being used by the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) to trace the large scale structure of the universe  in order to probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy that is caused our universe's expansion to accelerate.  The results of our narrow-band surveys are being used to improve the experimental design of HETDEX and have thus made a key contribution to the field of observational cosmology.  Broader impacts:     This project also provided training in astrophysics research for several undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs. Four of these trainees were  members of groups that are currently underrepresented in science (two women and two Latinos).  By   continuing our  successful collaboration with Chilean astronomers, we  fostered the  international cooperation that is necessary for  astronomy  in the coming  decades.  We participated extensively in outreach activities both at Rutgers and PSU which helped to demonstrate the excitement of current astronomical research to the public. These efforts included Rutgers Day, collaborations between Hayden Planetarium and Rutgers, Astrofest at Penn State University, and distributing key results from our results via the media.
