<AbstractNarration>INTERDISCIPLINARY (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates, assesses, and disseminates interdisciplinary instructional materials that, while designed for use in chemistry, materials science, biology and physics courses, also help students draw connections among disciplines. The scope is molecular science including both the study of how molecular structure and motion lead to emergent macroscopic properties, and the synthesis and engineering of structures with desirable properties. The disciplines share both these goals of molecular science and recurring patterns that appear in the explanatory frameworks and tools. The materials will help make these recurring patterns explicit for students. Four virtual labs (VLs) that combine simulation and visualization tools with instructional support materials are being constructed. Each VL provides instruction and practice regarding a recurring pattern of molecular science. The project creates instructional materials that help students construct a coherent set of knowledge and intellectual resources that can be applied in situations that cross disciplines. Impact is enhanced by designing materials for use in current disciplinary courses, since this provides a means to broadly promote interdisciplinary education without requiring a substantial restructuring of the educational system. Broad use is further promoted by the following: the VLs are flexible learning resources that can be used in a variety of learning contexts, they are being tested in a variety of institution types, and they are being disseminated through existing successful digital libraries.</AbstractNarration>
