<AbstractNarration>Much of the focus of this collaborative project is on the analysis of landmark based shapes in which a k-ad, i.e., a set of k points or landmarks on an object or a scene are observed in 2-D or 3-D, usually with expert help, for purposes of identification, discrimination, or diagnostics. Depending on the way the data are collected or recorded, the appropriate shape of an object is the maximal invariant specified by the space of orbits under a group G of transformations. In particular, Kendall's shape spaces of k-ads are invariant under scaling and Euclidean rigid motions. While this is a proper choice for many problems in biology and medical imaging, other notions of shape such as affine shape and projective shape are important in machine vision and bioinformatics. All these spaces are differentiable manifolds, often with natural Riemannian structures for measuring lengths and angles. The statistical analysis based on Riemannian structures is said to be intrinsic. In other cases, proper distances are sought via an equivariant embedding of the manifold M in a vector space E. Corresponding statistical analysis is called extrinsic. Finding proper Riemannian structures and equivariant embeddings is one of the objectives of this project, which is crucial for the statistical inference proposed. Establishing broad conditions for the existence of the Fre´chet mean, as the unique minimizer of the Fre´chet function the expected squared distance from a Q-distributed random shape is important for statistical inference; and it is a goal of the project to pursue, especially for intrinsic analysis where it has remained an outstanding open problem from the inception of shape theory. Reconstruction of a scene from two (or&lt;br/&gt;more) aerial photographs taken from a plane is one of the research problems in affine shape analysis. Potential applications of projective shape analysis proposed here include face recognition and robotics-for robots to visually recognize a scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistical analysis of data on geometric objects, or manifolds, is an exciting and challenging field of research, where statistical theory and differential geometry are inextricably intertwined, and implementation requires innovative algorithms and high speed computation. The project proposed here deals with the development of nonparametric methodology in this context, which must also resolve associated geometric issues and problems of implementation. Past progress in this field by the PIs has laid the foundation for the present project. The statistical analysis proposed has wide ranging applications, especially in biology and bioinformatics, health sciences, and machine vision. Under this project, the PIs plan to train both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as at least one postdoctoral fellow, in theory and in its practical implementation. This continues much further the present activities of the PIs in this regard. In addition, computational algorithms and codes are made available on websites to create and disseminate this research and its applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of the research has been the development of model-independent, or non-parametric, statistical methods for the analysis of data on shapes and images with broad applications in medical diagnostics, biology and machine vision.  Model-independence of the methodology ensures the validity of the statistical inference whatever be the unknown true nature of the distribution of the underlying data.  The earlier methods, called parametric, were mostly based on assumptions on the unknown distribution which cannot really be verified.  Not only is the validity of the new nonparametric  method assured, it has been found to be sharper and more effective than the parametric methods time after time in important data examples.   To understand the nature of applications of the new methodology in medical diagnostics, one may consider problems of analyzing medical images for the purpose of identifying the occurrence of a disease which produces a deformation of some organ in the body. Because medical images depend on the distance of the camera from the object and the camera angle, etc., varying with the instrument of measurement and the laboratory etc., one needs to transform the image into an object which is independent of the scale of measurement as well as the angle of measurement, in particular.  This transformed object is called the shape of the object. For example, certain types of schizophrenia are suspected to lead to deformations which may show up in a brain scan.  Another example would be the conjectured effect of glaucoma resulting in changes in the shape of the inner eye.  In statistical analysis one would compare the shapes of a random sample of normal persons with those of a random sample, or a paired sample, of diseased persons . Once a highly significant difference in shapes of these two groups is established, this vital difference can be used to identify the presence or absence of the disease.  Analysis of such medical images by the PI and his graduate students, and his collaborator in the partner institution,  has repeatedly established the much greater accuracy of the nonparametric method developed by them compared to the earlier parametric methods used for more than the past three decades or so.   Another area of application has been in morphometrics, or in the classification of biological species and subspecies by means of anatomical shapes.   A third and very important application of this research is in scene recognition based on images of scenes taken by a satellite at different times in different positions, or those taken by different satellites.  There are significant potential applications of this in machine vision or robotics as well.  The research of the PI outlined above combines statistics and geometry in a novel way, and it also involves the development of a set of new computational techniques and algorithms which have been essential in applying the computation intensive methodology to real data.     The work such as that described here has been published in reputed international journals, and in a recent research monograph co-authored by the PI with one of his former Ph.D. students under the grant.   It is exciting to see that these innovative research findings and their dissemination in recent conferences and workshops have already inspired a fairly large group of US and international scholars to pursue further extensions and applications.
