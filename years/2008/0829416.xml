<AbstractNarration>The  Florida State University is awarded a grant to develop a strategic plan for upgrading and expanding its facilities. This plan is warranted by the increased use supporting the new mission and the condition of the aging facilities. In January 2006, it expanded its mission to that of a programmatically-based institution for integrated research, education, and outreach within the coastal and marine ecosystems of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. This new direction is strongly supported by the FSU administration, as made evident by its financial support of recent facilities improvements and the addition of two resident faculty and two postdoctoral associates, with one more faculty member and postdoctoral associate arriving in June.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plan development will occur in four phases: (1) site analysis and initial data gathering, (2) needs assessment consisting of site visits to three comparable laboratories and a stakeholders workshop, (3) design and development, and (4) cost estimates and phasing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the facility is already serving the needs of scientists, students (high school to graduate school) teachers and the general public from Florida State as well as other Colleges and Universities around the country, expansion of the lab will clearly advance this discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning at the center. The planning project involves consulting with and getting input from various current and potential users of the facility.
