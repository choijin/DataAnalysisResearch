<AbstractNarration>In this project, researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and the University of Washington will construct and deploy Apex profiling floats equipped with ISUS optical nitrate sensors, Aanderaa oxygen optodes and Wet Labs ECO fluorometers. Two floats per year will be deployed at the HOT (Hawaii Ocean Time series) station, BATS (Bermuda Atlantic Time Series) station and at Ocean Station Papa in the Gulf of Alaska. Two additional float will be deployed each year in the Southern Ocean. These floats will provide time series observations of biogeochemical processes at these sites with temporal resolution that cannot be sustained by the current shipboard observations. With life spans for each float of four years, the float network will also provide significantly improved spatial resolution around each of the deployment sites near the end of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These float-based sensors provide the potential to study a variety of processes.  The project leaders recently demonstrated that profiling floats can provide time series observations of Net Community Production below the mixed layer based on dissolved oxygen measurements. The continuous measurements of NCP demonstrate that the euphotic zone of the subtropical ocean produces oxygen (net autotrophic) and that episodic events of high NCP are not required to sustain a positive autotrophic balance. These measurements thus may resolve a fundamental controversy as to whether the oligotrophic ocean is net heterotrophic or net autotrophic. Near the BATS site the floats will likely provide significantly improved understanding of the role of eddies in sustaining elevated primary production rates. At high latitudes, the floats will provide an unparalled view of the interaction of vertical mixing with timing of the spring bloom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two types of Broader Impacts will result from this work.  The project will "stimulate and support the development and dissemination of next-generation instrumentation, multi-user facilities, and other shared research and education platforms."  And secondly, by making the data from this research directly available in real time to the research and education, it will "advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning."  Information about the project and the data stream it produces will also be made available on a dedicated web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this grant, the co-PIÃ†s proposed to deploy 2 profiling floats equipped with chemical sensors per year for three years at  stations in the North Pacific near Hawaii, in the North Atlantic near Bermuda, in the Gulf of Alaska, and in the Southern  Ocean.  These are sites where baseline observations are now made at ocean time series stations.  Our robotic devices operate for years, measuring the concentration of essential nutrient chemicals and tracers of plant growth rates.    All data from these floats are made publically available at http://www.mbari.org/chemsensor/floatviz.htm as soon as they are received.   The floats are producing a unique view of the cycling of oxygen by photosynthesis and respiration throughout the ocean and the processes that regulatate the metabolism of the ocean.  This has enabled us to produce fundamentaly new perspectives on important issues such as the metabolic balance of the ocean (Riser and Johnson, 2008), or the supply nutrients to the euphotic zone (Johnson et al., 2010; Ascani et al., 2012).  This work resolves a basic questions regarding the balance of photosynthesis and respiration in the open ocean by showing that there is net oxygen production over an annual cycle (photosynthesis exceeds respiration).   Positive photosynthesis requires a continuous input of plant nutrients to support it.  Existing observations suggest this input of nutrients is difficult to achieve.  Our floats demonstrate that the nutrient supply needed to balance the observed oxygen production can be attained by episodic events that transport nutrients into the euphotic zone on a near monthly basis.  However, there must also be a biological component to the nutrient supply that involves a vertical migration by microscopic plankton.  How this migration is achieved remains a mystery.   The work is also laying the groundwork for a global, biogeochemical observing system, similar to Argo (Johnson et al., 2009).
