<AbstractNarration>This award will support continued research into the nature of fundamental theories of gravity, and their connection to cosmology. Topics to be investigated include (1) the principles which determine the quantum state of the universe and the generalizations of quantum mechanics necessary to understand it, (2) the gravitational aspects of string theory, a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, and (3) the notion of locality in quantum gravity and its application to quantum cosmology and the evaporation of black holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work in centered in the ongoing quest of physics for a unified theory of nature's fundamental forces and the origin of the universe. These are subjects not only of great interest to scientists but also the general public. By engaging the interest of students and public the investigators hope to encourage the support of science generally.  In addition, the project will develop human resources for science and technology by training graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in advanced techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most surprising results to emerge from string theory is a proposed equivalence between a theory of gravity and a nongravitational "gauge" theory. This is often called "gauge/gravity duality". Starting about five years ago, this duality was applied to condensed matter systems. Under a previous NSF grant, Horowitz showed that there is a gravitational description of a basic superconductor, i.e., a material that conducts electricity without any resistence. During this grant, Horowitz (and his collaborators) explored this connection between gravity and superconductivity further. They found a gravitational description of a Josephson junction, which is used in many applications of superconductivity and consists of two superconductors separated by a narrow gap. They also reproduced a mysterious feature in the conductivity of the cuprates using a simple gravity model. The cuprates are a class of materials that become superconducting at unusually high temperatures. These results (and others) suggest that gravity might be a new tool for analyzing certain features of  complicated materials.  In other work during this grant, Horowitz and collaborators studied the nonlinear stability of a well known solution of general relativity under gravitational perturbations. Although this solution is stable to linear perturbations and was expected to be always stable, it was shown that this is not the case. Adding a small amount of energy, generically results in the formation of a small black hole.  In a separate investigation, Marolf and collaborators studied how interactions affect the structure of quantum field theory during periods of cosmological inflation, such as was thought to occur long ago in our own universe.  Despite a long history of arguments in the literature that such interactions should trigger strong instabilities, it was shown that at least so-called scalar theories are in fact stable.  Another line of investigation revisited the old question of what happens when a black hole evaporates due to the production of Hawking radiation.  In classical physics, no information can emerge from a black hole.  While Hawking showed long ago that black holes can radiate energy, his effect also failed to radiate information.  Yet there is strong evidence that, at least in string theory, information does emerge from black holes as they evaporate.  Marolf and collaborators argued that this implies a dramatic failure of normal physics at the horizons of sufficiently old black holes in string theory.  The research of Hartle and collaborators supported by this grant was aimed at providing a quantum theory of the origin of the universe.  If our universe obeys the laws of quantum mechanics then it has a quantum state which can be represented by a wave function of the universe. Supported research explored both how quantum mechanics can be formulated for cosmology and the predictions of the no-boundary wave function of the universe for the large scale features of our universe. In simple models, predictions were calculated for the classical behavior of the universe, the duration of the inflationary expansion, the arrows of time of our universe, and for the magnitude and sign of the effective cosmological content in a landscape in which it can vary. The possible formulation of the no-boundary wave function was also studied. The positive results of these studies support the idea that there may be a simple quantum state of the universe that predicts a number of the properties of our universe revealed by observation.   In terms of broader impacts, this grant trained two postdocs and eight graduate students. Horowitz, Marolf and Hartle all engaged in outreach activities including public lectures, radio interviews, and advising on TV shows and movies. Hartle's undergraduate book on general relativity is continuing to be widely used and having a big impact. Horowitz edited a book called "Black Holes in Higher Dimensions" which was published by Cambridge...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
