<AbstractNarration>    In humans and in animals, many short-lived cells, such as skin, blood, or sperm cells, are constantly reproduced from adult stem cells.  The function of stem cells depends on cues provided by supporting cells, commonly referred to as ?micro-environment cells? or niche cells. However, little is known about how micro-environment cells are made and how they contact the stem cells.  The investigator proposes to investigate these fundamental questions, using fruit-flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as a genetic model system.  The investigator has previously implicated two genes, termed seven-up and homothorax, for proper functioning of micro-environment cells.  She proposes to examine the roles of these genes and the molecular pathways in which they act, and to place them in context with known pathways to gain a mechanistic understanding of micro-environment formation. The outcome of the proposed research will therefore have a broad impact on our understanding of tissue formation, and contribute to the development of techniques for controlling stem cells in tissue differentiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research involves training of students in genetic and molecular techniques.  The investigator has a record in training students from underrepresented groups, and intends to continue this track.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
