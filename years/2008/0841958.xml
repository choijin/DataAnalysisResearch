<AbstractNarration>This project will produce a framework for studying a fascinating example of flower and fruit diversification in a poorly studied plant group from the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. Most species in the target group (genus Drymonia in the flowering plant family Gesneriaceae) are rarely collected and inadequately known. Many of the species that will be studied have never been photographed and at least ten species are new to science. Molecular data will be generated to assess recently diversified lineages to answer questions on the origins of fruit and flower morphologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project will document plant diversity from ecosystems that are critically endangered. Exploratory collecting expeditions will be conducted in Panama, Costa Rica, Peru, and French Guiana where targeted areas represent significant gaps in our knowledge of plant diversity. Training opportunities will be given to one doctoral candidate in field and lab-oriented research and undergraduate students at the University of Alabama. Teachers from the Tuscaloosa City/County Schools will be exposed to a variety of experiences including assisting on field expeditions to the tropics. A live collection will be developed for conservation of rare and endangered species as well as for assessing floral features. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
