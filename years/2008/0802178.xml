<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to address challenges in predictably implementing high performance RF and microwave integrated circuits through a low-cost integration process.  The approach is based on self-assembly of prefabricated active chips containing identical microwave transistors and a substrate that contains passive components and interconnect metallization.  The design benefits from rigorous EM simulations combined with non-linear circuit simulation of a complex system containing many RF transistors, 3D interconnect lines and passive components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The research will investigate self-assembled wafer-level integration, high capacity computational electromagnetic methods for complicated on-chip electromagnetic analysis, and efficient co-simulation of linear electromagnetic structures and non-linear devices.  An integration process with better than 200nm accuracy with transistor contact pad area of 5?Êm?~5?Êm will be developed. Electromagnetic modeling and simulation aspects are addressed through an accelerated time-domain layered finite element reduction recovery algorithm.  Various high performance blocks of microwave transceivers with operating frequencies ranging from 3 to 40 GHz will be designed, fabricated and tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is to enhance our capability in designing and manufacturing state of the art RF and microwave products using a simple and low-cost manufacturing process. Additionally two graduate level courses taught by the PIs will be enhanced by defining common projects that require students to work together to define a research problem and follow it through until the RF system is fabricated and tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
