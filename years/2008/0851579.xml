<AbstractNarration>This grant provides renewed funding for the participation of junior faculty in the NBER Summer Institute. For more than twenty five years, NBER's Summer Institute has offered an ideal environment for developing new ideas and forging collaborative work relationships. Summer Institute brings together economists and scholars in other fields from universities, government, and international organizations for a few days or a few weeks of seminars, workshops, conferences, and cooperative research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summer Institute is four weeks long, and includes at least 40 sessions organized and co-organized by over 80 individuals. There are more than 1,750 attendees from over 300 universities and non-academic institutions, and in 2008 more than 64% of the individuals who attended Summer Institute were not NBER affiliates. While there are many presentations of work nearing completion, emphasis is placed on the workshop aspects of the program where new ideas are raised, preliminary research ideas are developed, and plans for joint or coordinated research efforts are established. Efforts are made to include a wide variety of new participants, and to reach out to women and minorities. Calls for papers are circulated widely and are available on the NBER website. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2007 NBER inaugurated a new feature at the Summer Institute, a two-day mini-course entitled "What's New in Econoemtrics."  The course is intended to update researchers on the latest techniques in econometrics.  The feedback was very positive and NBER held a second-mini-course in 2008 focusing on time-series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The NBER Summer Institutes generate timely and influential research on important economic policy questions related to such topics as international financial stability, economic productivity and technology, enviornmental regulations, social security policy, and educational policies. The workshops are an invaluable part of the research infrastructure in ecobnomics and assist the research of a large number of economists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the NBER's Summer Institute meetings for four consecutive years, 2009-2012.  These three-week meetings bring together applied economists in a wide range of different fields to share their latest research findings, attend lectures, and plan for their future research projects.  The 2009 NBER Summer Institute attracted 1,840 registered participants from 335 universities and non-academic institutions.  The 2010 NBER Summer Institute attracted 2,128 registered participants from 325 universities and non-academic institutions.  The 2011 NBER Summer Institute attracted 2,103 registered participants from 366 universities and non-academic institutions.  The 2012 NBER Summer Institute attracted 2,112 registered participants from 380 universities and non-academic institutions.  In each of these Summer Institutes roughly two-thirds of the participants were not NBER affiliates, and roughly one-fourth of the participants were first-time Summer Institute participants.  The Summer Institute includes nearly fifty distinct research meetings that focus on separate sub-fields within economics.  The number of research papers presented at the Summer Institute has varied between 425 and 450.  A complete list of the sessions for these Summer Institute meetings can be found at:  https://www.nber.org/summer-institute/  Each of the Summer Institute meetings included a two-day mini-course on "WhatÆs New in Econometrics?" The topic varied from year to year.  In 2009, the topic was "Using Field Experiments in Economics" and the lectures were given by Michael Kremer (Harvard University and NBER) and John List (University of Chicago and NBER).  In 2010 the topic was  "Financial Econometrics" and the lecturers, in the order of their talks, were Sydney Ludvigson (New York University and NBER), Yacine Ait-Sahalia (Princeton University and NBER), Michael Brandt (Duke University and NBER), and Andrew Lo (MIT and NBER).  The lecturers described current techniques for studying security returns as well as the links between asset markets and the real economy.  In 2011, the topic was "Computational Tools &amp; Macroeconomic Applications" and the lecturers were Lawrence Christiano (Northwestern University and NBER) and Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde (University of Pennsylvania and NBER).  The lectures focused on the numerical methods that are used to solve dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, and on the application of these models to study a range of macroeconomic questions.  In 2012, the lectures focused on "Econometric Methods for Demand Estimation."  They were presented by Aviv Nevo (Northwestern University and NBER) and Ariel Pakes (Harvard University and NBER).  The lectures focused on applications of discrete choice models and other statistical tools for studying consumer purchase behavior. The lecture series has typically attracted a substantial audience of junior scholars and graduate students at the Summer Institute.  In addition, the lectures have been recorded and posted on the NBER's website along with the lecture slides:  http://www.nber.org/SI_econometrics_lectures.html  The 2009 Summer Institute featured the inaugural Martin Feldstein Lecture, an annual lecture that honors the many contributions of the NBERÆs longest-serving president.  This lecture was delivered by John Taylor (Stanford University and NBER) and addressed "Empirically Evaluating Economic Policy in Real Time." The lecture focused on analysis of the 2008 and 2009 stimulus programs.  The 2010 Feldstein Lecture was presented by Roger Ferguson, formerly the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and currently the President and CEO of TIAA-CREF.  He spoke on "The Challenges of Delivering Retirement Income Security in the 21st Century."  The lecture summarized both the policy challenges that will arise as the baby boomers retire, and the menu of private retirement saving responses.  The 2011 Martin Feldstein Lecture was delivered by Kenneth Rogoff  (Harva...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
