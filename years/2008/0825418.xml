<AbstractNarration>The Oleander project began in 1992 as an effort to conduct high-resolution upper-ocean velocity measurements on a sustained multiyear basis. The Oleander project was established to track near surface heat-fluxes in the Gulf Stream region by taking continuous measurements over a long period of time. In the past 15 years of this project, upper-ocean velocity and near-surface temperatures have been sampled by an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted in the hull of a container vessel (CMV Oleander) that operates weekly between New Jersey and Bermuda. These transects include measurements taken in four distinct and oceanographically important regions: the continental shelf, the Slope Sea, the Gulf Stream, and the northwestern Sargasso Sea. In addition to creating a long-term record of measurements, results from the Oleander project have been used by a variety of researchers and in a range of oceanographic fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Currently, ocean scientists from the University of Rhode Island in collaboration with an oceanographer from SUNY at Stony Brook will continue in leading the efforts of the Oleander project. In addition to maintaining the measurements for this long-lasting record, they will be further analyzing the collected data to elucidate the long-term climatological variability of the upper-ocean mass- and heat-fluxes, as well as investigating the linkages between velocity and heat flux regimes in the Gulf of Mexico and their connections to large-scale forcing fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The measurements from the Oleander project have made valuable contributions to the CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability) program and compliment the measurements taken by other research initiatives such as the Ocean Observatory Initiative's  Pioneer Array and the deep western boundary current measurement program. The PIs will continue their outreach program for high school students with Bayonne High School in new Jersey. Funding from this research will support research and education opportunities for graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Oleander Project Outcomes Report  The MV Oleander is a 400Æ container ship operated by the Neptune Group Limited of Hamilton, Bermuda that makes weekly runs between New Jersey and Bermuda.  The Oleander and its predecessor have been supporting ocean science since the mid-1970s, initially to observe ocean conditions through the intensely fished areas of the continental shelf and shelf edge.  This is done using surface samples and XBTs, a torpedo-shaped device that measures water temperatures as it falls through the water column.  However, the OleanderÆs track covers more than the continental shelf crossing four distinct regions, namely the continental shelf, the area between the edge of the continent and the Gulf Stream known as the Slope Sea, the Gulf Stream itself, and the Sargasso Sea.  In the early 1990s scientists at the University of Rhode Island and Brookhaven National Laboratory, later Stony Brook University, decided to take advantage of the unique capabilities that the Oleander represented to institute an expanded observational program to include water velocities through the upper layers of the ocean.   This is done using a device called an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, or ADCP, which transmits high frequency acoustic pulses into the water column in four directions and then records the returned signals reflected off small planktonic organisms.  The Doppler shift in the returned signals indicates the motion of the water relative to the ship down to a depth of around 600 meters.  Using GPS navigation we can determine the shipÆs motion and heading very precisely which then allows us to determine the absolute water velocity profile under the ship.  At this time the Oleander Project, supported by the National Science Foundation, is monitoring ocean temperatures down to a depth of ~900m, near surface salinities, and volume transports across some of the most important ecological and climatological areas of the northwest Atlantic Ocean.  The Oleander ProjectÆs website that provides access to more than 40 years of data is found at http://po.msrc.sunysb.edu/Oleander.  A signature mission of the Oleander Project has been tracking changes in the character of the Gulf Stream, a critical component of the global flow of heat from the tropics to the poles.  Deep cold waters are formed in the polar-regions which sink to the bottom and flow generally equatorward.  The Gulf Stream plays an important role in this process by forming the main warm-water limb of this vertical circulation in the Atlantic Ocean in a process called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC.  As those who have followed the climate change discussion know, there are a host of potential changes in the environment including alterations in the AMOC which would necessarily include changes in the transport of warm waters northward by the Gulf Stream.  So an important contribution of the Oleander Project was the demonstration that although there are interannual changes in the transport of water by the Gulf Stream, there has been no significant long-term change in the past 20 years.  We have been able to say this with a good deal of certainty because of the large number of repeat velocity sections we have obtained (Rossby et al., 2014).  Despite the fact that there have been no long-term changes in the character of the Gulf Stream, there are substantial changes on shorter time scales that are principally reflected in the north-south shifting of the path of the Gulf Stream after it leaves the edge of the continental shelf at Cape Hatteras.  In her PhD thesis supported by this grant, Dr. Sanchez-Franks has investigated the low frequency variability of the Gulf Stream in this region comparing various measures of Gulf Stream position data from the Oleander and satellite-based data sources (Sanchez-Franks, 2015).  Sanchez-Franks has also investigated the relationship between fluctuations in the Gulf Stream and surrounding waters, and the larger-scale clim...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
