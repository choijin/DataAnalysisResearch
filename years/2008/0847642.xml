<AbstractNarration>Professor Lane A. Baker of Indiana University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry CAREER Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the mechanisms for gating synthetic conical nanopore membranes, and to develop a sensing paradigm based on pore blocking by nanoparticles with specifically designed surface chemistries. The idea is that analytes bound to the nanoparticles will be coupled with magnetic particles and magnetic fields will be used to dislodge the entire particle assembly from the nanopores, resulting in flow of electrolytes and change in the current, thereby providing the basis for analyte detection.  Accurate, rapid and sensitive detection and quantization of small, often transient, concentrations of chemical and biochemical species in a dynamic environment is a challenge in analytical chemistry. Developing new strategies for detection of analytes at low concentrations is an important contribution to the fields of analytical chemistry, electrochemistry, nanotechnology and biotechnology.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art analytical techniques, and an outreach program will be implemented involving visual learning concepts and information dissemination using video conferencing in coordination with podcasting technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the life of this project we have developed two technologies that enable new analytical/bioanalytical chemistry measurements.  In a first series of experiments, we developed approaches to magnetic gating of nano/microstructures.  These devices consisted of magnetic microcoils that were used to direct magnetic fields at specific locations on a surface.  By placing a sensing element, be it a micro/nanopore, a microelectrode, or an optical field of view in the center of the microelectromagnetic trap, new sensing modalities were realized.  To achieve this, we first had to develop process flow to fabricate microelectromagnetic traps with specific designs.  Designs were optimized using a combination of finite element simulations and experimental testing.    Microelectromagnetic coils were found to be useful for concentrating magnetic material in the center or on the immediate periphery of the coil.  By alternating the direction of current flow through the trap, the position of the magnetic trap could be modulated between these two positions (center, periphery).  This allowed for frequency modulated gating of micropores and for Fourier transform enhanced optical detection, as a frequency dependent component could be incorporated for magnetic pull-down assays.  Microelectromagnetic coils were also shown to be capable of directing enzyme modified magnetic particles to electrodes at specific locations.  This enabled an electrochemical, electromagnetic turn on/off sensor for glucose.  While investigating microelectromagnetic traps, we sought new methods for forming ultrathin insulating layers on the electrodes of the traps, and new methods to form micro/nanoporous membranes.  Parylene deposition was one such method.  We realized that parylene could be pyrolyzed to form ultrathin carbon electrodes that could coat three dimensional surfaces conformally.  This exciting result was investigated further, and led to new methods to create conformal carbon micro/nanoelectrodes.  The electrical properties of these new carbon electrodes were studied, and new applications of the electrodes were investigated.  We realized formation of diodes with pyrolyzed parylene films.  Pyrolyzed parylene was also investigated as a coating to form carbon electrodes on atomic force microscopy cantilevers and on probes for scanning ion conductance microscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy.    This proposal provided full or partial stipend support for 14 graduate students.  To date this support has resulted in 6 PhD degrees and 2 Masters degrees in Chemistry.  An additional 5 students are still enrolled in the PhD program and are presently working to complete thier degree.  Graduated students are presently employed in academia, national laboratories and chemical industry.  The proposal supported some costs of students who worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for several weeks in the Center for Nanophase Materials Science.  This work was necessary to fabricate electromagnetic traps in the clean room facilities present at ORNL.    An additional 5 undergraduate students worked on these projects.  They were not financially compensated through the grant, but the grant paid for materials and supplies for their research projects.  These students have graduated and are now employed in the workforce, are in professional schools or graduate programs.    Results have been disseminated in the form of publications, dissertations, theses, and from presentations at scientific meetings both local and national.   The methods and tools we have developed may find further application in commercial devices.  For instance the carbon materials we have developed afford a general-purpose strategy to formation of three dimensional microelectrodes from materials commonly used in biomedical devices.  This has been reported in the primary literature and as such is open to public/commercial use.  We have provided new ideas and concepts for sensing that can serve as inspiration,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
