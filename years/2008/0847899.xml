<AbstractNarration> The Yale Peabody Museum (YPM) houses a world-renowned collection of vertebrate specimens. Approximately 30 percent of the entire holdings of the Division of Vertebrate Zoology (VZ) are fluid-preserved specimens. The goal of this project is to recurate the entire fluid-preserved vertebrate zoology collections of YPM, to facilitate accessibility of the collections, and to promote their use in research and education. YPM-VZ?s fluid-preserved collections have been amassed over more than 160 years by Yale academics, researchers from other institutions, and government agencies. We will recurate of the entire spirit specimen collections in the YPM-VZ including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. These activities will include rejarring, relabeling, changing fluids, checking identifications, evaluating data quality, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The rehousing and improvement of storage conditions of the VZ spirit collections will help preserve these unique materials, and foster comparative biological research on them. Recuration will foster accessibility to visitors, faculty, and students wishing to use the collections. The project will provide curation, identification, and database training for Yale undergraduates, and high school interns (most of whom are under-represented minority students) through the YPM's after-school intern program. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was a recuration of the tens of thousands of fluid preserved vertebrate specimens in the Peabody Museum of Natural History (YPM). The project involved repackaging every jar, relabeling, checking the jar fluid contents and quality, verifying the identification of specimens, and upgrading all information on the electronic data base. All specimen information are available to the public through the YPM website.     During the project  we have identified to Genus and Species roughly one-third of the fluid-preserved fishes that were previously either uncataloged, or cataloged with vague determinations to the level of Family.  Identification verifications resulted in possible range extensions of some species.      Through the curation activities, we have engaged in professional training of graduate and undergraduate students in museum curation, cataloging, specimen care, and data basing. Students have been trained in sorting and identifying new and uncurated collections of mammals, fishes, amphibians, and birds.     Several students learned proper museum specimen handling, jar labeling, data management and other curatorial details. Students not only put specimens into new jars, but also help identify the specimens to species (if needed) and are involved in data entry and label generations utilizing ke-EMu and Datamax thermal printers. This provides a unique opportunity for students to learn museum curation methods in a hands-on manner. Students have also been trained to determine the developmental stage of amphibian larvae.     Outreach Activities:  We annually provided behind-the-scenes tours for the Yale Provost's Office. During these tours families visited the museum collection and got to see the specimens being re-curated. We also provide specimens to the Peabody Education Department for use in public programs and exhibits (including a recent exhibit on vector-born disease). Area high school students also use the fluid collection to study Connecticut biodiversity as part of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's 'Envirothon' in which schools compete in a competition that tests the students' knowledge and understanding of wildlife and environmental issues.  Specimens are also used for courses taught at Yale University, including courses in Ichthyology, Comparative Anatomy and Introductory Biology courses.     Contributions to Human Resource Development:  Our two project technicians received extensive training in museum curation.  They received extensive training in museum curation.      The first presented an oral presentation on recuration of the mammal collection at the 2010 meeting of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections.  She is now a Ph. D. candidate at University of Wisconsin at Madison in the Philosophy of Science program. Our second technician presented an oral presentation on recuration of amphibians and reptiles at the 2012 meeting of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections.  She is currently collaborating with museum staff on research projects utilizing the fluid-preserved collection and has taken a Research Technician job at The Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience, University of Florida.     Contributions to Resources for Research and Education:  By recurating the fluid-preserved specimens we are ensuring that specimens and their associated data are available to researchers and educators.  Verifying the identification and all collection data of each specimen, and reflecting this information in the electronic database (which mirrors to the museum's web page) provides vital and accurate data for research and education.     As older records are updated and older specimens identified, we are able to help build a better picture of each species' natural history.     Three peer-reviewed scientific publications and seven papers in conference proceedings were completed with grant support during the funding period.     Contributions Beyond Sci...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
