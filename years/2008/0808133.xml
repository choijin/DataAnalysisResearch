<AbstractNarration>This team will extend their DEEP2 spectroscopic survey, using high dispersion spectra with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph at the Keck telescopes for galaxies in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5.  This redshift range represents 85% of cosmic history, over the time when most of the galaxy mass was assembled and galaxies formed their disks.  The new DEEP3 survey concentrates on the extended Groth strip, an area on the sky that has been observed with many of NASA's great observatories.  The team will use these and other archives to compile a panchromatic catalog describing their survey galaxies over a wide wavelength range from radio to X-rays.  DEEP3 will push the limit of observations 2.5 times fainter than DEEP2, tripling the number of measured galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will estimate the rate at which their survey galaxies are forming their stars, by measuring their brightness in the ultraviolet, infrared and radio, and by using diagnostics based on the optical emission lines measured in the DEEP2 and DEEP3 surveys.  They will investigate a tight relation found in DEEP2 between the rate of star formation in a galaxy and the mass in stars already present, and examine how galaxy environment and morphology affect that relation.  Team members will use observations from the DEEP2 and DEEP3 surveys to study how scaling laws such as the Tully-Fisher relation (between a galaxy's luminosity and its circular rotation speed) change over time as disk galaxies are assembled.  They will investigate the role of active galactic nuclei in star formation, and use X-ray observations to search for signs of faint hidden active nuclei.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained as they participate in the research.  As has been done for the earlier DEEP2 survey, data including redshifts, photometry, and spectra would be released to the astronomical community.  Multiwavelength images from DEEP2, along with an interactive redshift catalog, are already available on google sky; more data will be added as the new survey proceeds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background: The DEEP3 galaxy redshift survey (third in our series of Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probes) continued to tackle the central question of the origin of galaxies.   Modern theory says that galaxies began as infinitesimal quantum fluctuations in the fabric of space-time just after the Big Bang.  Positive fluctuations acted as gravitational "seeds" that drew in surrounding matter and grew over billions of years to become the enormous galaxies of today.  In detail, galactic birth was more complex, involving two different kinds of matter, "dark" and gaseous, that collapsed inwards in an intimate gravitational embrace. The gaseous portion condensed to form visible stars and planets, while dark matter (comprising 5/6 of the total mass) tended to be left behind, forming, a vast, invisible outer halo.  What we did and why: DEEP3 aimed to flesh out the above picture by gathering some of the world?s richest data on thousands of very faint galaxies and using the world?s finest instruments on Keck and other telescopes to peer back in time some 5-10 billion years to observe galaxies growing in situ.   We focused on two key questions:  1)   Why some distant young galaxies became actively star-forming disky spirals like our own Milky Way, whereas others became quiescent, non-star-forming, football-shaped elliptical galaxies; and  2)   How super-massive black holes grew at the centers of galaxies &ndash; up to a billion or more times our Sun in mass &ndash; and how they assisted, if they did, in transforming spirals to ellipticals.  The DEEP3 survey was followed up by head-to-head quantitative comparisons of our data to the world?s most advanced computer simulations of galaxies and their dark-matter halos. We also publicly released some of the first, largest, and most information-rich databases of distant galaxies for use by other astronomers world-wide.  Scientific Highlights of DEEP3:   Confirmation of the rule that star-formation activity increases with a galaxy?s stellar mass. The relationship is tight, applies over most of the age of the Universe, and is referred to in the astronomical community by the name we gave it, the "star-forming main sequence".   Discovery of the rule that when a galaxy's central density of stars reaches a high-enough (critical) value, star formation activity over the entire galaxy starts to fall. Prior to this, astronomers had found that a galaxy?s overall mass or density appeared most closely related to star-formation shutdown &ndash; we showed instead that central density is much more diagnostic.  Our new focus on galaxy centers prompts the question whether a central, massive black hole, growing in concert with the stars, is heating and disrupting the surrounding gas and cutting off star formation throughout the entire galaxy. Discovery that galaxies, when corrected for their age and stellar mass, all take the same path from high to low star forming activity.  A few traversed this path quickly on a "fast track" at early times, while many more took a "slow track" and are quenching only now.   Evidence that mergers of similar-sized galaxies &ndash; for years the dominant paradigm for explaining many galaxy evolutionary trends &ndash; in fact play only a minor role in the lives of most galaxies, even galaxies that appear to host actively-growing super-massive black holes (AGN).  Discovery that galaxies settle from a chaotic early phase to disks in ordered circular rotation like our Milky Way, and that massive disks settle sooner (at earlier epochs) than their lower-mass cousins.   Discovery of a possible new rule that galaxies make stars in direct proportion to the number of existing stars at each radius. This appears to contradict two other popular rules: that galaxies form new stars preferentially in their outer parts and that star-formation ends first in the center, dropping later in the outer parts.  This new rule needs to be checked with future research.  All of the above discoveries are remarkably consistent with the predicted properties of dark-matter halos or the behavior of gas as it falls into halos, as modeled by state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy evolution.     In summary, the overall findings from this project are that galaxies evolve smoothly and predictably and that our understanding of how and why this happens is falling into place.  Broader impacts:  &bull; Completed the largest distant galaxy spectroscopic redshift survey to date (DEEP2/3) and made it public.  &bull; Used DEEP2/3 as a magnet to attract further multi-energy observations from X-rays to radio.  The region of sky used for DEEP3 became one of Hubble?s five legacy fields for distant galaxy research (the CANDELS project).  &bull; Created a convenient public user interface (RAINBOW Navigator) for downloading all multi-wavelength images, spectra, and value-added catalogs from CANDELS.   &bull; Delivered many public talks outlining our research, how it tells the story of humanity?s cosmic roots and predicts its cosmic future, and argued for the centrality of astronomical knowledge in shaping the future of our planet and the human race.
