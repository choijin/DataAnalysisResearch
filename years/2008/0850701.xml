<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire (UWEC) for the summers of 2009-2011. The REU site  will be directed by Alan Gengenbach from the UWEC Department of Chemistry. Eight undergraduate students will conduct research for 10 weeks under the direct supervision of their faculty mentors.   Research opportunities in the areas of analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, biochemistry and materials science are available. The primary objective of this REU site is to provide a bridge between UWEC and regional two-year institutions including Minneapolis Community and Technical College, St. Paul College and the UW Colleges.  These partnering institutions will help identify talented students who will increase the quality and diversity of the students conducting summer research in the UWEC chemistry department. A weekly seminar series will cover a variety of topics such as scientific careers, the role of science in public policy and effective communication of scientific ideas. Each REU participant will present the results of their research work at an end-of-summer symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
