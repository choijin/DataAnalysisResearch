<AbstractNarration>In the past few decades biochemists have discovered that practically all fundamental molecular design problems are about the geometric relationship of complex molecules. Massively parallel and distributed versions of such algorithms have been recently developed in hope of finding such proteins with shear brute force. For example, implementing screensavers that harvest idle CPU time from PC users worldwide to provide sufficient computing power to solve the protein prediction problems. So far, all these attempts have produced very modest improvements. This project takes a radically different approach: the molecular folding problem is cast as a massively distributed 3D puzzle game, and encourages people to work together with computers to find the solutions to current open problems including cures for cancer, AIDS, and discovery of novel biofuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental idea is to employ user-assisted optimization for protein design, and formulate and present it as a competitive game played by thousands of people. The intention in this project is that people will play the game beacause it is fun (it looks like a fun 3d puzzle and not like some biochemistry textbook), it is addicting, it is competitive, it is collaborative (players can work together in groups to solve a problem), has impact (players want to get credit for the drug that cures cancer). The impact of this proposal is in its addressing of a number of fundamental areas: 1) how to best develop games to maximize human ability to discover novel proteins beyond what is currently possible with computation-only approaches; 2) determining the guiding principles of a successful molecular design game; 3) how to best generalize game-development principles to the widest possible range of biochemical problems; 4) revealing what is learned from the way people play the game, and how these strategies could be "distilled" towards developing stronger automated approaches.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This is the final report for the 3-year project to develop a massively multiplayer game that tries to solve key problems in biochemistry through a collaborative process integrating strengths of people and computers. The project has been wildly successful, both in terms of publications including the two Nature papers (third one just accepted), one PNAS paper, as well as a sizeable presence in press and media over the last two years.  There are three key reportable findings resulting from this project:   People demonstrably outperform known computational methods on particularly hard protein structure prediction problems The process leading to the Foldit game has a number of discovered principles that could be applied to other problems. Game-developed experts are capable of solving long-standing complex scientific problems that were not solved by scientists for over a decade. It is possible to let people generalize their strategies through in-game macros, resulting from much quicker performance improvements by novices, as well as discovery of novel strategies not previously known in the biochemistry literature.   Below we describe each of these findings. 1.     Foldit gameplay creates protein experts  We hypothesized that human spatial reasoning could improve both the sampling of conformational space and the determination of when to pursue suboptimal conformations if the stochastic elements of the search were replaced with human decision making while retaining the deterministic Rosetta algorithms as user tools. We developed a multiplayer online game, Foldit, with the goal of producing accurate protein structure models through gameplay.  We have found the game to be approachable by a wide variety of people, not only those with a scientific background;  in fact, very few top players are professionally involved in biochemistry.  As interesting as the Foldit predictions themselves is the complexity, variation and creativity of the human search process.  The ability to advance science with this expertise has been shown thorugh 4 publications.  The details of these findings can be found in the Nature journal paper (Cooper et al, 2010).  This publication marks the first time ever that over 57000 game players were coauthors of a paper in the most respected science journal. 2.     Principles behind creation of Foldit game  Here we give an overview of the current state of Foldit.  Scientists post problems to the server; in the case of Foldit, these are protein structures for which the players are meant to find the native structures.  Players collaborate and compete to solve the puzzles over a one week period  At the close of a puzzle, the solution data is aggregated, and presented to the scientists for analysis.   In order to arrive at the current state of Foldit, we took an iterative approach to the game's design.  Given the difficulty of the problem, it would be unlikely that our initial decisions would be the best.  There are three major groups relevant to our approach: 1) the scientific experts whose problems the game is meant to help solve; 2) the players; and 3) the game development team itself.  The development team must incorporate feedback from the players to make sure the game is understandable and fun, and from the experts to make sure that the results produced will be useful to them.  An overview of the interactions between these three groups is given in the figure.  The full description of our strategies and how they could be distilled for other scientific-discovery games can be found in our Foundations of Digital Games paper (Cooper 2010a). 3.     Resolving open scientific problems through gameplay  In 2011, Foldit players in 10 days solved the structure of the protein that has stumped scientists for 15 years.  This marked the first such finding produced by novices who became experts through gameplay.  The protein has subsequently confirmed in the lab.  The finding was reported in Nature with key Foldit groups that lead to di...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
