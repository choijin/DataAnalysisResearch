<AbstractNarration>DMS-0802959&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project features a year-long, combined educational and&lt;br/&gt;research experience for a cohort of 9 to 12 students during each&lt;br/&gt;of the five project years.  Participants are recruited from the&lt;br/&gt;institutions of the Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities (ACTC)&lt;br/&gt;and perform their coursework and research under the mentorship of&lt;br/&gt;faculty at the University of St. Thomas (UST) in St. Paul, MN and&lt;br/&gt;faculty at other ACTC institutions.  Participants benefit from a&lt;br/&gt;course developed to support the learning and use of&lt;br/&gt;computationally intensive methods in mathematics and statistics. &lt;br/&gt;The cohort participates in a variety of workshops, seminars,&lt;br/&gt;conferences, and field trips.  In small groups, cohort students&lt;br/&gt;contribute to research projects requiring the computational&lt;br/&gt;skills acquired in the course and share their progress with&lt;br/&gt;fellow students and project faculty.  Students periodically&lt;br/&gt;present their results in the larger professional community.  The&lt;br/&gt;intellectual merit of the project is the result of the following&lt;br/&gt;achievements.  Students become proficient using computational&lt;br/&gt;methods and learn to apply this knowledge to perform research on&lt;br/&gt;problems whose solutions require the use of these methods. &lt;br/&gt;Through interaction with local academicians and industrialists,&lt;br/&gt;students see how their computation research methods are used in&lt;br/&gt;other areas of research and in real-world problems.  The broader&lt;br/&gt;impact of the project is felt at four levels.  At UST, students&lt;br/&gt;learn how to perform research using computational methods and&lt;br/&gt;faculty gain experience teaching a new course that emphasizes&lt;br/&gt;computational methods.  On a larger level, these same impacts are&lt;br/&gt;realized by students and faculty at other ACTC institutions. &lt;br/&gt;Local industries that utilize computational methods benefit from&lt;br/&gt;graduates of ACTC schools who enjoy a high level of proficiency&lt;br/&gt;in scientific computation.  Finally, student presentations and&lt;br/&gt;sponsored conferences promote to a national audience the&lt;br/&gt;innovative curricular elements developed and research&lt;br/&gt;advancements made by cohort members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Computing power continues to grow at an incredible rate.  As&lt;br/&gt;a result, scientists can use the computer to create highly&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated models for use in solving complicated mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems.  In addition, computational methods developed decades&lt;br/&gt;ago that were once intractable in practice due to the lack of&lt;br/&gt;computing facilities can now be employed to model and solve&lt;br/&gt;problems.  It is imperative that undergraduate mathematics&lt;br/&gt;students at universities in the United States receive the&lt;br/&gt;training they need in order to make the utmost advantage of the&lt;br/&gt;world's ever-increasing computing resources and remain&lt;br/&gt;technologically competitive with scientists on a global level. &lt;br/&gt;Towards this end, mathematics and engineering faculty from the&lt;br/&gt;University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN and mathematics faculty&lt;br/&gt;from other institutions in the Associated Colleges of the Twin&lt;br/&gt;Cities engage undergraduate students in research groups under the&lt;br/&gt;auspices of the National Science Foundation's Computational&lt;br/&gt;Science Training for Undergraduates in the Mathematical Sciences&lt;br/&gt;program.  For each of the next five years, a group of 9 to 12&lt;br/&gt;mathematics majors forms a cohort and participates in a year-long&lt;br/&gt;program to learn about computational methods used in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research and put the knowledge they have accrued to work as they&lt;br/&gt;join with faculty mentors to perform research on problems with&lt;br/&gt;applications to areas such as cancer treatment, image compression&lt;br/&gt;and analysis, tornadic storm detection, the behavior of thin&lt;br/&gt;films, and directed cell movement.  Students visit local&lt;br/&gt;industries in the Twin Cities to further learn how scientific&lt;br/&gt;computing is used to solve real-world problems and present&lt;br/&gt;results of their work at national conferences.  Students leave&lt;br/&gt;the program armed with both the tools required and experience&lt;br/&gt;necessary to continue work at a high level either in industry or&lt;br/&gt;graduate school on problems requiring an expertise in scientific&lt;br/&gt;computation.  The project is supported by the MPS Division of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;Activities, and the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The availability of large data sets allows businesses and industry to perform careful analysis of a wide variety of activities (monitoring profit/loss, forecasting trends, research and development).  While computer hardware and software development/production has grown to handle big data sets, the training of future members of the workforce has not always kept pace.     "CSUMS: A Computational Training and Interdisciplinary Research Program for Undergraduates in the Mathematical Sciences at the University of St. Thomas" was a 6-year project whose primarily goal was to immerse annual cohorts of undergraduate students in an intense training and research program that focused on large-scale computation.  Towards this end, 67 students were advised by 11 faculty members from 3 different St. Paul and Minneapolis colleges and universities.  In a year-long program, students first learned about large-scale computational tools that would be utilized in subsequent research programs and next broke into two- to four-person research teams that worked with a faculty advisor on an 8-month research project.  In total, 24 research projects were conducted over the duration of the 6-year project.  Selected research topics include:  Modeling of Thermal Treatment for Uterine Disorders Modeling Tornado Genesis Measuring the Delay in Spiking Neurons Market Return Data Analysis Pansharpening of Satellite Images The Financial Impact of Subjective Mortality Risk Characterizing Melanoma and Moles Mathematical Modeling of Craniosynostosis Mathematical Modeling to Diagnose Breast Cancer Statistical Modeling of Related Failures of Vehicle Components      All of these projects utilized large-scale data sets that in some cases were provided by local business and industry.  Students and faculty from the University of St. Thomas, Macalester College and Augsburg College participated in the project.     In addition to performing research, students participated in activities aimed to improve oral and writting communications skills and to foster teambuilding.  With regard to the goal of improviding communications skills, students made numerous and graduated presentations of their work to local audiences and in total made 50 presentations at national and international meetings.  They received instruction in presentation methods and participated in workshops to improve their technical writing skills.  To emphasize teambuilding, participants attended public lecture series talks (as a group) at the Universtiy of Minnesota, met with local and national professionals who talked about large-scale computational research at their particular business or industry, and toured facilities such as the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute and the Twin Cities National Weather Research Office.  On a broader scale, teambuilding and synergistic work for all participating CSUMS schools were emphasized by way of the organization of three summer research conferences (2009-2011) at the University of St. Thomas.  In total, 63 undergraduate students from 8 CSUMS universities presented their research at the CSUMS Undergraduate Research Conferences.     Upon completion of the program, it was our hope that students would be well-prepared to enter the high-tech workforce or be accepted into graduate school in a Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) area.  We believe we have been quite successful in acheiving this goal.  At the time the project concluded, 23 project students were still enrolled at the University of St. Thomas.  Of the 44 who did complete the project and graduate, our tracking data indicates that 82% continued on to graduate school in a STEM area (14 students) or were successful in obtaining a high-tech job for which their training in large-scale computing was a positive factor in securing employment (22 students).  Data are unavailable on 5 students and 3 students took non-STEM related jobs upon graduation.       The project had far-reaching impacts on our universi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
