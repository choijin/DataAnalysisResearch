<AbstractNarration>NSF funding under this grant will provide partial funding for a new Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Oceans and Human Health (OHH), including an associated Graduate Research Seminar (GRS). The subject of OHH concerns science at the intersection of medical, genomic and oceanographic disciplines, and the implications for and effects on human health and wellbeing. The purpose and scope of the GRC and GRS are to provide a multidisciplinary platform for discussing the current state of knowledge of the rapidly evolving, highly interdisciplinary fields that comprise Oceans and Human Health, to identify and debate unresolved questions, and to discuss new research directions. These activities will bring together experts and students with diverse backgrounds including algal and microbial biology, physical and biological oceanography, epidemiology and public health, genomics and proteomics, toxicology, pharmacology, and economics.  An important motivation is the fact that as a new scientific discipline, OHH as a professional enterprise does not currently have a forum to facilitate interactions and dialogue among its practitioners. The significance of the field is reflected by the support of four new Centers for Oceans and Human Health by the National Science Foundation and the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will have two practical objectives: (1) to assemble the highest caliber of academic, government and industrial scientists and students to examine recent developments in the subdisciplines of OHH and review the latest pertinent research in algal and microbial biology, physical and biological oceanography, epidemiology and public health, genomics and proteomics, toxicology, pharmacology, and economics; and  (2) to foster the open exchange of information and ideas among scientists at the cutting edge of OHH research by providing opportunities for participants to interact in a relaxed and friendly environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the conference is expected to contribute in a substantial way to education, learning, and increasing the involvement of underrepresented groups in addressing important societal issues. The conference will engage female, minority and junior faculty and students (postdoctoral and graduate) active in OHH research through participation in formal sessions, poster presentations and informal interactions. The GRS is targeted specifically at mentoring students in this new emerging discipline. Information concerning these meetings will be broadly disseminated through professional societies and by personal contact. Minority participants will be sought by advertising and personal contact at minority and other institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
