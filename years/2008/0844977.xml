<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is the development of a methodology for the analysis of wind loading and structural response uncertainty for tall buildings affected by wind hazards. This study will contribute to the quantification of such uncertainties through a combination of analytical and numerical simulation methods, which will be validated through an experimental study in wind tunnel. Attention will be focused on the loading induced by synoptic and hurricane winds. The deliverables will include the implementation of a set of numerical and analytical computer methods for the quantification of the damage. The following issues will be considered: 1) discomfort levels for occupants, 2) damage to the fa√ßade of the building, 3) damage to other non-structural elements, 4) immediate occupancy criteria for essential facilities in the aftermath of a severe wind storm. The analysis of economical impacts, for example associated with maintenance repairs and downtime losses, will be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research activity will contribute to the minimization of economic losses on tall buildings affected by wind hazards. The outcomes of the study will also provide indication for the derivation of simplified design rules for structural design. Integrated educational and outreach activities will include: direct training of graduate and undergraduate students, department-level and college-wide demonstrations for graduate and undergraduate students, creation of an expert system for awareness against wind hazards, short courses for practicing engineers, technology and data sharing through the collaboration with a wind engineering cyber-infrastructure network&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
