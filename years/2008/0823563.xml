<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate charge transport properties in interface-controlled organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) using light scattering techniques, with a long term goal of applying OFETs in memory devices. The approach includes (1) layer-by-layer growth of polymer films using pulsed laser deposition to control the semiconductor-dielectric interface in OFETs; (2) probing the dielectric-semiconductor interface using Raman spectroscopy from biased OFET structures and correlating the changes in the vibrational spectra with theory to identify the structural changes upon charge transport; (3) charge modulation spectroscopy of OFETs; (4) surface-enhanced Raman scattering from metal nanoparticle doped dielectric and organic semiconductors for memory applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach to probe charge transport in OFETs by combining light scattering techniques with conventional current-voltage characteristics, yielding information on electron-phonon interactions and structural changes at the interface. Such a technique has a potential transformative character as it promises to become a standard probe for studying charge transport mechanisms in a host of other optoelectronic devices. This hypothesis will be further put to test in organic memory applications where surface-enhanced Raman scattering studies will be carried out to gain insight into the operation of memory devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the work is demonstrated by recruitment of undergraduate interns including underrepresented minorities from Lincoln University (a Historically Black College &amp; University) to give them opportunities in cutting-edge research. The proposed work involves participation and training of graduate students which will contribute to the US workforce in the area of organic optoelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
