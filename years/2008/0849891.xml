<AbstractNarration>This S-STEM scholars program provides scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students to encourage rising juniors to pursue a five-year master's degree via the da Vinci Center for Innovation in Product Design and Development.  The da Vinci Center combines the disciplines of engineering, business, and art in a single venue and provides a framework for teaching and practicing the science and art of product development.  Students who participate in the center will be engaged in the creative, technical and commercial elements that comprise successful product development.  Approximately 91 scholarships will be provided during the life of this grant award; scholars will participate in peer mentoring and living learning communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was to provide financial assistance, in the form of scholarships, to support the educational pursuits of juniors and seniors with financial need in engineering and to continue that financial assistance at the graduate level as they pursued a master's degree in Product Innovation via the da Vinci Center for Innovation at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The da Vinci Center brings together the disciplines of engineering, business, humanities, sciences, and art in a single venue and provides a framework for teaching and practicing the science and art of product development. Its mission is to prepare graduates of VCU to function effectively in an interdisciplinary, team-based, technology driven environment where innovation in product development is the principal objective. Touted as one of VCU?s unique programs, the da Vinci Cneter "shapes students into entrepreneurs who can generate creative ideas and execute them with technical and marketing expertise.[1]"  During the course of the grant 39 students received financial assistance. Of the 39 students, 84% have graduated with an engineering degree and/or the Master of Product Innovation (MPI) degree, 18%[2] are still enrolled in their undergraduate engineering or master of product innovation programs.  The program provided critical financial support to scholars of varying identities. Of the scholars, 51% were female and/or minority students, 44% were transfer students (predominantly from the Virginia Community College System), 26% went on to pursue a graduate degree (in the Master of Product Information), and 31% enrolled in the Product Innovation certificate program. When queried, a majority of the responding scholars, "strongly agreed" or "somewhat agreed"  that participating in the da Vinci program; added value to their engineering education, improved their engineering skills, gave them greater appreciation for engineering, provided positive product innovation experience, and offered unique and innovated educational experiences.  Scholars have been highlighted in numerous VCU news articles[3] for their outstanding accomplishments and unique learning experiences through the da Vinci Center.
