<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the synthesis of three biologically active and challenging natural products.  The purpose of these studies is to test and expand methods previously developed by the PI and to investigate the biosynthesis of these unusual families of natural products.  The first aim involves the development of new methods and strategies in order to construct several members of the heliananes family and to investigate the biosynthesis of these terrestrial and marine compounds.  Several mechanistic studies will accompany this study with regards to key reactions.  The second and third aims entail the synthetic exploration of a new non-racemic benzopyrilium equivalent that has been developed, a new chiral chromene acetal.  The application of this new chromene acetal building block for the synthesis of kushecarpin, medicarpin, and sophoracarpan as well for members of the frondosin family will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Thomas R. Pettus of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Santa Barbara.  Professor research efforts revolve around the development of new aromatic chemistry.  Successful development of the proposed methodology and syntheses will undoubtedly have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.</AbstractNarration>
