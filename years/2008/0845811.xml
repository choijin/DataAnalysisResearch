<AbstractNarration>To assert their legitimacy, French kings were borne under witness, and awoke, bathed, and dressed in public.  America's Congress implemented a Freedom of Information Act to create methods for citizens to audit  their government.  These examples show how traditionally, organizations establish their legitimacy through protocols for disclosure.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;But disclosure has its practical limits; even organizations need a modicum of privacy. This project aims to balance the needs for both legitimacy  and privacy by replacing disclosure protocols by more nuanced cryptographic ones.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Although well-studied cryptographic protocols can help achieve this goal, several key challenges must be addressed.   As a conceptual challenge, this project studies how the use of cryptographic protocols may inadvertently introduce ways for individuals to cheat by colluding.  The eventual goal is to eliminate this phenomena.  As an implementation challenge. this project proposes a principled way to transform high-level specifications of special  cryptographic protocols into implementations.  Finally, as an efficiency challenge, this project studies a  promising  ``optimistic rational'' method for protocol design that can dramatically reduce  communication complexity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In summary, this project studies methods organizations can use to  establish their legitimacy by analyzing new models, new ways of organizing communication, and new methods for implementation.  To disseminate these ideas,  this project's educational activities include course development, outreach to high school teachers so that  ideas from cryptography can be woven into their lessons, direct interaction with high school students, development of  privacy tools,  and mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The initial goals of this project were to resolve conceptual, implementation, and efficiency challenges with using zero-knowledge protocols and secure computation to allow an organization to assert its legitimacy without having to disclose unnecessary private information about its operations.  During the scope of this project, we have made progress on all of these areas and resolved fundamental questions about zero-knowledge and secure computation.   *  Our contributions in the area of zero-knowledge addressed both conceptual and theoretical questions as well as practical and efficiency-oriented questions.  We studied zero-knowledge protocols that were optimistically secure in the sense that their execution overhead required to remain secure under concurrent executions was minimized when the scheduling permitted.  Later in the project, we designed zero-knowledge protocols for specific tasks, such as running truly anonymous surveys, and designed and implemented versions of these protocols that remain secure under concurrent executions and also require only one message to be sent from the Prover to the Verifier.  * In a different sequence of works, we developed notions of collusion-free protocols and designed protocols that achieved those notions.  During the later half of the project, we focused on more concrete tasks and developed two-party secure computation protocols that were secure against malicious adversaries.  Through a series of major improvements, our protocols and implementations were able to handle secure computations that were 1 million times larger than the largest examples from the literature in 2009 (at the beginning of the project) and at a rate that was effectively 100,000 times faster than the best results. These results showed that secure computation research had come to the level of near practice.  The project has supported a number of graduate students and undergraduates who have continued on to graduate school.  The software developed in the project has been made available to many research groups and posted online.       Last Modified: 05/04/2016       Submitted by: Abhi Shelat]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
