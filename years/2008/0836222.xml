<AbstractNarration>The 2008 Gordon Research Conference, held August 3-8, 2008 at Tilton School, New Hampshire, highlights the latest research and future trends in brittle and ductile rock mechanics, with experimental, field and theoretical contributions. This conference brings together experts and students in these research areas with experimentalists and theoreticians studying the same processes. Participants discuss and assess where agreement exists on rheological constraints derived at different length and time scales using different techniques - and where new insight is required. Thematic sessions are: 1) the dynamics of earthquake rupture; 2) the rheology of the lower crust and coupling with the upper mantle; 3) the measurement and interpretation of seismic attenuation and anisotropy; 4) the dynamics of ice sheets; 4) the coupling of reactive porous flow and brittle deformation for understanding geothermal and chemical properties of the shallow crust that are important for developing ideas in carbon sequestration, geothermal and petrochemical research. Participants include specialists in rock mechanics, seismology, tectonics, rheology, geodesy, and structural geology reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of the conference theme. The program includes significant time for all conference participants to debate current problems and future research directions. The principal goal of this conference is not so much to assess or present what has already been accomplished, but rather to look towards the future and open up new research directions. The conference format is designed to involve established leaders, both men and women, in a range of disciplines, in discussion with all participants, and to inspire the postdoctoral scientists and graduate students who will carry the field forward.</AbstractNarration>
