<AbstractNarration>OISE 0829180&lt;br/&gt;Pielke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Norwegian workshop will bring together a group of pioneering policy researchers to examine approaches for improving the best possible match between the information that is available to decision makers and the information used to support actual decisions.  Organizers, Roger Pielke of the University of Colorado-Boulder, and his Norwegian partner, Merle Jacob of the University of Oslo?s Center for Technology, Innovation and Culture, will direct a four-day program in Oslo to address the question: ?How can scholars who study science and innovation policy contribute more effectively to the needs of policy makers facing decisions about science and innovation policy??&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop draws upon Norwegian and U.S. perspectives for a comparative program designed to focus on both the supply and demand sides of the relationship of knowledge producers and users in the two countries.  The goal is to derive systematic knowledge about how the supply of scientific information, via the broad areas of science and technologies studies and policy research, relates to the demand for information among science and innovation policy decision makers and to the capacity of decision makers to use the information they receive. Results from this workshop are expected help develop approaches to address the challenge of producing and using new knowledge about science and innovation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   Broader impacts include early career introduction of U.S. graduate and post doctoral students to Norwegian and U.S. experts in the growing field called the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP).  Overall, participants are expected gain deeper understanding of problems associated with the integration of research and action in a two country context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
