<AbstractNarration>DMS-0801029 Eisenstein Series, Operators and L-Functions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         Dr. Lagarias proposes to investigate various analytic problems related to Eisenstein series and L-functions in number theory. There are three topics. The first topic concerns the Lerch zeta function and its relation to Eisenstein series. The second topic concerns properties of certain de Branges spaces and associated operators attached to automorphic L-functions. A third topic is to investigate Fourier coefficients of various nonholomorphic Eisenstein series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is in the area of number theory. Number theory has in recent years has provided many useful applications in communications, coding theory and cryptography. Recent developments have observed parallels between problems in number theory, including the distribution of prime numbers, and various topics in mathematical physics. This proposal investigates possible connections of this kind.  The problems considered may stimulate interactions between researchers in these fields. The proposer is training graduate students in related areas.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research area of this grant is number theory (the study of properties of integers) and its relation to analysis and geometry. A connection to geometry comes through connection to packings (``Geometry of Numbers"), which are important incommunications and cryptography.   The research in this grant covered diverse topics. One topic  concerned study of properties of  Eisenstein series and zeta functions, and how these objects encode number theory data. Another  topic investigated was to quantify the assertion that it is not possible for  three relatively prime numbers in arithmetic progression to have all three numbers completely factor into very small prime divisors compared to their size. This work was done with K. Soundararajan (Stanford). It quantifies a certain basic incompatibility of the addition and multiplication operation on integers.    The research in this grant resulted in two edited books, one of these concerning a number theory problem, thesecond one  on sphere packing,at least 13 papers, and four PhD. theses. I  trained six graduate students,and below would like to feature the work of two of them.   Elizabeth Chen (PhD 2010, U. of Michigan) worked on the problem of the densest packing of space by congruent regular tetrahedra. This is a very old problem.

Concerning broader impact, this grant involved the training of six graduatestudents, four of whom have now completed thePhD. degree. In addition I mentored three undergraduate students in mathematics research, at least one of which has resulted in published work.
