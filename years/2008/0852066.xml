<AbstractNarration>This project will be performed by the Computer Science Department at the University of Texas at ElPaso (UTEP), in collaboration with the departments of Psychology, Biological Sciences, Industrial Engineering, and Civil Engineering.  The topical focus will be Applied Intelligent Systems. The main goals of the project are to increase participation in science and engineering fields by traditionally underrepresented groups, to introduce science and engineering students to cutting edge interdisciplinary research, and toprovide students with an opportunity to familiarize themselves with graduate programs in science and engineering at a regional university. The program will host students for a period of ten weeks during the summer. It will emphasize interdisciplinary research, where techniques developed in the area of artificial intelligence will be appliedto real-world problemsinscience and engineering. This will allowthe students togain a broader overviewof science and engineering as a potential career than would be possible in more narrowly-defined research areas. An emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from minority-serving institutions and institutions that do not offer graduate programs in computer science. The proposed program will provide undergraduate students an opportunity to conduct full-time collaborative interdisciplinary research under the co-supervision of a faculty member fromthe computer science departmentand a faculty member from one of the collaborating departments hold a seminar series in which academic and non-academic careers in science will be discussed, promote extensive student-faculty and student-student interaction through weekly gatherings (research meetings and social/cultural activities) and undertake activities to mprove students' confidence and communication skills through oral and written presentations of project results and through Career Development Workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the unique combination of: a)well-planned interdisciplinary research projects, which can realistically be expected to be completed by an undergraduate student during one summer; b) mentorship by at least two faculty members from two different research departments,which enables students to gain a richer perspective about careers in science; c) emphasis on development of research skills over knowledge about a particular discipline; d) emphasis on recruitment by individualized invitation over self-selection of applicants, which is expected to attract larger numbers of minority applicants, and, f) participate in a proven mentor training program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project will ultimately be increased numbers of students, in particular members of underrepresented groups, pursuing graduate studies in science and engineering and engagingin successful careers.It is expected that most of the students who participate in the project will enroll and successfully complete graduate studies and that a significant fraction of them will become faculty members at colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>
