<AbstractNarration>One key to transforming undergraduate STEM education is better preparation of doctoral students who will become STEM faculty for their essential role as teachers and mentors. Over the past decade, significant time and resources have been invested in the development of numerous teaching-related professional development programs aimed at enhancing traditional doctoral training at research universities. However, little is known about the effectiveness of these programs. This research study is exploring a critical yet understudied juncture of graduate and undergraduate education: the preparation of future faculty for their pivotal role as teachers of undergraduates who will become the next generation of scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and science and math teachers. This Phase III Project is building on four years of research supported by the NSF-funded Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL).  It is a 5-year, multi-institutional study that is examining the short- and long-term effects of future-faculty professional development (FFPD) on STEM doctoral students and their early-career performance.  The study is addressing six research questions: &lt;br/&gt;(1) What are the general characteristics of FFPD programs, and which characteristics are most strongly correlated with positive and negative participant outcomes? &lt;br/&gt;(2) What characteristics distinguish FFPD participants from non-participants, and what encourages and discourages participation? &lt;br/&gt;(3) What do doctoral students gain from FFPD programs that helps prepare them for diverse academic careers? &lt;br/&gt;(4) What influence does participation in FFPD programs have on the kinds of careers that STEM PhDs choose? &lt;br/&gt;(5) Does participation in FFPD have impact on indicators of early career performance?  &lt;br/&gt;(6) What degree of investment in FFPD must a doctoral student make, and for what length of time, to receive modest but significant benefits?&lt;br/&gt;The study is using a longitudinal mixed-methods design that is following two groups of STEM doctoral students from three research universities over five years. One group of doctoral students who have participated in FFPD programs will be interviewed a total of three times: at the end of their doctoral program; soon after taking their first academic job; and in the third year of their job. A second group comprised of a large randomly-selected sample of STEM doctoral students including both FFPD participants and non-participants will be surveyed in Years 1 and 5 of the study. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Using surveys and interviews, researchers followed a cohort of STEM dissertators (initial N = 3,060) from three research universities as they completed their degrees from 2009 to 2013. We examined studentsÆ teaching experiences and TD participation during the doctoral program, their career pathways as many as five years after receiving their doctorates, and the short- and long-term effects of their participation in doctoral TD on their teaching knowledge, skills, and attitudes.   Intellectual Merit:  Key findings from the seven-year project included the following:  Nearly all doctoral students (94.9%) taught undergraduates, serving as teaching assistants, lab assistants, instructors of record, research mentors, and guest lecturers. On average, STEM doctoral students taught 13.5 weighted semesters during their degree programs (an average of 13.5 weighted semesters is comparable to 3.4 semesters of instructorsÆ teaching and 6.8 semesters of teaching assistantsÆ teaching). Participation in teaching development was commonplace, as most (84.6%) doctoral students engaged in at least one formal activity during their degree program. Women participated at higher rates than men at each career stage. The greatest barriers to participation were studentsÆ lack of time, the perception that TD was a low priority, lack of awareness of TD offerings, and scheduling conflicts. TD during the doctoral program had positive, significant effects for all participants, including those who did not take academic positions after receiving their doctorates. Eleven or more hours of TD participation had a significant impact on the short- and long-term outcomes that were measured. Women benefitted more from their TD participation than men. Participating in TD programs during the doctoral program had no effect on the average time to complete the doctorate, once all other factors were accounted for. However, teaching experiences did increase doctoral time to degree. STEM doctoral studentsÆ interest in teaching undergraduates increased during their training, especially among those interested in faculty careers. About half of doctoral students aspired to faculty careers (tenure-track or non-tenure-track), with a slightly greater proportion hoping to apply for faculty jobs at the end of their programs (55.4%) than at the beginning (53.3%).  More STEM doctoral students grew interested in teaching undergraduates as they moved through their programs, especially among those pursuing faculty careers. STEM Ph.D.s followed career pathways to a variety of positions in and outside of academia. Within one year of earning their doctorates, 9.3% of students had secured tenure-track positions; by the fifth year after completing their degrees, 23.0% of students were in tenure-track positions.

The percentage of unemployed doctorates was relatively low (4.0% overall). Nearly half of STEM Ph.D.s (45.5%) were in positions with undergraduate teaching responsibilities within five years of receiving their degrees. Higher levels of TD engagement (more than 55 hours) significantly increased the likelihood of moving into a faculty position after completing the Ph.D.   As these findings show, TD during the doctoral program is an effective approach to pre...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
