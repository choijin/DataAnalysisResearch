<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0805352&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Ko Honda&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently it has become more evident that contact structures play&lt;br/&gt;a central role in low-dimensional topology and Topological&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs).  The cut-and-paste theory of&lt;br/&gt;contact structures in dimension three, developed by numerous&lt;br/&gt;authors including the PI, can now be imported into Heegaard Floer&lt;br/&gt;homology, a (3+1)-dimensional TQFT.  The PI, together with his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators, seeks to better understand the relations among&lt;br/&gt;contact geometry, Floer homology theories, TQFTs and string&lt;br/&gt;theory, and hyperbolic geometry. More specifically, the PI&lt;br/&gt;proposes the following: (1) Analyze the TQFT properties of&lt;br/&gt;Heegaard/sutured Floer homology.  (2) Understand a certain&lt;br/&gt;category obtained via contact geometry, which satisfies many of&lt;br/&gt;the properties of a triangulated category.  (3) Study contact&lt;br/&gt;homology invariants of exact Lagrangian cobordisms between&lt;br/&gt;Legendrian links in the symplectization of a contact manifold.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Calculate the contact homology of tight contact structures on&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes a study of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces using a&lt;br/&gt;probe called a contact structure. The 3-dimensional spaces we&lt;br/&gt;study will locally be similar to the standard (Euclidean)&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional space.  These objects may be very complicated&lt;br/&gt;globally, but a local observer cannot tell the difference, just&lt;br/&gt;as an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a flat plane or a&lt;br/&gt;very large sphere.  A contact structure is a field in&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional space, analogous to an electric field in physics.&lt;br/&gt;Just as the nature of the electric field, such as the strength&lt;br/&gt;and the direction at any point, gives some information about the&lt;br/&gt;distribution of the electric charge, i.e., the source of the&lt;br/&gt;electric field, a contact structure gives information about the&lt;br/&gt;shape of the ambient 3-dimensional space.  A more thorough&lt;br/&gt;mathematical understanding of contact structures in dimension&lt;br/&gt;three may contribute significantly towards our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the shape of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There   are several invariants of knots, links, and 3-dimensional spaces that   arise from mathematical physics and symplectic geometry.  A knot invariant is a quantity that is assigned to a knot such that any two knots with different values cannot be deformed into one another.  Questions about knotting are ubiquitous in science: from quantum computing to molecular biology (especially knotting in DNA). A 3-dimensional space (technically called a 3-manifold) is a space which locally looks like the 3-dimensional space that we live in. It might look different from far away, just as a sphere and the surface of a donut with a hole are locally indistinguishable but can be distinguished from afar.    Two of the most powerful and useful invariants of knots and 3-dimensional spaces are Heegaard Floer homology and Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology.  I am currently putting finishing touches on joint work with Vincent Colin and Paolo Ghiggini in which we establish the equivalence of Heegaard Floer homology and Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology. This work consists of four papers which add up to over 300 pages in total.  (An alternate proof has been given by Cagatay Kutluhan, Yi-Jen Lee, and Cliff Taubes, using very different methods.) Since Heegaard Floer homology is combinatorial and computable, while Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology is more geometric, we expect many practical applications to ensue.
