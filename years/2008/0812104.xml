<AbstractNarration>OISE-0812104 (Spencer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)&lt;br/&gt;?Smart Structures Technology Summer School?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a series of three 3-week international Summer Schools in the design and construction of smart structures. The schools will provide students with multidisciplinary training in key areas related to smart structures: structural dynamics, control systems, circuit technology, wireless technology, and informatics. In addition, they will familiarize students with forefront research related to smart structures technology in participating countries. The Summer Schools will be held in Korea in 2008, the US in 2009, and Japan in 2010 and will involve approximately ten graduate students in civil and mechanical engineering from each of the participating countries. The program of each school includes coursework, labs and site visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is a collaboration among PI Spencer, C.B. Yun, professor and director of the Smart Infra-Structure Technology Center (SISTeC) of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Korea; Yozo Fujino, head of the Bridge Engineering Laboratory at University of Tokyo in Japan; and Guo-Qiang Li, professor of structural engineering at Tongji University in China. It is expected that the schools will create an environment in which highly motivated students, faculty, and professionals will be able to establish lasting international collaborative arrangements. The NSF award, jointly funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation in the Directorate for Engineering, supports the U.S. side of the collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
