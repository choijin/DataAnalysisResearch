<AbstractNarration>California State University, Long Beach Noyce II: Recruiting, Supporting and Retaining Teachers is supporting 21 secondary science or mathematics teacher candidates over the course of four years. The scholarship/stipends are for $15,000 per year. Six scholarship recipients are receiving more than 1 year of support to complete their undergraduate and post-baccalaureate credential programs while 15 stipend recipients are receiving up to one year of funding to support post-baccalaureate credentialing. A strong partnership with a community college, Cerritos College, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) like CSULB, is providing another pipeline of interested students. Noyce II Scholars have extra fieldwork as part of the program and are tutoring in partner school districts, Long Beach Unified School District (approximately 90,000 students) and Whittier Union High School District (approximately 14,000 students). Both districts include schools which meet the high-need criteria. The tutoring and fieldwork experiences culminate with the Scholars completing their student teaching assignment in a partner high need school. In addition to the fieldwork, Scholars participate in an on-campus seminar series, receive additional mentoring, and are eligible for paid summer teaching and research opportunities. In addition to supporting 21 scholars, this project is examining the successes and challenges of the CSULB Noyce I program. Approximately 35 students received support through the Noyce I grant. The evaluation component of this new grant is studying Noyce I, particularly: 1) how Noyce I alumni are doing in the classrooms; 2) how effective they are in the classroom;  3) how Noyce has influenced their careers; and, 4) for those who dropped out, why they left the program.</AbstractNarration>
