<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Cave fishes differ from surface fishes in numerous ways because of their evolutionary adaptations to life in the dark.  Most noticeably, they have smaller eyes and less pigmentation, but they also have better senses of smell and taste, and are more efficient metabolically.  All of these differences are under genetic control; the gene copies in the cave populations affecting important developmental systems differ from those in the surface populations.  The Mexican Tetra is unique in that the species has both cave and surface forms.  Because they can hybridize, they afford the opportunity to investigate the differences through genetic analysis.  In this collaborative research project, the genes responsible for these differences will be identified by genetic mapping and functional analyses of selected candidate genes.  The results will lead to a better understanding of the genetic pathways that control the development and maintenance of: (1) the visual system; (2) pigmentation; (3) metabolic efficiency; and (4) various other physiological and anatomical systems.  In terms of Broader Impacts, the work on cave fishes has been well covered by the media, and the extraordinary ability of this system to engage people's interest and attention will have broad positive impacts on public education in biology, genetics and evolution.  The research will also impact the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, particularly in novel concepts of evolution and development (evodevo).  In terms of societal impacts, the results may also contribute to a general understanding of the causes of eye degeneration and metabolic disorders and could lead to a better insight into how environmental changes (i.e., the shift from surface to cave environments) can modulate the direction of evolutionary change.</AbstractNarration>

Compared to their surface relatives, the cave forms have greatly reduced eyes and pigmentation (Image1), more efficient metabolisms, and altered patterns of behaviors. Study of these trait differences is important because they all have genetic bases; knowledge of the genes responsible for the differences will tell us much about the genetics of normal (and abnormal) eye development, physiology and behavior.  What we learn will be as relevant to humans as to fish.              During the course of the investigation we constructed high density genetic linkage maps which gave the positions of genes and other genetic markers (called "SNPs") along the chromosomes. Using these SNP maps we were able to find previously undetected regions in the genome where there were genetic differences (called "QTLs") between cave and surface fish that were responsible for the phenotypic differences. Thus, the QTLs mark the positions in the genome where important evolutionary changes occurred. By analyzing variation in SNP frequency among surface and cave populations, we identified a subset of SNPs whose variation bore hallmarks of natural selection.

When this becomes available, researchers will be able to compare the two genomes directly, facilitating discovery of important genetic differences.              An unanticipated, but important outcome of this research was our discovery that cave fish sleep much less than related surface fishes. Surface fish average about 12 hours of sleep per day, whereas cave fish sleep only two or three hours (Image 2). Patterns of sleep can be analyzed in terms of numbers and durations of sleep bouts. Numbers of sleep bouts per night do not differ between cave and surface fish, but the lengths of sleep bouts in cave fish are much shorter. That is, cave fish fall asleep as often as surface fish, but they ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
