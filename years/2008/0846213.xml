<AbstractNarration>A National Science Foundation award to the University of Arizona Herbarium (ARIZ) under the direction of Michelle McMahon will support installation of mobile storage units and provide proper museum storage for more than 50,000 important plant and fungal specimens. The majority of collections awaiting incorporation and protection are identified yet are not filed in the main collection due to lack of space, making them unavailable for research or public service. Material stored outside of museum cabinets is under constant threat from insects, despite vigilant freeze-fumigation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specimens awaiting incorporation include scientifically significant collections from preeminent botanical and mycological researchers in the southwestern US and northwest MÃ©xico, as well as unique collections that are global in scope (e.g., morning glories and endophytic fungi). Installation of compactors and associated cabinets will also increase space for public activities, including permanent and rotating displays and workshops on topics such as translational taxonomy, phylogenetics and floristics. The herbarium will continue to recruit students, including those from underrepresented groups, to assist in research, public outreach, reorganizing over 400,000 plant and fungal specimens, and incorporating the valuable backlog into the main collection. This award will allow the highly active UA Herbarium to continue to grow for years to come.</AbstractNarration>
