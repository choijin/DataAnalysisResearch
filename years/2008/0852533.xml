<AbstractNarration>The support from this grant provides the funds for the Mathematics and Statistics Department at Saint Mary's University of Minnesota to continue an annual colloquium highlighting successful women mathematicians and to support undergraduate travel to national conferences. Both activities support the department's goal to produce students who can effectively communicate mathematics to laypeople and to experts in the field. Both the colloquium speakers and undergraduate presenters at national conferences provide role models for Saint Mary's students by giving them the chance to observe and interact with successful mathematics professionals and peers. The colloquium speakers especially will provide examples to our students of successful female mathematicians. This series encourages the recent upward trend of women in mathematics at Saint Mary's University and introduces undergraduate and high school women to role models who are not only successful in their mathematical profession, but also in their lives. This project intends to keep inspiring women to pursue terminal degrees in mathematics and also to enhance the Saint Mary's mathematics community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major objective of this project is to continue a successful annual colloquium for the advancement and encouragement of women in mathematics. By bringing well-known and outstanding women scientists specializing in mathematics to lecture and talk about their areas of expertise, students are engaged and inspired by the opportunities and challenges presented for women in the ever-progressing field of mathematics. This series provides undergraduate women with the opportunity to spend time listening and conversing with successful women in the field in hopes that they will be encouraged to go on to graduate studies and consider careers in mathematics. Additionally, since the symposium encourages participation from local high schools, it leaves high school women with a positive and hopeful outlook on the field and fosters their inclination to pursue math majors in college.</AbstractNarration>
