<AbstractNarration>The PI has developed two prototype magnetic levitation systems with novel designs, which provide unprecedented extended motion ranges in addition to the many advantages of magnetic levitation for 6 degree-of-freedom haptic human-machine interaction (such as mechanical simplicity, absence of friction and backlash, and high impedance range and control bandwidths).  The first device uses a novel coil and magnet configuration to approximately double the translation and triple the rotation range of previous Lorentz force levitation devices in all directions (increasing the motion volume 8 times and reachable orientations 27 times).  The second device is a modular system to levitate a platform of one or more magnets above a planar array of 5 or more cylindrical coils, which provides a planar motion range extendable to any area (by increasing the size of the coil array) and a potentially unlimited rotation range (the current prototype uses 10 coils to levitate one magnet with a motion range of 60x80 mm in the horizontal plane, 30 mm vertical, and 30 degrees of roll and pitch rotation).  .In this project the PI will extend the performance capabilities of two magnetic levitation systems in terms of their motion and impedance ranges, control bandwidths, and accuracy, through new modeling, control, and computation methods.  He will formulate and implement novel haptic simulation methods to benefit from the unique capabilities of the new devices for task-specific simulated environments including surgical simulation and other haptic skill tasks.  And he will evaluate the resulting haptic interaction systems in terms of the realism of the haptic perception by users and system effectiveness for haptic training and task performance.  The PI's overall objective in this work is to bring to bear topics in electromagnetic analysis, multivariable nonlinear dynamic control, computational methods, haptic modeling and real-time physical simulation methods, and human haptic perception and task performance, in order to improve the fidelity and effectiveness of human-machine haptic interaction using magnetic levitation devices.  The PI's hypothesis is that application of the proposed methods will lead to significant measurable improvements in haptic perception, interaction, and task performance, both for general human-machine interaction and in specific applications such as training of haptic medical skills and upper-limb rehabilitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The realization of magnetic levitation systems with extended translation and rotation ranges in all directions (Lorentz device) and/or easily extensible translation in horizontal directions and unlimited rotation (planar device), will provide dramatic benefits in a wide range of domains including robotic manipulation, fine positioning and orientation, automation, materials handling and processing, force and vibration control, and camera and antenna pointing not to mention entertainment.  High-fidelity haptic interaction will also have application to the study of psychophysical human haptic perception, and to the display of complex multidimensional abstract data.  The new technologies will provide exciting opportunities to teach physics and engineering concepts at any level in a memorable, intuitive way; to this end, the PI will develop educational materials with haptic magnetic levitation demonstrations and simulations, which will be made available to complement materials already in development in robotics areas for university classes and secondary schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Magnetic levitation devices are well suited as haptic interface devices, as forces and torques in all directions can be generated with high fidelity and control bandwidths directly to a grasped handle, providing a user with realistic force and motion interaction with a simulated environment.  The main research activities of this project have been in the areas of magnetic levitation design, analysis, and control, in order to increase system parameters including motion range, force and motion accuracy, and control stiffness.  Increases in these parameters improve the fidelity and utility of magnetic levitation haptic interface systems in which a user grasps and manipulates an instrument to interact with a simulated environment while feeling realistic force and torque feedback calculated from the software environment and generated on the handheld instrument by the levitation system in real time.  Two distinct novel magnetic levitation systems were developed and used during this project, where the first system uses Lorentz forces to levitate a handle attached to a bowl-shaped shell with six embedded coils, and the second uses a planar array of cylindrical coils to levitate an assembly containing one or more magnets.  The magnetic levitation research achievements also have broader contributions to other applications of magnetic levitation such as fine motion control, manipulation, teleoperation, and vibration isolation.  In the first system, a novel coil shape and a two-layer configuration was developed to produce a haptic interface device with 60 mm translation and 60 degree rotation ranges in all directions, more than twice the range of previous magnetic levitation haptic devices in each degree of freedom with a levitated body of approximately the same size and mass.  The implemented system is shown in an attached figure.  In the second system, a planar array of cylindrical coils are actuated in combination to produce forces and torques on a levitated platform.  Novel design, modeling, and control methods were found so that platforms with various magnet configurations could be levitated and controlled by the actuation coils used in combination, and used for haptic interaction.  Several levitated platforms were demonstrated for various applications, including a two-magnet wireless assembly, a six-magnet levitated ball with an unlimited controlled rotation range, and a single magnet assembly to be worn for fingertip force and torque haptic interaction, as shown in the attached figures.   Controlled levitation of a rigid body with an unlimited rotation range is an original result of this project and allows the levitation system to be used as a spherical motor.  User trials were carried out to validate the use of the fingertip interface for haptic interaction with textured surfaces.  The horizontal translation motion range of the coil array magnetic levitation system can be scaled to any area by adding more coils.  The typical vertical motion range with the present coils is 50 mm.  The planar coil array magnetic levitation haptic interface system can be used as a combined, co-located 6D haptic and 3D graphic interface system by placing a thin 3D display on top of the coil array so that a simulated physical environment can be displayed in the same space as the instrument grasped by the user for haptic interaction.  Simulations including rigid-body motion, surface texture and friction, and soft deformations were implemented for this system.  These simulation elements can be combined to model basic medical procedures such as cutting, palpation, and intubation. A schematic diagram of the co-located system and the implemented system with a deformable surface interactive environment are shown in the attached figures.
