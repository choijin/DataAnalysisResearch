<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research award supports fundamental research on rotary ultrasonic machining of titanium and its alloys in order to develop an innovative and cost-effective titanium drilling process for the nation's aerospace industry. Specifically, the research will develop a physics-based predictive model for cutting forces in drilling titanium with rotary ultrasonic machining and conduct experiments to verify the model, test the hypothesis that coolant-flow direction is the determining factor for surface roughness in titanium rotary ultrasonic machining, evaluate the feasibility of using cold air as a coolant to replace cutting fluids in titanium rotary ultrasonic machining, establish the relationship between the dominating tool-wear mechanism and machining conditions, measure the cutting temperatures, and quantify the damage to machined titanium parts caused by rotary ultrasonic machining and twist drilling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research results will provide knowledge and understanding to meet the critical need to develop more cost-effective titanium drilling processes for the nation's aerospace industry. A globally competitive aerospace industry will contribute to the nation's economy, and airplanes with better quality and lower manufacturing cost will benefit consumers and the society.  Research results will also benefit other industries where titanium is widely used. By replacing cutting fluids with cold air as a coolant, the research will have a positive impact on the environment. This collaborative research project features a unique collaboration among Kansas State University, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Argonne National Laboratory, and industry. This collaboration provides excellent synergy for project resources, ensures the relevance of the research to industry, and expedites technology commercialization. It will also positively impact engineering education at two universities, promote lifelong learning for industrial practitioners, and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research.</AbstractNarration>
