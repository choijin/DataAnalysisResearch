<AbstractNarration>This award helps support a workshop to explore the potential benefits of establishing a cyber-enabled virtual network for paleoclimatology.  The group's initial focus is on developing such an institute for researchers on the West Coast of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the lead investigator will provide participant support for approximately twenty scientists with expertise in paleoclimatology and related aspects of climate research to participate in presentations and discussions that examine the scientific strengths and weaknesses of establishing a virtual institute that ties researchers together.  The premise of the group's efforts is that "no single institution possesses the ideal combination of expertise required to meet all of the scientific challenges associated with the US Climate Change Research Program" so, they are looking to "establish alternative ways for scientists to collaborate and share information rapidly" as through a cyber-enabled virtual institute.  Some of the scientific themes that the group anticipates being of importance in the next few years involve ice sheet dynamics, ocean/atmospheric interactions, and regional hydrologic variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will include seasoned researchers, new investigators, and students.  In this manner, an open and lively exchange of views on the science and the concept of a virtual institute will be enabled.</AbstractNarration>
