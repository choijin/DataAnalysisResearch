<AbstractNarration>This BRIGE project addresses the widespread and pervasive problems of maintaining global competitiveness by increasing the number of engineering graduates, improving the representation of women and minorities in engineering, and understanding how to improve recruitment and retention of engineering students. Employing identity theory provides a unique perspective and a much needed understanding of our students. The goal of this research is to employ a mixed methods approach by collecting quantitative and&lt;br/&gt;qualitative data to better understand the multiple identities of our students and the factors that shape these identities.  The study includes freshman and senior STEM students at James Madison University as well as freshmen and senior students at four additional institutions with engineering programs by conducting interviews questionnaires and personal identity instruments. We are looking for significant breakthroughs to contribute to our basic understanding of our students? multiple identities as a means of also understanding what activities, experiences, circumstances, and settings shape their identities (particularly their identity as engineers). Apart from the findings that will contribute to our basic understanding of students, the ultimate deliverable will be a survey instrument, Engineer Identity Survey (EIS), interview protocol and questionnaires that could be used by engineering programs at various levels. The PI is well-positioned with a foundation of related work and strong early career motivation to pursue this research, publish and disseminate the research and findings. This BRIGE grant would provide a strong research foundation upon which the PI can pursue more engineering education research funding. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Need:  Despite a significant increase in initiatives, interventions, and efforts to recruit and retain more engineering students (certainly students underrepresented in engineering), the decline in engineering enrollment continues and there is a clear need to diversify the engineering student population.  Approach:  Recent research and some of our previous work suggest that studentsÆ identification with engineering plays a critical role in their decision to pursue engineering and to persist in engineering. During this effort, we examined the role of identity (i.e. the process of identifying with engineering, developing an engineer identity, and becoming an engineer) among engineering students through the lens of identity theory.  More specifically, we used a mixed-methods research approach (using surveys, questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, observations, etc.) to aid us in ultimately developing a valid and reliable instrument, Engineer Identity Survey (EIS), to measure the engineer identity across different contexts, settings, student populations, etc.  Benefits:  In providing insight into studentsÆ engineer identity formation and evolution, not only were we able to better understand how our engineering students develop their engineer identity and how this identity is shaped over time, but we were also able to gain insight into improving recruitment and retention strategies and practices.  This is particularly important for engineering students who are underrepresented in engineering such as women and minorities.  In addition to engineering students, other stakeholders and beneficiaries in this research include engineering educators, directors and coordinators of engineering diversity programs, engineering education researchers, engineering administrators, university admissions personnel, recruiters, student advisors, etc.  Outcomes:  To date, we have gained insight into how the engineer identity begins to form (i.e. via influences such as experiences and individuals), how the engineer identity transforms over time (i.e. strength and growth of the engineer identity over time), how the engineer identity differs across various student populations (i.e. persisters vs switchers, men vs women, students of varying academic levels, etc.).  Key implications for improving recruitment and retention can be made from the findings of this effort.    Deliverables:  A key deliverable of this research is the Engineer Identity Survey (EIS), which to date has been piloted with over 700 students at three engineering programs to assure validity and reliability.  In addition to the EIS, our research findings have been published and disseminated in a variety of venues.             Last Modified: 10/30/2013       Submitted by: Olga Pierrakos]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
