<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In many engineering applications, notions of complexity, order or dimension of a model can be expressed by the rank of a matrix, while prior information and model accuracy often correspond to convex constraints on this matrix. Parsimonious Modeling involves the computational problem of minimizing matrix rank subject to convex constraints. Examples include problems in system identification, model reduction, and Euclidean embedding, arising in control, signal processing, and machine learning. The rank minimization problem is known to be computationally intractable in general.  The work is inspired by the recently developed framework of compressed sensing for sparse signals. A preliminary work by the PI and her collaborators, points to a rich generalization of this theory from sparse vectors to low-rank matrices, showing that some classes of this hard problem can be solved efficiently. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research builds on advances in compressed sensing and its underlying math, as well as convex optimization. The program has three thrusts: (1) theoretical characterization of classes of rank minimization problems that can be solved efficiently, (2) development of efficient semidefinite programming algorithms for this problem, (3) a focus on applications of rank minimization (e.g., in system identification). This program combines practical impact with conceptual depth, unifying existing notions of parsimony (such as vector sparsity and matrix rank) as well as the computational methods to address them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will leverage extensive collaborations between pure mathematicians and engineers, and should motivate research in mathematics in areas not traditionally considered ?applied". Results and computational tools developed can be used by researchers in various application fields. Research from this project will be integrated with the PI's past work into a new project-driven graduate course at UW. Students at all levels will be engaged. A workshop and a mathematical problem solving competition is planned as part of UW's BRIDGE program for incoming women and minority freshman.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

With advances in sensing technologies and exascale computing, researchers in every engineering discipline are faced with major challenges in modeling, analyzing, and identifying behaviors from high-dimensional data. In this project, we developed theory and algorithms that help make these tasks possible despite highly incomplete and noisy information, by exploiting prior knowledge about model structure, where "structure" is defined broadly and includes common concepts such as sparsity, group-sparsity, low-rank matrix structure, and low-rank tensor structure.  Our work initiated low-rank matrix methods as a subarea in several disciplines; significant research effort has since been devoted to these methods and they have been employed in machine learning, signal processing, and increasingly in control and system identification.
