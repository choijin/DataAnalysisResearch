<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the Polytechnic University of New York entitled, "RET Site: Science and Mechatronics Aided Research for Teachers", under the direction of Dr. Vikram Kapila.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site will provide a professional development opportunity to 10 high school teachers per year (total of 30 teachers) in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  These teachers will work with and be mentored by Dr. Kapila and three senior personnel as they conduct inquiry-based, hands-on, engineering research in the exciting field of mechatronics during six-week long summer workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will benefit the teachers by reinforcing their science and math skills; enriching their STEM experience through exposure to real world engineering research; developing and honing their research, communication and presentation skills; and providing them opportunities to network with STEM educators.</AbstractNarration>

Each year, six-week long summer workshops were conducted in a collaborative environment consisting of 11 researchers and five engineering faculty. To advance discovery and learning, project team employed hands-on structured projects and prototype product development activities. A 35-item survey assessed teachers&rsquo; familiarity with mechatronics skills, concepts, and devices introduced during the training. Teachers&rsquo; self-perception with project topics improved from 1.83/4 average (pre) to 3.18/4 average (post). On pre- and post-project technical quizzes, teachers&rsquo; average was: 57.8% (pre) and 66.2% (post); yielding 14.5% improvement. Project teachers have made significant contributions to research on biomechanical fish locomotion, biomimetic sound-localization, damage detection in beams, a temperature-control instrument for creep test, etc. For example, under Dr. Kapila&rsquo;s guidance, Mr. Fisher and Ms. Geraldi&rsquo;10 and Mr. Bernhardt, Ms. Mallar, and Mr. Outerbridge&rsquo;11 worked with a graduate and an undergraduate student to develop a series of iPhone controlled robotics projects.<strong><em> </em></strong>To obtain qualitative feedback on project effectiveness, an external evaluator conducted the following activities: interviews of research supervisors, site visit to interview teachers and conduct observations in labs, and follow-up interviews with selected teachers.
