<AbstractNarration>URM: Environmental Biology in the Pacific Islands&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program, based at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, will significantly increase the number of Pacific Islanders pursuing bachelors and advanced degrees by recruiting and training promising students from the islands of Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianna Islands, and the U.S. Compact-of-Free-Association Micronesian states (Republic of Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, and Republic of the Marshall Islands) in modern approaches to environmental biology.  Research areas include: field ecological studies on marine ecosystems that are largely intact, as well as those that are badly damaged by invasive alien species and pollution; studies of both coastal and mountain biota, with emphases on invertebrate, vertebrate (esp. Hawaiian birds) and plant communities; biodiversity investigations using classical and molecular approaches; and species-focused research on island endemics.  Thirteen students will be trained each years, eight during summer-only research internships, plus five, selected from the summer interns, who will remain in the program throughout the year. Up to 45 students will be extensively trained throughout five years of the program.  Internships will be intimately tied to faculty-mentor laboratories for training in scientific research and preparation for graduate school, augmented by important cohort training in ?how to do science,? scientific writing, and oral presentations. Emphasis will be on one-on-one training by the mentor and others in her/his lab and student ?ownership? of a research project.  Interns will be guided to develop all aspects of an individual research project that will contribute to the solution of globally felt problems.  Additionally, the program will introduce interns to activities in governmental agencies and NGOs involved with environmental management and conservation. This URM will contribute to understanding biodiversity and conservation problems, with a particular focus on island ecosystems where impacts of modern society are heavy and where, for many, global climate change is not just a concept but a threat to the Islanders? way of life.  The program will return to the islands a group of native islanders exceptionally trained to recognize and resolve local problems and to serve as role models and educators for other young residents.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Seventy undergraduate students, nearly all members of underrepresented minority groups, the vast majority being from Hawaii and the Pacific Islands, have received extensive training and experience in environmental biological research. All returned to their home islands or states with an expanded appreciation of environmental problems, ways to evaluate the problems and potential solutions to many such problems. This information has been broadly shared by intern presentations at professional meetings and, perhaps more importantly, by discussions and presentations at the interns' home institutions and communities. Many of the interns have gone on to complete baccalaureate degrees.  A subgroup of summer interns were trained further during five academic-year programs. Nearly all of these students completed B.S. degrees, two have completed masters degrees and two now hold Ph.Ds.  At least four additional former interns are now enrolled in M.S. and Ph.D. programs, one of whom will receive her doctorate in Biological Sciences at Stanford University in the next academic year. One Micronesian intern completed a M.S. and is now on the faculty at the College of Micronesia, a school that had been lacking Micronesian biology faculty members to serve as genuine role models for students. One former intern who completed her B.S. degree is now the marine biology instructor at her alma mater, Kamehameha Schools, an outstanding school for native Hawaiian students. In addition to those who have become educators are many former interns who are serving their communities through local agencies and NGOs responsible for environmental protection. Finally, the publication of results of URM interns' research definitely impacts the field of environmental biology, adding new data within the field and often new methods for other scientists to utilize.
