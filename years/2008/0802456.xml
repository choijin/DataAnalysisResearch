    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative project between Butte College and California State University (CSU), Chico is designed to meet the growing interest in providing sustainability courses to students at two- and four-year institutions. This project is responsive to the increasing need for trained technicians in occupations related to green building design, installation, and monitoring. The project activities include: developing courses for on-line certification programs for sustainable energy auditors and green building inspectors; developing 2 + 2 + 2 green building systems courses across high school to community college to four year degree programs; and instituting a mentorship program between engineering students at CSU, Chico and Butte College students and between the two- and four-year college students and area high school students. Butte College's Minority Engineering Science Achievement (MESA) students are being recruited into this program. The project is focusing on new career and technical education programs in Green Building that are being coupled with workforce development programs in the region. Transfer and articulation to four-year engineering and construction management programs are being developed.</AbstractNarration>
