<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0801712&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Santa Clara University&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM: PHY - PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Young, Betty A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:  Detector Optimization for SuperCDMS and Other Experiments.&lt;br/&gt;                                     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations of galaxies, superclusters, distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation tell us that ~85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low-temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. With this powerful technology, operating deep underground in the Soudan mine in Minnesota, they have a world-leading effort with a projected sensitivity reach for 100 GeV/c2 WIMPs in CDMSII of a factor of eight beyond their best published limit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal from Santa Clara University requests base-program support which will allow for (a) the completion of the CDMSII experiment, which is fully constructed and acquiring science data at the Soudan Mine, (b) the testing and underground operation in the CDMSII infrastructure at Soudan of two new ?SuperTowers,? each comprised of six next-generation detectors, and (c) a modest effort of long-range R&amp;D to develop and test new hardware and detectors for possible follow-up experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concerning Broader Impacts, the technical development will push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors which have increasing applications. In addition, the SuperCDMS collaboration will continue its support of the public outreach program at Soudan, which hosts thousands of visitors each year for tours of the mine and laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
