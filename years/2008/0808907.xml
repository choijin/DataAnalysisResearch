<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0808907&lt;br/&gt;PI:          Ronald L Rivest&lt;br/&gt;Institution:          Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;Title:                       SGER: Cryptographic Techniques for Trustworthy Computation in Faulty &lt;br/&gt;                                and Non-Confining Execution Environments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this exploratory research is to find methods for conducting secure computation within insecure, imperfect, and possibly malicious environments. To realize this goal, two complementary approaches are being pursued.  The first one, inspired by the technique of ?proof carrying code,? is a  ?Proof-Carrying Data? framework that can address many of the difficulties with current approaches.  In this framework, the system designer prescribe the desired properties of the computation?s output, usually expressing a security or privacy property.  Proofs of these properties are attached to the data flowing through the system, and are mutually verified by the system?s components.  &lt;br/&gt;The second research focus is the investigation of means by which concrete realizations of computation can guarantee security properties despite inevitable risks.  The novelty in the method is that the assumptions on which the risks are based are enumeratable, so they can be checked to be sure they that are, ideally, minimal, realistic, and verifiable.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
