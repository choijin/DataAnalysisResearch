<AbstractNarration>This project serves financially needy, academically talented students through its Next Generation Tech Stars Scholarship program. The program assists promising students in completing associate degrees (with the option of transferring to a four-year program) in the closely aligned disciplines of Engineering Technology, Industrial Technology, and Computer Technology/Telecommunications Management. This project is built on strong partnerships with industry and is designed to increase the number of well educated and skilled employees in high demand technical areas. Diverse cohorts of full-time, talented students have been recruited who meet NSF-required and project-specific selection criteria. Extensive student support services exist, e.g., on-campus child care, tutoring, industry internships, and open/staffed computer laboratories. New services are: Success Coaching, mentoring, Loan-to-Own laptop computers, recognition of success, and academic, personal, and career assistance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objectives include providing 30 scholarships annually, and financial support from industry will ensure that no worthy Tech Star are left without the financial assistance needed for degree completion when the project ends. The Tech Stars Scholarship program fosters diversity. At least 40% of scholarships are awarded to African American students and 35% to female students. Through enhanced student support services and industry involvement, 100% of Tech Stars are retained through graduation. Of those who graduate, 100% who desire enrollment in a four-year institution are assisted with the transfer process. Career awareness and job placement assistance ensures that 100% of graduates who want to enter the workforce are employed in jobs related to their major within three months of graduation. The current CSEMS grant has already resulted in an on-time graduation rate of 87% for STEM students compared to 9-14% overall for the college.</AbstractNarration>
