<AbstractNarration>This research asks how one might design a network architecture to support three-dimensional virtual worlds as a dominant application platform.  The architecture is based on three key design principles. First, rather than being centralized or peer-to-peer, the architecture is based on federation: cooperative but not necessarily collaborative interaction between multiple parties.  This enables providers to enforce local administrative and security policies, yet requiring new support for discovery, messaging, and migration between and within domains.  Second, application communication is grounded in three-dimensional coordinate spaces: objects can only communicate after being introduced through proximity.  This geometric addressing decouples applications from their physical locations on hosts, and introduces interesting security protections from unwanted communication.  Third, by using this communication model, the architecture can directly interface with and connect the physical world, leading to new possibilities for virtual interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much as the Internet was designed with a layered communication model, this research designs a new layered approach for virtual worlds: from a high-level object layer providing a rich programming environment for immersive virtual worlds, to the narrow waist of geometry-based communication, and down to the underlying service layer that implements computation, storage, and communication mechanisms.  With backgrounds across networking, systems, and graphics, the investigators have been previously developing a highly expansible and personalizable virtual world system, Meru.  This new project will develop the network architecture necessary to enable the seamless interaction and interoperation between many different Meru-based virtual worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating virtual worlds is already a pressing issue and concern among providers. Research towards a unifying networked system architecture would improve these efforts and could lay the groundwork for a next-generation programming platform for the Internet. It would integrate the current divide between the logical, host-centric networks and the emerging sensor networks of tomorrow. By incorporating existing efforts towards building an open, scalable virtual world system, the research will have impact in all of the areas virtual worlds are already bringing change.  Fundamentally, virtual worlds, even more so than the  Internet, are a platform for inter-personal communication, affecting education, public services and planning, commerce, and social networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
