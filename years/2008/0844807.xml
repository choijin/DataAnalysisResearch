<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Award funds a project integrating research and education to explore and understand nanometer scale magnetic phenomena in complex materials, such as layered uniaxial magnets.  State-of-the-art low temperature magnetic imaging techniques will be used. Nanoscale magnetic imaging provides irreplaceable visual information of novel magnetic materials, which is crucial for scientific understanding and technological application. New materials with enhanced/emergent properties are critical for the advances of modern technology, such as ultra-high density magnetic recording devices, magnetoelectronics and high-efficiency motors and generators. Training of future material scientists is naturally integrated with the proposed research activities. Undergraduate and high school students will be involved in the proposed research via various summer programs at Rutgers. The education component of this proposal will explore a novel feedback mechanism developed at Rutgers to enhance effective teaching of physics to non-science majors. Future and current high school teachers will be exposed to contemporary material research activities proposed in this project via the Teacher Education Program at Rutgers University so that modern material science and technology can reach out to high school education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this CAREER project is to explore and understand novel nanoscale magnetic phenomena in complex materials, such as layered uniaxial magnets.  Low temperature nanoscale magnetic imaging techniques, including both magnetic force microscopy and spin polarized-scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy will be used to investigate magnetic domain structure, domain irreversibility and atomic scale domain walls.  The research is expected to establish a microscopic understanding of magnetic hysteresis phenomena in layered materials with a large uniaxial anisotropy.  Nanoscale magnetic imaging provides irreplaceable real space information of novel magnetic materials, which is crucial for scientific understanding and technological applications of nanoscale magnetism. New materials with enhanced/emergent properties are critical for the advances of modern technology. Training of future material scientists is naturally integrated to the proposed research activities. Undergraduate and high school students will be involved in the proposed research via various existing summer programs at Rutgers. The education component of this proposal will explore a novel feedback mechanism developed at Rutgers to enhance effective teaching of physics to non-science majors. Future and current high school teachers will be exposed to contemporary material research activities via the Teacher Education Program at Rutgers University so that modern material science and technology can reach out to high school education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the support of this grant, the PI has set up several cutting-edge microscopes that were used to investigate exotic properties of functional materials. Using these unique instruments, the PI has discovered many exciting mesoscopic scale magnetic phenomena in a few novel electronic materials beyond hard magnets.

Intellectual Merit of the supported research activities can be summarized by the following key accomplishments: (1) Direct observation of magnetic domains in layered magnets; (2) Direct confirmation of emergent magnetism and multiferroicity (coexistence of magnetism and ferroelectricity) in artificial materials synthesized by advanced thin film techniques;  (3) Discovery of emergent phenomena (e.g. magnetism) at the domain walls of topological defects in a novel multiferroic materials; (4) Direct visualization of cross-coupling between magnetism and electric dipole within domains; (6) discovery of unconventional phase transitions in novel electronic materials.

In summary, the results from this NSF support have made significant contributions on a wide spectrum of electronic and magnetic materials, ranging from layered chalcogenides, hard magnets to multiferroics. By developing various SPM techniques in extreme conditions, the PIÆs group has discovered emergent phenomena from atomic to mesoscopic scale. These results were reported in 14 peer-reviewed articles, including 2 in Nature Materials, 3 in PRL, 2 in Nano Letters, 1 in Nano Research, 1 in Adv. Func. Mater., 3 in PRB, and 2 in APL. URLÆs to these papers are available on the PIÆs homepage. One paper is being reviewed and a few more manuscripts are in preparation. The support from this grant results in 21 invited presentations, including invited talks in APS (2010), CNM user meeting (2011) and Gordon Research Conference (2012).  The broader impact of our work lies in the discoveries of various electronic and magnetic phenomena at atomic to meoscopic scales that go beyond the conventional understandings. Understanding and controlling mesoscopic phenomena such as domains and domain walls are critical to the enhanced properties or functionalities of new materials.  These results have made significant contribution to the coercivity mechanisms of layered hard magnets, emergent modulations due to competing microscopic interations, revealed a cross-coupling mechanism mediated by lattice instability in multiferroics, and demonstrated the mechanism of enhancing magnetoelectric coupling via critical fluctuation.   Besides these scientific accomplishments, the PIÆs group has been endeavoring to develop new SPM techniques or to push the SPM performance to extreme limits or in extreme environments, which is crucial for the success of the aforementioned achievements.  These new developments were disseminated through scientific publications as well as invited and contributed talks in various conferences and university seminars.  In collaboration with staff scientists of the Center for Nanoscale Materials at Argonne National Laboratory, the PI has implemented various advanced SPM techniques in their user facilities so that other facility users from the research community can benefit from the PIÆs SPM expertise more effectively. The PI established a strong international collaboration with Prof. BodeÆs group at University of W&uuml;rzburg (Germany).  Training and outreach activit...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
