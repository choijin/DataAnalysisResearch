<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims to produce fundamental knowledge about the molecular level mechanisms of atomic layer deposition (ALD). In particular, atomic layer deposition of metal oxide films from alkyl amide precursors and water on GaAs surfaces is studied. GaAs due to its intriguing surface chemistry provides a suitable system to test and further our understanding of the molecular level mechanisms and kinetic processes involved in the atomic layer deposition process. Furthermore, its increasing technological importance make such as study very timely as it aims to bridge a gap of fundamental knowledge in the literature. A comprehensive approach that includes both in-situ monitoring of the surface chemistry using infrared spectroscopy as well as extensive ex-situ analysis of the materials and interface properties is used during the research project.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. Graduate students from diverse backgrounds are trained in an interdisciplinary field, and a much needed interdisciplinary laboratory course in materials characterization is introduced to complement an existing lecture course in the physics of surfaces and interfaces. Undergraduate students from disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as participants of the McNair program at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, are mentored during a summer research program with the goal to encourage their interest in scientific careers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
