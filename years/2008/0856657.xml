<AbstractNarration>Science Partnership for Undergraduate Recruitment, Retention, and Success (SPURRS) is increasing the quantity, quality, and diversity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates through recruiting, retaining, and graduating students, especially students from traditionally underserved groups. The goal of SPURRS is to increase over a five year period the number of STEM majors and graduates by 20%. The objectives are to: (1) Recruit at least 50 STEM majors from populations of undecided incoming college students and from populations of high school students with potential who may not have considered themselves college bound, (2) Increase the retention of students entering STEM majors and minors from 32% to 40%, and (3) Increase five and six year STEM degree graduation rates from 19.1 and an estimated 20.2% respectively to 24 and 25% respectively. At Angelo State University, the difference between the overall percentage of students majoring in STEM fields and the overall percentage of STEM degrees awarded is attributed to the low retention of students in STEM majors. Less than 40% of incoming STEM students who are retained at the university remain in a STEM major. Because this attrition occurs during their first year, it is hypothesized that this may be a result of difficulty in, and the lack of preparation for, the introductory course sequences in these majors. The SPURRS initiative is investigating the efficacy of instituting 'First Year Experience' cohorts specific to STEM majors through student participation in a 'Critical Thinking Boot Camp' designed to provide students with the basic training in skills and strategies for succeeding in introductory STEM coursework. The Boot Camp is being followed by a first semester Critical Thinking Seminar, mandatory tutoring for introductory sequence STEM coursework, and a Peer Mentoring program. In addition, students retained through to graduation are participating in career and graduate school preparation. The project is also investigating undergraduate learning in introductory science courses to better understand the driving factors behind successful student transition from high school to college. The SPURRS program is being proactive in its efforts to provide support for students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields including a large number of first-generation college students, many of whom are Hispanic. The partnership with San Angelo Independent School District and the Education Service Center Region XV also serves as a model for recruiting and transitioning underserved and underrepresented students into 4-year STEM degrees.</AbstractNarration>

It became evident that our first objective would be quite difficult to assess early in the life of the program.  Without surveying area high school students regarding their career goals prior to their committing to attending ASU, it was difficult if not impossible to determine if students were interested in STEM majors.  An ASU change in policy now requires all students to declare a major upon entry.  However, each year since 2008 (pre-grant) we have enrolled an average of 46 more STEM majors over baseline while non-STEM enrollment has actually declined by an average of 124.  Due to the difficulty in assessing this objective, the grant focus emphasis was weighted to objectives 2 and 3.    Students enrolled in the SPURRS program represent the "middle tier" of students enrolling at ASU.  These were students who, with support, had the potential to succeed in STEM majors. The primary means of improving retention and graduation rates involved a three pronged approach: 1) A pre-semester STEM freshman orientation "boot camp" that introduced students to faculty expectations, provided support to improve critical thinking and science process skills, and introduced a peer and faculty support system for incoming STEM majors enrolled in the program; 2) A required (for the first 3 cohorts), semester-long critical thinking course that continued the support from the boot camp; and 3) Required peer tutoring and mentoring for freshmen SPURRS students.

At that time had we, had many SPURRS upperclassmen; to assist them in transitioning to post-graduation careers, we instituted research mini-grants for travel to scientific meetings or to support research conducted directly by SPURRS students.    Intellectual Merit: Prior to the grant, the difference between the overall percentages of students majoring in STEM fields and the overall percentage of degrees awarded was at least partly a result of the low retention of students in STEM majors. Although the one-year retention rate for first-time full-time freshmen who declare a major in a STEM field was better than the overall retention rate for the university, the retention of these students in STEM majors was markedly lower. Less than 40% of incoming STEM students who were retained at the university remained in a STEM major. Most of this attrition occurred during their first year.  Of the cohorts with students eligible for graduation (within 5 years), 35% have graduated and 50% of those in a STEM discipline.  The numbers for cohorts 4 and 5 should be higher given that we became much better at recruiting and mentoring in subsequent years.   In meeting the long term goal of better understanding the driving factors behind successful student transition from high school to college, we learned that having a support system in place from day one is critical.  ASU has used this information to require the freshmen orientation course of all incoming freshmen.  Peer mentors are assigned to the courses to help answer student concerns and provide additional support. Additionally, many STEM departments have instituted programs to involve lower&ndash;level undergraduates in research opportunities earlier in their career.    Broader Impact: The SPURRS model provided safety nets for students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, including a large number of first-generation college students, many of whom are Hispanic, and has increased their success in completing STEM degree programs.   Five year graduation rates for SPURRS specifically (35%) and for the institution overall (33%) exceed the expectations of the grant proposal.  Students graduating from SPURRS have entered the workforce in STEM careers and are attending graduate STEM programs in areas such as Nuclear Physics, Microbiology, and Wildlife Ecology.  The impact of the program is reflected in the success of these students and the role they will play in the future of STEM.
