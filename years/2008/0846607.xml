<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY.  Conjugated polymers are of tremendous scientific and technological importance for use in applications such as photovoltaics cells, light-emitting diodes and thin-film transistors.  The ability to modify the electronic properties of conjugated polymers through chemical synthesis allows for the optimizaton of their properties for specific applications.  However, iin spite of the large number of synthetically accessible conjugated polymers, the values remains an important goal in the field.  Among existing conjugated polymers, poly (benzobisazoles) are well suited for use in organic semi-conducting applications because they combine photoluminescence and efficient electron transport with excellent thermal stability.  Historically, fully conjugated poly (benzobisazoles) are insoluble in aprotic solvents, limiting their use.  Recently, the Jeffries-EL group has demonstrated that soluble poly (benzobisazoles) can be synthesized via an approach that allows for easy variation of the side chains.  This CAREER award will support efforts to (1) design and synthesize novel soluble poly (arylene benzobisazole) polymers, (ii) investigate the influence of polymer structure on the optical, electronic and physical properties of these materials, and (iii) foster interest in polymer science through an outreach effort targeting underrepresented students in the 8th - 12th grade.  this research will elucidate the relationship between polymer structures and electronic properties providing a rational basis for synthesizing conductive polymers with optimized properties for organic electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNIAL SUMMARY.  Conjugated polymers are being explored both academically and commercially for use in semi-conducting applications.  The motivation behind their use is the ability to make large area films using solution-processing techniques such as inkjet printing, which translates into a significant reduction in the cost of device manufacture.  This CAREER award will (i) support research intended to increase basic knowledge for designing conjugated polymers with optimized properties for use as "plastic" electronics (ii) provide interdisciplinary research experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students, and (iii) foster interest in polymer science through a creative outreach effort targeting underrepresented students in the 8th - 12th grade.</AbstractNarration>
