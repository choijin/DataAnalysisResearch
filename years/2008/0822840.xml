<AbstractNarration>This award, to Dr. Lisa C. Cliggett of the University of Kentucky, is to support an international, multi-disciplinary research workshop in Lusaka, Zambia. The workshop will bring together scholars who share a research focus on Southern Province, Zambia, where scientists have been doing research for over half-a-century. The workshop participants will include anthropologists, sociologists, geographers, ecologists, and economists, from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, South Africa, Japan, and Zambia. The participants comprise both senior scientists who have conducted research in Zambia for as long as six decades and graduate students at the start of their careers. The workshop is thematically organized around longitudinal population dynamics, ecological change, agricultural trends, political integration, culture, and responses to social stress such as relocation and epidemics. The goal of the workshop is to take stock of what has been accomplished and to plan for the most urgent future questions, so that research will be focused and efforts not duplicated needlessly. The workshop's accomplishments will be summarized in planned publications.</AbstractNarration>
