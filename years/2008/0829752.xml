<AbstractNarration>EMT/BSSE: A Controller for Autonomous Systems&lt;br/&gt;Based on Principles of Vertebrate Neuromodulation&lt;br/&gt;Robots and autonomous systems require some level of supervision and tuning of&lt;br/&gt;parameters to fit a particular domain. However, biological organisms have the ability to&lt;br/&gt;respond quickly and appropriately in an ever-changing world. Because this adaptability&lt;br/&gt;is so critical for survival, all vertebrates have sub-cortical structures, which comprise the&lt;br/&gt;neuromodulatory systems. These systems regulate fundamental behaviors and set the&lt;br/&gt;organism?s internal and behavioral states. This research involves designing a controller&lt;br/&gt;for autonomous systems that is modeled after the vertebrate neuromodulatory system.&lt;br/&gt;This neurally inspired model enables robots to approach the behavioral complexity and&lt;br/&gt;flexibility associated with higher order animals, and would be a major improvement in the&lt;br/&gt;design of autonomous systems.&lt;br/&gt;Neuromodulators in the nervous system signal environmental changes to the nervous&lt;br/&gt;system that alter neuronal responses in such a way that the organism can respond&lt;br/&gt;quickly and accurately to these changes. There are separate neuromodulators that&lt;br/&gt;respond to threats, reward anticipation, novelty, and attentional effort. However, each of&lt;br/&gt;these neuromodulatory systems have a similar effect, that is, to cause an organism to be&lt;br/&gt;decisive when environmental conditions call for such actions, and allow an organism to&lt;br/&gt;be more exploratory when there are no pressing events. A design strategy, based on&lt;br/&gt;principles of the vertebrate neuromodulatory system, is used to control the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;autonomous robot systems. This research shows that such a system responds&lt;br/&gt;appropriately and adapts to environmental changes without human intervention.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, this research shows that a controller, which is based on neuromodulation, can&lt;br/&gt;be extended to any system in which an agent is situated in a dynamic, unconstrained&lt;br/&gt;environment.</AbstractNarration>
