<AbstractNarration>Dr. Steven Majewski (University of Virginia) and his team will undertake a suite of five major experiments that will both expand the census of known Milky Way halo tidal streams and exploit halo streams for the understanding of galaxy evolution, structure formation and dark matter (DM) on galaxy-scales.  These experiments are (1) A study of the chemistry of halo tidal streams using echelle spectroscopy of stream stars at both optical and near-infrared wavelengths to verify the discovery of a metallicity gradient in the leading arm of the Sagittarius stream, (2) A study of the 3-D motions of stream stars contained in a ground-based proper motion survey of 54 near-equatorial Kapteyn Selected Area fields to derive stream orbits and constrain the shape and strength of the Milky Way potential, (3) Undertake a pilot study with the Green Bank Telescope of a sample of M-type giant stars in tidal streams to look for bright water masers that can be used for precision astrometry of tidal streams using the Very Large Baseline Array,  (4) A spectroscopic follow-up to the photometric Grid Giant Star Survey, which has already identified a number of previously known and newly discovered halo substructures across both hemispheres of the sky, and (5) More fully characterize the spatial and radial velocity distributions of G and K giant stars in what look to be "classical" stellar halos discovered around the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds by this research group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stellar component of our Galactic halo provides an important test-bed for theories of galaxy formation. The present "concordance", hierarchical DM cosmologies predict the presence of stellar streams as tidal remnants of accreted sub-halos. Finding and characterizing these streams thus provides crucial information to constrain the nature of the Cold DM-predicted merging history. These streams are also highly sensitive dynamical probes constraining the shape, strength and lumpiness of the halo of the Milky Way, and provide key insights into the chemical evolution of galaxies. A key aspect of this research is that it has been fueled primarily by student leadership and contributions at both the undergraduate and graduate level.  Each experiment is being led or will be led by a different graduate student as part of their Ph.D. dissertation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the origin of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, and, in particular, on its outermost parts -- its halo.  This is one region of the Galaxy where the nature of its origin can still be read from fossil evidence still extant in the spatial, kinematical, and chemical distributions of its stars(the kinematical and spatial distributions of stars in the inner Galaxy have been substantially transformed by contingent processes that are more difficult to infer from observations of present conditions).  Much of the Milky Way is presumed to have formed by the accretion of smaller stellar systems --- star clusters and dwarf galaxies.  In the outer halo, these cannibalized systems leave behind stellar streams that more or less trace the orbits of their succumbed parent objects.  Observations of these streams can tell us the nature of the cannibalized systems -- their state of chemical evolution, their original orbit, their fractional contribution to the make-up of the Milky Way.  They also tell us about the distribution of the mass in our Galaxy, which affects the orbits of satellites and streams.   This project used five separate avenues to explore this halo substructure, as described in the Abstract at Time of Award.  Each avenue was led by a different Ph.D. dissertation student.  In all seven graduate students (three women) and several undergraduate or post-baccalaureate researchers (two women) at UVa participated in this project, and were trained in all aspects of astronomical research.  Five graduate students received their PhD and moved on to postdoctoral research positions (two of them prize fellowships, and one is now a faculty member); the two final PhDs will be awarded in the coming year or so.  The research resulted in the publication of 31 peer-reviewed articles and two dozen conference abstracts or proceedings.   Among the outcomes of this project were the chemical characterization of stars in several halo substructures, including the Sgr stream and TriAnd structures previously discovered by our team.  We also used proper motions and radial velocities to measure the kinematics of stars in several tidal streams (Virgo, Anticenter) and satellite galaxies (Sagittarius, Bootes III, Carina), including two (Sagittarius, Carina) that are currently known to be in the throes of being cannibalized.  From the dynamics of these satellite cores, we gleaned new insights into the distribution of dark matter in these tidally disrupting systems.   We have developed new techniques for tracking halo substructures using M and K giant stars, for purifying these samples by eliminating foreground dwarf star contaminants, and for determining their distributions of 3-D position and velocity.  Using the positions and velocities we have tracked the extensive Sagittarius stream, and, using those data, derived a new measurement of the mass and shape of the dark matter halo of the Milky Way.  We find that it is lozenge-shaped, but, surprisingly, oriented perpendicular to the Galactic disk.  We attempted to exploit the high precision astrometric capabilities of radio astronomy to improve significantly the ability to measure transverse motions of M giant stars in the Sagittarius stream, but, to our surprise, could not find any radio (maser) sources among our viable candidates.  However, M giants continue to be a valuable stream tracer we have exploited to identify new substructures, including several near the Sun.  Exploring these substructures chemically has enabled us to derive rough estimates on the fractional contributions of halo stars derived from accretion versus those formed in the Milky Way itself, either in the halo or kicked out from the disk.  In a separate spectroscopic study of an extensive, two-hemisphere catalog of K giant stars we created, we used Doppler velocities and chemistry to identify stars in the disk of our Galaxy that were stripped from the omega Centauri system, showing that it is likely the remnant of a dwarf...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
