<AbstractNarration>Unlike most bioinformatics data, such as DNA sequences and protein&lt;br/&gt;structures, pathways show the interactions of different bio-chemical&lt;br/&gt;entities. Thus, each entity or subpathway can have a function in its&lt;br/&gt;pathway that the pathway can not realize without it. Formulating these&lt;br/&gt;functions presents exciting computational challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops algorithms for efficient and accurate&lt;br/&gt;computational analysis of pathways. The first step in achieving this&lt;br/&gt;goal is to build a mathematical model for functions of pathways and&lt;br/&gt;subpathways. This proposal defines the function of a subpathway as its&lt;br/&gt;contribution to the steady state of the entire pathway. Computing this&lt;br/&gt;contribution is a difficult problem especially for gene regulatory&lt;br/&gt;pathways.  Existing methods can compute this for metabolic pathways,&lt;br/&gt;but they do not scale to even medium sized gene regulatory&lt;br/&gt;pathways. This proposal develops efficient methods for computing&lt;br/&gt;function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding the subpathway that has a desired function is a challenging&lt;br/&gt;problem. There is no clear way of searching for subpathways with&lt;br/&gt;desired functions using existing tools. This proposal develops&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for searching subpathways with desired function.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal takes this one step further, and develops mathematically&lt;br/&gt;sound algorithms for comparing two pathways so that the entities that&lt;br/&gt;map are functionally, homologically and topologically similar.  This&lt;br/&gt;proposal also explores feature and reference-based index structures&lt;br/&gt;for biological pathway databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on the project can be found at the project web&lt;br/&gt;page:&lt;br/&gt; http://bioinformatics.cise.ufl.edu/</AbstractNarration>

The methods we have developed extended beyond biological networks at the molecular level to ecological networks, food-webs, phylogenetic trees, and social networks.   The project supported training of nine PhD and one MS students towards their degrees. This project also helped in training of two post doctoral, three undergraduate students by having them participate in solving the  problems considered within its  scope.   The PI has developed a new graduate/undergraduate level research course. The PI has integrated the problems considered in this project in that course and in the graduate level boninformatics course.
