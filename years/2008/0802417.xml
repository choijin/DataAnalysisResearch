<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project, led by the University of Maine at Machias (UMM) with partners in five other colleges and universities and an extended community of GST educators, is designed to meet the growing demand for workers skilled in geospatial technologies (GST) in Maine. The approach includes developing educational programs that are more accessible and applicable to the needs of a rural workforce and increasing the number of students enrolling in courses, receiving two-year degrees and certificates, and pursuing further higher education. The model for GST education takes into account the lack of access to high-speed Internet and computing capacity in rural areas and the limited enrollment in rural community colleges across the state. This project is filling important gaps in understanding the educational needs of the rural geospatial workforce, particularly the skills needed by ancillary users of GST in government, natural resource conservation, and economic development. Information obtained from the workforce study is being used to inform the development and testing of curriculum, program structure and instructional methods for technical education that blend the best of distance education and on-site, inquiry-based, service learning. This project is demonstrating new modes of cooperation among institutions of higher education to meet the needs of the rural geospatial workforce nationally. Through outreach via the National Consortium for Rural Geospatial Innovations in America, this project serves as a model for GIS education in rural regions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, led by the University of Maine at Machias (UMM) with partners in five other colleges and universities and an extended community of educators, consisted of five initiatives related to education in geospatial technology (GST) which includes mapping software, map analysis tools, GPS, and related technologies.   Initiative 1. Workforce study: In collaboration with labor and economics experts, we conducted research on geospatial technology in the Maine workforce, focusing on users of the technology in non-geospatial fields. The workforce study was conducted in 2008 and 2009, including surveys and focus group interviews, culminating with a Geospatial Workforce Summit in April 2010. Results of the study and Workforce Summit sessions are at: http://gis.maine.edu/workforce_summit.htm.  This study, revealed that Maine's geospatial workforce includes large numbers of older workers nearing retirement, and small-scale governments and businesses need GST but don't have capacity. We now know there is very strong demand for training among workers who use GST in their jobs, and we urgently need to be ready to replace those in the field who will retire in the next decade.  Initiative 2. New models for GST education:  - UMM and Washington County Community College established a shared that provides three pathways for GST education, including an associate's degree (including tuition savings), certificate, and minor options for students in four-year programs. The curriculum is keyed to local workforce needs. Courses are offered in hybrid format combining online education with the support of face-to-face instruction, appealing to a distributed rural audience.  Before this project, Washington County, Maine's most rural and impoverished region, had little capacity for digital mapping. Thanks to a trained workforce, now all of the county's tax maps are digitized and many towns and local agencies have adopted digital mapping to help with decision making. The county economic council and state public health officials are now engaging interns from our program. We've seen similar changes for the Passamaquoddy Tribe due to training in our program.  - Southern Maine Community College expanded their existing program, focusing on marine mapping.

They have also provided leadership on the workforce study and K12 initiatives.  Initiative 3. Proactive marketing/ recruitment strategies: Early in the project, it became apparent that Maine lacked leadership and unity in efforts to provide GST education to primary and secondary students and their teachers. Therefore, we adopted a stronger-than-planned focus on K12 education under the leadership of UMM and USM, which has led to several additional activities that had not been part of the original proposal. These include:  - Close collaboration with the Maine Department of Education and other partner on projects and planning - A K-12 track for the annual conference of GST educators - Workshops, events, fiel...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
