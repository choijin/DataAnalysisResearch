<AbstractNarration>Kohn&lt;br/&gt;0807347&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The first two thrusts of this project are topics at the&lt;br/&gt;interface between mathematics, physics, and materials science,&lt;br/&gt;namely (a) modeling the evolution of a crystal surface below the&lt;br/&gt;roughening temperature, and (b) designing new schemes for&lt;br/&gt;"cloaking" regions of space from electromagnetic measurements.  A&lt;br/&gt;third thrust lies at the boundary between mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;finance, namely (c) examining the impact on markets of&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous beliefs or "irrational investors."  Concerning (a):&lt;br/&gt;the PI seeks a unification of two widely-used but apparently&lt;br/&gt;distinct approaches -- one based on step dynamics, the other&lt;br/&gt;using a fourth-order partial differential equation.  Concerning&lt;br/&gt;(b): the PI continues his recent work on a&lt;br/&gt;change-of-variable-based cloaking scheme; in particular he&lt;br/&gt;explores the design of "near-cloaks," obtained using regular&lt;br/&gt;rather than singular changes of variables, at finite frequency. &lt;br/&gt;Concerning (c): the PI explores how the heterogeneity of&lt;br/&gt;investors' beliefs can lead in some settings to speculation and&lt;br/&gt;market "bubbles."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project addresses topics where mathematics can have&lt;br/&gt;great impact on other areas of science.  Thrust (a) -- involving&lt;br/&gt;the evolution of a crystal surface -- addresses a core topic in&lt;br/&gt;materials science, of great importance for the design and&lt;br/&gt;manufacture of electronic devices.  Moreover, its goal is the&lt;br/&gt;linkage of models with different length and time scales -- a&lt;br/&gt;recurring issue in many areas of modern science.  Successful&lt;br/&gt;treatment of this example establishes a paradigm that could also&lt;br/&gt;be useful in other settings.  Thrust (b) -- involving schemes for&lt;br/&gt;"cloaking" regions of space -- addresses a current frontier in&lt;br/&gt;optics.  If the proposed cloaking schemes can be realized in&lt;br/&gt;practice, they will provide a means for making objects difficult&lt;br/&gt;to "see" using, for example, radar.  But the PI's focus is not on&lt;br/&gt;device design; rather it is on the fundamental correctness of a&lt;br/&gt;specific "cloaking" scheme recently proposed by other&lt;br/&gt;investigators.  Thrust (c) -- involving of heterogeneous beliefs&lt;br/&gt;or "irrational investors" -- addresses a central problem of&lt;br/&gt;modern economics.  Real-world markets are complicated, but many&lt;br/&gt;of their key features can be understood using simple models.  The&lt;br/&gt;recent "internet bubble" is a reminder that, even in the most&lt;br/&gt;efficient markets, the market price of an asset can greatly&lt;br/&gt;exceed its intrinsic value.  The PI explores models in which this&lt;br/&gt;type of behavior is explained by the heterogeneity of investors'&lt;br/&gt;beliefs.</AbstractNarration>

Early areas of focus included (1) the evolution of crystal surfaces, and (2) analyzing schemes for "cloaking" regions of space from electromagnetic measurements. Over time the PI identified and pursued additional scientific opportunities, including (3) wrinkling patterns in thin elastic sheets, and (4) membrane metamaterials. The project also had a secondary thrust related to finance, specifically (5) how the heterogeneity of investors' beliefs can lead to speculation.  (1) CONCERNING THE EVOLUTION OF CRYSTAL SURFACES: The conventional approach uses a differential equation for the height of the surface as a function of space and time. The PI's work with Hala Al Hajj Shehadeh and Jonathan Weare (Physica D 240, 2011, 1771-1784) showed that other approaches can also be fruitful. One uses a discrete model for the motion of steps on a crystal surface, looking for a similarity solution that represents its stable large-time asymptotics. A second approach involves a differential equation for the slope as a function of height and time. These are related: the step motion law is a finite-difference  scheme for the differential equation.  (2) CONCERNING CLOAKING: The PI's work with Daniel Onofrei, Michael Vogelius, and Michael Weinstein (Comm Pure Appl Math 63, 2010, 973-1016) addressed a cloaking scheme proposed by Pendry, Schurig, and Smith in 2006, identifying a previously-unappreciated weakness.

It also showed how this difficulty can be overcome, by using a lossy layer at the inner edge of the cloak.  (3) CONCERNING WRINKLING PATTERNS IN THIN ELASTIC SHEETS: Stress-induced patterns in thin sheets are very familiar: our skin wrinkles and our clothes wrinkle; leaves, flowers, and hanging drapes have folds. When such patterns are observed, it is often unclear whether their geometry is due to elastic energy minimization, or due instead to the detailed history of growth or loading. To address this question, it is natural to explore the character of the elastic-energy-minimizing patterns.  This topic fits within the framework of energy-driven pattern formation, a current frontier in the calculus of variations. A central theme is the identification of energy scaling laws, which show how the minimal energy depends on the thickness of the sheet and other physical parameters. A key step is the development of geometry-independent lower bounds, showing that a particular scaling law is optimal in the sense that no pattern can do better.  The PI completed several projects in this area. One, with Peter Bella (J Nonlin Sci 24, 2014, 1147-1176) concerned "metric-driven wrinkling," a model for the intricate folding patterns sometimes seen in leaves and flowers.

By focusing on energy scaling laws and geometry-independent lower bounds, the PI's work has helped explain "why" elastic energy minimization leads to the development of wrinkling patterns.  (4) CONCERNING MEMBRANE METAMATERIALS: This term comes from the recent physics literature, which has explored the design of structured, flexible walls that can reflect sonic vibration. The physics literature showed that such walls exist, but it offered only a relatively crude explanation of how and why they work. Jens Jor...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
