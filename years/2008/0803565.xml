<AbstractNarration>Robotics is currently at the forefront of technologies with recognized potential for impacting quality of human life. In response to the large need for personalized one-on-one care for the growing populations of elderly individuals and those with special cognitive and social needs throughout life, great strides must be made in the domain of human-robot interaction (HRI) in order to bring robotics into such application domains in human everyday life. This interdisciplinary project identifies a specific set of HRI research questions in socially assistive robotics, the study of robotic systems capable of providing help through social rather than physical interaction. The research focus is on two key issues: (1) the role of the robot's physical embodiment in the interaction; and (2) the use of expressive embodied communication and user modeling toward personalized time-extended assistive interaction. A specific consideration is given to interactions under the challenges of socio-communicative heterogeneity and deficits. A novel assistive robot control architecture is developed, based on multi-modal perception, embodied expression and communication, and on-line user modeling, implemented in three different types of real-world socially assistive systems. To give a realistic context to the research, the experimental testing and evaluation are performed with children drawn from a typical population and a population with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), a family of disorders that have already been identified as amenable to technological, and in particular robotic, intervention and therapy. A key contribution of the research lies in the unified and tightly integrated end-to-end approach that jointly studies embodiment and multimodal expressive communication, grounded in data from hypothesis-driven experiments, and the development and use of novel signal processing and user modeling methods for human-machine interaction design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, by its very nature, aims to impact the large and growing population affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders. With the support of the large and unique corpus of data that will be collected and analyzed, the expected scientific impact will go well beyond novel insights toward a better understanding of the fundamentals of HRI and its relevance for diverse user populations and for socialization of children with ASD. In addition to the basic research, two complementary educational outreach programs broaden the impact of the work: (1) a novel K-12 outreach and teacher training program specifically aimed at special education through the use of robotics for teaching STEM topics; and (2) undergraduate research training and pipelined role-modeling from pre-university to undergraduate to graduate students. The education programs dovetail with the research plan, resulting in integrated activities involving all participants in the research team.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was aimed at advancing the field of socially assistive robotics (SAR) for use with children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with the goals of developing computational and robotics methods that have the potential to aid in ASD detection, intervention, and therapy.  The rate of ASD diagnosis in the US has quadrupled in 25 years; it increased from 1 in 150 to 1 in 68 children during the lifetime of the grant.  The need for human-centered technologies that can aid with ASD screening and treatment is substantial.     If an autonomous robot is to effectively interact with a child, it must be aware of the child's behavior, and produce timely, contingent, and socially appropriate behavior in response. This becomes a greater challenge in playful and unstructured interactions involving children. To achieve these goals, the project developed and implemented socially assistive robotics algorithms and social interaction frameworks that result in a positive interaction for the child.  Over the lifetime of the grant, the intellectual merit of the grant included the development of multiple SAR systems, their evaluation  with children with ASD, and the production of a large corpus of data, results, and insights that aid both the ASD and robotics research communities.     One of the major research activities of the project was the development of a SAR system capable of interacting with a child through movement, gesture, sounds, and blowing bubbles. Different types of robot behaviors and different robot embodiments were compared. In particular, contingent behaviors (responding to the childÆs actions) were compared to random behaviors (the same behaviors executed not in response to the childÆs actions).   Children with ASD demonstrated a lack of interest in the random robot compared to the contingent one.  The project compared a humanoid robot, a non-humanoid box-like robot, and a toy, all capable of similar behaviors.  The results showed that children with ASD preferred the robots over the toy, but they had varied preferences between the two robots.  A major outcome of the project was the finding that childrenÆs preferences were based on whether they perceived the robot to be an agent (acting on its own volition) or a toy (repeating a fixed set of actions).  Those who perceived the robot (humanoid or not) as an agent displayed more desirable social behaviors (eye gaze, pointing, initiating play, vocalizations and verbalizations, even empathy), while those who perceived the robot as a toy were less social. This finding suggests that SAR has the potential to appeal to a variety of children, an important feature since ASD is a spectrum disorder.  Another major research activity was the development of an algorithm for automatically classifying children who behaved in typical versus atypical (usually asocial or antisocial) ways around the robot.  The algorithm uses the way children move around the robot and parent and can be used in an anonymous way.  This insight is promising because it indicates that the complex process of screening for ASD can benefit from automation in order to both speed up and enhance the diagnostic process.  Finally, the project also developed a SAR system capable of playing Simon Says with a child, and using graded cueing, a strategy from rehabilitation, to provide a personalized amount of feedback and coaching to each child based on their performance and rate of progress.  The robot was shown to be more effective and less frustrating than the alternative version not capable of customizing the feedback.     The broader impact of the project are a natural result of its focus on improving the lives of the large and growing population of individuals with ASD.  The developed algorithms, systems, and user study results all serve to inform the development of future human-centered technologies for ASD screening, intervention, and therapy.  They also introduce an opportunity to use interactive robotics technology ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
