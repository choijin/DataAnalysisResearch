<AbstractNarration>This project address an important, and unresolved question in Earth evolution, i.e. did the eruption of the Siberian Large Igneous Province (LIP) a.k.a. Siberian Traps cause the Permo-Triassic extinction? In reality there are two questions at the heart of this proposal; what causes flood basalts and do flood basalts cause extinctions? These questions have been the subject of active research for several decades. One of the unique aspects of this project is that both are addressed simultaneously by an international team of experts whose goal is to gain an in-depth understanding of this LIP from its origin to both short-and long-term effects on Earth systems. The PIs will use a large suite of techniques: geochemistry, geothermometry, paleomagnetics, seismology, geodynamics, paleontology, and climate modeling to achieve their goal. Specifically, the PIs will: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; create high-precision eruption time scales for the entire volcanic succession, thus obtaining flux rates; &lt;br/&gt;&gt; quantify the volatile loads of the igneous rocks including lavas, intrusives, and in particular the voluminous tuffs; &lt;br/&gt;&gt; quantify volatile release from country rocks; &lt;br/&gt;&gt; begin to map the crustal and upper-mantle structure beneath the region using existing seismic data and geodynamical modeling; &lt;br/&gt;&gt; study the climatic consequences of sulfur injection and buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide; and &lt;br/&gt;&gt; continue detailed studies of the end-Permian extinction, using paleontology, stable isotope geochemistry, and geochronology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI team consists of scientists from 7 different countries. A central repository will be created for samples obtained under this project. Information will be maintained on the web and material made available to other scientists. A documentary film producer associated with the National Geographic Corporation will be in the field with the PIs gathering footage for a film about the project. Additional coverage is will be provided through the American Museum of Natural History?s Science Bulletins, short films about current research that are shown at the AMNH and distributed to over 40 science centers and museums around the world. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Siberian large igneous province is among the largest volcanic eruptions in Earth history, and is approximately coincident with the Earth?s largest extinction that defines the Permian/Triassic boundary.  The major goals of this project were first to determine whether there was a causal relationship between the magmatic events and the extinction and, if so, what the causal mechanism might be.  The deep earth processes that created this large igneous province are not well understood nor, before this project, did we have an accurate and precise chronology for the entire eruptive sequence. Gaining understanding of this important event in Earth history required the integration of many disciplines, as well as extensive field work in difficult circumstances.   We proposed a multidisciplinary field and laboratory study of the ca. 251-252 million-year-old Siberian large igneous province and its effect on the chemistry of the oceans, atmospheres, and climate, and to evaluate its relationship to the end-Permian mass extinction. The international project involved 14 principal investigators from the fields of geodynamics, seismology, geochronology and isotope geochemistry, petrology, atmospheric chemistry, paleoclimatology, structural geology, and paleontology.  At MIT, work focused on geodynamics (Hager) and seismology (Rondenay).  The geophysical component of this project involved geodynamic modeling and seismic characterization of the Siberian Platform and West Siberian Basin to help better constrain the origin of the Siberian Flood Basalts.  The Geodynamical component had two main thrusts. Hager's major activity at the beginning of the project was participating in the 2008 field trips on the Kotuy River and to the Guli intrusives. Exposure to field observations, and deep discussions with the participating geologists, are essential in understanding the geodynamical processes to be modeled. Hager learned a tremendous amount about the traps while in the field.  In addition, Hager's skills as an expedition canoeist made it possible to visit more outcrops than would have been possible otherwise, including collecting one of two definitive samples for dating the onset of eruption, as reported by Burgess and Bowring (2015):  252.24 +/- 0.12 million years before present.  Comparison with the time of the beginning of the mass extinction, 251.94 +/- 0.04 million years before present, shows that the eruption of the Siberian Flood Basalts predated the extinction by a short interval and therefore could have caused the end-Permian mass extinction.  Hager also tracked down a new higher resolution gridded gravity data set from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) that is a substantial improvement over that used in preparing the proposal. He obtained new high resolution spherical harmonic expansions of gravity (EGM08) and topography (from NMA) that would enable the calculations of isostatic gravity anomalies maps. These maps would provide vital constraints on geodynamical processes.             Last Modified: 10/25/2017       Submitted by: Bradford H Hager]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
