<AbstractNarration>Dusty (complex) plasmas are four-component plasma systems that consist of ions, electrons, neutral particles, and the addition of a fourth species, charged microscopic particles or "dust". The charged dust, which is typically composed of micron- or nanometer-sized particles, fully interacts and self-consistently modifies the properties of the surrounding plasma. Once primarily focused on astrophysical phenomena such as planetary rings or interstellar dust, the growth of laboratory studies of the role of charged microparticles in plasmas has offered a unique opportunity to observe plasma physics phenomena at the kinetic level. As a result, this field has become, over the last two decades, a robust scientific enterprise within the larger field of plasma science.&lt;br/&gt;In laboratory studies, the microparticles become charged through the collection of ions and electrons from the background plasma. This process alters the ion and electron distributions in the plasma. Furthermore, in the presence of flows in the plasma, particularly ion flows, not only are the charging conditions of the microparticles modified, but the flows alter the force balance that allows the microparticles to remain suspended in the plasma and provide a free energy source for heating the microparticles and driving instabilities. Thus, a continuing challenge to the understanding of dusty plasmas remains the interaction between the charged microparticles and the ions. However, a complete model of this ion drag force remains&lt;br/&gt;elusive and an essential piece of information for resolving the differences among the models "the ion drift velocity" is often difficult to obtain in many experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most studies of ion-dust interactions infer the ion flow either from collected currents on probes or by the response of the dust particles to an applied perturbation. In this investigation, the PI proposes to directly and independently measure both the ion flow and the dust response to determine the correlation between these two parameters. To accomplish this, the PI?s group will utilize its unique capabilities for optical measurements of microparticle velocities using two-dimensional and stereoscopic particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). PIV facilitates measurements of microparticle transport and the velocity&lt;br/&gt;space distribution function of the microparticle component of the plasma. Furthermore, through a collaboration with Prof. Earl Scime's group at West Virginia University and access to the Auburn Fusion Laboratory's dye laser system, the PI proposes to use laser induced fluorescence (LIF) to directly&lt;br/&gt;measure ion flow velocities in the plasma. Additionally, complementary studies using Prof. Robert Merlino's Dusty Plasma Device at the University of Iowa will allow a verification of the measurements performed at the PI's laboratory at Auburn University.&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, this proposed work offers a unique opportunity to address a number of outstanding questions of importance to the dusty plasma community. Specifically, this project will investigate two specific aspects of ion-dust interactions: (a) testing a proposed model of dusty plasma heating that&lt;br/&gt;occurs via an ion-dust two-stream instability; and (b) characterizing how ion flow acts as a trigger for the generation of dust acoustic waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research project has several opportunities to have a broader impact. The PI will continue to actively engage undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral scholars in hands-on research training. The PI has a successful track-record of student training and will continue encourage&lt;br/&gt;and include student participation in publications, national and international conferences, and laboratory outreach activities. Additionally, this work will support collaborative activities among different researchers within the dusty plasma community (e.g., at Auburn and Iowa) and establish a new&lt;br/&gt;partnership (with WVU), thereby strengthening the community of researchers involved in basic plasma science. Furthermore, this project will provide continuing support for many of the public outreach activities that have been undertaken by the PI's laboratory to illuminate the physics of plasmas and dusty plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;Funds for this award are provided by the Physics Division and the Office of Multi-disciplinary Activities within the NSF's Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate, Combustion, Fire, and Plasma Systems within NSF's Engineering Directorate, and the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences of the DoE within the context of the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plasmas are a novel, fourth state of matter &ndash; after solids, liquids, and gases.  They are a type of ionized (charged) gas consisting of free electrons, ions, and neutral atoms.  The plasma state is the most common state of matter in the visible universe.  Often, plasmas can become mixed with small pieces of solid particulate matter &ndash; such as ice or dust grains.  If the particulates become charged, they can interact with the background plasma and form a new type of plasma system that is known as a "complex plasma" or a "dusty plasma".  Naturally occurring phenomena such as SaturnÆs rings, comet tails, or planetary nebulae (i.e., star-forming regions) are all examples of astrophysical dusty plasmas.  For the last 20 years, researchers have been able to make dusty plasmas in the laboratory to study many of their properties.  We use these laboratory studies to give us new insights into some of the most fundamental processes in nature &ndash; e.g., how do stars and planets form.  As shown in the primary figure, laboratory dusty plasmas show many complex behaviors.  Researchers study both single particles and collective effects in these systems.  In this research project, our work focused on the thermodynamic properties of dusty plasmas.  Specifically, this research project made use of a three-dimensional imaging technique known as stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (stereo-PIV) to make measurements of the velocities of dusty plasma particles.  From the distribution of those velocities, it is possible to determine how energy is distributed in a dusty plasma.  We used a variety of different analysis techniques &ndash; measurements of wave properties and measurements of the velocity distributions &ndash; to demonstrate that the temperature of the dust component of the plasma is greater than the temperature of the background plasma particles.  This result confirms earlier investigations by other groups (including our own earlier measurements), but with greater precision and accuracy than any earlier measurements.  It also motivates our next research project &ndash; what is the physical mechanism that leads to the heating?  The scientific output of this project is measured in terms of publications and presentations.  This project led to 7 peer-reviewed journal articles, 2 conference proceedings, and 18 invited or contributed presentations at national and international conferences.   Additionally, our group also contributed to the broader public understanding of plasmas and plasma science through its participation in large public outreach events as part of Auburn UniversityÆs AU Explore event each spring and the American Physical Society &ndash; Division of Plasma PhysicsÆ TeacherÆs Day and Plasma Expo events each fall.
