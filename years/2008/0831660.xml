<AbstractNarration>Users' desires to share high definition audio and video around the home are driving the need for ever-increasing wireless bandwidth. Wideband radios, whose bandwidth spans hundreds of MHz to many GHz, can provide the solution. Recent years have shown significant work on the design and implementation of wideband radio transceivers that function for a single link. However, this is not enough; for wideband technologies to become practical, we need a wideband link to coexist with narrowband technologies with which it shares the spectrum (e.g., 802.11 a/b/g and WiMax), as well as operate efficiently in the presence of other wideband links producing successful wideband networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project presents FAWN, a Frequency Adaptive Wideband Network designed for wideband radios operating in the unlicensed spectrum. FAWN allows wideband transceivers to coexist with narrowband devices operating in the same frequencies, while forming a network of their own. &lt;br/&gt;FAWN also exploits frequency diversity, introducing novel autorate algorithms and MAC protocols that are frequency-aware. We will implement FAWN in wideband radio hardware and evaluate our design in a testbed of wideband nodes and narrowband interferers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research involves designing and building the first system architecture for wideband networks that coexist safely with unknown narrowband devices. The work also has an important broader impact because it enables the rich-media wireless home which is of great interest to the wireless industry, and is closely integrated with an educational plan that involves both graduate and undergraduate students, with special emphasize on women and underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
