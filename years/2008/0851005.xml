<AbstractNarration>The PI will investigate the role of turbulent heating in the origin and dynamics of the solar wind. He will use a combination of 'weak' and 'strong' turbulence theory to investigate the strength of the so-called "quasi-parallel cascade." The small scale waves produced by the quasi-parallel cascade have very high frequencies, and can cause perpendicular ion heating via a cyclotron resonance. The PI will also use high accuracy test particle calculations to investigate perpendicular ion heating by low frequency "quasi-2D" turbulence, which is believed to be the energetically dominant component of solar wind turbulence. The PI will then incorporate these results into a 1D fluid model of the solar wind that solves for the radial evolution of the turbulence and plasma properties. He will test and validate his theoretical results by comparing the 1D fluid model to observations of the temperature profile, temperature anisotropy, and bulk flow speeds of protons, electrons, alpha particles, and minor ions in the corona and solar wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a key element of the Solar, Heliospheric, and INterplanetary Environment (SHINE) research program, which is to gain an understanding of the mechanisms of solar wind heating and to incorporate them into global models, with the objective of reproducing the observed properties of the solar wind. The PI is a Science Working Group Leader for the SHINE community and a new member of the SHINE Steering Committee, where he helps organize SHINE community workshops. He will continue his active involvement as an instructor at specialized summer and winter schools for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and advanced undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). By providing young scientists with specialized training and exposure to recent developments in solar physics research, these topical schools promote the integration of research and education at UNH.</AbstractNarration>
