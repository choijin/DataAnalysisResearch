<AbstractNarration>With support from the National Science Foundation, an international team of biological anthropologists and paleontologists will explore early Cenozoic (ca. 60-45 million year old) rock strata in the Erlian Basin of Inner Mongolia for evidence of the earliest phases of primate evolution. American members of the scientific team are based at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (Pittsburgh, PA), Northern Illinois University (DeKalb, IL), and the American Museum of Natural History (New York, NY). Several different lines of evidence, including the fossil record and reconstructions of evolutionary relationships based on analyses of long sequences of DNA, suggest that the earliest phases of primate evolution likely transpired in Asia. However, the fossil record of primate evolution in Asia remains spotty, and most of the Asian primates from this time interval are documented by very fragmentary anatomical remains. As a result, there is no scientific consensus about how these Asian fossils fit on the family tree of primate evolution. More generally, there is no consensus regarding where and when such important events in primate evolution as the origin of primates and the origin of anthropoids (the group of primates that includes living monkeys, apes, and humans) occurred. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Erlian Basin, which straddles the modern border between China and Mongolia, is the only depositional basin in Asia bearing rock strata of the appropriate age to yield fossil primates from the crucial interval of early Cenozoic time when primates and anthropoids are thought to have originated. Field methods will include three modes of paleontological exploration (surface prospecting, quarrying, and screen-washing) to locate new fossil primates in the Erlian Basin. Analytic methods include computer-assisted reconstructions of evolutionary relationships based on anatomical features, as well as high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) studies of anatomy. Working with geologists and experts on paleoenvironmental reconstruction, the team will establish the basic chronology of primate evolution in the Erlian Basin. These data will allow testing of competing models of when and where primates evolved. A particularly interesting goal of this project is to determine whether ancient episodes of primate dispersal across the Bering land bridge between Alaska and Siberia correspond precisely to ancient global warming events. The scientific results from this project will enlighten understanding of where, when, and how earliest primate ancestors evolved. This will result in greater knowledge of how these earliest primates migrated from Asia to adjacent continents (notably including North America) as the physical environment of the planet shifted due to plate tectonics and changing climate. Broader impacts of the project include enhanced scientific cooperation between American and Chinese scholars, training of undergraduate and graduate students in both field and laboratory techniques, and multiple forms of public educational outreach (including museum exhibits, television documentaries, popular publications, and public lectures).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       The major results of this three year proposal are paleontological in nature and can be divided into three parts.  First, we collected fossils in China, looking in particular for fossil primates.  The Nomogen Formation in Inner Mongolia spans a geological time range from the late Paleocene through the Eocene, our chief collecting area, and into the early Oligocene.  We concentrated our efforts within the 60-50 million year time span.  Many fossil mammals, for example rodents, lagomorphs, perissodactyls, and artiodactyls, were recovered in the Eocene (55-50 million year ago) but we had limited success in the earlier time period of the Paleocene.  After these collecting efforts, several papers were written to describe and update the geological setting and the fossil mammals we discovered.  We named two new fossil primates, Baataromomys and Tarkops.  Both are primitive fossil primates related to the family Omomyidae.  Baataromomys is a very primitive and tiny fossil primate while Tarkops is the opposite being quite derived in its dental anatomy and large in body size relative to the normally small-sized omomyids.  Tarkops is also very similar dentally to fossil primates found in North America suggesting an Asia to North America biogeographic exchange in the Eocene.     The second part of this project concerns the analysis and interpretation of the oldest fossil primate skeleton.  The skeleton is about 55 million years old and is very primitive in its anatomy.  This is a tiny skeleton with an estimated body size of 25 g, a size that is slightly smaller than the smallest living primate, the pygmy mouse lemur of Madagascar.  In fact, this specimen is so small and fragile it is impossible to prepare without damaging it.  Without preparation, its anatomy is difficult to see making any scientific interpretations problematic.  This led us to have this skeleton x-rayed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France.  After this part of the project was completed, we had precise computer images of all the bones of this skeleton and on a few instances impressions of bones that had fallen away.  When we examined its head and teeth, both regions resembled primitive fossil primates like Teilhardina, an omomyid fossil primate known from Asia, Europe, and North America.   This skeletonÆs dentition has all four premolars, a very primitive condition found in only a few fossil primates &ndash; we only have two left.  This skeletonÆs long legs and long tail stand out as unusual anatomical features in this specimen.  It fact its legs are very long relative to its arms giving it a low intermembral index,  like that of living tarsiers who are renowned leaping primates, but a very peculiar anatomical pattern relative to other fossil omomyids.  Overall this skeletonÆs anatomy is similar to other known fossil omomyids yet it also retains body characteristics that resemble anthropoids (monkeys,apes, and humans), making it an interesting mosaic to interpret.  After a long analysis  involving hundreds of taxa and thousands of characters, we have concluded that this skeleton is a basal tarsiiform, the most basal haplorhine fossil ever recovered to date.      The third part of this project allowed me to visit several natural history museums to collect measurements on living and fossil primates, including visiting the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels, Belgium, twice.  Here I was able to look through many bone boxes containing fossils from the public collections and from one private collection on my second visit.  These fossil bone boxes contain hundreds of miscellaneous bones from the site of Dormaa, an early Eocene site in Belgium.  I picked through these boxes and was able to recognize several small fossil primate bones.  Since only one fossil primate has ever been found at the site of Dormaal, it was easy to allocate these new elements to Teilhardina belgica, one of the most primitive fossil primates ever name...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
