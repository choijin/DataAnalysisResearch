<AbstractNarration>The consumption and production of rice is an integral part of Chinese society, politics, and economy.  In an effort to be self-sufficient in grain production through modern technology, the Chinese government has invested significantly in using hybrid rice and developing biotechnology to feed the people through scientific advances in rice production.  In recent years, urban consumers are rejecting this mass-produced rice in favor of higher-quality rice, such as japonica varieties grown in China's northeast.  At the same time, the state discourse of suzhi (quality) promotes a model citizen subjectivity meant to counter the Mao era's emphasis on material mass-production and population quantity.  This doctoral dissertation project will identify how the Chinese state discourse regarding "quality" people affects the production and consumption of rice in contemporary society.  The following questions will be addressed:  (1) How do the Chinese state and farmers negotiate the need for high-quantity mass production of rice with urban consumer demand for high-quality rice?  (2) In what ways does japonica rice represent "quality" for both urban consumers and rural producers?  A case study of japonica rice from China's northeast will demonstrate the ways that this particular rice is considered to be "high quality."  The doctoral candidate will conduct interviews with Chinese rice scientists and agricultural policy makers, surveys with urban consumers in Beijing, and an in-depth ethnographic exploration of japonica rice production, distribution, and consumption in the northeast region of China.  The integration of findings from these activities will reveal the rising power of consumption as state policy has shifted to reflect the role of consumers.  As the Chinese state discourse of "quality" expands into the realm of agricultural policies, this project will provide an appropriate lens to analyze the connection across rural-urban social divides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research project will enhance basic understanding regarding how Chinese state discursive practices have influenced changes in grain production and consumption practices.  Moreover, it will provide insight into the growing influence that consumers have in guiding agricultural production in China's new market economy.  In addition to increasing basic understanding of domestic social and environmental changes in China, project results will relate to the global market for rice and food trade.  This will have special relevance because the U.S. Department of Agriculture and California rice growers increasingly are concerned about Chinese japonica rice exports to Asia slowing their own market.  The project may also shed new light on broader ranging issues, such as the safety of food imports from China to the U.S.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.  This project is jointly supported by the NSF Geography and Regional Science Program and the East Asia and Pacific Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
