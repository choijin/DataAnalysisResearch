<AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to Professor Tobin J. Marks of Northwestern University supports studies on both fundamental and technologically-oriented aspects of new catalytic transformations involving lanthanide and related early transition metals.  The proposal has been divided into four subtopics: 1) exploratory catalytic metal-heteroelement chemistry, 2) organolanthanide-mediated materials synthesis, 3) multinuclear catalysis and 4) other metals and supporting ligands for f-element catalysis.  Titration calorimetry will be used to quantify the strengths of metal-ligand single and multiple bonds and to "anchor" bond enthalpies on an absolute scale.  The research includes the study of selective C-N, C-O, C-S, and C-P bond-forming processes, the study of a range of precursor structures, the characterization of reaction rates, selectivities, and substituent effects, as well as the comparison of intramolecular vs. intermolecular processes.  These transformations may produce efficient, atom-economical, catalytic processes for the production of fuels, plastics, pharmaceuticals and other commercially-important chemicals.  This research also addresses the national need for researchers trained in basic heavy element chemistry for the nuclear industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit. ThisNSF-funded program joins four closely interlinked thrusts, integrating research and education, and focusing on both fundamental and technologically-oriented aspects of new and unusual catalytic reactions, primarily involving abundant lanthanide, actinide, and related early transition metal elements.  The primary goal is to use experimental bond energy information to understand unusual bonding modes, to understanding known catalytic reactions, and to predict new ones. Our objective to elucidate principals for inventing new, efficient, useful, atom-efficient, and environmentally acceptable "green" catalytic processes.  In carrying out this research, students master the synthesis and purification of new catalysts, characterizing their molecular structures and dynamics, implementing these catalysts in exploratory reactivity studies, molecular modeling and electronic structure computation, and rigorous elucidation of reaction kinetics and mechanism.  Students also become familiar with polymerization reaction methodologies and with in-depth polymer/plastic microstructure, rheology, molecular weight, and thermal characterization.  The four reasearch thrust areas are: 1) Catalytic Metal-Heteroelement Chemistry--Hydroelementation and Hydrofunctionalization. The objective is the discovery, characterization, manipulation, and exploration of new, atom-efficient processes which result in heteroelement-H additions to carbon-carbon double and triple bonds where the heteroelement is an oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphous atom.  2) Catalytic Materials Synthesis. The objective is to use lanthanide, actinide, and related transition metal catalysts to investigate the coupling of single-site olefin polymerization processes with hydroelementation processes, to efficiently produce heteroatom modified plastic materials which would have unique and useful surface and bonding properties.  3) Multinuclear Catalysis.  The objective is to alter the course of catalytic reactions that produce plastic materials by locking two catalytic centers in close spatial proximity. Ideally, such cooperativity effects could alter both the rates and selectivities of events which control polymer architecture, mechanical properties, and processing characteristics&mdash;hence produce more useful plastic materials. 4) Electrophilic Lanthanide Catalysis in Ionic Liquids--Hydroelementation.  The objective is to use recyclable and highly electrophilic lanthanide triflate catalysts in green, recyclable ionic liquid solvents to drive new hydroelementation processes using substrates not responsive to the catalysts discussed above. Perfecting such reactions could yield new ways for more efficient processing of sustainable biofuels and other natural resources.  Broader Impact. Discovering, understanding, improving, and applying chemical transformations involving metal-carbon and metal-heteroatom containing molecules and fragments is of central importance to the U.S. chemical industry.  These transformations include efficient, atom-economical catalytic means for the production of fuels, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and other economically important chemicals on a huge scale.  Furthermore, creating a broad chemical knowledge base and also a technically skilled national cadre of researchers expert in this field is crucial to developing ever more selective, environmentally benign, and economically competitive technologies.  There is also a national need for researchers trained in basic heavy metal chemistry for the nuclear industry. This NSF-funded project focuses on organometallic/catalytic/materials chemistry with the goal being to effect, characterize, understand, and disseminate to the community, unusual and potentially useful new stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity principals, as well as new insights into bonding and bonding energetics. Such a research/-education activity deliberately involves young scientists in all aspects of this knowledge creation.  ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
