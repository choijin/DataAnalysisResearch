<AbstractNarration>This award funds research using computational methods on a problem in mechanism design that is especially important in understanding the likely outcomes of complicated auctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team use mechanism design theory and linear programming techniques to consider whether first-price auctions are more or less vulnerable to collusion than second-price or ascending bid auctions.  They  also determine how a tacit or explicit cartel might operate in a variety of different kinds of auctions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has substantial broader impacts because auction methods are widly used.  The Federal government currently uses auctions to allocate telecommunications spectrum and rights to offshore drilling, timber, and mining.  Proposals to use a 'cap and trade' system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also rely on auction methods.</AbstractNarration>

Marx, "The Economics of Contingent Re-Auctions," American Economic Journal: Microeconomics, 3(2), 165-193, (2011).  We consider an auction environment where an object can be sold with usage restrictions that generate benefits to the seller but decrease buyers' valuations. In this environment, sellers such as the FCC have used "contingent re-auctions," offering the restricted object with a reserve price, but re-auctioning it without restrictions if the reserve is not met. We show that contingent re-auctions are generally neither efficient nor optimal for the seller. We propose an alternative "exclusive-buyer ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
