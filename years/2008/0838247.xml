<AbstractNarration>The researchers will use the locations of secondary ocean microseisms noise to improve the&lt;br/&gt;temporal resolution of changes in crustal velocity, and to map the locations of coastal&lt;br/&gt;reflections of primary ocean waves. The proposed microseisms source location technique&lt;br/&gt;is based on an algorithm developed for real-time earthquake locations and is suitable for&lt;br/&gt;areas like Southern California where multiple simultaneous sources are located within a&lt;br/&gt;few hundred km offshore and where there is a well distributed seismic array on land. The&lt;br/&gt;use of source locations overcomes a problem with standard correlation methods that&lt;br/&gt;require a random distribution of sources to achieve precise measurements, which&lt;br/&gt;translates to long correlation times and hence a reduced temporal resolution. Using a set&lt;br/&gt;of source locations, a shorter synthetic seismogram can be used in the correlation. The&lt;br/&gt;coastal reflection points will be determined by forming an adjoint problem with the&lt;br/&gt;hypothesized reflection source and an incident primary wavefield determined from high resolution&lt;br/&gt;Wave Action Models (WAM's).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The source locations procedure is demonstrated with both a synthetic and real data&lt;br/&gt;examples. The results show that there are often many source points active at any given&lt;br/&gt;time. They provide two independent approaches: (1)&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements of the intensity of wave-wave&lt;br/&gt;interactions at the source regions ? a necessary condition for microseisms generation. A&lt;br/&gt;new airborne system that will be flown in June 2008 over the offshore S. California to&lt;br/&gt;look for opposing ocean wavefields which are indicative of the source points. (2) A&lt;br/&gt;comparison between the amplitudes of the observed micoseisms and estimated&lt;br/&gt;amplitudes calculated using the source locations and the theory of ocean microseisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of the&lt;br/&gt;coastal reflections is currently poorly understood. This research will provide the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to develop a model for this process and to ultimately to generate a description&lt;br/&gt;of the complete wave-field that can be incorporated into the next generation of Wave&lt;br/&gt;Action Models. Microseisms provide a means to continuously monitor the Rayleigh&lt;br/&gt;wave speed across the Los Angeles basins as a potential proxy for stress changes. The&lt;br/&gt;use of sources in this procedure increases the temporal resolutions and removes the&lt;br/&gt;problem of systematic bias due to the assumption of random source locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research bridges three communities: radar interferometry,&lt;br/&gt;oceanography and seismology and hence has the potential to spur research in all these&lt;br/&gt;areas. Determining the mechanisms for coastal reflections will significantly enhance the&lt;br/&gt;community wave action models. The application to southern California can be extended&lt;br/&gt;to several other areas including northern California, Cascadia, and Japan. The procedure&lt;br/&gt;established by this research could become part of the standard seismic monitoring of&lt;br/&gt;Southern California</AbstractNarration>
