<AbstractNarration>Theoretical approaches to quantum computing frequently model the state of a&lt;br/&gt;quantum system as something that changes discretely in time.  However, an&lt;br/&gt;unmeasured quantum system fundamentally evolves continuously in time as&lt;br/&gt;described by Schroedinger's equation.  Even the quantum measurement process&lt;br/&gt;can be described by a continuous-time stochastic differential equation.&lt;br/&gt;This research explores quantum computation in its complete continuous-time&lt;br/&gt;formulation, with the goal of uncovering new paradigms for processing&lt;br/&gt;quantum information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on three key areas: continuous-time quantum computing&lt;br/&gt;architectures, continuous-time quantum error correction, and continuous-time&lt;br/&gt;quantum algorithms.  These areas were selected because examples highlighting&lt;br/&gt;the differences between continuous-time and discrete-time quantum computing&lt;br/&gt;formulations are already known in each of them.  For example,&lt;br/&gt;continuous-time quantum walk architectures require no external dynamical&lt;br/&gt;controls, continuous-time quantum feedback can mediate quantum error&lt;br/&gt;correction, and continuous-time quantum scattering can calculate Boolean&lt;br/&gt;formulas with fewer queries than any classical algorithm can.  A major&lt;br/&gt;objective of this research is to expand upon these directions and develop&lt;br/&gt;new ones.  The strategy will be to focus on problems that are sufficiently&lt;br/&gt;well-defined and tractable that progress can be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project not only supports graduate student training in quantum&lt;br/&gt;information science but also supports education and outreach activities&lt;br/&gt;through the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) Network.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will seek out exceptional students outside his home institution,&lt;br/&gt;especially encouraging those in underrepresented groups, and sponsor their&lt;br/&gt;attendance at SQuInT meetings to further enrich this growing field.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
