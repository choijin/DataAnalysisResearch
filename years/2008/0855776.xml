<AbstractNarration>IIP 0855776&lt;br/&gt;University of Georgia&lt;br/&gt;Kane&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Georgia (UGA) will join the existing multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "The Center for Advanced Forestry Systems"(CAFS) which was established in 2007 with four member institutions: North Carolina State University (lead university), Oregon State University, Purdue University and Virginia Tech.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site will expand CAFS efforts by providing additional and specialized expertise and research platforms in the areas of silviculture, biometrics and wood quality.  The proposed activities at UGA will augment and complement current CAFS projects, and will more fully address the needs for scientific and technological advances for enhancing the competitiveness of the US forestry sector.  UGA has a long history of research on commercial forestry plantations, and proposes to develop research projects focused on understanding productivity drivers in thinned stands and integrating wood quality predictions into growth and yield models.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort at UGA has the potential to improve the competitiveness of the forest products industry and forest land owners.  The expected new developments in technical capabilities will have broad applications and benefits beyond just the US.  The emphasis on inclusion of both graduate and undergraduate students in research will enhance the number of trained experts to work in this important field.  UGA plans to address all issues related to diversity and to commit to the inclusion of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes are associated with three distinct research projects advanced during the 2009 to 2014 period.     Project 1. Improving estimates of growth and yield of loblolly pine plantations established with enhanced genotypes.     The most widely distributed and commercially attractive timber type in the southern U.S. is even-aged stands of planted loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.).  With ever increasing demand for wood fiber from a decreasing timberland base, it is imperative to improve timber productivity while insuring efficient use of resources.  Development of mathematical growth models for fast growing enhanced genetic selections of loblolly pine is critical for developing timber management plans that will insure efficient use of resources to meet demand for wood products domestically and internationally.  A preliminary model system for predicting growth and yield of loblolly pine plantations established with enhanced genotypes was developed using available data and an understanding of loblolly pine stand dynamics.  This model system included modifications to existing tree survival and stand basal area functions. Tree diameter distribution projection approaches were also used to take into account observed effects of different genetic types and genotypes on tree diameter distribution within a stand.  Discussions among biometricians, forest geneticists and silviculturalist about the preliminary model system and associated assumptions identified potential approaches to better model plantation performance across the range of genetic gain in productivity, quality, and uniformity. Evolving knowledge of stand development dynamics resulting from this project will inform development of new and improved model systems.         Project 2.  Improving understanding of the relationship between thinned loblolly pine plantation productivity and crown attributes.  Production dynamics of thinned and non-thinned loblolly pine plantations were examined from age 12 years, when thinning occurred at a number of locations,  to age 17 years in the Piedmont and Upper Coastal Plain in high productivity stands established with a range of planting densities in combination with high operational or intensive culture to improve the understanding of productivity drivers and inform growth and yield modeling and thinning prescription approaches for a range of stand conditions.   Results indicate that stand density management is relatively more important than resource management where resource availability is not a significant limitation to growth.  At locations without thinning, competition among planted trees resulted in marked mortality on planting densities above 2,220 trees per ha with effects especially pronounced for higher planting density and intensive culture stands. At locations with thinning, immediate post-thin mean tree DBH and stand basal area per acre generally decreased with greater planting density because of effects of density on average tree size and the thinning to a constant number of trees per ha. Post-thinning basal area increment generally showed similar trajectories for the different planting density &ndash; cultural intensity combinations.  In the growing season following thinning, pine foliar biomass and light interception tended to be lower for higher planting density, thinned plots than lower planting density, thinned plots but these differences decreased with time since thinning because of relatively greater increases in foliar biomass and light interception on the high planting density, thinned plots.       Project 3.  Incorporating wood properties with growth and yield models for loblolly pine plantations.  Growth and yield models have become the means by which forest managers and landowners can forecast future yields of their resources resulting from alternative management regimes.  As such they play a critical role in the decision process for modern forest management.  This project introduced the means to also forecast the qual...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
