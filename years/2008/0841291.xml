<AbstractNarration>GK-12, Collaborative Curriculum Development: Interdisciplinary Middle and High School Education in Biomedical Engineering through Graduate Fellow/Teacher Interaction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael L. Shuler&lt;br/&gt;Co-PIs: Shivaun Archer and Chris B. Schaffer&lt;br/&gt;Department of Biomedical Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University, Ithaca, NY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;This GK-12 program capitalizes on the strength of Cornell University?s biomedical engineering graduate fellows in interdisciplinary research as well as the education experience of local science teachers to create and implement new interdisciplinary curricular materials for middle and high-school science classes. The principle aim of this program is to help graduate fellows make the critical transition from student to scientist by asking them to identify the conceptual underpinnings of their field in order to develop outreach materials related to their research. Graduate fellows then teach these underlying concepts to teachers and students, thereby helping the fellows to develop the science communication skills that are essential for their future as interdisciplinary researchers and citizen/scientists. At the core of the program is the ?collaborative curriculum development? project: Graduate fellows will work with a teacher and faculty advisor during a six-week summer program on the development of innovative, inquiry-driven science education activities related to the fellow?s research, which will then be implemented in underserved rural and urban schools during the following year. In addition to graduate fellows becoming more conceptually-oriented scientific thinkers with better science communication skills, the participating teachers will improve their science knowledge and receive help implementing best-practice science teaching methods, while students will receive enhanced science education. In particular, the inquiry-driven activities will let students experience science not as an abstract collection of facts from separate fields, but as a process for discovery that integrates knowledge across disciplines, thereby increasing student understanding of and interest in science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

In addtion, the GK-12 fellows have given nine presentations including BMES annual meetings, Yale Bouchet Conference on Diversity and Graduate Education and the Orthopaedic Reseach Society.      Intellectual Merit:   &bull; Teaching and interacting in classrooms gave graduate fellows the skills necessary to communicate science ideas to a broad audience and helped them develop awareness of educational needs in public school systems best-practice teaching methodologies, leading to a life long commitment to K-12 education and outreach.  &bull; The professional development and research experience for middle and high school teachers improved their science knowledge, and improved the quality of science education in the classroom.  &bull; Middle and high-school students participated in inquiry-driven experiments and learned about connections between basic science and human health issues, increasing their STEM knowledge.  &bull; The fellow/teacher/faculty teams developed materials and resources for connecting science to real biomedical applications suitable for middle and high school by integrating science and math content with the fellowÆs research and teacherÆs curricular goals. These resources are disseminated on the BME CLIMB website.  Broader Impacts:  &bull; Fellow/teacher/faculty teams tackled a research project. This enhanced graduate fellow skills in the teamwork required for interdisciplinary science collaboration.  &bull; This proposal improved communication between middle school and high school teachers as well as between teachers and college faculty and graduate students.  &bull; We recruited a diverse group of graduate fellows and participating faculty.
