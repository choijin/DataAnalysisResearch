<AbstractNarration>This project, administered in a center for ecology, is initiating an S-STEM Green Scholarships program for talented transfer students with demonstrated financial need to matriculate from 2-year colleges to a 4-year degree program in an environmental science discipline. The Green Scholarship program builds on existing support services and programs to prepare the Green Scholars to complete a baccalaureate degree and enter the workforce or graduate school equipped to solve complex environmental problems. Scholars enter a living-learning community that includes common housing and courses to enhance research and problem-solving skills. To additionally build a sense of community, scholars have access to a central study room that houses undergraduate scholarship programs. A multifaceted mentoring network of peers, faculty and staff is helping to ensure that academic and professional goals are met and that the scholars perform at the best of their abilities. Workshops on professional development and career choices are provided, and governmental partners present seminars on internship and employment opportunities. Scholars are also offered opportunities to partner with research faculty mentors, and to experience vocational training through internships at seven partner facilities.</AbstractNarration>
