<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project is directed at training graduate students in the science and technology surrounding quantum coherent optical and matter systems and related photonic structures and sources. Such studies intimately relate to the emerging field of quantum information processing including quantum encrypted communications. Objectives include training a different kind professional who is cross-trained, flexible, and better prepared for the evolving needs of information technology, with an eye toward increasing underrepresented and female students. The latter will be enhanced through vigorous recruiting and partnering with minority serving institutions. A central educational feature is that the participating students take courses in at least three of the four participating departments: Physics, Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, and Materials Science.  Due to the advanced nature of the targeted research topics, much of the required theory and practice are not presently taught and thus the faculty advisors will create new courses that fill the gaps.  A new laboratory course featuring modern fiber-optics-based instrumentation is a central feature of the program.  The scientific questions posed have great potential for revolutionizing information technology based on the quantum coherence of light and matter fields. Graduate students trained under this program are expected to lead the next generation of information technology research and development, which will increasingly involve quantum coherence. The interaction with U. S. firms and National Laboratories will enhance the students? ability to compete in the global market place.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

Here we will describe a subset of the program outcomes resulting from the associated research.           Next-generation photonic quantum networks will require switches that operate with low loss, low signal-band noise, and without disturbing the spatial, temporal, or polarization degrees of freedom of the transmitted photons. An important property of such a "quantum network" is to be able to utilize the existing telecommunications infrastructure. These networks must also be able to route "entangled" photons (quantum admixtures) at high speeds, with minimal loss and signal-band noise, and, most importantly, without disturbing the photonÆs quantum state. A highlight of our program which was reported to NSF involved the participation of IGERT students in the design and construction of an all-optical quantum switch that fulfills these daunting requirements, as characterized by its performance at the single photon level using the methods of quantum-state tomography.           The LIGO detectors situated in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana (and now elsewhere in the world) have the goal of directly detecting gravitational waves, a major unrealized prediction of EinsteinÆs general theory of relativity. Three IGERT students participated in the development of a scheme for enhancing the sensitivity of such detectors by a factor of nearly twenty, which corresponds to an increase in the volume of accessible space by a factor of eight thousand.   In a related line of research, technology was developed for a superluminal ring laser gyroscope that may enable the measurement of the gravitational frame dragging, another effect predicted by general relativity, which produces a very small nutation, corresponding to one rotation in five million years.

The first involves utilizing 100nm scale evanescent waves generated via total internal reflection from a prism surface, while the second exploits surface plasmon excitations which are collective oscillations of free electrons in (typically small) metal structures that can be exploited to generate short range optical fields in the vicinity of their free surfaces. The two IGERT groups are developing atom trapping technologies which are expected to lead to the controlled interaction of ultra-cold rubidium atoms with surfaces generally and surface plasmon excitations in particular.
