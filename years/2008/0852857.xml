<AbstractNarration>Fundamental biological processes, such as programmed cell death, cell differentiation and cell division, involve time-dependent dynamic alterations in the structure of subcellular units, the organelles.  These structural changes are controlled by important molecular pathways, and must be quantified to gain a more complete understanding of cellular function.  The microscopic instrument developed in this project will rapidly image and quantify, with nano-metric sensitivity, organelle dynamics.  The method utilizes a dark-field microscopic method developed by the Principal Investigator, and allows rapid mapping of subcellular structural changes by automatically probing and quantifying local sample texture with very high sensitivity, and over large sample areas.  The technique is therefore applicable to rapid screening of unstained biological samples for basic biological research or drug discovery.  The instrument is also likely to reveal novel subcellular dynamics by enabling highly sensitive measurement of dynamic organelle changes as part of routine microscopic observation.  Data collected with the instrument may be combined with molecular imaging data to provide a multimodal study of organelle function within living cells. &lt;br/&gt;The usefulness of the instrument to biological research will be demonstrated by measurements of mitochondrial fission during apoptosis.  Mitochondria are being increasingly recognized as significant players in a number of cellular processes, including diseases such as cancer.   As such, structural markers that can track changes in mitochondrial shape due to the deregulation of fusion and fission are likely to have a wide-raging impact on a number of emerging biological studies. &lt;br/&gt;This instrument development project exemplifies the principle that engineering design is prevalent in methods, which enable measurement, understanding, and control of biological entities, and will be used in various educational and training activities involving students at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels, as well as under-represented minorities from local public middle schools and high schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ IDBR: Optical Fourier Processing Microscope Based on Two-Dimensional Gabor Filters     The goal of this project was to design a microscope capable of rapidly measuring changes in cellular and subcellular structure with high sensitivity.  We have developed a microscope that can measure optically the texture of unstained transparent objects with very high sensitivity. The optical textural measurements can be used to characterize the structural content of the object by depicting, in an encoded image, the spatial distribution of textural features.     Intellectual merit:  The microscope relies on a unique approach based on spatial filtering with Gabor filters implemented optically on a spatial light modulator consisting of a liquid crystal device. In well-controlled objects such as diatoms, the microscope demonstrated sensitivity to structural differences on the order of 20nm, while maintaining a 0.36mm spatial imaging resolution.  The microscope relies on quantifying the sampleÆs texture, which is directly related to the size of object features within the sample or the spacing between them.  This measurement is well suited to quantify the structure of objects made up of a continuum of substructures such as living cells.  The method typically yields a feature size spectrum which provides a multiparametric depiction of the sample structure (Sierra et al, 2012, Optics Express, 20 (27), 28698-28706).  We have demonstrated that this instrument is capable of measuring biologically-relevant structural changes by showing how it can quantify mitochondrial fission during programmed cell death (apoptosis) (Pasternack et al 2011, Cytometry Part A. 79A: 137-148). We are currently utilizing this measurement as a marker of apoptosis with the goal of developing a rapid label-free apoptosis assay for applications in drug discovery.     Broader impact:  The microscope introduces a novel way to assess dynamic structural changes in living cells that can have a broad impact on advancing our understanding of cell biology.  The technique developed in this project can be applied to the study of a multitude of biological functions involving critical changes in morphology.  These functions include programmed cell death, a fundamental process, which when disregulated can cause cancer or degenerative diseases. They also include the important morphological transformations which occur during cell differentiation.  Understanding structural changes in cell differentiation could shed light on how the molecular processes driving differentiation eventually result in a desired morphological and functional phenotype. In addition, the development of this novel microscope has involved several undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students from diverse cultural backgrounds.  The project served as a training platform for these students who were able to develop their research skills in a relevant scientific context.  The project was used as a basis to develop a new course on microscopy in the department of Biomedical Engineering at Rutgers.  It also supported the development of an exhibit on optical activity.  This exhibit, which is almost completed, will serve to engage its viewers in a discussion about the physics of light and light-matter interactions.
