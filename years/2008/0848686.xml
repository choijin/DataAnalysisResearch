<AbstractNarration>This proposal extends studies of unusual aspects of alkyne reactivity into a new direction. It will concentrate on fundamental factors controlling radical cyclizations of alkynes and utilize this knowledge for the design of synthetically useful transformations. Because stereoelectronic patterns are significantly different for radical cyclizations of alkenes and alkynes, understanding these fundamental differences is essential for the development of alkyne chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the Alabugin group will utilize stereoelectronic and thermodynamic factors in search of the apparently favorable but virtually unexplored radical process: 5-endo-dig radical cyclization and apply this and related reactions to the synthesis of new carbo- and heterocyclic systems. Proposed experiments will test earlier computational predictions regarding the relative efficiency of different cyclization patterns, discover new cyclization topologies and test the efficiency of cooperative hyperconjugative interactions in control of radical reactivity. In parallel, the group will combine efficient radical cyclizations with radical translocations for the rapid construction of functionalized polycyclic systems. These reactions take advantage of synthetic potential which is present in alkynes but not in alkenes by utilizing both pi-bonds of the alkyne moiety in the C-C bond forming steps.&lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merit of this research is in unraveling the contribution of electronic and structural factors controlling the efficiency and selectivity of radical processes through a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. The underlying focus on electronic effects will increase the general importance of these findings, broaden understanding of these fundamental factors and lead to the development of new paradigms of radical reactivity.  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact will be the laying of mechanistic, structural, and kinetic foundations for successful applications of radical reactions of alkynes in synthesis and materials science. The proposed research will enhance  understanding of the reactivity of the alkyne moiety as well as radical species. The combination of computations and kinetic studies will be used to validate theoretical approaches for studies of organic reactions. &lt;br/&gt; The theoretical and experimental components of this work will allow training of specialists in each area and will provide researchers at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels with an opportunity to integrate learning and discovery. The results will be disseminated in the PI's publications and outreach activities, including participation in symposia and lecturing at undergraduate and graduate institutions. The PI and his students will also record their research presentations for the Global Educational Outreach for Science Engineering and Technology (GEOSET), a new initiative to provide outstanding Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) teaching material through the new technology. The recorded research presentations will be posted on the GEOSET website and linked to the the PI's and Departmental websites. This exposure will also help in the development of further career opportunities for participating students since these recordings may even take the place of job interviews, thus reducing carbon footprints and travel costs to prospective employers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF-funded work led to significant breakthroughs in several directions:  Refined and redefined rules for alkyne cyclizations and their application to the preparation of carbon nanoribbons: About 90% of molecules in Nature include a cyclic substructure. This is why the ability of creating cyclic molecules in a controlled way with high precision and sufficient efficiency is paramount for preparting new chemicals and pharmaceuticals. One of the three basic structural motifs for the preparation of cyclic structures involves ring closure of alkynes. We have used funding provided by NSF to redefine the rules for anionic and radical cyclizations of alkynes.  We have leveraged the new rules for alkyne cyclizations towards the preparation of graphene nanoribbons. Graphene is a form of carbon with promising  mechanical and electronic properties. However, because structural variations (e.g., size, shape, curvature, edge geometry, and composition) affect electronic properties strongly, progress in this field depends on the development of rationally designed "bottom-up" approaches toward chemically and structurally uniform graphene substructures. We have invented two efficient and flexible approaches to nonsymmetrically substituted precisely cut and functionalized graphene substructures including polarized and N-doped nanoribbons.  From autoprotection in antibiotic-producing organisms to new synthetic methods: We have provided an explanation to the unusual fragmentation of natural enediyne antibiotic esperamicin and connected this process to the mechanism of autoprotection for the enediyne-producing microorganisms.  We have used this information to develop carbon-oxygen transposition for the first transition metal-free synthetic method for conversion of phenols to aromatic carboxylic acid derivatives. A metal-free reaction which converts phenols into benzoic acid derivatives is a useful alternative to the commonly used Pd-catalyzed carbonylation because Pd is classified as a Class I metal (significant safety concern) in pharmaceuticals with permitted daily exposure &lt;10 &mu;g/day.  New tools for bioorthogonal chemistry: Biorthogonal chemistry has potential to revolutionize chemical biology. One of the most promising approaches for efficient and selective transformations in complex biological environments is based on alkyne/azide cycloadditions ("click chemistry"). We identified two promising approaches to selective acceleration of cycloaddition reactions. These approaches removed ~80% of the difference in the cycloaddition barriers between acyclic alkynes and cyclooctyne (~1 million fold acceleration). Furthermore, these ideas opened new venues to the rational design of alkyne reagents for fast and tunable "click chemistry" such as incorporation of endocyclic heteroatoms within cycloalkynes that, according to computational analysis, should provide alkynes ~104 times more reactive and ~30% less strained than cyclooctyne.  In each of the three developments, the intellectual merit include identifying the fundamental electronic and mechanistic factors controlling reactivity whereas the broad impacts are in applying the new chemical processes and tools toward problems of general importance in materials science, organic synthesis and chemical biology.
