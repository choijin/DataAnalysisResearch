<AbstractNarration>Dr. Jeffrey Dick is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Arizona State University.  The investigation will explore, using a thermodynamic framework, the physical-chemical factors that support communities of microbes in a hot spring at Yellowstone National Park. Environmental genomics data will be coupled with geochemical measurements including temperature, oxidation-reduction potential and elemental concentrations to predict for the first time the relative abundances of proteins as well as the diversity of the microbial populations in this system. Placing the environmental genomic and geochemical data into the same thermodynamically derived frame of reference is crucial to a rigorous theoretical analysis of the geobiological system responses to environmental gradients. It can also aid in the growing challenge of interpreting large amounts of environmental data and in deducing possible geochemical imprints on the genomic relationships. The approach will bring together insights from biogeochemistry and environmental genomics to identify the amino acid compositions of enzymes that are involved in the cycles of carbon, nitrogen and other elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An expected outcome of this project is the development of a software implementation of the computational models that can then be modified to investigate the geochemical limits of different metabolic pathways in other extreme environments. The fellow will engage in outreach and educational activities by developing an interactive presentation for the annual Earth and Space Science Day at Arizona State University and by assisting faculty and undergraduate students in a senior group project to conceive and carry out a mission of geobiological exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall subject of this project was the study of geochemistry and microbial life in the high-temperature environment of hot springs at Yellowstone National Park. The intellectual merit of the project is inherent in the development of chemical reaction models and computational tools to assess connections between the composition of biomolecules, including proteins, and the chemical environment.  The accumulated data about one hot spring in particular ("Bison Pool") was used to test and calibrate the thermodynamic predictions.  A highlight of the results was the finding of patterns in the chemical formulas of proteins that are correlated to geochemical conditions. In one example, chemical formulas of proteins were derived from the environmental genome (DNA) sequences of microbial biofilms from five sampling sites at a hot spring (Image 1). We found that the average oxidation state of carbon, which is a value derived from the chemical formulas of the proteins, increases along the outflow channel of the hot spring, even among classes of proteins that are primarily intracellular and thereby protected from direct interaction with the environment.  This finding motivated a more in-depth analysis of the relationship between chemical properties of proteins and the chemistry of the hot spring water. Briefly, a thermodynamic model was constructed that can be used to compare the energy required for the overall synthesis of proteins as a function of temperature, pH and oxidation-reduction conditions. There are significant spatial gradients in each of these variables in the hot spring, and the calculations reported in the publications are the first example simultaneous assessment of the effects of all of these variables on the energetics of protein formation in a well-characterized hot spring system.  A major step forward is that the thermodynamic model is based on chemical reactions involving inorganic and biological reactants. The ability to quantify these reactions enhances study of the microbial communities in Yellowstone. For example, proportions of certain classes of amino acids have previously been identified as signatures of microbial adaptation to high temperatures. The hypothesis that these patterns are shaped by energy minimization can now be tested quantitatively, owing to methods developed in this project. In a broader context, the thermodynamic methods can be generalized to other environments, such as oceans or soils.  The research was facilitated by improvements made to a computer software package, CHNOSZ, written in the R language, and available for free download from the web site for the package and from the comprehensive R archive network. Major features that were introduced during the project are the ability to quickly compare the energetic costs of synthesis for thousands of proteins, as well as expansion of the thermodynamic database in order to model other systems of interest to biochemists and organic geochemists (Image 2). The principal investigator trained graduate students in a geochemistry class at Arizona State University in the use of the software.
