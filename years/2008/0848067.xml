<AbstractNarration>Humans routinely reason about the origin of their beliefs, for example, whether they found out about something through direct perception, communication or inference. Languages vary in the means they use to encode information sources. Some languages use lexical means (e.g., "I heard/figured out that John went to the concert") while other languages use grammatical markers. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Papafragou will examine how children learning different languages acquire evidentiality, the linguistic encoding of information sources, and how the acquisition of evidentiality relates to non-linguistic reasoning about the origins and reliability of information. Another goal of the research project is to investigate whether cross-linguistic differences in the way evidentiality is encoded influence the non-linguistic representation of information sources. By comparing performance on linguistic and nonlinguistic tasks by speakers of different languages and across various child and adult groups, this research could reveal whether the way information sources are encoded in language affects nonlinguistic thinking. A unique feature of this research lies in the innovative and systematic comparison between aspects of linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge within a single domain. Early career researchers will get training in interdisciplinary research, including international data collection.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our studies throw new light on the relation between language and thought in both adults and children. A first important finding from our work is that, in languages that use grammatical distinctions to encode evidentiality (such as Turkish), the acquisition of evidentiality is quite protracted; furthermore, the acquisition of evidentials in language is tightly linked to children&rsquo;s cognitive ability to reason about sources of information in oneself and others. A second important finding is that the cognitive ability to reason about information sources (especially, perception and inference) develops significantly between the ages of 4 and 6, and seems to follow similar steps in children learning different languages. A third major finding from the present work is that cross-linguistic differences in the way evidentiality is encoded do not seem to influence the non-linguistic representation of information sources in adults. These results are important because they offer new evidence for the complex and multi-pronged relation between linguistic and cognitive abilities using evidence from multiple speech communities and age groups.
