    <AbstractNarration>This project will employ a highly interdisciplinary approach that integrates new&lt;br/&gt;geometrical techniques, modeling, and experiments to address fundamental, open&lt;br/&gt;questions concerning the physical properties of granular media and other jammed&lt;br/&gt;materials such as glasses, foams, and colloids. The hallmark of jammed materials is&lt;br/&gt;that they resist applied forces like solids, but are disordered like liquids. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;many jammed materials possess heterogeneous, ramified structures known as force&lt;br/&gt;chain networks when external forces are applied. Although the existence of force&lt;br/&gt;chains has been known for decades, a quantitative understanding of their role in&lt;br/&gt;physical processes has proved elusive in part because previous studies have been&lt;br/&gt;unable to devise an unbiased and general definition for them. Precise identification and&lt;br/&gt;characterization of force chains and the response of jammed materials to applied forces&lt;br/&gt;will likely have a transformative impact in many arenas. For example, financial and&lt;br/&gt;energy costs of handling and processing of granular materials, typically with high&lt;br/&gt;inefficiency, is estimated to be at least one trillion dollars in the US alone. Also,&lt;br/&gt;avalanches and earthquakes are examples where the unpredictable behavior of&lt;br/&gt;granular media detrimentally impacts mankind. In this work, we will apply novel&lt;br/&gt;mathematical techniques coupled with computer simulations and experiments to obtain&lt;br/&gt;a quantitative, predictive description of jammed materials.&lt;br/&gt;The outreach efforts of this project emphasize providing educational opportunities to&lt;br/&gt;students from underrepresented groups. We will organize education and recruiting trips&lt;br/&gt;to predominantly female liberal arts colleges in the Northeast and historically black&lt;br/&gt;schools in North Carolina, such as North Carolina Central University, and others in the&lt;br/&gt;Southeast. These trips will include giving technical and popular lectures, including&lt;br/&gt;demonstrations to show that research on jammed materials is intriguing and important.&lt;br/&gt;During informal meetings with students we will emphasize that careers in science and&lt;br/&gt;technology are rewarding and open to those in underrepresented groups. To stimulate&lt;br/&gt;further student interest in this research, we will hold biannual 2-day lab open houses so&lt;br/&gt;that promising undergraduates can be exposed to both experimental and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;aspects of our research. To encourage close collaboration among researchers in the&lt;br/&gt;field of jammed materials, we will organize biannual interdisciplinary workshops. The&lt;br/&gt;inaugural workshop, ``Computational Homology Tools Applied to Jamming and Flow in&lt;br/&gt;Granular Materials'' is scheduled for the winter of 2009.</AbstractNarration>
