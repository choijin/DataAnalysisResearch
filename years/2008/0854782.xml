<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will address the question of how experiments at current and future particle accelerators, in particular the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, can help us understand the Standard Model of Particle Physics, electroweak symmetry breaking and dark matter. Part of the planned project focuses on theoretical models that can simultaneously explain the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking and the nature of dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles. Different models and their potential experimental signatures will be compared, in order to develop model-independent analysis techniques. The proposed research work, while theoretical in nature, will be directly beneficial for the experimental LHC collaborations. The other part of the project focuses on effective field theory applications for heavy quark, collider, and gravitational physics. In particular developing an effective field theory for calculating low-x physics and the use of an effective field theory for gravity to investigate questions of interest to LIGO and LISA. The broader implications of this proposal are that this project examines several fundamental issues including questions of direct phenomenological relevance to present and future generations of particle accelerators. The issues studied will have a direct bearing on the interpretation of results from these facilities. The proposed project is well suited for the participation of students at different levels, allowing them to acquire knowledge and skills in theoretical physics, mathematical methods, computer programming and data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
