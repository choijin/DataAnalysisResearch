<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;One of the most exciting themes of modern condensed matter physics is the discovery and investigation of novel phenomena and new forms of order in materials systems of ever increasing complexity. It is one of the goals of our proposed program to study the elastic properties (i.e. how a material responds to strain) of a set of novel, complex materials called spinels. The elastic response of these spinels can be quite exotic, and our research program will explore if the behavior can be understood with recently developed theories. &lt;br/&gt;Graduate students will gain in-depth experience in the field of elastic properties and low temperature physics, and will acquire skills in various techniques in materials science. This proposal includes the development of outreach activities to high-school students. Special efforts will be made to reach female students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This research program is designed to systematically study the elastic response of a set of complex transition metal oxides (TMOs) that we believe are ideal for elastic property studies: chromium and vanadium spinel oxides.  Specifically, the  compounds we intend to study have the formula AB2O4, where the B cation is Cr3+ or V3+ and the A cation is Zn2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, or Co2+.  These materials are cubic at room temperature, and have only 3 elastic moduli.   As the materials are cooled, they all undergo structural and magnetic phase transitions that are currently the subject of intense experimental and theoretical interest.  The relevant physics involves crystalline distortions to relieve magnetic frustration (the spin-Teller effect), orbital ordering and spin-orbit interactions in a t2g manifold, and magnetic control of orbital occupation.  RUS will be used routinely from 2-400 K and in magnetic fields up to 9 Tesla to obtain the elastic moduli. Pulse-echo measurements will be performed as appropriate.  The elastic response of a solid is a measure of the material?s ?strain susceptibility? to strains of different symmetries.  Near phase transitions, it can provide information about the coupling of the order parameter to strain. This knowledge is indispensable for understanding the physics of complex TMOs. Graduate students will gain in-depth experience in the field of elastic properties and low temperature physics, and will acquire skills in various techniques in materials science. This proposal includes the development of outreach activities to high-school students. Special efforts will be made to reach female students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Resonant Ultrasound Studies of spin-liquid Tb2Ti2O7  The physical properties of geometrically frustrated magnets are known to display a wealth of exotic phenomena, because the lattice structure does not allow all interactions between the magnetic ions to be simultaneously satisfied. A recent example of a material where the frustration prevents magnetic ordering down to lowest measurable temperatures has been found in Tb2Ti2O7. We measured the temperature-dependence of the elastic moduli for Tb2Ti2O7 with and without an applied magnetic field. A striking elastic softening is observed in the absence of a magnetic field, and is arrested upon the application of a moderate magnetic field. Such dramatic softening is typically attributed to a structural phase transition, however, no transition has thus far been observed in Tb2Ti2O7. Theoretical modeling of our experimental data is currently under way.     Resonant Ultrasound Studies of Fe-based superconductors  The discovery of high-temperature Fe-based superconductivity has resulted in substantial activity leading to the finding of a wide range of Fe-based superconductors, including a number of materials based on the BaFe2As2 parent. We have carried out a series of measurements of the temperature-dependence of the resonant frequencies of parent compound BaFe2As2 and Co- doped BaFe1-xCoxAs2. The observed reduction in f2 indicates a dramatic softening of cs, as shown in the figure.  The amplitude of the effect indicates a strong magnetoelastic coupling, consistent with the observed softening of some phonon frequencies.     Education and training  Exposing students to real-world science and the cutting-edge technology with emphasis on the challenges and opportunities associated with Materials for the 21st Century, is of the utmost importance to motivate them to consider future careers that relate to technology. Not only is the training of graduate students and post-docs essential but motivating high school students is imperative to the advancement of science.  In addition to the graduate students and post-docs involved in various aspects of this work, several high school students were sponsored through internships to spend one or more semesters in the lab and have learned different aspects of materials physics through hands on experience and interaction with the group.
