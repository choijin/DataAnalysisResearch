<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World Wide Web is a critical infrastructure that serves our society&lt;br/&gt;by facilitating  information  exchange, business and&lt;br/&gt;education. As it continues to evolve, the number of web-based&lt;br/&gt;attacks that target innocent web users keeps increasing. &lt;br/&gt;Examples of such attacks include Cross-site Scripting, SQL Injection&lt;br/&gt;and Cross-site Request Forgery. Recent attacks on end-users and&lt;br/&gt;online enterprises through these virulent attacks have resulted in&lt;br/&gt;widespread damage. Defending these attacks is therefore of very &lt;br/&gt;important concern to Internet economy and to  society-at-large. &lt;br/&gt;This project develops a comprehensive plan for defending web &lt;br/&gt;applications from these attacks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical contributions of this project are in the development of the&lt;br/&gt;technologies that  elicit the intended behavior of a web application&lt;br/&gt;and prevent attacks by enforcing these intended behaviors. We build&lt;br/&gt;a  framework in which  the intentions of a web application are represented &lt;br/&gt;using models, which are then enforced to ensure robust prevention of attacks. &lt;br/&gt;This framework uses novel techniques  based on static and dynamic&lt;br/&gt;analysis, symbolic evaluation, runtime checking and &lt;br/&gt;isolated execution as foundations. This project also develops&lt;br/&gt;techniques that enable a web application and a browser to&lt;br/&gt;collaborate in order to prevent attacks, and apply fine-grained&lt;br/&gt;restrictions on Web content.  The tools being developed in this project &lt;br/&gt;will have immediate impact on defending legacy web applications &lt;br/&gt;that are  vulnerable to these attacks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CAREER research project is closely tied with educational&lt;br/&gt;efforts by integrating topics on web security in the undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;and graduate computer security classrooms. Finally, a collaborative &lt;br/&gt;effort with a Chicago inner-city elementary school is also part of this &lt;br/&gt;project's educational mission.</AbstractNarration>
