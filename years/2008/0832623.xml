<AbstractNarration>This award facilitates scientific research using the large new computational resource named Blue Waters  scheduled to be deployed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It provides travel funds to support technical coordination between the principal investigators at Purdue University, the Blue Waters project team and vendor technical team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chip design faces a crisis. The 40 year process of transistor downscaling has led to atomic-scale features, making devices subject to unavoidable manufacturing irregularities at the atomic scale and to heat densities comparable to a nuclear reactor. A new approach to design that embraces the atomistic, quantum mechanical nature of the constituent materials is necessary to develop more powerful yet low energy devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic device engineering and material science must meet at the atomic scale to design new switching concepts. This demands the solution of quantum non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in systems in excess of 100 million complex degrees of freedom. Computations of this magnitude have been impossible, due to the lack of sufficiently powerful computers. Petascale computing creates an opportunity to pursue a multi-scale design approach that fuses nano scale (atomic) to the macro scale (wire), which will make possible new kinds of device designs that were previously unimaginable. The team is developing a general-purpose simulation engine. It will model electron transport in realistically extended devices using fully quantum mechanical (QM) models in an atomistic material description containing millions of atoms. Designers will be able to directly address questions of quantization and spin, tunneling, phonon interactions, and heat generation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The U. S. is a market leader in the semiconductor industry and produces many high-paying, high-technology jobs. The U. S. semiconductor industry is one of the nation&rsquo;s largest export industries and the U. S. holds one-third of the global semiconductor device market worth over $300 billion. Relentless downscaling of transistor size has continued according to Moore&rsquo;s law for the past 50 years. According to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)&mdash;an industry consortium plan for the coming years&mdash;transistor size will continue to decrease in the next 10 years, but foundational issues with currently unknown technology approaches must be pursued. The number of atoms in critical dimensions is now countable. As the materials and designs become more dependent on atomic details, the overall geometry constitutes a new material that cannot be found as such in nature. The Institute for Nanoelectronic Modeling (iNEMO)&rsquo;s software package, NEMO5, is designed to comprehend the critical multi-scale, multi-physics phenomena through efficient computational approaches and to quantitatively model new generations of nanoelectronic devices including transistors and quantum dots, as well as to predict novel device architectures and phenomena. How can new materials and device concepts be integrated to continue to improve reliability, power consumption, and processing power?</p> <p>iNEMO's research on Blue Waters has encompassed a variety of topics, including scattering effects on transistors that use quantum effects (tunnel FETs), time-resolved quantum transport, self-assembled quantum dot heterostructures, and nitride-based light emitting diodes.&nbsp;</p> <p>The current mechanism of Tunneling Field Effect Transistors (TFETs) is through quantum tunneling compared with thermal excitement in typical MOSFETs present in everyday devices. When this occurs, electrons and phonons (i.e. crystal vibrations) interact with each other and the underlying semiconductor material, which affects the device&rsquo;s performance. &nbsp;Quantum tunneling has the potential to yield significantly improved turn on-characteristics to allow lower supply voltages and better efficiency than MOSFETs. Electron transport through the overall device including the connections entails significant amounts of computationally demanding (scattering) interactions which cannot be ignored in realistic device performance predictions and these simulations agree well with experimental resistivity data. These scattering interactions were simulated in an ultra-scaled silicon TFET and quantitative results showed a significant impact on performance.</p> <p>The MHz wars of the 90s are long gone as conventional designs for transistors have peaked at about 3 GHz. Time-resolved quantum transport data allows more accurate calculation of energy/delay device characteristics during turn on for studying novel effects. Transistors turn on and off, but they do not do so instantaneously. What features of this phenomenon are important to understand? Time-resolved quantum transport simulations have been performed and initial work shows that this approach is valid up to about 1 mV/ps, which allows for the simulation of transistors up to a few GHz&mdash;in the realm of computers available today.</p> <p>Self-assembled quantum dots are highly strained heterostructures&mdash;mixed atomic elements--with optoelectronic applications such as infrared photodetectors, intermediate band solar cells, optical amplifiers, and quantum dot lasers. Atomistic strain simulations are more accurate but more expensive than analytic continuum solutions. Simulations on Blue Waters showed that both techniques indicate that the strain depends on the aspect ratio of the dot, and not on the individual dimensions. This has allowed for the formulation of a compact model of strain effects on self-assembled quantum dots.</p> <p>Multi-quantum well Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) have designs that try to increase the amount of emitted light. We all remember the key chain LEDs of the 2000s and the same technologies now allow for whole-room illumination. The LEDs have electron flow through complex quantum states and the Non-Equilibrium-Green&rsquo;s-Function (NEGF) approach has been used to model nitride-based diodes which provide blue mid-to-high power light. Strong electron-electron/phonon scattering excites elections in the wells, leading to increased light output. A multiscale, multiphysics approach allows to use more detailed models in certain part of the device, but less detail in others, thereby reducing the simulation time. NEMO5 simulations of 120 nm long devices show current (output) vs voltage(input) characteristics matching experimental results. This research has revealed details about which parts of the device design provide higher radiative recombination(i.e. light), allowing engineers to better understand the operation of these LEDs.</p> <p>Besides enabling basic engineering, physics, and materials science research, NEMO5 is used by leading semiconductor firms to design future devices. The source code, binaries and support for academic use are available through nanoHUB.org, an NSF-funded cyberinfrastructure for science.</p> <p>Future iNEMO work will enable efficient reliability predictions of modern nanodevices &ndash; a crucial milestone in their design. Atomistic deviations due to statistical and fabrication fluctuations can have increasingly large effects on a device&rsquo;s operation as devices are scaled and it is imperative to have a strong grasp on these phenomena in the coming years in order to maintain the U.S.&rsquo;s standing in the market and provide cheaper, more powerful computational power for the benefit of society.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/12/2016<br>      Modified by: Gerhard&nbsp;Klimeck</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0832623/0832623_10131478_1476291319407_Klimeck_UTB_figure--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0832623/0832623_10131478_1476291319407_Klimeck_UTB_figure--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ultra Thin Body Transistor"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0832623/0832623_10131478_1476291319407_Klimeck_UTB_figure--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ultra Thin Body Transistor"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Visualization of the atomic structure and the electrostatic potential (blue/red) in a periodic, ideal, Ultra Thin Body (UTB) device of InAs.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daniel Mejia</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gerhard&nbsp;Klimeck</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ultra Thin Body Transistor</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0832623/0832623_10131478_1476291092922_Klimeck_LED_band_DOS_density--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0832623/0832623_10131478_1476291092922_Klimeck_LED_band_DOS_density--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Multi Quantum Well LED"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0832623/0832623_10131478_1476291092922_Klimeck_LED_band_DOS_density--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Multi Quantum Well LED"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Energy-resolved electron, hole density of states (contour lines) filled with electrons and holes (color contours) of a multi well device.
