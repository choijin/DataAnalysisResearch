<AbstractNarration>Several small-scale experimental studies in classrooms by Star and Rittle-Johnson demonstrate the value of comparison in mathematics learning: Students who learned by comparing and contrasting alternative solution methods made greater gains in conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and flexibility than those who studied the same solution methods one at a time. This study will extend that prior work by developing, piloting, and then evaluating the impact of comparison on students' learning of mathematics in a full-year algebra course. Sixty Algebra I teachers will participate in a randomized controlled trial of the contrasting-examples instructional approach, using a delayed treatment design.</AbstractNarration>
