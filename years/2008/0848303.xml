<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor Amanda Bryant-Friedrich of the Chemistry Department at the University of Toledo in Toledo OH will develop highly efficient and novel methods for the generation of modified nucleic acid oligomers. The successful completion of the work described in the proposal will provide highly efficient protocols for the synthesis of sugar derivatized DNA and RNA oligonucleotides using phosphoramidite and H-phosphonate automated nucleic acid preparation techniques. These chemistries are well established and have been applied to the synthesis of a large number of modified olignucleotides. This proposal seeks to diversify this technology and make it useful for application to an even broader number of substrates. The modified oligomers that are the target of the proposal will be used for the generation of nucleic acid sugar radicals in DNA and RNA oligomers to determine the impact of oxidative damage on nucleic acid structure. The products of oxidative damage to DNA and RNA have been shown to contribute to several significant diseases. These substrates will be used for the development of biomarkers for disease initiation and progression. The systems designed in these studies will be used to develop new and sensitive analytical methods for the identification and quantification of nucleic acid damage products. These techniques and experimental outcomes are highly relevant to the understanding of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Bryant-Friedrich will train students in pharmaceutical, medicinal, and biological chemistry in the manipulation of synthetic nucleic acids, and these students will become skilled in many different types of chromatography, electrophoresis and mass spectrometry techniques. Due to the nature of the proposed investigations, students involved in these projects will be a part of a highly collaborative research program in which they will interact with scientists across disciplines, cultures and institutions. This is a vital part of the training of successful future generations of scientists. This laboratory has an excellent track record in the recruitment of minorities and women both at the graduate (10 women) and undergraduate (12 women and 4 minorities in the past four years) levels. This trend is ingrained in the culture of the laboratory and is always a significant focus in the recruitment and retention of qualified individuals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "The Creation of Tools for the Study of Reactive Intermediates in DNA and RNA" was a project designed to make chemical substrates available to the scientific community that have the capacity to illuminate the consequences of the interaction of nucleic acids with small reactive species that are formed within the body through normal respiratory processes as well as those derived from environmental sources such as ionizing irradiation.  It is a long accepted fact that damage to DNA contributes to the development of many diseases with a primary one being cancer as well as diseases of aging such as heart disease.  The role of damage to RNA is a more recently observed phenomenon which has been shown to be causative in the development of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's.  Due to the complexity of biological systems it is often difficult to determine the contributions of individual events at the molecular level to gross alterations such as the development of cancer.  We have designed and synthesized precursors of the reactive intermediates that have been observed or are proposed to form as a result of the interaction of cellular DNA and RNA with reactive oxygen species and low energy ionizing electrons. The utilization of these substrates allows for the site-specific generation of reactive chemical intermediates under controlled conditions such as those found in a cellular environment.  This allows for the determination of the actual chemical entities that can be formed in the cell and subsequently allows for studies into their stability, reactivity towards cellular components and their ability to be removed from the cell in a controlled manner.  The understanding of events at the molecular level is very important in guiding the development of new drugs, detection technologies and understanding the etiology of human diseases.  As such this knowledge guides activities to improve the human condition and to promote intellectual and economic development.  Activities involved in the elucidation of such knowledge provides an excellent training ground for students at all levels of academic preparation.  The Bryant-Friedrich laboratory finds this to be a part of a broad mission to train the best and brightest of students from all socioeconomic, racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds.  A focus on diversification of the scientific workforce is ingrained in all activities of the laboratory and have contributed greatly to the scientific success we have experienced over the years.  Through this project female, African-American, African, Hispanic and Latino as well as those who identify themselves as gay or lesbian have been trained at the state of the art of science.  Those trained in this environment who do not belong to any of these underrepresented groups have greatly benefited from learning science in this environment and have gone on to pursue graduate studies at some of the  nations top institutions.    The production of multiple manuscripts, the presentation of this work at many venues and the training of a diversity of bright and diverse students represents significant outcomes from this project.  This work will be translated into activities relevant not only in the area of biological chemistry but also the radiation sciences and DNA repair.
