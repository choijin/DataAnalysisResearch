<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: Corrosion is an interdisciplinary field that draws together fundamental aspects of the physics and chemistry of interfaces, advances in atomistic and statistical modeling and a broad range of cutting-edge characterization techniques, and applies them to issues of major societal impact. The 2008 Gordon Research Conference on Aqueous Corrosion is scheduled to be held July 20-25, 2008, at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire, USA. Presentations at the conference will cover a wide range of corrosion-related topics, but they will all fall under the conference theme: ?Aqueous Corrosion: Mechanisms, Methods and Models?. The theme of the conference and the individual subject areas have been selected to highlight the fundamental science that underpins practical solutions to corrosion problems. The preliminary list of topics is the following: Models and mechanisms at the nanoscale; High spatial and temporal resolution characterization methods; Long-term life prediction of corroding structures.  There will be speakers from academia, national labs, and industry. NON-TECHNICAL: The demographic and gender diverse mix of speakers and discussion leaders will reflect the worldwide community of people working in the field of corrosion as well as under-represented minorities or women. The conference will promote education and the scholarly pursuit of research in this technologically significant field. All attendees and students in particular, will be encouraged to present posters. In order to enhance the participation of the next generation of researchers in the field, the 2008 Gordon Conference will be immediately preceded by a ?Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar?, a two-day meeting run by and for young researchers along similar lines to the main conference, which will run on the Saturday and Sunday immediately prior to the start of the main conference. The Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar will provide an ideal opportunity for the next generation of corrosion scientists to develop their ideas and confidence in the field, fostering links with groups internationally that will enhance their future careers. The broader impacts, therefore, include student development and fostering of international exchange and good will amongst scientists world-wide. Every attempt will be made to engage women and minorities in this process. Organizers will make a concerted effort to achieve an appropriate representation of women, racial/ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities, and other individuals who have been traditionally under-represented in science. When evaluating applicants of equal merit, applicants from under-represented groups will be given preference. A web site has been set up at http://www.eng.bham.ac.uk/metallurgy/grc2008/home.htm to advertise the conference and to communicate with the corrosion community.</AbstractNarration>
