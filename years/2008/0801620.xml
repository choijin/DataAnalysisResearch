<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program (IGERT) renewal award establishes a training program focused on the science and engineering of stem cells.  New cross-cutting thrusts for Ph.D. research, together with a new multidisciplinary graduate curriculum, will integrate stem cell biology with research in biomaterials, process engineering, and computational modeling. Trainees will participate in an IGERT Research Interchange Forum to develop their abilities to communicate across disparate disciplines.  Professional development activities encompassing teaching, mentoring, and outreach will enable IGERT trainees to better realize the impact of their technological know-how.  Each IGERT trainee will be guided by an advisory constellation of scholars drawn from over 30 faculty members from Engineering, Molecular Biosciences, Physical Sciences, Business, Public Policy, and Management.  The IGERT program will leverage Rutgers' active "diversity infrastructure" to help broaden the participation of underrepresented minority students.  In addition to providing research opportunities for visiting underrepresented undergraduates, the IGERT will offer two new initiatives: a teacher-student summer institute at Rutgers, and, a bridge-to-IGERT program. New outreach programs at the intersection of stem cell science and engineering with public policy and business include: (1) an initiative with the School of Management and Labor Relations to "bundle" IGERT research and curriculum into portable modules for scientific workforce training; (2) Rutgers Business School-mediated interactions with pharmaceutical management students and industry; (3) public policy workshops with policy makers, facilitated by the Eagleton Institute of Politics.  IGERT trainees will acquire global perspectives through internships and workshops with leading stem cell researchers at over 15 sites in Europe and Asia.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The Rutgers IGERT directly impacted the advancement of over 20 PhD degrees and successfully nucleated three interdisciplinary research thrusts. The IGERT supported cross-disciplinary research at the interface of chemistry/materials science to impact stem cell fate (biology), and leveraged tools from molecular biology and engineering analysis to provide an improved view of stem cell decisions at the molecular level.  At a systems level, the IGERT projects bridged all three disciplines (biology, chemistry/materials science and engineering) to develop critical technologies needed for stem cell engineering applications.  In closing, the IGERT at Rutgers has had a transformative impact on the extent and quality of research efforts currently ongoing in regenerative biology and biomaterials at Rutgers, which hosts a leading research collaboratory in biomaterials, genetics, and proteomics.     Broader Impacts:  The overall influence of the IGERT program on broader impacts of the community of students and the educational landscape at Rutgers has been quite significant. Before the establishment of the IGERT on stem cells, there were no dedicated courses or curriculum on stem cell sciences or biotechnology at this major campus.  In addition to the formal in-class educational experiences, the IGERT also fostered a community of scholars through its interchange activity. The IGERT Research Interchange  Forums were held every three weeks for over 5 years allowing fellows to present their research to the entire IGERT group and receive feedback from faculty and other fellows. This allowed fellows to interact with potential collaborators from a variety of fields and to become educated  regarding a variety of types of stem cell research and their applications.  Further, over 16 PhD fellows visited world-class international research laboratories to gain first hand research experiences in a field related to their IGERT research.      The overall impact of the Rutgers IGERT can be gauged by the 37 site contributions at the following link, ranging from research innovations to stem cell biotechnologies to new curriculum to entrepreneurship:  http://www.igert.org/projects/150/contributions          Last Modified: 12/01/2015       Submitted by: Prabhas V Moghe]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
