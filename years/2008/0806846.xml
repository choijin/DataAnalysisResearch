<AbstractNarration>This Materials-World-Network project aims to support studies of quantum phase transitions (QPTs) by the muon spin relaxation (MuSR) measurements to be performed at high-intensity accelerator facilities, such as TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada and Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) in Villigen, Switzerland, by an international team of researchers.  The team includes senior and junior scientists from Columbia University (USA), McMaster University and TRIUMF (Canada), PSI (Switzerland), Kyoto and Tohoku Universities (Japan), Brazilian Center for Research in Physics (CBPF, Brazil) and Centro Atomico Bariloche (CAB, Argentina).  For many decades, studies of phase transitions have been performed exclusively by varying temperatures (thermal phase transitions).  Recent developments of materials and technologies have opened a new window to investigate quantum evolutions of phases at low temperatures by varying pressure or composition as a tuning parameter.  Many novel concepts and unexplored features of QPTs are being revealed in studies of heavy-fermion systems, frustrated / low-dimensional magnets and exotic superconductors.   Taking advantage of unique capability of MuSR to detect magnetic order of even very small / random magnetic moments, to estimate volume fraction of magnetically ordered regions in a situation involving phase separation, and to characterize dynamic spin fluctuations in a very wide time window complementary to other techniques, the present project will elucidate magnetic QPT's in frustrated square-lattice J1-J2 spin systems, doped magnetic semiconductors (Ga,Mn)As and (Fe,Co)Si, novel ruthenium oxide compounds, quasi one-dimensional spin system which exhibits Bose Condensation of magnons, as well as UGe2 and other heavy-fermion systems.  Extensive collaboration of leading researchers in materials development (Kyoto, Tohoku), MuSR measurements (Columbia, McMaster), MuSR instrumentation (TRIUMF, PSI), Moessbauer effect (CBPF), and heavy-fermion physics (CAB), at the world's strongest meson facilities (TRIUMF and PSI) with close involvement of leading theorist team members (Affleck, Maekawa, Millis), will advance basic understandings of the role of competing states and soft dynamic modes near quantum phase boundaries.  Such progress could contribute to long-awaited determination of mechanisms for novel superconductors as well as to development of ideal magnetic semiconductors suitable for application to spin-sensitive transistors. Involvement of students and postdoctoral researchers from all participating institutions provides valuable training and international research experience to young scientists in a challenging area of cutting-edge research in condensed matter physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses large accelerator facilities and principles from particle/nuclear physics to study a variety of materials including novel superconductors to understand properties related to magnetism and quantum physics not accessible to other techniques in this research area. An international team of researchers will conduct the main part of their measurements at TRIUMF, a Canadian accelerator facility in Vancouver, British Columbia. The research is focused on understanding novel condensed matter phenomena in a variety of materials systems including semiconductors and oxide compounds that exhibit interesting magnetic behavior.  Students and junior scientists from the US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Switzerland and Japan work together in this project and gain valuable international research experience. In addition, web-based courses and seminars for graduate, undergraduate students are planned to be developed and shared among all participating institutions using the technology already available at Columbia University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the Office of International Science and Engineering ?East Asia and pacific Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In modern condensed matter physics, researchers study materials having special properties, such as ferromagnets / antiferromagnets in which magnetic moments of certain electrons align parallel / antiparallel to each other, or superconductivity where electronic resistance of the material completely vanishes.  These states, achieved by a breaking of symmetry from more random and isotropic situation at high temperatures, are defined to have an "ordered phase" of matter.  Transition from the ordered to disordered phase could occur not only by raising temperature (thermal transition) but also by keeping the system at very low temperatures while changing other "tuning parameters", such as density of charge carriers, applied pressure, and external magnetic field.  This evolution at low temperatures is called quantum phase transition.  The present project aims to study details of quantum and thermal phase transitions of unconventional superconductors and novel magnetic systems by using positive muon spin relaxation (MuSR) methods at accelerator facilities TRIUMF (Canada) and PSI (Switzerland).  Extensive experimental researches have been carried out by the PIÆs team from Columbia (US), in collaboration with groups from McMaster (Canada), CBPF (Brazil), Tohoku, Kyoto, Tokyo, and Osaka Universities and Japan Atomic Energy Agency (Japan), Institute of Physics in Beijing (China) and PSI (Switzerland).  MuSR is a new and powerful probe for magnetic phase transitions, having a few definite advantages over other standard techniques.  For example, unlike neutron scattering and magnetization measurements, MuSR can detect static magnetic order with information of both the volume of the ordered region and the magnitude of the ordered moment obtained separately from each other.  Neutron studies require large bulk specimens, while MuSR can be performed both with bulk and thin-film specimens.  As a notable contribution to intellectual merit, the present project demonstrated phase separation and first-order quantum phase transition at the boundary of ordered and disordered phases in a frustrated spin system Cu(Cl,Br)LaNb2O7 in collaboration with Prof. Hiroshi Kageyama of Kyoto Univ. (Japan) (Physical Review B 2009).  Similar quantum evolution was previously discovered by the PIÆs group (Nature Physics 2007)  at the boundary between helically ordered and disordered magnetic states of an itinerant-electron magnet MnSi tuned by applied pressure.  In collaboration with the group of Prof. Hideo Ohno of Tohoku Univ. (Japan), the present project also revealed phase separation in the border of paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states of a prototypical magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As in a quantum evolution tuned by Mn doping (Nature Materials 2010).  These results have highlighted importance of first-order transitions where the magnitude of the ordered magnetic moment varies discontinuously at the phase boundary.   New high-temperature superconductors based on FeAs layers were discovered in 2008.  This allowed extensive collaboration of the PIÆs group with that of Prof. Elisa Saitovitch (CBPF, Brazil) in studies of magnetic order using both MuSR and 57Fe Moessbauer effect.  Complementary features of these two local probes elucidated magnetic properties of the so-called 42622 FeAs systems and EuFe2As2 (Physical Review B 2011).   Before the present project started, the PI made extensive studies on unconventional superconductors, frustrated magnetic systems and itinerant-electron magnets.  The present project allowed the PI to add new studies of magnetic semiconductors.  In collaboration with groups of Hideo Ohno (Tohoku) and Elvezio Morenzoni (PSI), the PIÆs team demonstrated high spatial homogeneity of ferromagnetically ordered state in (Ga,Mn)As in the metallic region (Nature Materials 2010).  In collaboration with the group of C.Q.Jin (IOP Beijing), the PI has led development of a new ferromagnetic semiconductor Li(Zn,Mn)As based on the I-II-V semiconductor ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
