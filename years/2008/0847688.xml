<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important issues in the geosciences is the growing disparity between the workforce needs and our ability to produce well trained students.  This project is examining whether inquiry-based approaches to education and research can aid us in this challenge.  This examination builds on an internally funded course revision project at Miami University that is converting an introductory geology courses from lecture-based to inquiry-based.  The inquiry-based approach is also a natural one to investigate an exciting new observation that faults on the edges of tectonic plates produce episodic tremor and slip (ETS) that represents a previously unrecognized type of deformation that occurs on time scales in between impulsive damaging earthquakes and slow geologic creeping.  In response to these recent developments, this project has the following integrated research and teaching initiatives:&lt;br/&gt;- expand the inquiry-based learning approach to other courses by 1) developing a new workshop to train high school instructors how to use an inquiry-based approach in an advanced placement environmental science class and by 2) constructing a new second-course at the college level that focuses on how physical processes associated with plate tectonics relate to geologic hazards.  These efforts are critical to ensure that students are practicing the scientific method not just memorizing the outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;- expand the investigations of ETS behavior by 1) searching for ETS in a global context using newly developed detection algorithms and by 2) investigating the spatial and temporal relationships between tremor, slow slip, earthquakes, and geologic structures through longer-term recording of ETS signals at fortified temporary networks.  These efforts are critical for better understanding the physics of how faults move and generate hazards.&lt;br/&gt;- expand the student research experience by 1) offering undergraduate research to a larger set of students including an investigation into what makes a successful research project and by 2) experimenting with online research discussion both in classes and with collaborating research groups.  These efforts are helping to identify key areas for improvement in the integration of teaching and research.  &lt;br/&gt;The integrated teaching and research plan of this project is designed to achieve 3 broader impact outcomes that address the key issue of preparing a scientifically trained workforce:  &lt;br/&gt;- encourage students to consider a scientific career by exposing them earlier to scientific experiences that have intrinsic motivation (i.e., AP credit or personal interest in hazards)&lt;br/&gt;- retain science majors and graduate students by having them work on newly developed areas of research (i.e., ETS) that address problems of high societal importance (i.e., what causes earthquakes)&lt;br/&gt;- improve students' scientific training through more regular use of the scientific method.  &lt;br/&gt;To determine whether the teaching and research initiatives are leading to the desired broader impact outcomes, this project is utilizing and developing an extensive set of assessment tools with help from the Assessment Office at Miami University.  The results of these assessments as well as the tools developed to achieve the outcomes are being made publically available, and the teaching and research findings are being prepared for both international teaching and research conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.  The integrated initiatives are specifically designed to maximize the number of students who can be impacted by this work, such that 10s of students per year are being guided to function as scientists, instead of just learning about scientific results.</AbstractNarration>
