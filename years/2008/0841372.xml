<AbstractNarration>Savannah State University (SSU), the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, and the Savannah Chatham Public School System (SCPSS) will engage graduate students, scientists, and K-12 teachers and students in a sustainable research-based education program to promote ocean literacy, science education, and research in coastal Georgia.  The goal of the ?Building Ocean Literacy Program? is to expand ocean literacy and cultivate research skills in K-12 classrooms while developing graduate student skills in communicating science concepts to people beyond the research community.  The program will pair marine science GK-12 fellows from a historically black university (SSU) with master science teachers and classes within the SCPSS.  African-American students are over-represented in the SCPSS compared to the national average and the program will reach a wide and diverse audience.  Fellows will engage classes in estuarine monitoring and in their graduate research activities to enhance research skills and ocean literacy in the school system.  New graduate coursework will develop communication and teaching skills among GK-12 fellows, while teacher training opportunities will enhance teacher awareness of marine issues.  Research activities of GK-12 fellows, teachers, and public school students, will focus on the local estuarine ecosystem and will directly support Georgia Performance Standards.  Research and instructional components of this project will collectively 1) promote ocean literacy in K-12 classrooms, 2) enhance K-12 science instruction in Chatham County public schools, and 3) train the next generation of scientists to be competent, comfortable, and engaged in communicating science concepts to a wide array of audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) Program supported fellowships and training for graduate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  The goal of the program was to provide opportunities for graduate students to improve their communication skills by fostering interactions with teachers and students in K-12 schools and to enrich STEM content and instruction in K-12 schools.   From 2009 through 2016 in partnership with the Savannah Chatham County Public School System (SCPSS) in Savannah Georgia, the University of Georgia Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO) collaborated with Savannah State University (SSU) to host the GK-12 program "Ocean Literacy in a Coastal Community through Science Education and Estuarine Monitoring".  SSU is a historically black university that offers graduate degrees (MS) in Marine Sciences, SkIO is an internationally respected oceanographic research institute, and African-American students are over-represented in the SCPSS compared to the national average.  The goals of this project were to 1) build Ocean Literacy and sustainable partnerships at SSU that would enhance both education and research in the Southeast USA and 2) to increase the engagement of underrepresented students in the ocean sciences.   The components of the program included 1) engaging SSU graduate students in coastal relevant research, 2) pairing graduate students with K-12 educators to assist in teaching and infuse K-12 classrooms with Ocean Literacy content.
