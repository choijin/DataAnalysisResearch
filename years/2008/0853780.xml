<AbstractNarration>0853780&lt;br/&gt;Sayler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research effort focuses on the development of a closed loop sense-and-respond biotherapeutic sensor for thyroid hormone control.  With an objective towards biological engineering of "humanized" lux-based bioluminescent bioreporters for autonomous sensing of hyper and hypothyroid states, it is hypothesized that new biophotonic silicon platforms can be fabricated to intelligently diagnosis and respond to health related insults.  The intellectual merit of this research advances our understanding of coordinate multi-gene expression in mammalian cell lines and promotes novel strategies for controlling gene expression in mammalian cells using electrical induction.  The research has broader impacts and benefits society because it structures a new foundation for future lab-on-chip array sensors for metabolic monitoring in blood, breath, saliva, urine, and perspiration and for applications in in vivo whole-body imaging.  The multidisciplinary nature of the research additionally promotes teaching, training, and learning at a level where the boundaries of biology and engineering merge, thus creating a cross-training regimen critical to advancing the biotechnological knowledge of participating graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

Diagnostic devices that complement theranostic biotherapies require elements capable of sensing when body systems are out of balance and autonomously responding with appropriate countermeasures. To move toward such a device, this research project focused on the creation of human reporter cells designed to autonomously emit bioluminescent light in real-time when exposed to changing physiological states. This strategy required a synthetic biology approach that re-configured the nucleic acid sequence of the bioluminescent bacterial luciferase (lux) operon to allow it to function in human cells. The advantage of bacterial luciferase over other more common light-generating reporter systems like firefly luciferase is that every component of the bioluminescent reaction is fully provided for by the cell itself, thereby allowing light to be produced continuously with no additions of extraneous substrates or other required manipulations. These characteristics are critical for maintaining these reporter cells as independent sensing elements that could, for example, be implanted within the body to continuously monitor for out-of-range therapeutic states. We have demonstrated such functionality within mouse models and further demonstrated the parallel sensing capabilities of our reporter cells in non-animal cell-based assays. We have also developed an integrated circuit microluminometer that can detect the light signals being produced from reporter cells to create an all-in-one biosensor unit for intelligent (and perhaps implantable) medical surveillance. To form a closed-loop sense-and-respond device, genes capable of being activated by electrical pulses were identified, which may allow the integrated circuit to both sense the light response and react to it via emission of an electrical pulse that activates specific reactive genes within the cell.
