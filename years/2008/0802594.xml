<AbstractNarration>The project will provide for the operation and management of the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) summer workshops and the fall GEM mini-workshop that takes place annually in conjunction with the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union.  The GEM workshops are a critical part of the GEM program.  A major portion of the funding goes to support the travel and subsistence costs of approximately 60 students each year (both graduate and undergraduates).  The educational impacts of the student participation in GEM is one of the major goals of the GEM program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to provide the logistics suppoert and venue for workshops that promote progress in the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Program.  The GEM program is an NSF targeted research program with the scientific goal "to understand the soar-terrestrial system well enough to be able to formulate a mathematical framework that can predict the deterministic properties of geospace (weather in space) and the statistical charactyeristics of its stocastic properties (climate in space)."  Two workshops per year are supported.  The major GEM event is a week-long summer workshop at which researchers gather to collaborate, discuss the latest developments, and plan for future work.  These workshops have come to define GEM and its unique approach to collaborative science.  The GEM workshops have become an important annual gathering for magnetospheric physicists, both US and international.  The summer workshop is supplemented with a 1-day mini-workshop in December held in conjunction with the meeting of the American Geophysical Union.  While the GEM program addresses forefront science, the workshops are also important to promoting prefessional development of students and early-career scientists.  Most of the financial support in this project is utilized to support workshop attendence by graduate students and some early-career scientists and the occasional exceptional undergraduate student.  The workshops have special tutorial programs devoted to, and organized by the students.  There are two student representatives, elected by the students, that serve 2-year terms on the GEM steering committee.   Steering committee meetings are also organized at the end of both the summer workshop and the December mini-workshop.  GEM Summer workshops were held during June 22 -27, 2008 at the Zermatt resort in Midland, Utah and 60 Students were supported to attend this workshop; during June 21 - 29, 2009 in Snowmass, Colorado and 61 students were supported and 153 scientists participated; during June 20 - 25, 2010 in Snowmass, Colorado and 59 students were supported and 159 scientists participated; during June 25 - July 1, 2011 jointly with the CEDAR workshop in Santa Fe, New Mexico and 64 GEM students were fully supported and 9 students received partial support and 180 scientist registered.  GEM mini-workshops are organized in San Francisco on the Sunday afternoon prior to the December Meeting of the American Geophysical Union.  These were held in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.   Focus groups can push forward their activities at this meeting and the GEM Steering Committee is able to meet and consider various aspects of the GEM program and workshops.
