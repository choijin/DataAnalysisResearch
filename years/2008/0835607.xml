<AbstractNarration>0835607 &lt;br/&gt;Schnoor &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamics of water and the role of humans in the water cycle are not well understood largely because: (a) environmental and socio-economic analyses have traditionally been performed separately; and (b) the methods, tools, and data needed for true multidisciplinary work do not exist. In the absence of a full understanding of coupled human-natural system dynamics, there is a risk of unintended consequences (e.g., increased nutrient pollution, Gulf Hypoxia, greenhouse gas emissions, and food prices as a result of a government policy to improve energy independence through agricultural production of corn for biofuels). This project's overarching goal is to develop a prototype cyberinfrastructure-based intelligent digital watershed (IDW) that enables discovery and innovation in ways never before possible. IDW will facilitate novel insights into human/environment interactions through multi-disciplinary research focused on watershed-related processes at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Project objectives are to: (a) Determine the time delay between socio-economic decisions in land management practices and the resulting water quality at multiple scales, (b) Discover patterns, emergent behavior, dynamic interactions and underlying principles from the integration of heterogeneous data collected or generated by multi-disciplinary simulation models, (c) Develop computational intelligence to fill-in data gaps, and improve model parameterization, and (d) Determine needs (data transformation, knowledge extraction/representation, and visualization) for a real-time, multi-domain cyberinfrastructure system using distributed resources to engage a variety of users in watershed science &amp; management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Use of the novel IDW will enable the prediction of stream-flow and water quality fluxes based on rainfall runoff forecasts and human-management decisions, including dependencies on hydrologic, biogeochemical, and anthropogenic parameters (e.g., vegetation, subsurface structure, land use and cover). The associated fluxes, stores, and properties will be combined to determine estimates of water quality and quantity at the watershed-scale level. Direct benefits of the research will be: (a) creating prototype tools and technology needed to collect near real-time data related to land use; (b) understanding the impact of local land-use decisions on stream water quality at multiple scales; and (c) enhancing the eco-hydrological data management systems currently used to monitor water quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The broader benefit of the proposed research will be an increased understanding of how humans: (a) process information about natural systems, (b) make decisions under uncertainty, and (c) evaluate social and environmental impacts of technological change and substitution among competing societal objectives. First, the modeling and cyberinfrastructure approaches proposed in this research are applicable not only to the emerging observatory effort led by the WATERS Network community, but to many other disciplines where distributed databases are used for decision making. The domain studied in this research makes a useful test-bed for envisioned applications of research in energy, medicine, technology, and other domains. Such generalizations are suggested by general systems theory and the similarities among nonlinear, complex, coupled human behavioral and natural science systems. Second, the Intelligent Digital Watershed operates on a web-based platform, so anyone with internet access will be able to benefit from the research including environmental specialists, engineers, hydrologists, regulators, non-governmental organizations, environmental consulting firms, and academic institutions. Broader impacts will include the capability to utilize this Intelligent Digital Watershed in problem-based learning (PBL) like the Invent Iowa Program, a network of 30,000 active student participants (K-12).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Final Project Outcomes Report to the NSF  CDI-Type II:  Understanding Water-Human Dynamics using an Intelligent Digital Watershed  P.I.: Jerald L. Schnoor  May, 2013   The overall goal of the project was to develop a prototype cyberinfrastructure for an intelligent digital watershed (IDW) of Clear Creek, Iowa, in an agricultural setting (watershed area, 270 km2) which enables scientific discovery, visualization, and innovation in water science and engineering.  IDW facilitates insight into human/environment interactions through multi-disciplinary research focused on watershed-related processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales.  In the end, it's designed to inform better the decision-making process of watershed farmers, managers and policy makers.   Project objectives were to:  a)         Determine how farmers make economic decisions concerning their land and crop choices by developing a model of their behavior (an agent-based model) using data for the model obtained by a survey of farmers  b)         Link the agent-based model of farmerÆs economic behavior to water quality models so that the farmerÆs decisions are simulated to result in changes in water quality, crop yields, and soil erosional losses  c)         Develop statistical and numerical computer models (computational evolution) to make use of a large amount of water quantity data (stream discharge, precipitation, and meteorological data) and real-time measurements of water quality parameters in Clear Creek (nitrate, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH, conductivity, temperature)  d)         Determine what data is needed to develop such a cyberinfrastructure system which is capable of projecting on-farm decisions into economic and environmental performance under various alternative scenarios like increased crop prices and/or biofuel production in the Midwest.  The economics group made several interesting findings in this research related to farmers in Clear Creek watershed and their land management choices. There are a substantial number of part-time farmers in the watershed because of its proximity to urbanized areas of Iowa City and Cedar Rapids. Generally, there is very little "continuous corn" crop rotation reported and a substantial level of "no-till corn/bean" rotations employed according to the project survey responses.  Thus, there appears to be substantial employment of conservation practices in the watershed already. However, we found that farmers who work large acreages are more likely to engage in more intensive and potentially environmentally-damaging activities than small farmers.  Analysis of the survey results demonstrated that female respondents had significantly lower levels of knowledge about "best management practices" than men and significantly more positive attitudes towards conservation and collaboration than men. Meanwhile, women looked to the same sources for conservation information as male respondents, including conservation agencies like the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Cooperative Extension, and the Farm Service Agency.  In completing the project, the team produced research papers and conference presentations on all four of the objectives.  An economic survey was completed of farmersÆ opinions on which crops to plant under various economic conditions and how much fertilizer to apply.  This information allowed development of the socio-economic Agent Based Model (ABM) for agricultural decisions and was successfully linked with the ag-runoff model SWAT model in a complete loop. In the process, we put together a computer cyberinfrastructure utilizing streaming data, the open access internet, various computers, servers, real-time sensor measurements, digital elevation models, USGS stream discharge measurements, NEXRAD radar information, and the Iowa Mesonet tipping bucket precipitation data.  We call this end-to-end amalgamation of data and information, "An Intelligent Digital Watershed".  Some important outcomes of the research i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
