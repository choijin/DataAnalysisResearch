<AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Philip Coppens and his team will develop X-ray diffraction methods for the detailed study of photo-induced processes in solids.  Chemistry is often referred to as a science of molecular change; studies of reaction mechanism are therefore central to chemistry. The studies are designed to increase our understanding of photo-chemical processes in which light is converted into chemical energy.  The research uses a combination of crystallography, spectroscopy and theoretical calculations to study chemical reactions which take place in either pure crystals or in multi-component framework-forming supramolecular solids.  The latter offer great versatility and therefore the opportunity to observe the effect of the molecular environment on reactivity.  This includes the influence of steric restrictions imposed by the crystal matrix on the reaction rate and the conformation of the product, the effect of the chirality of the cavity walls on the nature of the product, and the effect of host-guest energy transfer which can enhance the reactivity or suppress it, depending on the direction of the transfer.  Concurrent with these activities, the Coppens group will continue development of the University at Buffalo Databank of transferable aspherical atoms,including application of aspherical atom scattering factors, their use in the calculation of the electrostatic component of intermolecular interactions beyond the point charge model, and charge density analysis of complexes with controversial bonding situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of chemical reactivity at the atomic level is relevant for our understanding of chemical reaction mechanisms in general including catalytic and physiological important processes.  The project concerns a frontier area of science which is pursued in many laboratories across the world.  One of its aims is to keep the US competitive in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Molecules are always in motion, but their motion is usually so fast that they and their properties may change in less that a millionths of a second.  Many processes that we encounter in daily life are dependent on those very rapid changes of molecules.  Examples are chemical reactions in which new molecules are formed as happens for example when sunlight strikes the human skin, when light is emitted by OLED's (Organic Light Emitting Diodes), which are now rapidly replacing light bulbs and even the new compact fluorescent lamps, as most importantly also in  life processes happening in our bodies.     It is therefore most important to study such processes on very short timescales so we can understand how they work and how we can change them in a beneficial way.  That is what time-resolved studies are about.  In our project we are studying how light emission depends on the nature of molecules and how and how fast exactly they change during emisison of light.  This depends not only on the molecules  but also on their environment.  Therefore, by changing the environment we may manipulate those properties and learn how to improve devices.  More specifically, we are using a tool for doing the equivalent of very fast-frame-motion pictures using the scattering of X-ray by crystals By combining Laser pules and following X-ray pulses, we image the structure of molecules in crystals, and the  rapid structural responses to light by molecules. They occur very short time scales--millionths of a millionth of a second, or picoseconds.       Last Modified: 07/30/2013       Submitted by: Philip Coppens]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
