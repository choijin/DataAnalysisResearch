<AbstractNarration>The analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research project of Prof. Amy walker of the University of Texas at Dallas. Prof. Walker and her students will develop methods for chemically selective deposition of metals on organic thin films and apply these methods to construct complex multilayer structures. The reliable production of stable metallic contacts to organic thin films is critical in many technologies, including polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs) and molecular and organic electronics. Fundamental to this goal is a quantitative understanding of the interactions of deposited metals with the terminal functional groups in organic films. Prof. Walker and her students will define and explore these critical interactions using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as model systems. The study will focus on the deposition of aluminum, copper, nickel, platinum, palladium and gold. These metals all have important applications as contacts in molecular-, organic- and magneto- electronic devices. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to students who wish to train in the cutting edge research of molecular electronics.</AbstractNarration>
