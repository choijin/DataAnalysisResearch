<AbstractNarration>This award establishes a humanoid robotics facility at the University of California, Merced to be used by cognitive scientists and engineers to investigate (1) how embodiment constrains models of human cognition, (2) how people naturally interact with humanoid robots, and (3) how the design of robotic control systems can best address the cognitive issues surrounding human-robot interaction.  The centerpieces of this facility will be a fully mobile humanoid robot and a humanoid torso equipped with two human-like dexterous arms and a vision system mounted on a fully actuated head. Though much work on humanoid robots has focused on solving fundamental engineering problems associated with robust operation in real world environments, the proposed facility will support research that uses the robot as an instrument to test hypotheses of human cognition or that augments robotic capabilities in a manner sensitive to the cognitive limitations of human-robot coordination.  As a scientific instrument, a humanoid robot can be used to present precise, controlled motions and patterns of interaction to human experimental participants, offering new methods for probing human responding in interactive contexts.  The embodied perceptual and motor capabilities of such a robot also make it a challenging testbed for computational models of human cognitive processes.  Developing cognitive systems that appropriately support human-robot interaction will reify and test our understanding of embodied perception, humanoid motor coordination, and cooperative interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed facility is also intended to support interdisciplinary research at the boundary between cognitive science and engineering. Emerging cognitive research on human-robot interaction has the potential to transform robotics research and result in practical innovations in the design of humanoid robot control systems.  These additional engineering contributions will be extremely valuable, as robots will be equipped with physical and cognitive abilities that are appropriate for human environments, and with communication and coordination skills that are appropriate for human-robot collaboration.  Indeed, robotic assistants have already demonstrated potential in numerous application areas, including physical therapy, care for the elderly and disabled, collaborative work, and astronaut support during space exploration.  Though recent technological innovations have allowed for the development of reliable and affordable robotic mechanisms that mimic human bodies, many questions related to the intelligent control of these bodies remain.  By supporting the exploration of models of human cognition within a robotic framework, and by generally applying insights from cognitive science to the problems of embodied perception and motor control, practical progress is expected in domains such as locomotion in cluttered environments, spatial awareness and spatial reasoning, dexterous object manipulation, task-oriented attention and perception, imitation and learning, life long adaptation, and multi-modal social interaction and coordination with humans, including the use of natural gestures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This facility will advance the development of integrated research and teaching programs at UC Merced, a new campus located in an economically challenged region with low educational levels.  The availability of this equipment will grant students access to unique training opportunities in Cognitive Science, Artificial Intelligence, Motion Planning, Computer Graphics, Computer Animation, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Robot Algorithms, and Humanoid Robotics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
