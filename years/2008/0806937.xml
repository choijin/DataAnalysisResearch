<AbstractNarration>This Materials World Network (MWN) award supports a joint research project between Rutgers University (RU) and French counterparts in Ecole Polytechnique (EP) and at Centre de Saclay (CEA) to build a "Lab without walls" for predictive understanding of correlated electron materials. These are materials, in which the effects of electron interactions are unusually strong, and as a consequence they exhibit a range of new and exciting behavior; their remarkable properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, anomalous thermoelectricity, and ultrafast optical nonlinearities, continue to surprise the condensed matter and materials community.  The electronic structure of these materials is not well described by the standard models of solid state physics.  This award will strengthen the existing collaboration between RU, EP and CEA by building a cyber-lab to advance the frontiers of our understanding of correlated materials using new computational tools based on Dynamical Mean Field Theory. The goal of the proposed research is to harness the unique functionalities of correlated electron materials to demonstrate the premise that material design using these materials is possible, thus getting closer to the practical design of materials with useful features. Two test projects will be pursued, the design of pigments with yellow and blue color based on rare earth oxides, fluorides and sulfides such as Ce2O3 and the optimization of the thermoelectric figure of merit in a the class of marcasite transition metals pnictides such as FeSb2. The first project would help understand the optical properties of coloring pigments that are environmentally-responsible and the second project relates to energy conversion potential of an interesting materials system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in rational material design using strongly correlated materials will have significant implications. Classes of natural and artificial compounds with desirable properties will be identified using theory and computation which would help improve currently employed trial and error procedures that are expensive and time consuming. The concepts and computational tools generated by this international lab without walls will be disseminated widely (workshops, web-access to database etc.) so as to have great impact in the future search for better materials within the class of correlated electron systems, speeding up material discovery in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In parallel with the research efforts, this project will develop new pedagogical tools for visualizing unique properties of these materials, and for conceptualizing and teaching the theory behind their extraordinary functionality. This project includes training of a postdoctoral researcher as well as graduate and undergraduate students by fully involving them in the international research and education experience of developing computational tools for designing new materials with useful physical properties. This Materials World Network project called "Lab without walls" will, thus, integrate research and education efforts on correlated electron materials from different segments of the world community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The growing awareness that fossil fuels are both finite and in their burning detrimental to the environment has caused tremendous efforts in finding alternative, renewable energy sources. One such source is the convergence of a heat gradient into electricity, commonly referred to as thermoelectricity. To date, the low convergence efficiency has been restricted the use of thermoelectric devices to very specialized applications (such as the use in outer space : voyager and pioneer spacecrafts). However, the general increase in cost of conventional energy sources, as well as the discovery of novel materials with promising properties has renewed the interest in this physical effect.           Indeed, recently the largest ever to be measured power factor &ndash; a quantity related to the thermoelectric convergence performance &ndash; was found for the narrow gap semi-conductor FeSb2. Furthermore, this compound exhibits large similarities with the material FeSi, a well studied, yet poorly understood intermetallic. Indeed both these compounds are insulating at low temperatures, with magnetic susceptibilities and resistivities that follow conventional activation laws. Yet, at temperatures that correspond to only a fraction of the energetic cost to thermally excite an electron across the insulating gap, both materials metallize. Moreover, a Curie-Weiss susceptibility develops &ndash; a phenomenon unheard of in ordinary semiconductors such as silicon or GaAs.           Using recently developed many-body ab-initio theoretical method, which can realistically describe such complex correlated materials, we studied FeSi, FeSb2, as well as FeAs2 with the hope to elucidate (a) the microscopic origin of the temperature induced crossover mentioned above, and (b) the physical mechanism at the heart of the large thermoelectric response.           With our first principles theoretical methodology we were able to quantitatively reproduce the signatures of the insulator-to-metal crossover for a large panoply of experimental observables, such as photoemission spectra, optical conductivities, neutron form factors, as well as, in the case of FeSi, the Seebeck coefficient (see Figure 1). The latter connects the induced voltage difference to the size of the applied heat gradient. This validates our theoretical approach, and gives us new insights into a novel microscopic scenario that explains the puzzles of FeSi in terms of a decoherence crossover that is powered by electron-electron interactions[1]. With this insight, we made explicit predictions on how to improve thermoelectrical conversion in FeSi, namely by pushing the coherence temperature of the system to higher values through iso-electronic substitution of iron with ruthenium[2]. This proposal awaits experimental scrutiny.           In the case of FeSb2 our studies revealed that, contrary to previous belief, electronic correlations alone are not able to account for the enormously large Seebeck coefficient[3]. We proposed that non-electronic effects, in particular the so-called phonon-drag effect, propelled by the coupling of electronic degrees of freedom to the atomic lattice, play the major role in this compound. Unfortunately such phono-drag effect make FeSb technologically unsuitable for further exploration.  Subsequently our prediction was also substantiated through experimental evidence.           Using our theoretica ab-initio description of solids, we addressed the nature of correlated electroni state in archetypical transition metal oxide, Sr2RuO4, for which the mechanism behind its puzzling properties was poorly understood before. We showeed that the Hund's rule coupling in a solid state environmet and its tendency to favor local high spin state in material is responsible for its puzzling properties [4].         Without a basic comprehension of materials that are exhibiting certain desirable properties, there is no guidance for chemists and experimentalist on how to enhance these prop...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
