<AbstractNarration>Free on-line learning promises to transform the educational landscape of the United States through a significant broadening of supplemental educational opportunities for low income and minority students who do not have access to high quality private tutoring to supplement their in school education. The proposed solution is to develop a technological augmentation to available human support in a lightly staffed Virtual Math Teams (VMT) environment as well as deploying conversational agents that are triggered by automatically detected conversational events and that have the ability to elicit valuable collaborative behavior such as reflection, help seeking, and help provision. This project brings together expertise in technological development and careful experimentation both in the lab and in the classroom, a track record for large scale deployment of educational materials, and a solid foundation in significant student learning results in collaborative environments. The project builds on results from a pilot project in which the team has built VMT-Basilica, which is a technical infrastructure for supporting collaborative problem solving, as well as having conducted pilot studies with it in an on-line setting with promising results. The VMTs use the infrastructure provided by the Math Forum. This project also contributes to the general development of intelligent agents to aid collaboration in a wide variety of settings where collaboration support is needed. By bringing together research in education environments and in computer based intelligent agents, this project is potentially transformative in both computer science and mathematics education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the potential to bring mathematics to a national community since the development of these agents will substantially reduce the amount of time a human must monitor VMT collaborations. VMTs operate primarily out of the classroom and act as supplemental work for students learning mathematics. In addition, since the collaboration support provided by these agents is not specific to mathematics problem solving, agent supported collaboration could be expanded to any field where collaboration needs to be supported - from education to business to the military.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key research goal of "Dynamic Support for Virtual Math Teams" was to experimentally learn broadly applicable principles for supporting the development of student skills in effective collaborative problem solving. The project explored (a) the design of a collaboration environment, (b) the incorporation of dynamic-geometry workspaces, (c) the intervention of conversational software agents and (d) the refinement of curricular guidance.  (a)   The Virtual Math Teams (VMT) online environment was developed, debugged, tested, fielded and refined through many iterative cycles of design-based research. It is now robust enough for public usage at the Math ForumÆs free site. See http://vmt.mathforum.org.    (b)   GeoGebra&mdash;the open-source software for dynamic geometry, developed with NSF support&mdash;was incorporated into the VMT environment.

(c)   Software agents were tested under various conditions by students working in small teams using the VMT software. Student content included high school combinatorics mathematics, middle school dynamic geometry, middle school biology, college chemistry and college engineering. The experiments with biology students are discussed at length in Productive Multivocality (Suthers, et al., 2013, Springer).  (d)   Curricular guidance was extensively explored for introducing middle school students to the core concepts of dynamic geometry&mdash;see Topics in Dynamic Geometry for Virtual Math Teams (Stahl, 2013).  The project resulted in at least 78 publications or presentations&mdash;see http://gerrystahl.net/vmt/altpubs.html.

Agents should not be designed to have a dominant role or to pretend to have human cognitive powers or knowledge.  (d)   Curricular materials are important to guide student discourse in an online setting where there is no teacher playing a central role. The materials should be challenging and should stimulate student creativity. Engaged student groups can interpret the materials appropriately and plan their own responses to the materials.  The Virtual Math Teams Project has developed a comprehensive approach to collaborative learning of geometry: an online environment for small teams of students to meet in, a multi-user version of GeoGebra, other appropriate digi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
