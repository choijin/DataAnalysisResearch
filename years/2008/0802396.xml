<AbstractNarration>The project is developing and implementing a Nanotechnology Technician Education degree program by adapting existing curricula and developing new curricula. The program is a third degree track in the college's Advanced Manufacturing Technology degree program (the other two tracks are Manufacturing Engineering Technology and Polymer Manufacturing Technology). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new degree option is strongly supported by regional organizations and industry.  The 42 project partners include 29 industry partners who are supporting curriculum development and/or are providing internship and employment opportunities for students. In addition to developing new curricula for this program, the college is adapting elements of a nanotechnology undergraduate program developed by project partner University of Virginia, which is also providing training equipment and curriculum development support. The primary audience for the new program is graduating high school seniors, as well as local adult workers who are seeking career re-training due to loss of a great number of the region's traditional jobs in textiles manufacturing and tobacco. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nanotechnology Education degree program is being managed by Danville Community College's Workforce Services and housed in its Regional Center for Advanced Technology and Training, a new 24,000-square-foot high-tech facility designed to support high-level scientific training programs such as nanotechnology education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Technician-level employees that are well-trained in the topics of nano science and the operation of high-level lab equipment work with researchers to discover and develop improved materials, medical procedures, medical cures, new energy sources, and a myriad of other potential technological discoveries through the application of nano technology (technology at less than 100 billionth meter scale).  Discoveries using the techniques and equipment of nanotechnology are likely to be revolutionary.  Nanotechnology has the potential to impact all traditional-scale technology.   Danville Community College (Virginia) (DCC) received funding to develop and implement a technician-level training program in nanotechnology from NSFÆs Advanced Technology Education (ATE) program.  As a result, an AAS degree in Nanotechnology Education was developed and offered in Fall semester, 2011.  DCC is the only community college in the state of Virginia that offers a degree in nanotechnology. Over forty companies signed the proposal to NSF, indicating a need for technician-level training in nano and micro technologies in the Virginia / North Carolina region.  Presently, six students are enrolled, and the first graduates are expected in Fall, 2014.  These students are being trained to assist PhD researchers by performing routine tests, calibrations and troubleshooting of equipment used in the characterization and measurement of nano phenomena.  Students should be intellectually curious about science and natural occurrences, mechanically and technically proficient to work with computer-based instruments and enjoy working cooperatively in a fast-paced laboratory environment.  Central to this approach of training nano technicians, is the emphasis of hands-on equipment skills.  Through this award, DCC planned and purchased equipment for a basic nanotechnology laboratory, for student use in the curriculum. Equipment includes two atomic force microscopes, a RAMAN spectroscope, a four-point probe, Hepa-filter fume hoods and associated tables and equipment. Additional equipment was donated by local industry and the Tobacco Revitalization Commission, for a total value over $200k.  For training in this new technology to be sustainable, there needs to be a pipeline of high school students with interest and motivation to pursue such a career.  Through NSF funding, a number of summer workshops for k-12 teachers were developed and offered to over 30 teachers in summer of 2012.  Teachers developed lesson plans and received kits and materials to take back to their classrooms to make it easy for them to incorporate nanotechnology topics in their science classes.  DCC offers secondary education materials free to k-12 technology teachers through this link:   http://www.dcc.vccs.edu/workforce/Programs/NanoTech/default.html   (Click on the "Secondary Education Materials" button on the right).  The AAS degree is designed to be a terminal degree, meaning that graduates should be able to secure jobs with just this degree.  In addition, DCC is working to partner for opportunities for further study at four-year degree institutions in the region.
