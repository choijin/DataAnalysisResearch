<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit.&lt;br/&gt;By providing the opportunity for participating undergraduate students to display the&lt;br/&gt;results of their creative academic activities at the national level, the Symposium, which is&lt;br/&gt;specifically dedicated to recognize and celebrate the students' exceptional work, is one of the&lt;br/&gt;most effective means to motivate these students and intellectually stimulate their further interest&lt;br/&gt;in graduate education. The symposium will give participating students a chance to discuss their&lt;br/&gt;research projects and exchange ideas with other students, graduate researchers, faculty and&lt;br/&gt;professional scientists. In addition students will practice presentation skills and gain invaluable&lt;br/&gt;experience presenting research at a premiere, national level, professional scientific conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will serve to provide recognition to outstanding undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;in polymer science and engineering, to foster networking and exposure, to introduce&lt;br/&gt;opportunities in graduate research and education and to help develop the careers of future leaders&lt;br/&gt;in both academia and industry. The symposium will also offer an occasion for students and&lt;br/&gt;supervising faculty to witness how student projects enhance faculty research and also serve the&lt;br/&gt;greater community. Additionally, it will provide motivation for future generations of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students. Those who are not engaged in these pursuits as yet can learn how their&lt;br/&gt;fellow students developed their research interests.&lt;br/&gt;"When does a scientist become a scientist? It is not when a person knows many facts and&lt;br/&gt;even understands in depth some aspect of the natural world. I would suggest the transition&lt;br/&gt;occurs when curiosity about a phenomenon leads to an inquiry for new knowledge. This can&lt;br/&gt;occur in a person with little or lots of knowledge about a subject. It is an attitude of inquiry".</AbstractNarration>
