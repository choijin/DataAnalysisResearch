<AbstractNarration>The Department of Chemistry and Physics at Texas Woman's University will acquire a circular dichroism spectrophotometer with this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program.  Principal Investigator Sheardy will investigate the influence of sequence and environment of G-quadruplex nucleic acid secondary structures. The goals of co-PI Anderson's research are to understand the function and mechanism of human Glutathione Synthetase.  The primary purpose of co-PI Britt's proposed research is to thermodynamically characterize the transition states and conformational changes of several non-denatured enzymes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A circular dichroism spectrophotometer will produce spectral data that provides information on molecular structure and especially the conformations of bio-molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, enzymes and nucleic acids.  The instrument will be used in research by graduate and undergraduate students.  The theory and practice of circular dichroism spectroscopy will be incorporated into the undergraduate teaching curriculum.  This training will prepare students to utilize this sophisticated technique in various careers, especially in chemical, biological and health related fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant allowed acquisition of a Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectrometer which is being used in the characterization of important biological molecules.  One project focused on understanding the structure and stability of DNA related to the human telomere sequence.  This DNA sequence has been implicated in the propagation of cancer cells and hence, understanding it can lead to improved therapies for cancer.  The second project studied the enyzyme glutathione synthase which is responsible for the maintenance of proper levels of glutathione - an important biological anti-oxidant. A third project investigated the slight heat induced unfolding of important enzymes with a goal of better understanding the biological roles of these molecules.  Together, these projects form a foundation for the biological roles of DNA or proteins that can be built upon for the ultimate improvement of human health.  Throughout the course of the project, several undergraduate and graduate students were trained in state of the art biophysical techniques.  All together, 10 graduate students in three different labs have worked on these and related projects leading to 6 MS degrees (five women and 2 from under represented groups) thus far.  Of these, one student is pursuing a PhD degree and three students are teaching at the college level.  Further, an additional 12 to 15 undergraduates have had the experience of working with this instrument.  Finally, a lab experiment devoted to the CD of DNA was carried out by students taking the  Instrumental Analysis course.  Thus, the training of students is one of our primary missions and this instrument has afforded us an opportunity to realize that mission.
