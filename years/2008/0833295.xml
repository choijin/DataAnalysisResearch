    <AbstractNarration>This Phase 1 project is producing 30 new middle or high school mathematics and science teachers who commit to teach in any of the 134 high-need Coalition of Rural and Appalachian Schools (CORAS) districts. Scholarship recipients are enrolled and remain in good standing at one of the South East Ohio Center for Excellence in Mathematics and Science (SEOCEMS) partner universities' accredited programs. SEOCEMS is a partnership of Ohio University, Shawnee State University, the University of Rio Grande, superintendents from CORAS, and superintendents from regional Education Service Centers (ESC). This project is increasing the capacity of this teacher preparation consortium by at least 10%. The project is (1) identifying and recruiting talented students and displaced second career professionals from the Appalachian region with preference for the under-represented first generation college bound; (2) providing a university training and support system to ensure each Noyce Scholarship recipients' successful development as a mathematics or science teacher; and (3) incorporating field experiences in rural schools with systematic feedback and professional support as part of a preparation and retention plan.</AbstractNarration>
