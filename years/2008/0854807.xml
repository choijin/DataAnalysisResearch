<AbstractNarration>This award supports a broad range of research in gravitational physics, including quantum field theory in curved spacetime, classical general relativity, and cosmology. The specific research topics proposed for investigation include the analysis of a new mathematically rigorous framework for quantum fields in curved spacetime and the ramifications of this framework for interpretation of previous less rigorous calculations and potential new effects. The research program will also include investigations of issues arising in extra-dimensional "brane" models and further study  of issues involving gravitational self-force on ?point particles? arising from a recent rigorous derivation of this effect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research areas have a common theme: To obtain a deeper understanding of the mathematical and physical properties of classical general relativity and of quantum phenomena occurring in strong gravitational fields. All aspects of this research will involve the direct participation of graduate students. The general areas of research supported by this award are of considerable interest to the public. This interest will be fostered by public lectures and by the PI's participation in the promotion of interdisciplinary conferences and research collaborations between physicists and philosophers and historians of science.</AbstractNarration>
