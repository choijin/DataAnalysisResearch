<AbstractNarration>This project builds on the strengths and successes of the Unidata Program Center with an enhanced focus on the application of cutting-edge technologies and tools for a broad community of scientists and educators, with the overarching goal of transforming geoscience education and research.  The endeavors emphasize providing data and a rich set of tools, services, and collaborative activities that will enable the community to advance scientific exploration and learning.  It will continue to provide real-time meteorology data to over 170 institutions to instruct and conduct research.  The goals, objectives, and activities in this projet are based on national science, technology, and education trends, as well as community concerns and needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report summarizes work undertaken between 2008-2013 under NSF grant 0833450: "Unidata 2013: A Transformative Community Facility for the Atmospheric and Related Sciences."    Unidata (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu) is a community data facility for the atmospheric and related sciences, established in 1984 by U.S. universities with sponsorship from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The Unidata Program Center (UPC), the program office for Unidata and the nexus of activities related to UnidataÃ†s mission, is managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a consortium of over 104 member universities and academic affiliates providing science in service to society.    Unidata exists to engage and serve researchers and educators dedicated to advancing the frontiers of Earth System science. The programÃ†s aim is to help transform the conduct of research and education in atmospheric and related sciences by providing well-integrated, end-to-end data services and software tools that address many aspects of the scientific data lifecycle, from locating and retrieving useful data, through the process of analyzing and visualizing data either locally or remotely, to curating and sharing the results. Specifically, the UPC:  Acquires, distributes, and provides remote access to real-time meteorological data. Develops software for accessing, managing, analyzing, visualizing, and effectively using geoscience data. Provides comprehensive training and support to users of its products and services. In partnership with others, facilitates the advancement of tools, standards and conventions. Provides leadership in cyberinfrastructure and fosters adoption of new tools and techniques. Assesses and responds to community needs, fostering community interaction and engagement to promote sharing of data, tools, and ideas. Advocates on behalf of the community on data matters, negotiating data and software agreements. Grants equipment awards to universities to enable and enhance participation in Unidata.   Unidata is governed by its community and its governance structure ensures that the program stays in tune with the community it serves, and allows it to quickly adjust program priorities as the technological landscape and community needs change.    Today, the Unidata community includes educators and researchers associated with nearly 2500 academic institutions and more than 80 research labs. Unidata strives to promote diversity in the geosciences by supporting use of its technologies in a wide array of educational institutions. Unidata software and data services are used at universities in all 31 EPSCoR jurisdictions, including many institutions that have a large number of students from underrepresented communities.    During the period of performance for this award, Unidata met most of the goals described in the proposal, accomplishing many of the stated objectives. Specifically, Unidata significantly increased the reliability, volume, and variety of data provided to the community, extended the functionalities of its software, developed and deployed new tools and services, and actively engaged its growing user community. The programÃ†s contributions and accomplishments have had a demonstrable and sustained impact on the geosciences community, empowering faculty, students, and researchers to be more productive and enhancing their ability to advance science and learning.  The following are some highlights of the Unidata ProgramÃ†s activities and accomplishments over the course of the five-year award.    As of May 2013:  263 academic or research institutions were participating in UnidataÃ†s community geoscience data distribution network By participating, these institutions gained access to roughly 13 Terabytes per day of observational weather data and computer simulation output at no cost (beyond their own computing infrastructure and network costs) Participants retrieved roughly 660 Gigabytes per day of geoscience data directly from se...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
