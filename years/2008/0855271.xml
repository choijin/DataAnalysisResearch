<AbstractNarration>The FrameNet project has been building a lexical database containing&lt;br/&gt;highly detailed information about the syntax and semantics of the&lt;br/&gt;different senses of English words, with applications such as question&lt;br/&gt;answering and information extraction.  The database is based on&lt;br/&gt;Charles Fillmore's theory of Frame Semantics, relating word meanings&lt;br/&gt;to conceptualizations of situations and their participants, ranging&lt;br/&gt;from simple actions like Placing to complex events such as a Criminal&lt;br/&gt;process, with subevents like Arraignment and Trial. The&lt;br/&gt;generalizations are derived from annotated example sentences from&lt;br/&gt;large text corpora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this planning grant, input will be gathered from researchers in the&lt;br/&gt;NLP field regarding how the FrameNet data is currently being used, how&lt;br/&gt;it can be made more useful to a wider range of users, and how it can&lt;br/&gt;be enhanced so as to enable new directions of research.  As part of&lt;br/&gt;this, a series of conferences will be held, both face-to-face and by&lt;br/&gt;videoconference, to plan future FrameNet development and cooperation&lt;br/&gt;and alignment of data with other lexical resources and annotation&lt;br/&gt;projects, such as WordNet, PropBank, OntoNotes, etc., with the&lt;br/&gt;ultimate goal of improving results in sense disambiguation, semantic&lt;br/&gt;role recognition, and natural language understanding in general.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
