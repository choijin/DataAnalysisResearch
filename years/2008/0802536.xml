<AbstractNarration>Stark State College of Technology leads a regional partnership dedicated to fuel cell technology education.  The mission of the Great Lakes Fuel Cell Education Partnership is to provide leadership in creating innovative fuel cell-related education and training programs through curriculum development and enhancement; professional development; and partnerships with high schools, institutions of higher education, businesses and government entities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective is to meet the future workforce needs of the fuel cell industry in the region, including (but not limited to) Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan and Indiana.  The Partnership's goals are to: 1) aggregate and evaluate innovative solutions for advancing fuel cell education and training in collaboration with high schools and undergraduate education entities, top research universities, business and industry, government agencies and professional societies; 2) research and define essential technical skills to advance workforce development in fuel cell-related technologies and promote the creation of additional jobs; and 3) serve as a clearinghouse to share proven curriculum materials and foster public understanding of fuel cell technologies, the hydrogen-related economy and the importance of developing alternative energy sources.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stark State College is joined in this effort by education institutions in Ohio, New York, Michigan, Indiana and Pennsylvania.  Partners include the Ohio Department of Education, Hocking College, Case Western Reserve University, Kent State University, University of Akron and University of Toledo (Ohio); Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (New York); Lansing Community College and Kettering University (Michigan); Vincennes University (a two-year college) and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (Indiana); and Penn State University (Pennsylvania).  Fuel cell industry, business and government organizations include Plug Power Inc. and ENrG Inc. (New York); and GM-Powertrain, Lockheed Martin, Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems (US) and Graftech (Ohio).</AbstractNarration>

Serve as a clearinghouse to share proven curriculum materials and foster public understanding of fuel cell technologies, the hydrogen-related economy and the importance of developing alternative energy sources.  The intellectual merit of the Partnership was the advancement of workforce development, curriculum enhancement, information dissemination and public understanding of emerging fuel cell power technologies.  Broader Impacts:  The Partnership was designed to be industry-driven through participation of employers on the PartnershipÆs Advisory Board. The dissemination of the results and products has taken place through a website, as well as print and electronic materials distributed at conferences and workshops presented, including other national and regional conferences related to fuel cell technology. The PartnershipÆs website www.fuelcelleducation.org has a searchable database to facilitate access to materials as well as links to other websites.  In order to increase dissemination capabilities, links have been be made to other NSF centers and projects that have fuel cell information or learning objects.

Ohio, the lead state for the regional collaboration, is located within 600 miles of two-thirds of the U.S. population.  The region has suffered tremendous losses in traditional manufacturing jobs; thus, providing training and career transition education opportunities is critical to promoting diversity in the technical workforce. The project has focused efforts on population segments having low employment and education in sciences, including women, disadvantaged minorities and the economically disadvantaged. During the grant Stark State trained 299 fuel cell technicians with the following demographics 10 African American, 8 American Indian, 6 Asian, 2 Hispanic, and 39 female.
