<AbstractNarration>The biochemical reactions within cells follow the principle of mass action--the rate of a reaction is the product of the concentrations of the reactants--so that their behavior can be represented by a polynomial dynamical system. The steady states of a network of reactions are therefore solutions to a set of polynomial equations and form an algebraic variety. Despite the powerful mathematical tools that have been developed to analyze algebraic varieties, this feature has never previously been exploited in studying biological systems.  The research team recently showed that for a particular class of biological networks, arising in multisite protein phosphorylation, the steady-state variety has remarkable geometric properties, which lead to new biological predictions as well as a method for drastically reducing the complexity of calculating steady states. In this project, these geometric ideas will be used to analyze a much broader class of cellular networks, especially the key modules that are repeatedly used in biological processes, including cascades, scaffolds and feedbacks. While the analysis will initially be at steady state, the team will also examine whether the unexpected benefits of polynomial dynamics can be extended to more complex dynamical behaviors, such as limit cycles. If successful, these studies will provide new methods for overcoming molecular complexity as well as a new geometrical language in which to formulate the principles of cellular regulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The molecular networks found within biological cells exhibit extraordinary complexity. Not only are there many components--there are around 23,000 genes in the human genome--but the proteins encoded by the genes may themselves become modified in multiple different ways by other proteins in a dynamic fashion. Although the researchers have developed excellent mathematical tools for dealing with genes, which are static entities, there are few such tools for dealing with the dynamics of proteins and their modifications. It is these dynamical processes that do the work of cellular physiology and which become destabilized in disease. For instance, a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease is uncontrolled modification of a protein called tau, while similar imbalances in protein modification have been found in many cancers.  Unfortunately, the number of different protein states that can arise in such processes is enormous, making it hard to even understand what the processes are capable of doing, let alone to devise the right experiments to unravel them. At present, much of this complexity has to be glossed over. In this project, the investigators develop new mathematical tools for representing and analyzing such cellular processes that enable them to overcome some of the complexity rather than ignore it. In this way, the team hopes to characterize how cellular networks exploit molecular complexity to implement the physiological processes of life.  Studies of this kind will help lay the foundation for a better molecular understanding of health and disease.</AbstractNarration>
