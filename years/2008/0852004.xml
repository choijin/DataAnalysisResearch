<AbstractNarration>This award, jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research and Chemistry a the National Science Foundation, supports the continuation of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. The REU Site program supports 14 undergraduates for 10 weeks each summer during 2009 to 2011.  Participating REU students work on interdisciplinary projects in materials research with close guidance from faculty mentors in Chemistry, Physics and/or Engineering departments. The interdisciplinary environment encourages the REU students to think about their respective projects in broad terms and to consider applications of their research to new technologies and issues relating to manufacturing of new devices.  REU students have the opportunity to present their research to a diverse audience across disciplines during the program and at the end-of-program poster presentation as well as in regional and national conferences.  Opportunities to network with peers, faculty mentors, and other scientists and engineers are provided through evening and week-end social and cultural activities included in the program. Students are recruited nationally, with particular emphasis on students from groups underrepresented in science and engineering, as well as socio-economically disadvantaged and first-generation college students.  The goals of the REU site include: 1) creating a positive image of science and engineering as a career choice; 2) providing a nurturing research environment; 3) improving the participants' communication skills; 4) teaching basic research tools (including modern instrumentation); 5) fostering collaborative research; and 6) increasing the number of domestic students, especially those from underrepresented groups, who choose careers in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

As part of our Program, students participated in instrument training workshops in the following areas: NMR, mass spectrometry, electron and optical microscopy, various spectroscopies (like FT-IR and UV-Vis), ellipsometry, and thermal analysis (among others)&mdash;as well as library / reference resources.  Each student also learned how to prepare and give oral presentations, maintain detailed laboratory records, work with peers in a team research environment, use data manipulation and figure preparation software, write up their scientific results in a final report in ACS journal format, and prepare and give a final poster presentation.  Indeed, each year approximately 100 faculty, graduate students, and other scientists attend our summer research colloquium where the REU students present their work.  Over the last 3 years our REU participants have co-authored over a dozen publications and over 40 conference presentations.  Broader Impacts. The research projects of our REU participants are designed to be excellent training grounds for chemists, physicists, and engineers working in materials and related fields.
