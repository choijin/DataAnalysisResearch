<AbstractNarration>The Minority Student Pipeline Math Science Partnership (MSP)2 is led by Bowie State University (BSU)  with the additional core partners of the Prince George's County Public Schools (PGCPS), the Prince George's Community College (PGCC), the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP), the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (UMBI), and the University System of Maryland (USM).  (MSP)2 proposes to establish a strong, multifaceted partnership among the essential P-16 players in one of the largest minority-majority counties in the country, Prince George's County, Maryland, in order to expand the minority student pipeline in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in higher education.  (MSP)2 will employ four strategies engaging STEM faculty, teachers, undergraduates, and high school students: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Working with approximately 750 teachers in grades 4-8 over five years, &lt;br/&gt;    science faculty will develop two different types of professional &lt;br/&gt;    development programs designed around principles of teaching and learning &lt;br/&gt;    through inquiry science. &lt;br/&gt;2.  A total of 110 high school science teachers will engage in summer research&lt;br/&gt;    experiences over five years with college and university STEM faculty. &lt;br/&gt;3.  At least 375 high school students over five years will be offered &lt;br/&gt;    opportunities to take challenging science courses through an innovative &lt;br/&gt;    early college/dual enrollment programs. &lt;br/&gt;4.  100 undergraduate underrepresented minority college undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;    will be offered opportunities for teaching experiences (with 100 PGCPS &lt;br/&gt;    science teachers to mentor them) and 50 undergraduate will be offered &lt;br/&gt;    research experiences over 5 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(MSP)2 will explore four research strands through four implementation strategies:  (1) In what ways do different inquiry-based professional development experiences and training for elementary and middle school teachers influence students'interest in science? Are different models more effective at achieving different outcomes? How do these possible effects compare for underrepresented minority students and teachers versus non-minority?  (2) What characteristics of summer research opportunities for secondary science teachers, paired with intentional learning communities focused on the nature of scientific inquiry, lead to enhanced curriculum and greater success for students in science, particularly underrepresented minorities?  (3) In what ways do opportunities for secondary students to take early-college and dual-enrollment courses affect the likelihood that students, particularly underrepresented minorities, will attend college and choose science majors? And (4) How do opportunities for undergraduate science majors to teach science lessons in elementary and secondary schools affect the likelihood that science majors will consider a career in teaching? How do early research experiences affect the likelihood that STEM majors will complete science degrees?</AbstractNarration>

By creating professional development opportunities for teachers, teaching experiences for undergraduates, and challenging course work for high-school students within Prince Georges county and across the state of Maryland, (MSP)2 has recruited, retained, and prepared minority students in STEM majors and professions, as well as, the teachers who teach them. Project Strands  (MSP)2  is comprised of five strands of activity for different groups/populations of participants:  Elementary and middle-school teachers: science and education faculty at UMCP and PGCC developed and provided two types of professional development program models for teachers, designed around the principles of teaching and learning through inquiry science. These teachers teachers thousands of students each year. High-school science teachers (ExPERT) engaged in multi-year summer research experiences with university faculty.  The project established learning communities that allowed teachers to learn more about the nature of science, build on their research experiences, and connect them with the thousands of students they teach in their classrooms. The ExPERT teachers have also taken what they have learned to their colleagues around the state. Most participating teachers have taken on leadership responsibilities in their schools and beyond. Several ExPERTs have become science department chairs or professional leaders/mentors of science teachers around Prince George's County. Some participating teachers have served the Maryland State Department of Education as Master Teachers in science and as  consultants for implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards. High-school students were given opportunities to take challenging science courses for college credit through a pair of innovative dual-enrollment programs developed collaboratively by PGCPS, BSU, and PGCC (Environmental Biology and Forensic Biology. Undergraduate students: Science majors were given unique opportunities to learn about teaching through formal training and guided experiences in teaching in reformed college science coursesat UMCP. (MSP)2 Computer Science Expansion created a professional development initiative that galvanized other initatives in the state like the NSF-funded Structured CS Principles project, to prepare teachers to teach rigorous high school computer science (CS) lessons and courses, AP Exploring Computer Scienceand AP Computer Science Principles.   Outcomes  Through these strands of program activity, the (MSP)2partnership successfully:  Raised student achievement in science.

In FY2018, the state of Maryland committed $7 million to MCCE with hopes of providing high-quality computer science experiences to students in every school in the state. In fact, MCCE programs are expanding access to high-quality Pre-Kindergarten-12 (P-12) computing education by strengthening educator knowledge &amp; skills and increasing the number of certified computer science teachers in elementary and secondary education.  It also serves as a focal point for broader collaborative initiatives to increase the availability and quality of P-12 computing education across the state, including stakeholder meetings and partnerships; teacher certification efforts; standards and curriculum development; innovative pedagogical research and training; training and awareness for administrators, students, and parents; and coordinating with related national efforts.
