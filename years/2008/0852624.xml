<AbstractNarration>SES- 0852624&lt;br/&gt;Sally Hillsman&lt;br/&gt;American Sociological Association&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant supports U.S. sociologists to attend the XVIIth World Congress of the International Sociological Association (ISA) in Gothenburg, Sweden, July 11-17, 2010. The ISA is the major international organization of sociologists, and the World Congress is the single most important opportunity for U.S. sociologists to exchange ideas and scholarship and promote collaborations on an international scale. The World Congress, which includes hundreds of sessions, exhibits, and other events, occurs at four year intervals and attracts approximately 5,000 participants from around the world. Support for travel of U.S. sociologists permits continued growth of international exchange and collaboration in sociology and ensures a strong presence of U.S. scholars in this important venue. The meeting promotes international collaborations on a wide range of challenges arising from global social processes and transformations, including those stemming from global interconnectedness, worldwide social problems, and environmental concerns that transcend national boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
