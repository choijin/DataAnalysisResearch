<AbstractNarration>Commodity systems are changing the face of storage and I/O. Commodity disks&lt;br/&gt;are cheap, but unreliable. Commodity file systems are widely used, but bug&lt;br/&gt;prone. Despite these critical problems, people rely increasingly on commodity&lt;br/&gt;computing systems to store data of critical importance, whether from an&lt;br/&gt;emotional (e.g., family photos), business (e.g., a customer database), or&lt;br/&gt;legal (e.g., your tax return) standpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wisconsin Arrays in Software Project (WASP)    tackles the problem of&lt;br/&gt;building the next generation of robust and reliable commodity RAID&lt;br/&gt;system. Such a RAID system must be reliable, detecting and recovering from a&lt;br/&gt;broad range of disk faults correctly. Such a system must also integrate&lt;br/&gt;properly into existing systems, thus delivering high performance and proper&lt;br/&gt;recovery in the case of system crashes. Finally, such a system must be&lt;br/&gt;flexible, enabling new protection strategies to be developed and deployed to&lt;br/&gt;cope with new problems as they arise.  WASP has two major components: the&lt;br/&gt;first is a RAID design checker known as Sting, which ensures that protection&lt;br/&gt;schemes correctly protect data from a given set of disk faults.  The second is&lt;br/&gt;a framework to allow the specification and automatic generation of&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated RAID systems; known as WASP Nest, this part of the project&lt;br/&gt;promises a new higher-level design methodology for commodity RAIDs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
