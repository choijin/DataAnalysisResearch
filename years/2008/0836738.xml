<AbstractNarration>Engineering Mechanical -(56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent national reports have suggested the need for reforming engineering education courses and curriculum to include more integrated components.  Thus, this project addressees multiple objectives: (1) systematically increasing project-based learning experiences throughout typical engineering curricula; and (2) increasing the prospects for industry adoption and commercialization of industry-sponsored and student-generated capstone design projects. This project will enhance the outcomes of senior capstone design projects by having needed refinements to these designs serve as the basis for project-based learning activities in courses scheduled earlier in the curriculum.  Students, in courses taught during the sophomore, junior, and senior year prior to the senior capstone course, will gain insight into, and experience with, many aspects of real-world engineering projects. Simultaneously, capstone design projects will be advanced further towards industry implementation and commercialization through efforts in this project. This concept will be tested in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department of the University of Missouri. A rigorous assessment and evaluation plan to measure outcomes for the project will be developed and implemented by an independent consultant.</AbstractNarration>
