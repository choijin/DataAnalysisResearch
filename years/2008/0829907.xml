<AbstractNarration>EMT/NANO: Comprehensive Modeling of Power Dissipation, Leakage, and Non-Equilibrium Transport in Low-Dimensional Transistors&lt;br/&gt;Eric Pop ? University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Power dissipation and leakage are significant concerns of modern integrated circuits, and increasingly important in the future. Leakage is a strong function of temperature, and hence of the power dissipated. However, no detailed models or data exist for nanoscale, low-dimensional devices, and little is known about the microscopic behavior and role of interfaces for heat dissipation in technologies of high interest such as carbon nanotubes or graphene. In addition, fast switching times (of order 1 ps) are comparable to electron- or phonon-scattering times, leading to non-equilibrium carriers and heating during device operation.&lt;br/&gt; This research involves producing a comprehensive, microscopic understanding of power dissipation and leakage in nanometer-scale integrated circuits. More specifically it (1) extends an existing Monte Carlo approach to investigate the role of non-equilibrium phonons on power dissipation and leakage, (2) pursues a microscopic understanding of phonon coupling across device interfaces with Molecular Dynamics simulations, and (3) wraps up the advanced physical understanding into self-consistent electrical-thermal compact models to be used in circuit modeling. The research is also incorporated into classroom materials for the courses taught by the PI, including updating or creating new Wikipedia articles in the context of a graduate class. Models and computer codes are made freely available through the NSF/NCN computational nanoHUB. A breakthrough in our understanding of nanoscale device power issues can lead to a revolutionary approach to thermally efficient circuit and system design, from a bottom-up, device and materials perspective.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Power dissipation and leakage (PDL) are significant concerns of modern technology, and increasingly important in the future.

Over the three years of its course, this project has achieved:  1) A new simulation method to investigate the role of non-equilibrium phonons on power dissipation and leakage in low-dimensional silicon- and carbon-based devices.  2) Measurements of the role of "dimensionally mismatched" (e.g. 1-D to 3-D) carbon-dielectric material interfaces on power dissipation and heat spreading in such devices.  3) A more detailed understanding of phonon coupling across these interfaces with Molecular Dynamics simulations.  4) Compact circuit-oriented models for leakage current, band-to-band tunneling, and interface thermal transport in low-dimensional devices, grounded in a deeper physical understanding of transistor operation.  5) The products of this work have been published in 15 journal articles, and discussed in approximately 20 conference presentations and another 20 invited talks given by the PI and his graduate students.
