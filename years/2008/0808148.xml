<AbstractNarration>AST-0808148&lt;br/&gt;Ingersoll&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a comprehensive numerical model of the formation and dynamical evolution of the Enceladus water vapor and ice particle plumes (EPs).  Since the nature of the reservoir that produces EPs is hotly debated, including eruptions from chambers of liquid water, sublimation and venting of hydrate clathrate, and vapor diffusion through ice pores, the model proposed here will simulate different origins and allow comparison to available observations.  The model describes the dynamics of compressible gas and of boiling liquids expanding through narrow channels, particle growth in the expanding vapor, condensation and sublimation on the walls, heat transfer and vapor diffusion in the surrounding ice, and feedback between these different elements.  This work will advance our knowledge of the subsurface structure of Enceladus and of processes occurring on icy moons elsewhere in the solar system, producing the first complete model of the EP dynamics and thermodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The search for liquid water has broad societal impact by capturing the imagination of the public and of young people who might be considering scientific careers.  Enceladus is a potentially important island of habitability: this project tests the hypothesis that liquid water exists below the surface and at what depth it might exist, and whether there is a source of chemical energy to support life.</AbstractNarration>
