<AbstractNarration>The primary focus of the project will be the study of random processes random walks and branching random walks, contact processes, Ising model, and competition processes on hyperbolic groups and graphs. The last four of these processes exhibit multiple phases, including an intermediate phase of weak survival that is not seen on integer lattices. A major objective of the research will be to understand how hyperbolic geometry constrains the upper phase transition between weak and strong survival, and how this in turn is related to asymptotic behavior of the Green's functions of random walk. This will involve development of techniques centered around Ancona inequalities, symbolic dynamics and infinite-dimensional Perron-Frobenius theory, and the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction of infinite systems of algebraic functional equations. Secondary foci of the project will be (a) mathematical problems arising in Bayesian nonparametric function estimation, and (b) stochastic models of epidemics and interspecies competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic interacting particle systems are widely used as models in various areas of science, especially in statistical physics and in population biology, but also in the social sciences. It  is hoped that studying such processes in infinite hyperbolic geometries will ultimately contribute to understanding their behavior in finite "expander" and "small-worlds" networks, which may better model interactions in various social and ecological systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit     This project focused mainly on mathematical models   of epidemics, with emphasis on models attempting to  account for geographical factors restricting the spread of   infection. In these models, the population through which  the epidemic spreads is distributed in "colonies" located  in space. (For example, a one-dimensional space might be suitable for  describing animal or plant populations that live along riverbeds or  coastlines, while two-dimensional space would be better suited to   species that live and interact in a grassland.) Infected individuals   can infect only susceptible, non-infected individuals in neighboring   colonies. These infections occur at random times, but only before   the infected individual recovers. In some models, individuals  acquire immunity from further infection upon recovery; in other  models they rejoin the pool of susceptible individuals. In the former  case, the susceptible population is eventually depleted to the point   where the epidemic can no longer sustain itself locally, and so the  epidemic proceeds in a fashion somewhat like a forest fire, staying   alive only at the edges of its extent. The first figure attached  illustrates  a simulation of a very simple super-critical one-dimensional  case, showing the   local density of infected individuals in space and time, and clearly   illustrating how the infection front travels at a definite speed, even though  the epidemic is spread purely by random contacts. The second figure  shows the progress of  a critical epidemic.     Our primary interest was in discovering how the spread of  epidemics  in space and time would be affected by changes in the parameters  of the model, such as the infection and recovery rates and the   population density. We were especially interested in how the epidemic  would behave at the "critical values" of the  parameters, for instance,  when the infection rate is just high enough so that, in a colony  where nearly all individuals are susceptible, an infected individual  would on average infect one other before recovering.  We found that  here the spacial extent of the epidemic has a "long tail", that is,  exhibits a very large range of variation from one run to the next,  and we were able to formulate precise rules describing this   variation as functions of the population density and infection/recovery  rates.     Broader Impacts     (1) Stochastic processes of the type considered in this  proposal have become increasingly important in population biology,  epidemiology, and the emerging field of ``complex networks''.     (2) Much of the research was done in collaboration with several Ph. D. students  at the university of Chicago who have now finished their degrees and  moved on to academic positions at leading research universities.
