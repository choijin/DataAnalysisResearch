<AbstractNarration>This is a five-year project aimed at organizing a DRK-12 Resource Network to provide assistance for projects in areas such as research and development methods, implementation, and analysis procedures; synthesis of findings across the portfolio of projects; and national dissemination of the R&amp;D contributions of the DRK-12 program. To accomplish these goals, Education Development Center (EDC) will join efforts with Abt Associates Inc., and Policy Studies Associates to implement three major strands: (1) Technical Assistance, which consists of (a) a portfolio assessment to define it in terms of composition and major characteristics and identify project needs, (b) individual technical work services to project leadership, (c) focus groups, (d) thematic meetings, (e) Principal Investigators (PI) meetings, and (f) a web portal; (2) Portfolio Analysis, including (a) synthesis activities to capture a comprehensive view of the portfolio in order to understand the role that the program has played in advancing K-12 student and teacher learning, and (b) evaluative studies of selected projects describing specific contributions to the field; and (3) Dissemination, comprising (a) the development of a white paper to summarize research findings on dissemination and implementation of research in practice and policy settings and highlight examples from the portfolio, and (b) a series of dissemination-related workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CADRE began in 2008 as the DRK-12 resource network designed to support and make visible NSFÆs DRK-12 program and its grantees. Specific strands of work included defining the portfolio (portfolio analysis and targeted studies; building researcher capacity (networking, information sharing, fostering collaboration, and awareness of DRK-12 projects); disseminating findings and products briefs, working papers, Web-based tools, and social media streams; and nurturing the professional growth of early career STEM education researchers and developers through the CADRE Fellows program. Through STEM Smart, a series of national and regional meetings, CADRE engaged in outreach and awareness building to bridge research and practice, and to disseminate information about NSF-supported models, tools, and technologies. STEM Smart meetings, supplemented with a website and a series of topical briefs, were targeted toward preK&ndash;12 practitioners, policymakers, funders, professional development professionals, and leaders from business, industry, higher education, and cultural institutions.  Evaluations indicate CADREÆs contributions included "enhanced capacity of the STEM research and development community, and reduced isolation/enhanced collaboration among researchers. CADREÆs broader impact has been associated with advancing the state of STEM education research and development, as well as an amplified collective voice for STEM education researchers and developers."  Because of CADREÆs work with early career members of project teams, evaluators posited that "it is reasonable to suggest that CADREÆs capacity-building efforts will yield even longer-term and broader-reaching results as the Fellows and more junior members of project teams&hellip;advance in their own careers and continue to employ those resources."  Dissemination efforts of both CADRE and its STEM Smart outreach efforts have increased awareness of the DRK-12 portfolio, and other NSF-supported resources and studies. Effective strategies have included increasingly interactive PI meetings, targeted studies, an evolving website and social media venues, and collaboration with other networks. In terms of STEM Smart specifically, diverse participants believed that awareness-building sessions provided them with new information that would inform their thinking and future work in STEM education.
