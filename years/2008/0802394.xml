<AbstractNarration>A group of academic institutions and industry are planning a National Center of Logistics and Supply Chain Technology. The initiative is being jointly led by Riverside Community College District in California and Sinclair Community College in Ohio. Participating partners include (a) in California the Distribution Management Association of Southern California, Cardinal Health Systems, and Ozburn-Hessey Logistics; and (b) in Ohio ABX Air, Boeing, DAU (Defense Acquisition University), and Honda.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The objective is to develop a five-year strategic plan for a National Center of Logistics and Supply Chain Management to include (a) mission and vision, (b) organizational structure, (c) partnerships and linkages to other initiatives, (c) student recruitment strategies, (d) faculty development strategies, (e) outreach and dissemination methods, and (f) evaluation criteria and methodology. The National Center of Logistics and Supply Chain Technology is being planned to develop high-quality programs, curricula, and faculty professional development in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines of (1) mathematics: (i.e. operations research, statistics); (2) technology: (i.e. Global Positioning Systems, Radio Frequency Identification); and (3) engineering (i.e. human-machine interface, automated systems design) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Currently, many initiatives are being designed to create and make available information on logistics educational programs, teaching materials, and jobs. These efforts accomplish an important mission within a local area or industry; however, they are disparate and localized. This planning project is creating a blueprint for a national center designed to standardize creation and dissemination of logistics education, standards, and materials. It is melding military and private logistics methods for increased efficiency and effectiveness for both sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The development of a national center for logistics and supply-chain management addresses two critical issues. First, the logistics and supply chain management are important industries, which offer career ladders to family-supporting jobs. Employment in logistics and support industries is growing and projected to add 969,000 jobs by 2030. Second, the Department of Defense is on the verge of a retirement-driven talent crisis. By 2015, 54% of the federal acquisition workforce will retire. The development of a national center provides a mechanism to support the growth and replacement of talent in this vital economic sector.</AbstractNarration>
