<AbstractNarration>Proposal: CCF- 0830734&lt;br/&gt;Title: Geometric Data Structures&lt;br/&gt;PI: Souvaine, Diane L.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Tufts University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric Data Structures&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;A data structure is a repository of information; the goal is to organize the data so that it needs less storage (space) and so that information can be retrieved quickly (query). A geometric data structure handles data which has locations attached to it (e.g. addresses of fire stations in the state of Massachusetts). Geometric data structures have become pervasive and an integral part of life; and can be queried to produce driving directions or the name of the nearest Italian restaurant. Since the space and query time of a data structure depend upon the type of queries it has to support, it is important to study which tools and techniques are suitable for which data structures. The ongoing quest for better data structures sometimes results in improved methods and sometimes results in entirely new techniques. The goal is to determine optimal data structures with the best possible performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project focuses on creating new and efficient data structures for geometric queries and geometric decision problems that close the gaps between known lower and upper bounds. Particular problems include planar simplex emptiness queries, relative convex hull queries in dynamic subdivisions, and dynamic vertical ray shooting queries, and the implementation of the resulting data structures in both the real RAM and word RAM models. The project also addresses key problems in computational geometry such as computing spanning trees with low crossing number, constructing minimum size cuttings in 3-space, and generating convex subdivisions from disjoint line segments in such a way as to solve plane reconfiguration problems such as the compatible geometric matching problem. Solutions to these problems will contribute to the creation of efficient data structures for geometric queries such as multi-point location, ray shooting, and range searching. These data structures are fundamental to the field of computational geometry, and have broad applications in computer graphics, robotics, CAD/CAM, motion planning, collision detection, and geographic information systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed a collection of new strategies and problem-solving techniques and successfully applied them to a spectrum of problems in discrete and computational geometry. Fundamental problems considered in the project invove point sets, polygns, geometric networks, and physical objects including Rubik's cubes and pop-up cards. Results are of three flavors: new algorithms for the manipulation and analysis of geometric objects, bounds on the number of different types and behaviors of these objects, and characterizations of various properties of these objects.   One example is the problem of illuminating regions using light sources of various types, with applications to sensor networks, GPS, and robot motion planning. We derived tight bounds on the minimum number of lights needed to illuminate regions, on the minimum number of times light might need to reflect off of a wall before illuminating the entire region, and the impossibility of certain types of lights to illuminate some types of regions.    Other results included deriving new upper bounds on the maximum number of some common geometric graphs, such as perfect matchings, spanning cycles, and crossing-free graphs, that can be embedded on a given finite set of points in the plane. We have also developed algorithms for the design of 2D and 3D pop-up cards with any silhouette, and solved scrambled generalized Rubik's cubes using the optimal number of moves.   Many engineered and natural biological systems carry out complex geometric processes as huge numbers of small particles organize into large functional macromolecules. We studied theoretical models of these particle systems, designing algorithms for the creation of systems forming structures with desired shapes and properties and developing surprising connections between these particle systems and a long-studied model in linguistics.
