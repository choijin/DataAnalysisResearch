<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate possible fault location approaches for transmission lines utilizing sparse voltage and current measurements from buses and branches that may be distant from the faulted line. The approach is to derive the measured quantity as an analytical function of the unknown fault location based on the bus-impedance matrix technique, and then to solve the equation for the fault location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research has the following intellectual merits: It will explore appropriate estimation theories for transmission line fault location, aiming at making fundamental contributions to the areas of power system monitoring, protection and fault analysis. The research will investigate algorithms for both single-circuit and double-circuit lines by employing sparse voltage and current phasors or magnitudes alone. Synchronized phasors from phasor measurement units will be fully exploited. The developed method has the potential to be utilized for online protection purposes, and this could significantly improve distance protection accuracy harnessing only local data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have broader impacts in several areas: First, the developed approach can greatly improve the reliability of the power system, reducing the costs associated with the outage, and enhancing the welfare of the society. Second, the research results will be utilized in the classroom to enrich the curriculum. The underrepresented students, especially women, African Americans and those from Appalachia will be encouraged and recruited to work on the project. Third, the research results will be promptly and broadly disseminated through technical publications and presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
