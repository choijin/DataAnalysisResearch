<AbstractNarration>Ren&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0806401&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In this project, the investigator develops numerical methods&lt;br/&gt;for the study of complex energy landscapes and barrier-crossing&lt;br/&gt;events (rare events) as well as free energy calculations in&lt;br/&gt;multiple-dimensional spaces.  In the past few years, he and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators developed a theoretical framework and numerical&lt;br/&gt;methods (the string method) for dealing with barrier-crossing&lt;br/&gt;events in complex systems.  In the first part of the project, he&lt;br/&gt;applies the string method to problems arising from material&lt;br/&gt;sciences.  In particular, the dislocation motions and the energy&lt;br/&gt;landscapes of silicon will be studied at the atomistic scale. &lt;br/&gt;The minimum energy paths at low temperature and the minimum free&lt;br/&gt;energy paths at finite temperature are investigated.  In the&lt;br/&gt;second part of the project, the investigator studies the problem&lt;br/&gt;of mapping free energy landscapes in multiple-dimensional spaces. &lt;br/&gt;For problems arising from theoretical chemistry and structural&lt;br/&gt;biology, very often the interesting dynamics can be characterized&lt;br/&gt;by a number of collective variables.  For example, conformation&lt;br/&gt;changes of bio-molecules are usually characterized by several&lt;br/&gt;torsion angles or distances between different chemical groups. &lt;br/&gt;The computation of the free energy associated with these&lt;br/&gt;collective variables is of great practical interest. &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately such a calculation has been limited to situations&lt;br/&gt;when there are only a few collective variables (typically no more&lt;br/&gt;than 3), mainly due to the enormous number of grid points or bins&lt;br/&gt;involved in the calculation based on a regular grid.  In this&lt;br/&gt;project, the investigator uses a sparse representation for the&lt;br/&gt;free energy function based on sparse grids.  This to a certain&lt;br/&gt;extent overcomes the difficulty and allows the mapping of the&lt;br/&gt;free energy landscape in spaces up to about 30 dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Many problems from structural biology, theoretical&lt;br/&gt;chemistry, and material sciences can be abstractly formulated as&lt;br/&gt;a system navigating over a complex energy landscape.  The system&lt;br/&gt;spends most of time in metastable states (the local minima of the&lt;br/&gt;energy landscape), with thermally activated transitions from one&lt;br/&gt;metastable state to another.  The questions of interest are the&lt;br/&gt;mechanism of such transition and the transition rates.  These&lt;br/&gt;transitions happen on a time scale specified by Arrhenius' law,&lt;br/&gt;which is much longer than the intrinsic time scale of the&lt;br/&gt;dynamical system.  For example, the individual atoms in a&lt;br/&gt;bio-molecule vibrate on the scale of femtoseconds (1e-15 s); in&lt;br/&gt;contrast, conformation changes of the molecule (which is the&lt;br/&gt;interesting event) typically happen on the scale of milliseconds&lt;br/&gt;(1e-3 s -- a trillion times longer than a femtosecond) or even&lt;br/&gt;longer.  The disparity in the time scale makes traditional&lt;br/&gt;approaches (e.g. the direct simulation of molecular dynamics or&lt;br/&gt;Langevin dynamics) prohibitively expensive.  In this project, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator develops efficient numerical tools (the string&lt;br/&gt;method) for the study of such transition events and the&lt;br/&gt;associated energetics.  The numerical method is applied to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the dislocation motions in crystalline solids at the&lt;br/&gt;atomistic scale.  The mapping of free energy landscapes of&lt;br/&gt;biological systems in multiple dimensions using sparse&lt;br/&gt;representations is studied as well.</AbstractNarration>
