<AbstractNarration>The Philadelphia-Camden Informal Science Education Collaborative (PISEC), which is composed of four museums and eight community-based organizations (CBOs), is creating a new model of learning and professional development for underserved communities in the Philadelphia area. The goals of the Communities of Learning for Urban Environments and Science (CLUES) project are to (1) increase underserved families' interest in, understanding of, and engagement with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through involvement in hands-on experiences that address their interests and are relevant to their lives, (2) build and support informal STEM leaders in community-based organizations, and (3) disseminate information about a new model for community outreach and capacity building for museum and CBOs. The project is producing a two-tiered professional development program for CBO members, STEM learning programs developed by project-trained Apprentices and Presenters, and evaluation findings about the project's impact on focal audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numerical impact of the project is an estimated 16,000 individuals in family groups participating in project-related STEM activities. The project will also train 32 CBO-based Apprentices and 64 Presenters from eight CBOs. The project's strategic impacts are three-fold: (1) building STEM education capacity within eight selected Philadelphia area CBOs, (2) increasing STEM awareness and interest of CBO-affiliated family groups, and (3) increasing awareness and understanding by the field of another community-based model for developing and delivering science education in informal settings.</AbstractNarration>

The PISEC institutions share a common mission to increase public understanding of science through engaging interactive exhibits and programs in informal settings. It is the philosophy of PISEC to move beyond the idea of simply supporting childrenÆs learning to that of family learning. The PISEC approach is to involve and engage all members of the family in science exploration, thereby giving them ever-increasing opportunities to deepen their exposure to areas that are interesting to them and are presented in a culturally responsive manner.  The resulting projects of PISEC have increased our understanding of how to involve diverse audiences to encourage family learning and multiple levels of science engagement. Moving beyond building pathways to understanding and inviting family learning in museums, PISEC developed the Communities of Learning for Urban Environments and Science (CLUES) project, a 5-year program that focused on teaching science to families within their own community venues facilitated by their peers. Over the five years of the CLUES program, there were 17,720 documented visits to 24 large museum events, 34 museum workshops, and 327 CBO workshops.  The goals of the project included:  1.

Families stated that they attended CLUES events to do something as a family, to learn about science, and to have fun. In the first and last year, about half of the families reported being knowledgeable about various urban environmental science topics, and in the last year, almost three quarters (72%) also reported quite positive attitudes toward science.
