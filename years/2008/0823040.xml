<AbstractNarration>This NSF Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to synthesize cadmium-free, water-soluble, and multicolor quantum dots (QDs) by chemical doping. The project will focus on the synthesis of high quality doped ZnSe QDs using a newly developed phosphine-free approach. From these cadmium free doped derivatives with high quality blue, green, and red emissione will be produced. Then the doped core/shell QDs will be processed to make them water-soluble and biocompatible through proprietary methods for biomedical&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful development of the proposed techniques will result in a new generation of biolabels and make significant advances in biomedical applications of such cadmium-free doped QDs. The "green" nature of the production methods, mineral precursors, natural surfactants, non-toxic and nonvolatile solvents and cadmium free QDs, will assist to maintain a sustainable environment, in addition to delivering high performance end products to the public.</AbstractNarration>
