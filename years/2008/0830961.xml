<AbstractNarration>Modern communication networks are constructed using a layered approach, with one or more electronic layers (e.g., IP, ATM, SONET) built on top of an optical fiber network.  This multitude of layers is used in order to simplify network design and operations and to enable efficient sharing of network resources.  However, this layering also gives rise to certain inefficiencies and interoperability issues.  This project explores the impact of layering on network survivability and develops network architectures that are resilient to failure propagation between layers.&lt;br/&gt; In spite its importance and practicality, to date, very little has been done to understand network survivability in this complex layered environment. The goals of this project is to develop a fundamental theory for understanding cross-layer survivability; and mechanisms for providing survivability in layered networks through the joint design of the network topologies at the different layers.   &lt;br/&gt; The outcomes of this research will include:  (i) the development of new metrics for assessing the survivability properties of layered network architectures (ii) the development of mechanisms for enhancing cross-layer survivability through the joint design of the logical and physical topologies. (ii) the development of new network architectures that have good cross-layer connectivity properties. The results of this research will be widely disseminated through publication in conferences, journals and the web.  This research will directly impact the way in which future networks will be designed and deployed; and in particular, will lead to network designs that are robust and immune to failure propagation across layers&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
