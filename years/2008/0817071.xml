<AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences 21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PRofessional Enhancement Program (PREP) offers 50 workshops enabling at least 1,000 mathematical science faculty to respond to rapid and significant developments that impact undergraduate mathematics.  PREP provides extended support for adaptation and implementation of curricular materials and pedagogical strategies that have been shown to be effective in improving the teaching and learning of undergraduate mathematics.  Themes for the PREP workshops include inquiry-based learning; distance learning; service learning; redesign of the undergraduate program in mathematics; interdisciplinary studies, especially mathematics and life sciences, mathematics and the environment, and financial and actuarial mathematics; preparation of future teachers; and how best to serve the next generation of college students, especially those who have already studied calculus in high school.  PREP workshops extend over time with preparatory, intensive, and on-going components that make extensive use of the latest technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since 2001, the Mathematical Association of AmericaÆs PRofessional Enhancement Program (PREP) has offered professional development opportunities&mdash;referred to as "PREP workshops"&mdash;that have enabled faculty to reach beyond their own educational experiences, increase their knowledge base and improve their teaching. The workshops have provided opportunities for participants to collaborate with colleagues across institutions, they have fostered the establishment of links between mathematics and partner disciplines, and they have provided national exposure for, and support the adaptation and implementation of, tested, high-quality curricular materials and pedagogical strategies, especially those developed under other NSF-funded projects.  The primary characteristics of a PREP workshop are: active involvement by participants, leadership by experts and a commitment by participants to make use of what they learn. To achieve a sustained impact each PREP workshop was an extended professional development experience with a preparatory component that consists of online discussions and readings designed to establish individual buy-in to the workshop; an intensive component, which was onsite or online and enabled participants to actively interact with the workshop leaders(s) and other participants; and a follow-up component, where participants made use of the expertise they acquired, with the workshop leaders serving as mentors.  PREP workshops have focused on a wide variety of mathematical topics ranging from geometry to mathematics and politics and from curricular issues related to preparing computer scientists to mathematical biology.  The workshops were open to all, and PREP participants represented a diverse cross-section of the higher education community.  Although participants were typically mathematics faculty from post-secondary institutions, some workshop participants were secondary school teachers, federal or private business employees or faculty from other areas such as statistics, computer science, biology and engineering.  PREP workshops with onsite intensive components typically had budgets between $20,000 and $25,000. Online workshops typically had budgets between $10,000 and $12,000.
