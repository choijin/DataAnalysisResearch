<AbstractNarration>0853798&lt;br/&gt;Reinhard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a field enhanced vibrational spectroscopy that shows great promise for the rapid spectroscopic identification of pathogenic microorganisms. To realize its full potential, SERS substrates are required that generate large and reproducible electromagnetic field enhancements. In this project fabrication technologies are developed that provide control over the complex electromagnetic response of two-dimensional plasmonic structures. To achieve this aim chemical assembly procedures and lithographic nanofabrication approaches will be combined to generate nanoscale noble metal structures at defined locations over micron length scales. Reliable fabrication methods for locations of giant electromagnetic field enhancement - so called "hot spots" - will allow a rational fabrication of optimized SERS substrates which combine large field enhancement and high reproducibility. The intellectual merit of the effort is that it will improve our understanding of the complex electromagnetic interactions in periodic and aperiodic plasmonic structures with multiple length scales. The broader impact of the project is that the optimized SERS substrates will allow a rapid and reliable identification of bacterial pathogens through SERS. This is highly relevant, for instance, in the clinical setting where it could enable more effective treatment strategies of acute infections. SERS substrates with improved reliability and reproducibility will also lead to entirely new applications of SERS in challenging biological and biomedical sensing applications. In addition to the scientific impact of this proposal, there are clear educational and outreach impacts. The project will offer students and junior researchers the opportunity to participate in a collaborative research and education program. Because both the topic and technique are of great interest to the general population, this effort will enable a substantial outreach program. One important component will be the Boston University Nanocamp, organized by the PI in collaboration with the Boston University's learning network resource (LERNet). The nanocamp will attract and familiarize students from inner-city high schools - which typically have a higher fraction of underrepresented groups - to the research outlined in this proposal.</AbstractNarration>
