<AbstractNarration>This is a comparative genome sequencing project of bacteria in the Bacillus subtilis group.  B. subtilis can be divided into two major subgroups:168 and W23. The only genome sequence available to date is a representative of the 168 group that has been extensively adapted to laboratory conditions. This adaptive process, which includes  serial passaging and X-ray irradiation, has resulted in the loss of a number of ecologically-relevant social behaviors exhibited by newly isolated environmental members of this species.  To fully appreciate the diversity within this important model organism a whole genome shotgun sequencing approach will be used to sequence the genome of an additional four B. subtilis isolates: B. subtilis TU-B-10 (type strain of the W23 group), Bacillus mojavensis RO-H-1 (close relative associated with wheat blight, hydrocarbon recovery and novel antifungal properties), B. subtilis NCIB3610 (the ancestor to B. subtilis 168) and B. subtilis RO-NN-1 (a recent environmental isolate within the 168 group that has a larger genome than other B. subtilis strains).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Bacillus subtilis is the second most studied microbe after Escherichia coli. It is the subject of more that 20,000 scientific publications and a model organism for many biological processes. Currently there are more than 20 genome sequences available or in progress for E. coli and only one genome sequence for B. subtilis. The comparative analysis of these genome sequences will generate a better insight into the evolution of this important model organism. More significantly, the large and international scientific community (academic,industrial and biodefense) will be better served by having access to these sequences. The project will also involve significant training at the postdoctoral and undergraduate levels, and the development of a website of B. subtilis comparative genomics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
