<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summer Program in Solid-State Chemistry for Undergraduate Students and College Faculty aims to increase the number and caliber of young chemists pursuing this field.  The program begins with a one-week tutorial, held at the University of Oregon where student and faculty participants are immersed in the concepts and applications of solid state chemistry through a series of morning lectures and afternoon hands-on laboratories led by top scientists in the field.  The tutorial includes two days focused on sophisticated chemical instrumentation to include microprobe and surface analysis techniques using equipment housed in the Center for Advanced Materials Characterization in Oregon. After the tutorials, the participants disperse to their assigned host laboratories across the country for an eight to nine week research session. At each host laboratory, the individual participant will become an active part of the research team, working on a project assigned by the host.  This is also time the faculty participants can use to work on curricula to include at their home institutions. Participants return to Oregon after their research for a final symposium where they share their successes, frustrations and overall experiences with peers through presentations, a poster session and group discussions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summer Program in Solid State Chemistry for Undergraduate Students and College Faculty has played a vital role in increasing the knowledge, membership and diversity of the solid-state chemistry community nationwide for the last two decades. The program begins with a one-week tutorial, held at the University of Oregon where student and faculty participants are immersed in the concepts and applications of solid-state chemistry.  This is accomplished through a series of lectures and hands-on laboratory sessions using state of the art x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, scanning electron microscopy and surface analysis techniques led by top scientists in the field. After the tutorial, the participants disperse to their assigned host laboratories across the country for an eight to nine week research session where they become an active part of the host's research team, working on a project assigned by the host. This research experience gives students perspective both on the nature of graduate level research and the importance of solid-state chemistry to current science and technology. The intensive research experience is a critical factor that influences many undergraduates, including those from underrepresented populations, to continue their education by going to graduate school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The pre-workshop packet lessened the differences between studentsÆ readiness, as they were able to read and complete the problems on their own time in advance of the tutorial.  Hands-on exposure to solid-state characterization techniques were introduced in an inquiry-based format, where student teams chose techniques to apply to their prepared products with the goal of fully characterizing the materials they synthesized.  A number of senior graduate students and postdoctoral associates used this program to develop teaching skills as they prepared for future academic careers. Two of these individuals are currently assistant professors at primarily undergraduate institutions.
