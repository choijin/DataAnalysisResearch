<AbstractNarration>Computing Education is essential not only for Computer Science and its many sibling disciplines(Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Information Systems, etc.) but for practically all other academic disciplines. Computers are pervasive today and many professionals develop basic programming skills as a way to express ideas, problems and solutions in computational terms within their own disciplines. It is common to find curricula in the arts (music, graphical design), business (accounting, economics), sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), and social sciences with computational courses in their curriculum. In a way, computing is becoming a requirement of most professional degrees.  This project addresses both the separation between computing specialists and to widespread integration of computing concepts, not just the technology but computational thinking, in other disciplines. The project will use technologies now commonly available to permit faculty to collaborate in offering courses that extend the potential reach of experts to a broader audience, as well as a collection of recorded expert lectures.  In addition, it will develop a visual, interactive interface to a common framework around which to explore similarities and differences across domains and to enable decisions about educational plan development.  The teams will also host workshops to identify innovative approaches to teaching, as well as support initiation of new collaborative course experience and reflect of the utility of the courses.  The opportunity computing education is to learn how motivated hands-on learning can engage students and provide opportunities to introduce computing concepts.  In addition to aiming for diversity in the groups of participating faculty, the project will extend the reach of computing to disciplines not normally associated with that content and will also represent the scope of their discipline to computing students, providing a broader view of the impact of the discipline as it is applied in creative fields. This project addresses the growing conviction that inter-disciplinary approaches are crucial to revitalizing computing education and offers a solution to the need for broader reach of individual areas of expertise. If successful, this project could spread to national implementations with very great effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Distributed Expertise in Enhancing Computing Education with Connections to the Arts DistributedExpertise.org Project Description  The Distributed Expertise in Enhancing Computing Education with Connections to the Arts project explored effective techniques for collaborating across disciplines and across institutions. Distributed Expertise, or DE, courses were developed and offered that provide college students with educational experiences that were not currently available from their own departments or interdisciplinary and cross-institutional course experiences that would otherwise not be available nor practical for majors and non-majors, alike. The project team involved collaborators from three institutions.  The overarching approach is that of "distributed expertise" where the expertise to offer a course is sought through collaboration of various forms with colleagues who might be at the home institution or any other institution. Sometimes the expertise is cooperatively shared, while at other times one collaborator might have a partial and complementary area of expertise with another who could serve as a facilitator.  Motivation  Computing Education is essential not only for Computer Science and its many sibling disciplines (Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Information Systems, etc.) but for all other academic disciplines. Computers are pervasive today and many professionals develop basic programming skills as a way to express ideas, problems and solutions in computational terms within their own disciplines.  Project Focus  The project had three key areas of focus:  Explore faculty collaboration across departments and institutions using available technologies to offer courses that extend the potential reach of experts to a broader audience. Develop a visual and interactive interface to the computing ontology, to provide a common framework to that quantifies similarities and differences, and supports decision making about what concepts need to be included in any educational plan. Host several workshops that identify innovative approaches to teaching computing, identify priorities, opportunities, difficulties, and resources needed to rethink computing education.   Summary of Outcomes  In support of these three key areas, we made significant contributions to computing education, particularly as it applies to cross-disciplinary collaboration, including the following outcomes:  Launched a number of inter-institutional courses between The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) and Villanova University. Surveyed existing collaborative efforts among computing faculty who are members of ACM SIGCSE, and conducted follow up surveys. Conducted numerous information sharing and planning workshops and conferences, involving over 50 partners and collaborators. Published a number of well-received academic research papers in conferences. Nurtured cross-institutional, cross-regional and cross-continential collaborative relationships to further the goals of distributed expertise research and use. Developed a number of cross-disciplinary courses at a variety of institutions. Created a new approach to interdisciplinary course design called the "Loosely-Coupled Approach" that provides a lightweight administrative mechanism to overcome many of the challenges involved with a more traditional interdisciplinary course approach. Disseminted the results of our project at conferences, panels, seminars and workshops, including delivering a keynote address at a major education conference. Developed and launched successful DE partnerships with Knacktive Project at Northwest Missouri State University, a suburban Richmond, Virginia middle school, a Ewing, New Jersey middle school. Developed courses that comined computing with such subjects as French literature analysis, Music, Biology and Bioinformatics, Journalism, Game Design, Interactive Storytelling, and Ethics.   While these are perhaps the most visible and important outcomes of this project, this enumer...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
