<AbstractNarration>Plasmaspheric hiss is an incoherent, band-limited emission found predominantly in the dense-plasma region surrounding the Earth, known as the plasmasphere. Hiss propagates as an electromagnetic plasma wave in the whistler mode, and is able to resonate with the high-energy electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts. The importance of hiss in controlling the structure and dynamics of the radiation belts has long been established, but the origin of hiss itself has been an open problem for over four decades. This project will develop a newly discovered mechanism involving chorus waves that appears to be able to naturally account for the observed frequency band, the incoherent nature, the day/night asymmetry, and the dependence on geomagnetic activity. An existing numerical ray tracing code will be used to calculate wave propagation, together with Landau damping using fluxes measured by the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES). By properly weighting the power distribution of chorus waves and tracking the evolution of chorus into hiss using ray tracing, the distribution of hiss intensity, frequency band, and wave normal angle will be quantified as a function of distance from the Earth, magnetic local time, and latitude. The effects of geomagnetic activity on the distribution of hiss characteristics will then be analyzed by recalculating the ray database under a number of different magnetospheric conditions. In the final year of the study, the project will determine contribution to hiss from (a) global lightning activity, (b) the effects of azimuthal propagation, and (c) propagation in plasmaspheric plumes. The computed hiss distributions will be compared with observations from satellite measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be done primarily by a young research scientist and a  postdoctoral scholar. Understanding the physics of the radiation belts is important to understanding and being able to forecast space weather.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plasmaspheric hiss is a naturally-occurring electromagnetic wave, much like the radio waves that are used for communication, that has been observed by satellites since the late 1960Æs. It is confined to the dense plasma region that surrounds the Earth, known as the plasmasphere, which typically occurs up to altitude of about 20,000 km above the EarthÆs surface.   Since its discovery, the origin of plasmaspheric hiss has been a topic of hot debate, and included such ideas as hiss waves arising out of a natural plasma instability in space, or perhaps being due to an accumulation of radio waves in the Very Low Frequency (VLF) range that have been injected due to lightning strikes occurring on the Earth. While these proposed mechanisms could explain certain features of the observed hiss waves, they could not explain many others.  In 2008, the PI of this NSF proposal (J. Bortnik) proposed that hiss might come about as a result of the propagation and evolution of a different wave type, called whistler-mode chorus, from distant regions of the magnetosphere.  The chorus waves would propagate into the plasmasphere, and merge into the wave continuum that is known as hiss.  Preliminary results showed that this new mechanism could ostensibly account for all of the major characteristics of plasmaspheric hiss, and the present NSF grant was awarded to the PI to perform a detailed investigation t study this new mechanism.  In the course of this NSF grant (AGS:0840178, 9/1/2009-8/31/2014), a young scientist (Lunjin Chen) began work on this project as a graduate student since its inception in 2009, continued as a postdoctoral scholar (2011- 2013), and was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Texas in Dallas, at the conclusion of his postdoctoral training in the Fall of 2013  (all within the span of the project!).  In the course of the project, Dr. Chen was awarded the prestigious AGU Space Physics and Aeronomy SectionÆs 2012 Fred L. Scarf Award, which is "given annually to a recent recipient of a Ph.D. for outstanding dissertation research that contributes directly to solar-planetary science". He has also won our departmentÆs Jacob A. Bjerknes award for outstanding research, and has made the nominee list for UCLAÆs chancellor award, as well as receiving an "editorÆs spotlight" for his paper on the modeled hiss propagation.  The research work carried out under the auspices of this proposal showed that the modeled plasmaspheric hiss characteristics reproduce observations exceptionally well.  A new technique was developed to launch many tens of thousands of rays in a numerical simulation domain (representing the source chorus waves) and reconstruct them within the plasmasphere (representing the hiss waves) and the resulting spectra matched observations from the CRRES satellite in terms of the frequency bandwidth, how it changes as a function of position within the plasmasphere, and even a bimodal power distribution of hiss within the plasmasphere.  It was shown that adding a very small amount of wave growth due to the free energy found in the particle distribution within the plasmasphere was sufficient to account for the observed plasmaspheric hiss amplitude and so now we understand that chorus waves propagating into the plasmasphere must circulate inside the plasmasphere several times and slowly accumulate wave power, before the look like the observed wave spectra on satellites.  We have also shown that chorus waves can propagate substantially in azimuth, up to several hours, and have shown exactly such a coincident observation of hiss and chorus made with the multi-probe THEMIS spacecraft, which was published in the journal science.  We also showed how density modulations in the plasmasphere (also known as ducts) can trap and guide this wave energy and this confine hiss wave power to density structures.  As a coincident discovery, whilst trying to find correlations of chorus with other emissions, we have serendipitously shown th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
