<AbstractNarration>The PIs plan to investigate QCD, electroweak symmetry breaking, and physics beyond the Standard Model. The grant period coincides with the first experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, which will probe QCD processes to unprecedented precision and discriminate among proposed models of electroweak symmetry breaking.  One strand of the PIs' research in theoretical particle physics addresses the origins of mass. They study the causes of electroweak symmetry breaking (responsible for the masses of the W and Z particles that transmit the weak nuclear force) and the mechanisms responsible for the diverse masses of the quarks and leptons, the elementary constituents of matter.  While the Standard Model of particle physics can accommodate massive particles, it does so by invoking a particle (the Higgs particle) that has not yet been observed and it does not explain the dynamics through which mass arises. Hence, the PIs seek to advance the understanding of the origins of mass by using field theory, model building, and computer simulation to explore physics that lies outside the Standard Model. Of particular interest are "Higgs-less" models whose only new particles are massive vector bosons, heavier analogs of the W and Z . They plan to construct new models of this kind that can provide insight into the masses of the quarks and leptons, analyze the experimental consequences of such models, and propose incisive new tests based on LHC data. &lt;br/&gt;Another strand of the PIs' research stresses topics, such as QCD and the properties of the Higgs boson, that are both intrinsically interesting within the Standard Model and also necessary precursors for many studies of physics beyond the Standard Model. The PIs engage in detailed QCD calculations necessary to compute the production rate and detection backgrounds for a standard model Higgs boson; they provide software to experimentalists to allow for the proper evaluation of experimental results.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes multiple efforts in the areas of linking research to education, diversifying participation, and broad dissemination of research results. The PIs will keep presenting pedagogical lectures at international summer schools for doctoral students and collaborating with Master's Degree and undergraduate Honors students  on research and outreach projects. These efforts introduce students to new areas of knowledge and provide them with faculty mentoring. The PIs will continue to create, employ, assess, and disseminate particle physics and cosmology outreach materials for K-12 students and teachers. Several of their annual outreach events focus on female students or those from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Simmons will also sustain her efforts to improve the climate for women physicists at the college, university, and national levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Contributions:     The intellectual focus of this award has been to theoretically EXPLORE THE PHYSICS ACCESSIBLE AT THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.  A key issue being explored at the LHC is the difference between the behaviors of the weak force (responsible for radioactivity, and mediated by the W and Z bosons weighing approximately 100 times the mass of the proton) and the electromagnetic force (responsible for binding electrons to atomic nuclei, and mediated by the massless photon).  The PIs have examined a range of models to explain why the weak and electromagnetic forces are observed to behave so differently despite arising from the same linked set of fundamental interactions.     The discovery of the Higgs Boson at the LHC in July, 2012 was a pivotal moment in these investigations. Any viable theory must include this new spinless, neutral particle, which is unlike any fundamental building block of nature previously discovered, and must accommodate its measured properties. Since July, 2012 one major thread of the work supported by this grant has been work on understanding the implications of the possibility that the Higgs boson could be a composite particle, formed of tightly-bound constituents.  Both the constituents and the force responsible for binding them together could potentially correspond to brand-new particles not previously observed by experiment.      The PIÆs focused specifically on creating and studying models in which the constituents of the Higgs are bound together by interactions at energies just beyond those currently explored by the LHC.  In such theories, there would inevitably be additional fundamental particles or bound states required to make the model self-consistent and in accord with existing data about the known particles and forces.  Hence, the PIÆs devoted considerable effort to analyzing the experimental signatures these theories would present at the LHC.     A separate line of investigation supported by this grant has been to UNDERSTAND THE PROPERTIES OF THEORIES THAT INVOLVE EXTENSIONS TO THE STRONG (QCD) INTERACTIONS. The QCD (short for quantum chromodynamics) interactions are mediated by massless gluons, and are responsible for binding quarks into protons and neutrons; indirectly, they result in binding protons and neutrons into atomic nuclei. While existing data on the strong interactions among quarks and gluons is consistent with the standard, minimal model of QCD (which posits the existence of exactly eight massless gluons), the data does not rule out the possibility that the underlying model is somewhat richer.      Extended models of the QCD interactions include everything already observed, but allow for additional phenomena to emerge at higher experimental energies.  These models would naturally include a new set of particles called "colorons", which are massive analogs of the gluons. The PIs have investigated the potential properties of colorons and their experimental signatures at the LHC.  Along the way, they undertook the first study of quantum corrections to the production of colorons at the LHC.     It turns out that the interactions of colorons with quarks could take a variety of different forms, each with different experimental implications.  Therefore, the PIÆs have also developed techniques whereby, if colorons are discovered, one could precisely characterize the properties of these particles.  This would enable physicists to deduce the underlying mathematical structure of the model describing coloronsÆ interactions and thereby establish the laws of physics that govern their behavior.     Broader Impacts:     STEM EDUCATION REFORM: During the award period, the PIs were leaders in campus and national efforts to improve studentsÆ learning and persistence in STEM.  They especially focused on programs and practices addressing the needs of students from demographic populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM degrees and careers.   LIN...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
