    <AbstractNarration>Musin&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807640&lt;br/&gt;Barg&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807411&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project is devoted to the study of point allocations on&lt;br/&gt;the real sphere and related configurations using methods of&lt;br/&gt;distance geometry, coding theory, and semidefinite programming. &lt;br/&gt;The properties of the point sets studied include restricting the&lt;br/&gt;minimum angular separation between any pair of distinct points in&lt;br/&gt;the set or the degree of the cubature formula supported by it. &lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in these problems include a solution by the&lt;br/&gt;investigator of the kissing number problem in 4 dimensions, a new&lt;br/&gt;proof for the kissing number problem in 3 dimensions, and a new&lt;br/&gt;approach to bounds on codes using semidefinite programming, due&lt;br/&gt;to Schrijver, Bachoc, and the investigator. The kissing problem&lt;br/&gt;in x dimensions is the question of how many unit spheres can&lt;br/&gt;touch (kiss) a unit sphere in x dimensions. The new ideas&lt;br/&gt;developed in these works pave the way for further advances in the&lt;br/&gt;problems of bounding the size of codes and in a number of other&lt;br/&gt;problems in distance geometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The main problems to be addressed in the project are related&lt;br/&gt;to bounding the size of optimal sets of points on a sphere when&lt;br/&gt;the sets have a certain property, and the links between the&lt;br/&gt;bounding problem and multivariate positive definite polynomials. &lt;br/&gt;Interesting properties of the point set include having a minimum&lt;br/&gt;angular separation that exceeds a given value between any two&lt;br/&gt;points in the set (this is relevant for signal processing&lt;br/&gt;problems), and supporting an exact cubature formula for spherical&lt;br/&gt;harmonic functions of a given degree. Applications of the point&lt;br/&gt;sets studied include communication theory, numerical analysis,&lt;br/&gt;the meshing problem, data representation, and localization in&lt;br/&gt;sensor networks.</AbstractNarration>
