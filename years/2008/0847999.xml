<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will extend the work begun in Phase I to apply advances in knowledge discovery to bridge the gap between what is known about an Internet viewer and what is done with this knowledge to improve user experience and business outcomes.  The effort will develop new algorithms to combine implicit and explicit taxonomies to build content networks.  A live feedback loop that uses multivariate test results will be used to adjust and refine clusters of users in order to establish specific parameters which can subsequently be acted on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online content publishers aggregate enormous volumes of data about their viewers from web logs, registration systems, third-party web analytics providers and ad-serving systems.  Mostly these systems operate independently with a primary focus on describing what has happened.  Through a deeper analysis, which will be enabled by the current effort, content providers will be able to use this data in more predictive ways.  This in turn will allow content providers a more intelligent tool for serving higher-value content throughout the online experience.  If successful, this will have implication for new rich media services and e-commerce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Do you ever miss a concert or play that you wished you had known about?  Do you find it hard to keep up with all the local events going on in your town?  Crosscut Media has tackled this problem with statistics and machine learning.  We have built an events recommendation engine that you train by thumbing up events they like and thumbing down events they don't like.  Based on these thumbs, we filter through all events for this weekend and send you just the ones that match your preferences.  We developed a technique to extract the important characteristics of an event from the text of the event.  These features are so accurate that if you spend five minutes training the system (about 50 thumbs), we will be able to generate a top-ten list where at least five of the ten will be interesting to you.  In addition, as part of this work we have built a framework we use to statistically estimate proposed model improvements.  The commercial product based on this technology is live and in production now.  As we built this product, we had the opportunity to emply a number of undergraduates in research positions.  Working with us, they had exposure to state-of-the-art software development and research technologies.  All of our interns have ended up employed and one has gone on to focus on machine learning for his masters degree.
