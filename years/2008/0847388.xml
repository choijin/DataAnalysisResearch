    <AbstractNarration>Maggioni&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0847388&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award is funded under the American Recovery and&lt;br/&gt;Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The investigator&lt;br/&gt;addresses fundamental problems arising from the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;analysis of multiscale geometries of sets, and multiscale&lt;br/&gt;decompositions of function spaces on such sets. The complexity&lt;br/&gt;of the geometry of these sets, which are embedded in&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional spaces, are noisy, and often have different&lt;br/&gt;dimensions at different locations, is analyzed at multiple&lt;br/&gt;resolutions. He develops robust mathematical and statistical&lt;br/&gt;quantitative multiscale methods of analysis, yielding estimators&lt;br/&gt;of intrinsic dimensionality that are extremely robust to noise&lt;br/&gt;and succeed with high probability even for small sample size. He&lt;br/&gt;develops algorithms for multiscale processing of high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;point clouds much as is done for low-dimensional functions, by&lt;br/&gt;means of a geometric multiscale transform. He studies and&lt;br/&gt;approximates functions on data by constructing data-driven&lt;br/&gt;multiscale dictionaries, generalizing approaches familiar in&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. He develops efficient&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for computing these multiscale decompositions and&lt;br/&gt;dictionary expansions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many important application problems directly require the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of high-dimensional data sets, dynamical systems, or&lt;br/&gt;large graphs, or they are posed on a framework of&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional data sets, dynamical systems, or large graphs.&lt;br/&gt;Such problems arise for instance in different disciplines and&lt;br/&gt;real-world situations where instruments or simulations produce&lt;br/&gt;large amounts of data. The investigator develops novel methods&lt;br/&gt;for the analysis of high-dimensional data sets and of statistical&lt;br/&gt;models with a large number of variables, under the assumption&lt;br/&gt;that the number of free parameters (which in some sense&lt;br/&gt;represents the intrinsic dimensionality or complexity) of the&lt;br/&gt;data is small compared to that of the ambient space. He further&lt;br/&gt;applies these methods to algorithms that are able to learn&lt;br/&gt;functions on such data from examples, or learn models of complex&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems (e.g. molecular dynamics, protein folding,&lt;br/&gt;neuronal activity, etc.), or learn behavior patterns in social&lt;br/&gt;networks. This Career award is funded by the Applied Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences/Directorate of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical and Physical Sciences and by the Office of&lt;br/&gt;Cyberinfrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
