    <AbstractNarration>Objective &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this effort is to demonstrate the utilization of common-paper substrates for inkjet-printed increased-functionality cognitive and autonomous inexpensive radio frequency tags and wireless nodes. The approach will use a characterization of paper-based materials and different inkjet-metallization schemes to help integrate components (antennas, transmission lines, matching networks, batteries and energy scavengers), with for compatibility of IC-interconnects with paper. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is the development of the first paper-based inkjet-printed technology platform to integrate RF, antenna, material and battery technologies and develop the first-generation of enhanced-range communication/sensor nodes able to operate in various environments. The scavenging-antenna approach will facilitate the research in autonomous rugged wireless modules and will allow for the first true mapping of potentially harvested energy in commercial bands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact of this effort would lead to the reconfigurable autonomous sensor networks of the future, addressing various societal challenges (chemical/explosive-detection, crack/stress detection, secure emergency communications, smart logistics, surveillance sensors, biomonitoring). In addition, this effort could revolutionize high-frequency electronics? education offering the opportunity to students to inkjet-print electronic prototypes in minutes with near-to-zero cost without the need of expensive and time-consuming masks introducing them for the first time to the principles of environmentally-friendly electronics. A new senior-level course is planned, along with a dissemination effort in major conferences and through a new textbook in the proposed area. The project is expected to involve a number of minority students.</AbstractNarration>
