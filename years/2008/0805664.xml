<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation of underrepresented minorities in biology through mentorship and outreach. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Glenn F. Dulla is "Host-symbiont interactions between composting earthworms and bacteria: Do chemical signaling and motility affect host colonization?" The host institution for this research is the University of Washington and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. David Stahl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The health of all biological systems is influenced by interactions between the resident micro- and macro-organisms. In terrestrial systems, earthworms improve the health of soil biosystems through their burrowing, ingestion of particles, and nutrient cycling. In turn, the worms'health is enhanced by symbionts such as Acidovorax-like bacteria, which colonize the osmoregulatory-excretory organs (nephridia) of the composting earthworm Eisinia foetida. This project is developing a genetic system to manipulate the genome of the Acidovorax-like species. Using these new tools, genes and expression patterns are being identified that determine the role of bacterial motility and chemical signaling in the bacteria's preferential colonization of the nephridia.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The training objectives expand proficiencies in microbiology techniques. Working in a new biological system will add scientific breadth to the repertoire of technical skills and alternative avenues of scientific reasoning. Broader impacts include a better understanding of the relationship between the earthworm and its associated Acidovorax-like bacteria, as well as more general interactions between eukaryotic hosts and their bacterial endosymbionts.</AbstractNarration>
