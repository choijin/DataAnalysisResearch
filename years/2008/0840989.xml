<AbstractNarration>The University of California-San Diego is awarded a grant to create a research coordination network to promote and integrate standards for genomic and metagenomic data and metadata within an international community. The network is based on the existing Genomic Standard Consortium and will be extended under this award to include ecological data standards such as Ecological Metadata Language, biodiversity standards such as Darwin Core, and environmental research programs such as the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network and Long Term Ecological Research. Genome enabled research has transformed biological sciences for the entire breadth of scales from molecular to ecosystems. Expanding and fully incorporating early consensus building, technical standards and the institutional commitments inspired and implemented by the Genomic Standards Consortium, the creation of this RCN for the Genome Standards Consortium (RCN4GSC) will ensure a worldwide, community driven process for establishing standardized mechanisms for the electronic capture of genomic data and for obtaining willingness to participate; these are essential to ensure effective use of the sequence and associated data, to provide access for all biologists to all of the information, and to create interdisciplinary opportunities for discovery.  &lt;br/&gt; Intense collaborations around the maturation of GCDML, Genome Rosetta Stone and the Genome Catalogue will be an early focus. Productivity will be sustained year round by routine A.V. and web-enabled interactions, including small working group sessions and collaborations via the RCN's extant web hub at http://gensc.org. The activities will expand ongoing coordination required for implementation, including the Genome Catalog, GCDML, Genome Rosetta Stone software, Habitat-Lite and Environmental Ontology, and the eJournal "Standards in Genomic Sciences". The RCN will also sustain and build upon the very active, ongoing, two-way exchange between LTER and GSC, interactions arising from common goals. The RCN4GSC will be an open organization, welcoming inspired biologists with a commitment to community service, and will increase participation from Asia and the USA. Coordination with professional societies and communication to federal and foundation stakeholders will be among strategies for expanding participation; these will be managed by the Communications Committee, who will focus on enlisting further diversity in participation and in reaching out to young biologists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over this concluding performance period, this award supported the planning and execution of a community meeting, entitled ?New Opportunities to Study Origins of the Eukaryotic Cell.? This meeting was conducted at the Janelia Research Campus over the days spanning April 15-18, 2018.  This award further supported the generation of a summary report on the outcomes of the meeting.  This meeting brought together thought leaders to discuss how eukaryotes evolved and to explore new opportunities to accelerate understanding of their evolution. Meeting participants explored how the study of non-eukaryotic cells and basal eukaryotes can provide insight into the origins of eukaryotic cellular organization, organelles, and eukaryote-specific molecular pathways. Attendees shared key data emerging from genomics, proteomics, informatics, computational biology, structural biology and microscopy, highlighting the most exciting opportunities for future research. Participants further discussed gaps in our knowledge and identified specific research areas where the development of new strategies, new methods and new tools would most rapidly propel our understanding of the origins and diversity of eukaryotic cellular processes. The program was comprised of short (15 min) talks, poster sessions and breakout sessions to explore sub-topics in greater depth. Participants and organizers further produced a written summary of the opportunities and potential strategies to accelerate research on the evolution of eukaryotes (to be published in 2019 or 2020). The key outcome of this meeting was the identification of 3 organizing research priorities (and recommended approaches and associated disciplines) to drive deeper understanding of eukaryotic origins.  These priorities are summarized as follows:   1. Explore and Classify Earth?s Biodiversity   &rarr; What is the full extent of Earth?s biodiversity? Are substantial branches of the phylogenetic tree of life missing that would reveal key links between Archaea and Eukaryotes? Based on combined metabolic / phylogenetic trees and physiological inferences, can we reconstruct the eukaryotic common ancestor?     Potential Approaches:  1) Continue to explore and analyze microbial diversity, ecophysiology, and structure across as wide a range of environments as possible.  2) Using new and existing genomic and proteomic data, build robust phylogenetic trees that incorporate physiological data to clarify evolutionary relationships and characterize missing branches.  3) Reconstruct the eukaryotic ancestor?s physiological and structural traits.     Key Disciplines: Environmental microbiology, Fluorescence Microscopy, Meta-omics, Genetics, Computational Biology, Electron Microscopy, Phylogenetics.   2. Clarify the Evolutionary History and Fundamental Principles of the Eukaryotic Cell     &rarr; What was the sequence of events that gave rise to eukaryotic cells? Where did the organelles come from? Which features are necessary and/or sufficient for a eukaryotic cell (e.g., genome size, organelle complement) and what are its constraints (e.g., size, metabolism)? Are evolutionary pressures for prokaryotes and eukaryotes different? Do they respond differently?     Potential Approaches:  1) Examine how the environment exerts its influence on cells and how evolutionary pressures may have contributed to eukaryogenesis  2) Delineate the path(s) to eukaryogenesis  3) Determine the limits of eukaryotic life, in comparison to prokaryotes     Key Disciplines: Evolutionary Biology, Geobiology, Cell Biology, Statistics, Molecular Biology, Mass Spectrometry, Synthetic Biology, Genetic Engineering, Analytical Chemistry   3. Study Microbial Communities to Develop Key Principles of Inter-Organism Interactions     &rarr; What drives interspecies interactions, and how does the polarity of metabolic interactions shift under different conditions? Which aspects of collaboration are generalizable? What enables the transition to multicellularity, and how can multi-component communities inform this investigation?      Potential Approaches:  1) Probe interspecies interactions under environmentally relevant conditions to understand how partnerships expand habitable zones, enable energetic complexity, and drive evolution.  2) Build microbial interactions from co-cultures and model systems in the lab, using known settings and controlled manipulation to rigorously evaluate behaviors and responses under distinct conditions.  3) Integrate empirical data with modeling approaches to understand the fundamental principles at play.     Key Disciplines: Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering, Biochemistry, Marine Microbiology, Meta-omics, Culturing, Modeling         Last Modified: 05/29/2019       Submitted by: Mark H Ellisman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
