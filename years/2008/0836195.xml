<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the sources of observed perturbations to the F region ionosphere due to upward propagating gravity waves at two incoherent scatter radar sites, Poker Flat and Arecibo.  A by-product of the research will be the extraction of time-varying F region neutral winds.  The research activities include making gravity wave observations using a new technique at the two radars, modeling of secondary gravity wave excitation as well as the propagation and dissipation of these gravity waves, and reverse ray tracing studies.  The F region of the atmosphere frequently exhibits medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances that are thought to be gravity waves propagating upwards from the lower atmosphere, but their sources are generally unknown.  Of particular interest is determining the role of secondary gravity waves in producing the ionospheric disturbances.  Two types of secondary wave generation will be investigated in this project:  those excited by mountain wave breaking in the wintertime thermosphere at high latitudes and those excited by the breaking of gravity waves in the mesosphere.  One of the tools used to address the identification of gravity wave sources is reverse ray tracing. The essential information needed for the ray tracing approach is: 1) an accurate gravity dispersion relation, and 2) knowledge of the gravity wave's horizontal and vertical wavelengths and its period.  Recently, an accurate viscous gravity wave dispersion relation which accounts for realistic thermospheric dissipation was derived and incorporated into a 3D ray trace model under a previous grant.  Meanwhile, information on gravity wave wavelengths and period have recently become available from new multi-beam experiments at the Poker Flat and Arecibo radars.  As part of this project, observations of electron density perturbations associated with the passage of gravity waves will be made at the two radars.  These measurements will be the basis for the modeling studies, which emphasize gravity wave (GW) coupling between the lower atmosphere and the thermosphere.  The specific tasks and objectives include:  determining wavelengths and periods from the density and velocity perturbation profiles for selected gravity waves at Poker Flat and Arecibo; extracting the temporal evolution of the neutral winds and accelerations in the F region from these profiles using the viscous gravity wave dispersion relation; calculating the secondary gravity wave spectra excited from breaking mountain waves, and characterizing the scales and amplitudes of the GWs in the F-region via ray tracing; determining the lower-atmospheric sources of the gravity waves observed in the thermosphere for three case studies at Poker Flat and one or two case studies at Arecibo; testing the accuracy of the viscous GW dispersion relation by comparing the extracted neutral winds with the measured neutral winds along the magnetic field at Arecibo.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are only 2 types of linear waves in the atmosphere: acoustic waves and gravity waves.  In general, acoustic waves tend to have small amplitudes.  Whereas, gravity waves tend to have larger amplitudes, and carry away most of the energy from typical sources.  By "amplitude", we refer to how far the air is displaced as the wave passes by.  These sources include the breaking of waves from air-flow over mountains ("mountain waves"), thunderstorms, and the aurora.  When we refer to "breaking" waves, it is easiest to visualize this breaking with ocean waves; just before the ocean waves reach the beach, the wave appears to lift up and curl over itself before it crashes down on itself ("breaks").  In the studies performed during the duration of this grant, we investigated theoretically and observationally the sources of gravity waves observed in Alaska using the the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar in Alaska (north of Fairbanks), the Arecibo Observatory (AO) in Puerto Rico, and dual Fabry-Perot Interferometers (FPI) in Alaska (Poker Flat and Fort Yukon).  These instruments provided us with an unprecedented look at the gravity waves excited by these sources.  We found that the major daytime sources of gravity waves in Alaska includes wind changes in the troposphere, dubbed "geostrophic adjustment", and the breaking of mountain waves.  We also studied a nighttime gravity wave in Alaska, and found that it likely originated from the northern aurora.  At Puerto Rico, we found that the vertical wavelengths of the gravity wave spectrum increases very quickly with altitude, as expected from theory.  We also found that these waves appear to come from the direction of the continents to the northwest, west, and southwest of Puerto Rico.  This includes Florida, central America, and Brazil.  Since these were summertime measurements, this suggests that these waves originated from thunderstorms in these regions, as well as in the ocean offshore from these regions.  The precise locations of these sources are currently under investigation with another NSF grant.   The thermosphere, which is the region of the atmosphere above 110 km, is viscous, and impedes the motion of propagating gravity waves.  We say that a gravity wave dissipates as it moves upwards in the thermosphere.  Dissipation can be envisioned in the following way.  If a person walks through air on the ground, no "drag" is felt on one's legs.  Thus, there is no noticeable dissipation in this case.  If that person then walks in a pool of water, a significant amount of drag is felt on one's legs, which slows the person down; thus, a fair amount of the person's energy is dissipated in the water.  Finally, if that person walks in a pool of molasses, that person may not be able to walk at all.  In that case, the person's "propagation" through the medium, namely molasses, is stopped.  Then, all of that person's forward-motion energy is dissipated.  In a similar manner, gravity waves dissipate in the thermosphere.  In this grant, we studied the properties of these waves as they dissipate in the thermosphere.  We found various relationships among the gravity wave parameters, such as between the upward and eastward air motions, as well as to the variations in the air temperature as the wave passes by.  We applied these relations to satellite and FPI data in order to validate these results.  We found that the results fit the data reasonably well in both cases.  Such a validation is important, because it allows the results to be used in cases where complete data sets are not available (such as for future satellite and FPI data).
