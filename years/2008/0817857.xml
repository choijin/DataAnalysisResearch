<AbstractNarration>NMR spectroscopy is widely used in science and engineering, but acquisition of multi-dimensional spectral information is hampered by the NMR sampling problem resulting from the steep increase of minimal measurement times with dimensionality. Furthermore, NMR-based studies of biological macromolecules are impeded by chemical shift degeneracy, in part resulting from comparably low accuracy of shift measurements.  The focus of this project is on the  development of methodology for rapid NMR data acquisition and data acquisition schemes enabling one to measure NMR parameters more accurately. Specifically, the objective is to implement a new line of "simultaneously cycled" or "slice selected" NMR experiments to (quasi) simultaneously execute radio-frequency pulse phase of flip-angle cycling, and to implement schemes to acquire spectra devoid of dispersive line components, which impede accurate measurement of shifts.  This new methodology will be applied to solve protein structures in the framework of structural genomics consortia in order to assess impact on semi-automated data analysis and protein folding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new NMR methodology will broadly impact on the speed and accuracy of NMR data acquisition in the scientific community.  The PI will set up a web portal to ensure efficient dissemination of results. This project is well suited to educate young researchers in NMR-based structural biology, in particular in advanced methodology development and application of NMR to study protein structure and folding.  The research will be conducted considering the specific demands for comprehensive interdisciplinary teaching of young scientists at the Departments of Chemistry and Structural Biology at the State University at New York at Buffalo. The PI will offer undergraduate and graduate level courses in Physical Chemistry and on the use of NMR in life sciences, and he will continue to support research training of undergraduate students in the laboratory, in summer schools and in colleges.  This project is jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background and significance  Spectroscopy represents a major tool used by scientists to study matter based on its interaction with electro-magnetic radiation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is based on radiation with very low energy (radio-frequency). This enables scientists to tackle very fragile structures without perturbing them with higher energy radiation. However, the use of low-energy radiation comes at a high price: NMR spectrometers can easily cost a million US dollars or more. This is because large magnets and sophisticated electronics are required.  Life scientists, in particular æstructural biologistsÆ, use NMR to study structure and dynamics of the fragile constituents of living systems, e.g. protein molecules and their interactions with other biomolecules, at atomic resolution. The complexity of these high molecular weight protein molecules requires the acquisition of NMR spectra with extremely high information content, that is, spectra of æhigh-dimensionalityÆ which encode and resolve æNMR parametersÆ providing the desired structural and dynamic information. Apart from enhancing our understanding of the phenomenon of life, such NMR studies are of pivotal importance for biomedical research and drug development.   NMR spectroscopy faces four major challenges to take best advantage of the costly scientific infrastructure. First, NMR spectra should be acquired as rapidly as possible to enhance utilization of spectrometers. Second,  spectra should be acquired such that NMR parameters are obtained with highest possible precision. Third, the measurement of important NMR parameters should be feasible even for the largest (most complex) biological macromolecules. Fourth, the measurement of hitherto not utilized NMR parameters providing additional information should be enabled.   Intellectual merit and broader impacts of research  Technology developments which resulted from this project are summarized below with reference to the four challenges.  Challenge 1: Rapid acquisition of NMR spectra  The acquisition of NMR spectra relies on æwaiting periodsÆ between signal detections so that atomic nuclei can relax back to thermal equilibrium. The longer the waiting period, the closer will they relax back to equilibrium. However, long waiting periods also lengthen the acquisition time. Hence, we implemented æspatially selective NMR technologyÆ to acquire spectra with long waiting periods while at the same time allowing for high repetition rates for signal detection.  The acquisition of multi-dimensional spectral information is hampered by the æNMR sampling problemÆ resulting from the steep increase of measurement times with dimensionality. Hence, we developed æGFT projection NMR technologiesÆ to rapidly acquire (a) relayed four-dimensional spectral information for the efficient resonance assignment of ribose moieties in RNA molecules in solution and (b) four-dimensional spectral information for the efficient resonance assignment of protein molecules in the solid state.  Challenge 2: Precise measurement of NMR parameters   We developed æclean absorption mode NMR data acquisition technologyÆ for the elimination of unwanted signal components to enhance spectral resolution and to enable more precise measurement of important NMR parameters. Subsequently, we developed a comprehensive theory of æmirrored time domain sampling of NMR spectraÆ to enable not only optimized clean absorption mode NMR technology but also new NMR technologies to measure other important NMR parameters.  In addition, we contributed to develop NMR technology to precisely measure ækinetic 13C isotope effectsÆ occurring during enzymatic reactions, which enables their improved analysis.  Challenge 3: Acquisition of NMR parameters for high molecular weight biological macromolecules  We developed æSE2 J-TROSY NMR technologyÆ to measure the key NMR parameter æ15N-1H residual dipolar couplingÆ in very large protein molecules and supramolecular complexes. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
