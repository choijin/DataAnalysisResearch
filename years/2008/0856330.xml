<AbstractNarration>This award supports the continuation of the aerial hydrographic surveys component of the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) as part of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) and the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH). During the annual aerial hydrographic surveys a number of tasks will be completed: (1) conductivity/salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and nutrient profiles will be measured in the water column; (2) water samples will be retrieved and returned to the laboratory for analysis of a variety of tracers [salinity, Ba, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, delta O-18]; and (3) a variety of ice-based drifting instruments will be deployed for other AON projects, including ice mass balance buoys, ice-tethered profilers and atmospheric pressure buoys. The "Intellectual Merit" of NPEO rests on its foundation of successfully tracking change in the air-ice-ocean system since 2000, and obtaining data that will help to answer the question "have a combination of long-term trends and decadal variability driven the Arctic Ocean to the brink of a new seasonal ice regime?" The "Broader Impacts" of NPEO center on enabling the scientific efforts of other investigators, and educating the public about environmental change in the Arctic. NPEO improves the scientific infrastructure by providing scientific data, developing new observational methods, and providing operational field support to other Arctic researchers. NPEO continues to take advantage of the cachet that the North Pole provides for generating many avenues for informal education and outreach. NPEO maintains a Web site, participates in various talks and demonstrations at the annual Polar Science Weekend at Seattle's Pacific Science Center, and will sponsor a booth at the SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Latinos and Native Americans in Science) conference aimed at broadening participation of under-represented groups in careers in environmental science.</AbstractNarration>

The NSF Arctic Observing Network (AON) was formed to do this. NPEO was an excellent prototypical AON observatory, first because the North Pole is an excellent site for measuring change, and second because NPEO pioneered techniques for making repeat observations in one of the most remote regions on the planet.  NPEO automated drifting station deployments at the North Pole filled a geographic gap in buoy coverage of the International Arctic Buoy Program.  The NPEO airborne hydrographic surveys from the Pole reached critical areas difficult to reach from other locations.  The NPEO mooring at the North Pole provided a unique time series of observations representing the central Arctic Ocean.  The NPEO repeat hydrographic measurements in the central Arctic Ocean and a unique bottom pressure recorder at the Pole have provided ground truth observations for satellite altimetry and gravimetry, which have in turn extended our observations of circulation and freshwater content Arctic Basin-wide. NPEO has tracked the significant decadal variability of these and at the same time supported studies by other scientist of shorter-term, more localized processes.
