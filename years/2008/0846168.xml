<AbstractNarration>During early embryonic development, the expression of large numbers of genes must be precisely orchestrated to allow correct morphogenesis of an organism.  Thus, studying gene regulatory networks is crucial to understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern early neural development.  The Zic1 transcription factor plays multiple and critical roles in early neural development, for example when neural tissue is first set aside and later during formation of the cerebellum.  Despite its critical roles in regulating genes during early neural development, little is known about the molecular pathways that are regulated by this transcription factor.  A screen conducted in the PI's laboratory was designed to identify genes that are directly regulated by Zic1.  Four of these genes are the focus of the proposed studies.  The first is an aquaglyceroporin (aqp-3b), which is specifically expressed in the neural folds.  It is expected to be involved in closure of the neural tube.  Three additional genes (cpl-1, CRABP-II, and SRC-3) promote retinoic acid signaling, which plays critical roles in hindbrain development.  The experiments in this project aim to identify a mechanism through which Zic1 regulates neural tube closure and may show that Zic1 is a previously unknown modulator of retinoic acid signaling.  Together, the data from these experiments will significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which the transcription factor Zic1 regulates early neural development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the educational activities are to integrate research and teaching by developing a research-based course that introduces a larger group of students to hands-on research than is possible in an individual research laboratory and will allow development of lasting skills in independent inquiry-based thinking.  The undergraduates will examine additional direct target genes of the Zic1 transcription factor.  The resulting projects will be continued inside the classroom in subsequent years of the course, and outside the classroom by undergraduate students in independent research projects within the PI's laboratory.  Thus, the course will help attract talented undergraduate students into the laboratory, who might previously not have considered research an option.  Further, outreach activities to middle schools and tribal colleges will provide teaching opportunities for undergraduate students that will foster a deeper understanding of their own work and contribute to BRIDGES, a program that facilitates the transition of Native American students from tribal colleges to four-year institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During early embryonic development, the expression of large numbers of genes is precisely orchestrated to allow correct morphogenesis of an organism.  Transcription factors are critical elements in this process, they regulate when and where certain genes will be expressed.  Of particular interest to our research is the family of five Zic transcription factors, which play multiple roles during early development of the nervous system.  Despite their important roles, our knowledge about the molecular pathways that are regulated by Zic transcription factors is limited.  Thus, we conducted a screen designed to identify genes that are directly regulated by Zic1, using Xenopus laevis as model organism. In this screen, we identified two new genes: the aquaglyceroporin3b (aqp3b) gene and the Xfeb gene. Aquaglyceroporins are water channels that allow water and small molecules to cross the cell membrane.  aqp3b was specifically expressed in the neural folds, which form at the edges of the neural plate (the first neural tissue established in embryos). The neural folds join to become the neural tube by a process called neural tube closure.  When this process does not occur normally, neural tube defects (such as anencephaly and spina bifida) result.  Mutations or deletions of zic genes in humans and mouse are known to result in neural tube defects. Thus, it was of significant interest when we discovered that aqp3b was expressed in the neural folds and was required for neural tube closure.  Neural plate cells constrict their apical domains to allow neural tube closure.  This apical constriction was disrupted throughout the neural plate, when aqp3b expression in the neural folds was compromised. We are currently testing the mechanism by which aqp3b exerts its influence on the entire neural plate.  Further, aqp3b is required for normal cell behavior during gastrulation.  Gastrulation is the process by which cells enter the embryo (involute) to form its initial set of tissues (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm).  When aqp3b expression was compromised in gastrula embryos, the cells did not migrate properly during involution.  Further, the boundary between non-involuted ectoderm and involuted mesendoderm did not form correctly because the extracellular matrix component fibronectin was missing between these two tissue layers.  In addition, aqp3b was required for convergent extension cell movements in whole embryos and in tissue explants from Xenopus gastrula embryos.  Convergent extension movements of cells drive the involution of mesendoderm cells during gastrulation.  In order to affect convergent extension, Aqp3b acted through noncanonical Wnt signaling.  Demonstration of an aquaporin acting through specific signaling pathways is an important advance in our understanding of the function of aquaporins.  In another project, we examined the role in neural crest development of Xfeb (another direct transcriptional target of Zic factors).  Xfeb was required for slug expression, which is a neural crest marker.  Xfeb consists of five SCP domains and deletions of these domains showed that SCP domains 1 and 2 appeared to be dispensable, while domain 5 is required.  Interestingly, domains 1-4 have putative serine protease activity, while domain 5 lacks critical residues for serine protease activity.  Finally, in collaboration with Dr. Andrew Wilkie (Oxford University, UK), we determined that expressing Zic1 constructs that carry deletions or point mutations in the C-terminal domain cause mis-regulation of engrailed-2 expression in Xenopus embryos, which is critical for formation of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and of the cranial sutures.  On the education side of this grant, a new Molecular Biology course was developed specifically for freshman students.  Students cloned genes that were identified as direct targets of the Zic1 transcription factor in the screen described above.  The course was specifically designed as a research experience, where students learned the scientific process from forming a hypothesis to designing their experiments and preparing final presentations.  Troubleshooting proved to afford the deepest learning experiences.  The students also designed and conducted workshops for local middle and/or Native American high school students to develop teaching skills.  As a result of this course, students entered research laboratories early and were competent and successful.  In further education activities, immersive week-long introduction to research courses for students at tribal colleges were developed and implemented, using zebrafish embryos as model organism.  These activities were later funded by a separate NSF grant.          Last Modified: 12/28/2019       Submitted by: Christa Merzdorf]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
