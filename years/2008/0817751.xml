<AbstractNarration>This is a three-year effort to produce models of the high latitude ground magnetic field variations as function of the solar wind and IMF conditions.   The work uses the same technique of spherical harmonic expansion that has been utilized in the existing ?Weimer models? of ionospheric electrodynamics. In the new model the scalar magnetic potential will be matched to ground based magnetometer measurements.  First, a static baseline model will be developed.  Next, dynamical information where the magnetic field is perturbed due to sudden pressure pulses in the solar wind will be included through a superposed epoch analysis, equivalent to a disturbance-response classification process.   Datasets from the Canadian CARISMA chain, the Greenland Chain, and the Virtual Global Magnetic Observatory residing at Virginia Tech will be used together with solar wind data from the ACE satellite.   &lt;br/&gt;The new models will have widespread utility within the space science community and also has the potential to contribute directly to improved space weather forecasts and/or nowcasts in the near-term future. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to develop a new method for predicting the geomagnetic perturbations at the surface of the Earth that are caused by the solar wind and the embedded interplanetary magnetic field (commonly referred to by the abbreviation IMF). The interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere produces electric fields and currents in the ionosphere. Magnetic fields are produced by the electrical currents flowing in the conductive ionosphere.  These magnetic field variations are more intense in polar regions under the aurora, and much smaller variations occur near the equator on a daily cycle, due to solar illumination of the ionosphere. Although the magnitudes of these fields are much smaller than the level of the steady field from the Earth's interior.  Forecasts of these effects due to "space weather" are useful to a number of commercial interests.  The magnetic variations can affect geomagnetic surveys and navigation, induce currents in pipelines, and perturb electrical power grids.    The construction of this "empirical model" required measurements from over 140 magnetometers scattered over the Northern Hemisphere. The simultaneous measurements of the solar wind and IMF were also required, and were obtained from NASA's "Advanced Composition Explorer" (ACE) satellite, that was launched in 1997.   These data that were collected and processed for a time span of eight years.  Another activity was the creation of a list of "magnetospheric substorms" during the same eight-year period.  A graduate student had developed this list, and used it to map the progression of the geomagnetic variations during substorms, that occur when there is a release of energy that was accumulated in the "tail" of the Earth's magnetic field, due to stretching by the solar wind.  This work was done for a Masters thesis, which was completed in 2012.  Figure 1 shows maps of all three vector components of the magnetic perturbations, from the final version of the prediction model. These maps show patterns for an IMF that has a moderate magnitude (8 nT). Each of the four rows show the results for different IMF directions, using a coordinate system in space that has the +Z axis aligned with the Earth's main dipole magnetic field.  These maps use a coordinate system based on geomagnetic latitudes and longitudes from local solar time.  The X, Y, and Z maps show the magnetic perturbations that are in the Northward, Eastward, and Vertical directions.  It has been noticed that the maps of the vertical perturbations strongly resemble the patterns of the overhead, field-aligned currents in the aurora (Northern Lights).  The model has been running on a web server for over two years, using input from the real-time measurements in the solar wind.  The data from NASA's ACE satellite are obtained through the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center, and the maps show conditions that are expected approximately one hour into the future.  This is possible since the radio signal from ACE reaches the Earth before the IMF in the slower solar wind can arrive.  Continuous updates are shown at http://mist.nianet.org/weimerGeomag.html.  Figure 2 shows an example from this web site.  Comparisons of this new model's calculations with actual measurements at different locations show very good results, particularly at low frequencies.  In the magnetometer measurements there are random and unpredictable variations at higher frequencies, that are not reproduced as well with the model, but they tend to occur in relative proportion.  This noise signal is due to the turbulent motion of the aurora. This model could be useful for providing regional forecasts of geomagnetic activity, with an approximately one-hour lead time.
