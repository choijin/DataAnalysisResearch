<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantastic achievements in present-day electronics are based on detailed knowledge of the properties of silicon doped with phosphorus and boron. Similar knowledge of physical properties of optical materials doped with rare-earth and transition ions is required for the fast and successful development of optoelectronics devices, for instance, laser screens suitable for a use by the bright sun light on streets, highways and airports. This project will be devoted to the investigation of intentionally doped optical crystals with the help of techniques, which operate at different frequencies of electromagnetic waves (multifrequency spectroscopy). It is expected that this research will give a significant contribution to the fundamental understanding of the nature, properties and interrelation of defects created by doping, determination of their structures on atomic/nanoscale levels, and finally, to tailoring properties of optical materials. This is of key importance for optical communication technologies. Conducting cutting-edge investigations, students and post-docs will become proficient in state-of-the art experimental techniques; learn promising materials and their potential applications. All these will improve their career prospects and efficiency of their future activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doping materials like lithium niobate and tantalate allows creating various elements for optoelectronics: waveguides, modulators, lasers, fiber amplifiers, holographic memory etc. Electrical and magnetic interactions of transition and rare earth ions with surrounding ions have frequencies from kilohertz up to petahertz. Complementary techniques including electron paramagnetic resonance, electron nuclear double resonance, and optical spectrometers will be used in order to characterize these interactions and to clarify structures of impurity and intrinsic defects on atomic/nanoscale levels. It is expected that this research will give a significant contribution to the fundamental understanding of the nature, properties and interrelation of these defects, and finally, to tailoring properties of optical materials. Findings of the project will have a potential impact on various scientific projects, as well as on applications in optical communication technologies. Conducting cutting-edge investigations, students and post-docs will become proficient in state-of-the art experimental techniques, learn promising materials and their modern applications, and consolidate knowledge obtained in solid state physics courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Last year, the magnetic resonance spectroscopy was integrated to education program of the Physics Department as a part of the course "Advanced Experimental Physics Lab". Eleven students attended this course and carried out EPR measurements of selected samples using spectroscopic equipment of our lab. Backgrounds of magnetic resonance were placed on corresponding pages of the D2L (Desire To Learn) online system.  The conducted research contributed also to lectures devoted to non-linear optical materials, ferroelectrics, photonic materials and magnetic properties of solids in the required course "Solid State Physics" for undergraduate students, "Novel Materials for Physics and Engineering" for graduate and undergraduate students, and "Condensed Matter Physics" for graduate students. Basic ideas of the EPR/ENDOR and combined multifrequency spectroscopy were presented in the popular lecture "How to See the Invisible", designed for undergraduate students.  A part of our findings was already published in peer-review physics journals and presented at local, national and international scientific conferences; other results submitted are prepared for publications.  Information about our activity, key results, publications and presentations was placed on our laboratory website:  http://www.physics.montana.edu/eprlab/index.html  The website was designed in a format, which is understandable for broad public and senators.
