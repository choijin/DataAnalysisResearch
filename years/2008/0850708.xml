<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding for a series of workshops to be hosted jointly by the University of Minnesota and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis during the summers of 2009, 2010 and 2011. Each workshop will meet for four days, concentrating on theoretical issues in macroeconomics and dynamic economic modeling. These workshops continue the series sponsored by the NSF at the University of Minnesota during 2000-08 and at Northwestern University during 1990-99.&lt;br/&gt;Specific topics for the three years will vary, depending on research interests of the participants. Topics in recent years have included: international trade and finance, heterogeneity and inequality, labor market behavior, financial markets, housing markets, development and financial integration, monetary policy, fiscal policy, long run growth, and macroeconomic consequences of contracting frictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Research: This workshop series brings together the best junior and senior researchers in theoretical macroeconomics. As such, it is a useful device for new, young researchers in the area to meet and get detailed comments from their senior colleagues to guide their future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the Research: The research presented in this conference series focuses on many of the fundamental questions facing macroeconomic policy makers currently (the design of the tax system and monetary policy, the importance of reputation, etc.). Thus, it will have a broad impact on the future design of macro policy both in the U. S. and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funds a series of annual workshops on Macroeconomic Theory that has been taking place for approximately 25 years now. It has been held at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, since 2000. Prior to that it was held at Northwestern University. Also contributing funds to help pay for the conference are the University of Minnesota, College of Liberal Arts and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Research Division.  Each year a selection committee consisting of two researchers in macroeconomics, different each year, chooses the speakers for the year. Then, the workshop meets in late July for a series of fifteen talks by leading scholars in macroeconomics. These talks are based on associated research papers. Typically, 75 to 90 people attend each talk and a very spirited discussion concerning the research takes place.  Historically, this workshop series has been a venue where the best young researchers in the field interact with more experienced faculty members in an open forum to both present their current work and get advice about future work.  The website for the conference is at:  http://www.econ.umn.edu/macro/  Available there is the entire list of talks over the 12 years since the conference began taking place at the University of Minnesota along with the selection committee for each year.
