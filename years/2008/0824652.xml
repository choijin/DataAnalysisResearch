<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Profiling float observations in the western subpolar North Atlantic made in the 1990s appeared to contradict the current understanding of the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) as the dominant export pathway for Labrador Sea Water (LSW) from subpolar to subtropical latitudes. All of the profiling floats that exited the Labrador Sea in the DWBC left the boundary well north of the Tail of the Grand Banks, turning eastward into the ocean interior along the path of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) at about 50°N. This unexpected observation motivated a long-term observational effort to obtain a better understanding of LSW pathways and their variability with new float observations and historical hydrographic data analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field component of this project, which began in 2003, is nearly complete. For three years, groups of six acoustically tracked RAFOS floats were released nominally every three months in the DWBC near 50ºN at Upper LSW and Classical LSW levels. When the last floats surface in November 2008, two-year high-resolution trajectories from about 62 RAFOS floats will be available for analysis. Two important results have emerged to date from a study of RAFOS floats that have already surfaced and "e-floats" generated from an ocean eddy-resolving general circulation model. First, there is little evidence for a "fast-track" from the subpolar to the subtropical basin along the DWBC. Second, a significant number of RAFOS and e-floats trace an interior pathway for LSW southward from the Newfoundland Basin to the eastern subtropical gyre, a pathway that was not observed at all by the profiling floats. These results raise critical questions about the importance of the DWBC as an export pathway for newly-ventilated waters, and hence its role in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) which is a near-term priority of the Ocean Research Priorities Plan (ORPP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the conclusion of the RAFOS field work in sight, and the capability to generate e-float trajectories in hand, the investigators are now poised to make significant advances in the understanding of the export pathways of LSW and their impact on the AMOC. The specific objectives of this analysis are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Complete the statistical analysis of the full RAFOS float data set and compare to a similar study using e-floats generated from an ocean general circulation model.&lt;br/&gt;2. Reconcile the apparent contradiction between the rapid loss of floats from the DWBC in the Newfoundland Basin and the concept of the DWBC as a direct LSW export pathway from the subpolar to subtropical region.&lt;br/&gt;3. Elucidate the impact of mesoscale, interannual and decadal variability on LSW pathways.&lt;br/&gt;4. Assess the importance of the interior pathway of LSW, relative to the DWBC, to the volume and property transport of the AMOC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By providing an improved understanding of subpolar-to-subtropical ocean pathways, this proposed research will contribute to an unraveling of the ocean's role in global climate. The Lagrangian perspective will provide valuable information on the continuity of the lower limb of the AMOC and as such will aid in the design of monitoring programs. This project will also have a broader impact in that it will contribute to the training and education of a graduate student at Duke University and a postdoctoral investigator at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</AbstractNarration>
