<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malicious software is one of the most pressing security problems on&lt;br/&gt;the Internet. The main reason for the apparent failure of current&lt;br/&gt;defense approaches is that malware detection techniques are too&lt;br/&gt;specific. This is most obvious with virus scanners, which rely on&lt;br/&gt;signatures that are specific to individual malware instances. However,&lt;br/&gt;also behavioral detection techniques typically target only specific&lt;br/&gt;features of malicious code. Examples include the scanning behavior of&lt;br/&gt;worms and the command and control channels of bots. Unfortunately,&lt;br/&gt;such techniques become obsolete when malware evolves and the targeted&lt;br/&gt;feature disappears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we develop a novel malware defense system that&lt;br/&gt;overcomes the shortcomings of current approaches. To this end, we&lt;br/&gt;investigate techniques that specify and model program behavior at a&lt;br/&gt;level of abstraction that captures general properties and features&lt;br/&gt;that are fundamental to the execution of programs. In addition, we&lt;br/&gt;develop a stealth and comprehensive analysis environment that&lt;br/&gt;automatically extracts the characteristics of novel malware strains&lt;br/&gt;when they appear, expressing these characteristics in terms of the&lt;br/&gt;general, behavioral properties. These characteristics are then&lt;br/&gt;automatically translated into efficient detection models. This allows&lt;br/&gt;our system to quickly react to and eliminate novel malware variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research on novel techniques to eliminate malware presents rich&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for industrial and societal impact, and will have broad&lt;br/&gt;impact though education and outreach. We will introduce a new course&lt;br/&gt;on malware analysis at UC Santa Barbara, perform outreach activities&lt;br/&gt;through a newly established diversity center, and cooperate with&lt;br/&gt;well-known players in the anti-malware industry.</AbstractNarration>
