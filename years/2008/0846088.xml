<AbstractNarration>The rat whisker system is one of the most commonly-used systems in neuroscience to study how the brain combines sensory information with movement information. To date, however, the small size and rapid movements of the whiskers have made it difficult to quantify their dynamics. This work will quantify how the whiskers move and interact with objects during rat exploratory behavior. Improved understanding of the rat whisker system will provide considerable insight into the general functional principles that govern the neural circuits mediating sensing and control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dynamic model of the isolated whisker moving in free air and during object collisions will be developed. This will be incorporated into an anatomically accurate 3-dimensional simulation environment. Finally, behavioral experiments will identify the patterns of mechanical input across the array associated with the rat's ability to distinguish between flat and curved surfaces. The ultimate goal is to determine how the brain might represent the shape of an object based entirely on the patterns of forces and moments at the base of each whisker across the array. The simulation environment will be distributed widely, so that researchers working on any brain structure involved in rat whisking behavior can predict whisker-object contact patterns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation environment will also be used in conjunction with previously developed robotic systems in a classroom environment and to aid in the recruitment of underrepresented minority engineering applicants. Students will be engaged in understanding how basic mechanical principles must be applied to sensory neuroscience. Simultaneously, the PI will develop a coordinated program for undergraduate research across the McCormick school of Engineering at Northwestern University. The success of these initiatives will be carefully evaluated with the help of Northwestern's Searle Center for Teaching Excellence.</AbstractNarration>

Somehow, your brain combines information about your hand movements and the contacts that your fingers make, to enable you to identify a particular object. The goal of this research project was to better understand how movement and touch are combined in the brain to enable perception.  The problem, however, is that the human hand is complicated. It is not yet possible to measure all of the mechanical signals generated as a hand touches an object. Therefore, this research used the rat whisker system as a model. The neural pathways that carry touch information from a ratÆs whiskers through its brain are in many ways similar to the pathways that carry touch information from the hand through the brain, so whiskers are a good model to study how movement and touch signals are combined.  The same way that humans have five fingers in a row on each hand, all rats have approximately 31 whiskers on each side of their face, arranged in a grid (a bit like the game "Bingo"). A ratÆs whiskers are similar to those of a cat or a dog, but with one important difference &ndash; rats can move their whiskers completely independent of their head. The rat can keep its head immobile, but special muscles allow it to rotate its whiskers through angles up to ~70 degrees. This behavior is called "whisking."  The first step in constructing the Virtual Rat was to measure the size, shape, and orientation of all the whiskers on the faces of many rats. We could then construct a 3D computer model of the rat head and whisker array and simulate motions of the ratÆs head and whiskers to learn how rats explore their world through the sense of touch. You can see the "Virtual Rat" in Figure 1.  We then ran simulations that determined how far the rat can reach with its whiskers and how large a volume the whisker array encompasses. These simulations revealed how the rat must move its whiskers if it wants to change how carefully it is exploring an object. When we looked at the shape of the whiskers around the head, we also discovered that the whisker tips form nearly a perfect section of a sphere centered around the ratÆs eyes, suggesting that the whisker array is tuned to work in concert with vision.  In other simulations, we looked at how motions of the ratÆs head influence the way whiskers touch an object. The results showed that if the rat changes how its head is oriented, very different whiskers will come into contact &ndash; in other words, changing the head orientation determines which whiskers touch an object. In contrast, because the head typically moves more slowly than the whiskers, head motions have a much smaller effect on when the whiskers make contact with an object. Distinguishing between the spatial and temporal patterns of contact is important because it can help neuroscientists determine what patterns of whisker stimulation to use when studying the responses of neurons in the brain.

This was a particularly challenging problem because whiskers are flexible. We studied the material properties of whiskers, including their mass and stiffness, and we developed models that describe how the whisker bends and vibrates as well as the mechanical signals generated when it collides with different objects.  We compared the simulation results generated by the Virtual Rat with high speed videos taken while real rats explored different objects with their whiskers. For example, you can see the contact patterns that the whiskers make on a flat wall in Figure 2. We found that the simulations were able to predict the overall spatial structure with which the whiskers touch an object. We also found that when whiskers touch a surface they sustain contact for extended durations, during which...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
