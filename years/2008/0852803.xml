<AbstractNarration>0852803&lt;br/&gt;Sorial&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), usually called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have been a major health concern due to their adverse effects on both human and the environment. Biofiltration systems have recently emerged as an attractive option for controlling volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions from industrial processes due to its cost effectiveness. However, a number of challenges face biofiltration technology. Typically, most off-gas or treatment streams for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that originate in industrial processes have variable flowrates and contaminant compositions that limit the handling efficiency of the biofiltration system. Furthermore, hydrophobic contaminants are not readily bio-available. Nevertheless, the regulatory community generally expects emission controls to be capable of maintaining adequate treatment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a solution to this limitation in biofiltration systems, a novel integrated technology will be investigated to achieve stable contaminant removal efficiency by combining the buffering capacity of a two bed cyclic adsorption/desorption unit with a Trickle Bed Air Biofilter (TBAB). The bioavailability of hydrophobic compounds will be enhanced by the introduction of non-toxic surfactants that will serve dual purposes, increasing solubility and limiting excess biomass growth. The primary objective of this project will be to establish the effectiveness of coupling adsorption with biofiltration to yield an efficient treatment train that can comply with emissions regulation during adverse conditions of industrial operation especially for recalcitrant low solubility contaminants. The results of the study are expected to form the scientific and engineering bases for an innovative integrated treatment scheme for effective control of hydrophobic VOCs under varying loading conditions. It is expected that the utilization of the 2- bed cyclic adsorption/desorption unit to minimize fluctuations in the TBAB operation will improve the overall efficiency of the biofiltration treatment process; provide cost savings and more consistent emission compliance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a general class of additional benefits, the proposed scheme for removal of hydrophobic VOCs is expected to promote significantly improved air emission control technologies. Furthermore, the research activities will emphasize learning through discovery and can be used to establish a culture of curiosity, critical thinking, and an authentic scientific method of inquiry for both undergraduate and graduate students. The 7th to 12th grade teachers involved in the RET site project (in which the PI of this project is a CO-PI) will have the opportunity to gain knowledge in the proposed research through scheduled Engineering Seminars and poster forums and convey the knowledge gained in their teachings of math and science. Furthermore, the results obtained in this study will be disseminated by presentations at national and international conferences and by publication in peer refereed journals for enhancing scientific and technological understanding of the proposed integrated technology.</AbstractNarration>

Two hydrophobic compounds, n-hexane and benzene, which are carcinogenic and toxic, and one hydrophilic compound, namely, methanol were utilized as model compounds. Different operating conditions were considered. Loading rates up to 48 , 64.5 and 77 g/(m3 h) for n-hexane, methanol and benzene were applied at the inlet providing elimination capacities of 39, 63.1 and 61 g/(m3 h) , respectively.
