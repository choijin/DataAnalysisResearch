<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in wireless and micro-electronics technologies &lt;br/&gt;have made these technologies functionally accessible and available &lt;br/&gt;to a wide range of different applications. One of the fast growing &lt;br/&gt;field?s is wireless sensor networks technologies, whose applications &lt;br/&gt;from military,  such as monitoring enemy and military consignments, &lt;br/&gt;to traffic surveillance, environment and building structures monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;An important characteristic of sensor networks is the limited power &lt;br/&gt;supply of the sensor nodes. These nodes are usually powered by batteries, &lt;br/&gt;and therefore it may not be possible to recharge or replace the batteries &lt;br/&gt;after their deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research aims at addressing the maximal lifetime scheduling &lt;br/&gt;problem for sensor surveillance networks in a dynamic environment in which &lt;br/&gt;the positions of the targets are dynamic and each sensor has different &lt;br/&gt;surveillance range. Specifically, the research involves an exploratory &lt;br/&gt;investigation of finding a novel family of efficient scheduling algorithms &lt;br/&gt;(that offer a wide range of tradeoffs among cost, scalability and energy &lt;br/&gt;consumption) for a sensor surveillance network. Its purpose is to monitor &lt;br/&gt;a set of moving targets, such that all the targets are being monitored by &lt;br/&gt;the sensors in the network at any point in time and at the same time the &lt;br/&gt;lifetime of the sensor surveillance network is maximized. In this scheduling &lt;br/&gt;algorithm, a sensor can switch off to save energy when it is not its turn to &lt;br/&gt;monitor a target. The proposed project also develops distributed monitoring &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms and scanning methods to obtain a sensor?s locations information. &lt;br/&gt;An analytical framework to theoretically evaluate the scheduling solution &lt;br/&gt;from the point of view of tradeoffs between cost, scalability and energy &lt;br/&gt;consumption is also proposed. The analytical results will be evaluated by &lt;br/&gt;extensive simulations and experimental measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
