<AbstractNarration>Lipton&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807265&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator develops new mathematical and computational&lt;br/&gt;tools for the quantitative description of multi-scale phenomena&lt;br/&gt;seen in composite structures.  The effort focuses on properties&lt;br/&gt;related to failure initiation.  Failure is often precipitated by&lt;br/&gt;extreme excursions of the local fields at the level of the&lt;br/&gt;microgometry.  Three projects are carried out that seek to make&lt;br/&gt;new connections between the excursions of local deformation,&lt;br/&gt;strain, and stress fields as functions of applied boundary loads&lt;br/&gt;and initial conditions.  The first project examines load transfer&lt;br/&gt;between length scales for hierarchical structures when the&lt;br/&gt;substructure is known only in a statistical sense.  The goal is&lt;br/&gt;to provide new variational tools for teasing out relationships&lt;br/&gt;that connect the local field response to the applied long&lt;br/&gt;wavelength loads.  The objective is to use these relationships to&lt;br/&gt;discover explicit criteria on the applied loads that are&lt;br/&gt;necessary for failure initiation inside composite media.  The&lt;br/&gt;second project seeks to understand how field fluctuations inside&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous media depend on the boundary data in the presence&lt;br/&gt;of residual stress.  The goals of this project are to: i)&lt;br/&gt;quantify the roles of boundary data, microgeometry and residual&lt;br/&gt;stress on the penetration of high stress zones inside&lt;br/&gt;statistically defined media and ii) understand the effect of&lt;br/&gt;residual stress on the decay of high frequency boundary data&lt;br/&gt;inside the composite domain.  Understanding these phenomena&lt;br/&gt;facilitates the design of tough composite structures for use in&lt;br/&gt;aviation and infrastructure.  The third project investigates the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of heterogeneous media using nonlocal models for elastic&lt;br/&gt;interactions.  The goal is to develop a multi-scale peridynamic&lt;br/&gt;formulation for modeling deformation fields inside fiber&lt;br/&gt;reinforced laminates.  This formulation provides the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;framework and associated numerical methods necessary to capture&lt;br/&gt;the dynamic interactions between small and large length scales. &lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the basic mathematical work and subsequent&lt;br/&gt;numerical investigations can resolve new dynamic phenomena that&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the delamination and failure of fiber reinforced&lt;br/&gt;laminates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator develops new mathematical and computational&lt;br/&gt;tools for the quantitative description of multi-scale phenomena&lt;br/&gt;seen in composite structures.  Composite materials are rapidly&lt;br/&gt;becoming the materials of choice for structural applications. &lt;br/&gt;This is due to their light weight and superior stiffness&lt;br/&gt;properties.  In order to accelerate their deployment an improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding of their strength properties based upon their&lt;br/&gt;microstructural geometry is required.  This proposal focuses on&lt;br/&gt;properties related to failure initiation.  Failure is often&lt;br/&gt;precipitated by extreme excursions of the local fields at the&lt;br/&gt;level of the microgometry.  The proposal consists of three&lt;br/&gt;projects that make new connections between the excursions of&lt;br/&gt;local deformation, strain, and stress fields as functions of&lt;br/&gt;applied boundary loads and initial conditions.  The projects are&lt;br/&gt;chosen to address issues of practical interest that if solved can&lt;br/&gt;accelerate the use of light weight composite materials for&lt;br/&gt;applications in aviation and infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
