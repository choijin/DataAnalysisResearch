<AbstractNarration>Horner-Devine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will combine a series of laboratory experiments with field observations with the aim of improving our understanding of the vertical structure of wave supported gravity currents (WSGC). Specifically, the proposed laboratory studies will address whether the high concentrations of suspended sediment necessary to initiate down-slope transport can be achieved solely by resuspension, or whether sediment convergence is necessary. The work has important implications for sediment transport in a wide range of environments. Previous observations of high concentration fluid muds in energetic oceanic environments have been largely limited to areas with extremely high fluvial sediment input. Understanding the role of sediment supply to the formation and initiation of this mode of sediment transport will improve the understanding of cross-shelf sediment transport. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across-shelf transport by wave-supported turbidity currents is a newly identified, potentially dominant mechanism for moving fine sediment (and associated constituents such as carbon and contaminants) across continental shelves. The project will also support one graduate student, enhance undergraduate courses, and provide outreach to pre-college students through the UW Open House.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Source-to-sink describes the processes by which sediment is generated in the mountains, carried downhill to the coast, dispersed along the continental margin and, ultimately, lost to the abyssal ocean. Understanding these processes is critical for understanding geochemical cycling (e.g., carbon), ecosystem impacts and coastal resource management.

Along continental margins, the predominant direction of ocean currents is parallel to the coast, and the slope of the seabed is not sufficiently steep for sediment to be carried to deeper water by gravity alone. Scientists have been trying to understand this missing link: how does sediment discharged onto the continental margin from rivers move across the continental shelf?     Results from field observations in the past two decades suggest that surface gravity waves may play an important role in this process. If the water is sufficiently shallow and/or the waves are sufficiently large, surface waves generate shear stress on the seabed. The observations suggest that this stress can be large enough to re-suspended or maintain in suspension a thick high-concentration mud layer, which will then flow downslope due to gravity. These flows are referred to as wave-supported gravity currents (WSGC). While observations from a number of field campaigns point to the importance of this process in shelf sediment transport, measurements that would enable detailed predictive models of WSGC are nearly impossible in the field due to the episodic nature of the currents and the fact that they may be only a 5-10 centimeters thick.
