<AbstractNarration>Drs Mateo and Olszewski will measure the motions of stars within dwarf galaxies, using a spectrograph at the Magellan telescope built by Dr. Mateo.  These least-luminous of the galaxies appear to contain far more mass than is present as stars: we observe those stars to be moving so rapidly that they would escape from the galaxy if not for the additional gravitational pull of unseen dark matter.  By careful studies of stellar motion, the group will improve measurements of the total mass present in nearby dwarf galaxies, and test whether they are being pulled apart by gravitational forces from neighbor galaxies.  In more distant galaxies, they will measure motions of the surrounding globular star clusters to estimate the mass of the galaxy and hence of its dark matter.  The group will collaborate with statisticians to analyze and interpret their results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work will test theories of galaxy formation, many of which predict that a galaxy must exceed a minimum mass in order to continue making stars.  Students will be trained as they participate in the research.  Both Dr Mateo and Dr. Olszewski will present public lectures on their work in their local communities. Through a program at U. Arizona, Dr. Olszewski will continue his work with elementary-school teachers, with star parties and visits to the Steward Observatory telescopes.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This study was designed to extract critical information about these processes from detailed studies of some of these satellite systems and other structures using a variety of astornomical instruments and techniques.  Over the course of this work we determined that the dwarf galaxies of the Halo not only reveal a common minimum mass scale--that is, however faint they are, these galaxies always contain at least 10 million solar masses worth of dark matter--but that the distribution of this mass appears to be 'universal'.  The scale and detailed shape of this profile appears not to conform to expectations from the more popular dark matter models, though this remains an issue of significant discussion.  We have also demonstrated that these dwarf systems, simple as they appear to be, actually contain significant substructure as revealed from the basic properties fo their stars and the motions of these stars within the gravitational fields of the galaxies.  We have also explore the nature of extended structures--known as streams--in the outer Galaxy,. studying both well-known structures such as the Sagittarius stream and new regions such as the Virgo Overdensity.  These reveal how dwarf galaxies are tidally destroyed as they approach our Milky Way and in the process build up our Galaxy, and they also help reveal the nature and number of such dwarfs that have, over the past 10 billion years, contributed to this process.  Finally, our work helped to provide specific scientific guidance for the development of new observational tools--also funded in large part by the NSF--that allow us to carry out even more comprehensive studies of the Galactic Halo and its enigmatic population of dwarf galaxies and stellar streams.
