<AbstractNarration>The Space Science Institute, in collaboration with the Catawba Science Center (North Carolina), the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, the American Library Association, and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific propose to develop a multi-pronged project on the topic of asteroids.  Content areas will include: Asteroids ? Up-close and Personal; Deep Impact; and Planetary Protection.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables will include a 2,500 square-foot traveling exhibit for small to mid-sized museums; four, 300 square-foot ?small exhibit components? (SECs) for libraries, community centers, etc.; Web 2.0 sites for the project developers and for the public; public education programs; professional development programs for informal STEM professionals; and a study of how Web 2.0 can be used to improve the evaluation of Web sites.  The project team will be experimenting with virtual prototyping of exhibit modules as a way to improve exhibit development, especially with team members who are around the country.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teens from around the country will be enlisted to help inform the project on its deliverables.  The Association of Science-Technology Centers will manage the exhibit tour.  The Institute for Learning Innovation will conduct the evaluation activities, including the study of Web 2.0 and virtual prototyping tasks.</AbstractNarration>

Teachers and docents participated in workshops about the exhibit content at the Science Museum of Virginia and the Columbia Memorial Space Center. The Association of Science-Technology Centers, a project partner, hosted an online forum for informal science educators that focused on how the Asteroids team successfully integrated middle school students into the projectÆs development process.  Project facilitators also engaged the participants in discussions about creating meaningful STEM experiences for and with students.     4)      Outreach and Education: ASP developed the Space Rocks Toolkit for use by amateur astronomers in ASPÆs Night Sky Network.
