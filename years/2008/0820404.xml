<AbstractNarration>The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the Pennsylvania State University exploits unique capabilities in materials synthesis and fabrication, microscopy, physical property measurements, molecular synthesis and theory to attain materials with new properties and functions in areas of fundamental scientific importance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center includes several interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). The Motors IRG designs, synthesizes, and studies molecular, nano- and micro-scale motors that employ chemical reactions to generate force at the nanometer scale. This IRG constrains and controls motor movement via tethers, tracks, rotary bearings, gradients in the fuel concentration, magnetic or electric fields, patterns of light and interactions between motors themselves, to enable long-term applications in systems that sense, respond, organize and adapt to their environment. The IRG on Electrons in Confinement advances our understanding of electrons that are confined to move within precisely defined, narrow one-dimensional single crystals made from a wide range of metals and semiconductors. Interactions between these confined electrons generate new phenomena involving superconductivity, magnetism and the motion of electron spins. The IRG on Electromagnetic Nanostructures organizes and integrates metals and semiconductors in sophisticated patterns. By marrying the ideal media for electrons and photons, it enables a new class of in-fiber devices for the generation, modulation and detection of light. Patterned planar nanostructures generate unusual optical properties such as low, zero and negative refractive index, thereby enabling an unprecedented degree of control over the propagation of light.  The IRG on Multiferroics exploits strain, the ability to stretch or compress the atoms within a lattice by depositing them layer-by-layer, to create a new class of materials that couple together elastic deformation, electric fields and magnetism, guided by computational modeling that can predict new materials. Multiferroics promise a variety of new material applications, such as electrically switched magnetic memories. Seed grants, selected through competitive peer review, will lead the Center in new scientific directions by nurturing high-risk, transformative research by both early-career and established faculty.  These projects include making new electronic materials by connecting atomic clusters with conductive linker molecules and studying the quantum mechanical aspects of electron transport in one-dimensional systems. All research projects will be regularly competitively reviewed to maintain high levels of innovation, collaboration, productivity and scientific impact.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MRSEC nurtures a broad range of partnerships with national, international and industrial collaborators. Center research activities are strongly integrated with educational and industrial programs, providing interdisciplinary training within a culture of outreach for a diverse group of students and postdocs. For maximum impact, the Center?s outreach activities couple the scientific expertise and enthusiasm of its members with its partners' expertise in reaching large audiences.  The MRSEC develops content on topics of public interest for K-8 summer science camps. With The Franklin Institute, the Center designs and produces hands-on cart-based shows for distribution to a national network of science museums.  Center faculty will mentor high school students from the Science Leadership Academy. The Center recruits and supports students from under-represented groups at all levels through close ties with institutions in Puerto Rico, Texas, Louisiana, and (through the NSF Discovery Corps) Africa. The Center reaches a broad range of high schools and middle schools through teacher training workshops and research experiences, and mentors a diverse group of students through Research Experiences for Undergraduates. All major outreach programs are regularly assessed for efficacy and impact.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The Center produced &gt;450 publications &amp; patents with multiple papers in Science, Nature + sister journals, PNAS, PRL, JACS, Angew. Chem., Nanoletters and others. The MRSEC nucleated companies, built industrial partnerships and established productive international collaborations.  IRG 1, Atomic Scale Design of Multiferroics predicted and created new multiferroic materials in which magnetic, electrical and/or elastic forms of order co-exist within a single material, among other accomplishments proposing and demonstrating four new mechanisms of multiferroicity and developing new materials of potential application in low-loss high-frequency communications. IRG2, Powered Motion at the Nanoscale pioneered the invention and development of autonomously powered nanomovers that are powered  by chemical fuels or acoustic fields. The IRG team demonstrated that single enzyme molecules can generate sufficient mechanical force through substrate turnover to cause their own movement and , more significantly, the movement becomes directional through the imposition of a gradient in substrate concentration, a form of chemotaxis at the molecular level. This discovery may have broad implications for the strategies that cells use tho manage the transport and accumulation of chemicals within their interiors. IRG3, Charge and Spin Transport in Quasi-1D Nanowires brought together complementary expertise to create new phenomena in the charge and spin transport of quasi-1D metallic, superconducting, and magnetic nanowires and nanowire junctions, phenomena that encompass low dimensional condensed matter physics, materials growth and processing, and device design and fabrication. IRG4, Electromagnetically Coupled Nanostuctures integrated metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics on sub-wavelength scales to access new optical and optoelectronic material properties and novel devices. Among other accomplishments, the IRG achieved high-power infrared optical fibers, amorphous silicon fibers with excellent optical properties, novel Bragg fibers, scalable fabrication of integrated p-n radial junctions, and the first low-loss void-free ZnSe fiber cores suitable for hosting transition metal dopants. Optical metasurfaces that allow for ultrathin optical components with broad operational bandwidth, wide field of view and high efficiency were developed. Planar metallo- and all -dielectric nanostructures with customized refractive indices including zero and negative index and low loss were developed, including mechanically robust free-standing zero index meta-material in the near-infrared. Education and Outreach efforts catalyzed new diversity initiatives at Penn State, including the STEM Open House, founding sponsorship of the Millennium Scholars program, and the MRSEC-initiated Women in STEM Mixer. New hands-on materials kits were developed in partnership with the Franklin Institute, involving MRSEC members at all career stages in inception, design and implementation and delivery, and distributed to ~30 science museums nationwide, reaching 100,000 participants annually. Diverse high school participants in the Science Leadership Camp engaged with MRSEC scientists at all career stages, as did numerous Upward Bound students working in MRSEC labs. Additional summer camps targeted younger K...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
