<AbstractNarration>This award to Oregon State University by the Solid State Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research is to support a collaborative project aimed at the synthesis and study of new wide band gap compound semiconductors that can be selectively doped either n- or p-type. Such bipolar materials are of fundamental interest in setting the foundation for a variety of new technologies including broad-spectrum solar cells, highly efficient polycrystalline inorganic light-emitting devices (ILEDs), complementary printed electronic circuits, and photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water. The fundamental scientific question is whether the valence and conduction band positions can be optimized to allow one material to be a host to either n- or p- doped carriers without excessive compensation. The basic premise is to seek materials that&lt;br/&gt;have two (or more) cations that are known to be reliable hosts of each of the conductivity types&lt;br/&gt;and combine them in a single material.  This designed materials approach to realizing such bipolar behavior is expected to discover new p- and n-type semiconductors that will be useful in applications from solar cells to transparent electronics.  As part of the project, the investigators will explore bulk powder materials and selected thin film systems using a range of experiments that probe structural, electrical, and optical properties of the materials and their defects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this project, students will be trained in gaining experience in a broad range of synthesis and characterization techniques covering a wide spectrum of new wide band gap compound semiconductors from powders to thin films. In addition, this work will involve close collaboration between faculty, graduate students and undergraduate students in Chemistry and Physics departments. As a research extensive university, Oregon State University expects all students to participate in cutting edge research in order to contribute to the knowledge base, which in turn is to provide the basis for Ph.D. and undergraduate senior thesis dissertations. Students will learn the techniques of solid state chemistry and physics, and understand the scientific process by engaging in collaborative research, rigorous scrutiny of their work by peers and mentors, delivering accomplished presentations, and receiving mentorship and being mentors as appropriate. An outreach component of the proposed collaboration is the integration with a regional undergraduate summer research program sponsored by industry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explored new semiconductors with band gaps of a size appropriate to be used in many electronic devices, including solar cells, where they would absorb the sunlight and transfer the charge for collection, and transparent electronics, where circuits are invisible and can be painted on windows.  For semiconductor electronics, we need materials that can accept dopants that create positively charged (p-type) carriers and negatively charged (n-type) carriers.  Most semiconductors accept either one or the other type of dopant (unipolar), but p-type carriers are harder to create. Rarely does a material accept both kinds of dopants (bipolar).  We found several new unipolar p-type semiconductors, e.g. BaCuQF and BiCuOQ (Q = S, Se, Te), and some new bipolar semiconductors, e.g. SnMQ3 (M = Zr, Hf, Sn; Q = S, Se), and investigated the optical, electrical and structural properties that help us understand how light is absorbed and how charge is carried.  We also found that a well-known semiconductor, SnS, can exhibit the necessary absorption and charge collection properties to be used in solar cells.  This is important because SnS is made of "earth abundant" elements that are in plentiful supply and not as toxic as many in current use.  The project developed new bulk semiconductors and translated them to thin-film form, the most commonly, used form in applications, via pulsed laser deposition.  This allowed us to create and control different combinations of semiconductors &ndash; in particular, we could control the semiconductor band gap, which determines the optical absorption and the charge transport.  The project directly funded the Ph.D. work of four graduate students and the M.S. work of two graduate students and provided projects for five undergraduates in Chemistry and Physics.  These students received a rigorous, intensive training in research, and were fully involved in initiating and maintaining interdisciplinary collaborations with research groups across the world, acquiring and reporting results internally and nationally via conference presentations and journal publications.   The work in this project has involved collaborations between experimental and theoretical scientists, and some of the techniques are now being taught in Solid State Physics classes to beginning graduate and advanced undergraduate students in Chemistry, Physics, Engineering and Materials Science.   Our students now use powerful software to calculate the electronic structure of semiconductors, including many of the properties researched under this grant. Now novices can accomplish and understand in a few weeks a task that, fifteen years ago, was limited to experts only and took months.
