<AbstractNarration>This project involves research synthesis of the literature on laboratory experiences in the life sciences from first grade through the first year of college from 1987-2006. During this time period many advances in educational standards, cognitive sciences, and learning research have changed the conception of lab experiences in biological sciences. The project will produce both a literature review and a publication that: 1) identifies areas that are already well studied; 2) indicates areas requiring further study; 3) establishes a theoretical framework for research and development of progressions in laboratory experiences in the life sciences across grades. The NRC study, America?s Lab Report, limited its research to high school, expressly leaving aside the question of earlier grade levels, and the progression from elementary school to college. Furthermore, the NRC study did not explore any particular disciplinary content. Thus, some of the unique characteristics of the biological sciences have not been used in a consideration of the goals, value, and growth of understanding in biology during students' biology education. This study will fill that gap. The study?s main goal is to examine key literature on labs and activities in life sciences, examining English-language publications in North America, Australia, and Europe. The study will address six major research questions that relate to progressions in student learning, content and design, activity structure, support of diverse learners, ?innovation bias? and international comparisons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will contribute to the development of empirically based research and development in life science curriculum and teacher education by taking a critical look at the lab experiences. The research synthesis will aim to serve current needs in life-science education across the grades. The deliverables are intended to inform researchers and practitioners concerned with life science education, and to facilitate dialogue between these constituencies. It will also serve the field of science education research, by identifying gaps in the research of the past two decades ? gaps in age-level studied, in subject matter covered, and in kinds of lab experiences under-investigated. The findings of the study are likely to have an impact of curriculum design and teacher professional development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
