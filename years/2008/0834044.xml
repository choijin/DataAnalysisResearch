<AbstractNarration>PI:  C. Robin Buell (Institute for Genomic Research)&lt;br/&gt;CO-PIs:  Shelley H. Jansky (USDA-ARS), Bernd M. Lange (Washington State University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on generating genomic resources for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Through participation in the international Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC), it will generate Genome Survey Sequences and a draft sequence of chromosome VI. This sequence, along with other potato genome sequence generated by the PGSC, will be annotated for genes and other features, and made available through a web-based portal for scientists to enable scientists to further their work on potato biology and production. Under-represented undergraduates will be trained through a project specific internship program. The general public will be educated in genomics through an educational exhibit in collaboration with the US Botanical Garden that demonstrates challenges in potato and agricultural production and how science, including genomics, can meet these challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to project outcomes&lt;br/&gt;Sequence data from this project will be made available to the public through Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html) and the project website (accessible through http://www.tigr.org/plantProjects.shtml) and annotation data will be made available through the project website.</AbstractNarration>
