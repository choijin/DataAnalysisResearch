<AbstractNarration>Collaboration and cooperation are essential to innovation and knowledge creation, and virtual teams are a valuable tool for such collaborations. Characteristic features of virtual teams, such as the dispersion and diversity of team members and the reliance on information and communication technology rather than direct interaction, are advantageous but also pose challenges. The purpose of this project is to examine what enables teams to best meet these challenges. We use the concept of trust as an organizing principle for understanding how technostructural and social-psychological factors affect the behavior in virtual teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting for this research is a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG). Since skills required in such games are similar to those required in work organizations, MMOGs are not only useful for the study of virtual teams but is in itself a valuable education and professional development tool. Travian Games, a designer of MMOGs, has provided unique access to conduct experiments, collect behavioral data, and administer surveys. The research team will pursue two empirical investigations: a series of experiments and a large-scale correlational study involving multi-level, longitudinal data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies should yield insight into the development and role of social bonds in virtual teams and the interplay between social dynamics and technostructural factors. Findings will inform literatures on leadership and group dynamics, the management of virtual organizations and information technology. Findings will also provide practical insights into how to design virtual teams and organizations to better enable collaboration and innovation. The methodology involving MMOGs is itself an innovative contribution to both science and practice, as it demonstrates a new platform for conducting social science research and provides insight into using virtual games for leadership and team development. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Working in teams is risky business. Teamwork requires delegating tasks to team members, but what if a team member lacks the capability to do the task? Moreover, conflicts between individual and team interests often occur. How can team members be confident that fellow team members will "do the right thing?"  Such questions are at the heart of trust in teams.  Research shows that when individuals trust each other, they work harder, more cooperatively, and are more willing to delegate.
