<AbstractNarration>The Workshop on Development of Higher-Order Cognitive Processes in Adolescence and Young Adulthood: Social, Behavioral, and Biological Influences on Learning will advance basic science in higher-order cognition and its development in adolescence and young adulthood by focusing leading scientists on key problems that are ripe for groundbreaking discoveries. The workshop will bring together separate but overlapping research communities.  These communities include those with basic research expertise in learning (e.g., cognition, development, neuroscience) with those who have expertise in more applied research, especially education.  Themes of the workshop will focus around the following areas: 1) Metrics of Meaning (devising valid measures of meaning, a construct that is at the heart of research on comprehension, reasoning, and information processing generally), 2) Reasoning and Judgment, and 3) Neuroscience of Reasoning, Representation, and Retrieval. Special attention will be given to acquisition of mathematical knowledge and skills, and their application in reasoning (e.g., scientific reasoning) and judgment (e.g., economic judgments). The workshop is also expected to facilitate development of new metrics and methods for studying higher-order cognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will enhance mutual understanding among research communities and stimulate fruitful collaborations. It will foster the translation of research on the basic science of higher-order cognition to solve pressing problems in education, economics, and workforce development, especially the development of mathematical knowledge and reasoning skills essential for competitiveness in the 21st century in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
