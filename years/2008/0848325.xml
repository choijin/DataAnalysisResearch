<AbstractNarration>Controlling Microscale Collagen Peptide Self Assembly with Metal Triggers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collagen is one of the major structural proteins of the extracellular matrix and is found associated with skin, bone, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels.  As such, there is great interest in using collagen for applications in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.  Natural collagen has limitations, however, for these applications due to difficulties in precisely controlling the protein's structure at the nano- and micro-scale and a limited ability to modify its chemical structure.  These difficulties could be overcome by using synthetic fragments of collagen (peptides) as building blocks for larger, functional biomaterials.  To this end, the Chmielewski group has designed collagen peptide building blocks that can be assembled using metal ion/ligand interactions to generate unique micron-scaled structures, such as fibers, spheres, meshes and disks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the mechanism used in the formation of the collagen peptide assemblies and to fully optimize the conditions needed to generate distinct collagen peptide microstructures on demand.  Specific questions that will be addressed include:  (1) What roles do the metal-ligand combination and the chemical structure of the collagen building block play in the assembly of nano- to micro-scaled structures?  (2) What is the mechanism of the formation of the collagen peptide microstructures?  (3) Can features of different building block design strategies be combined to create modular microstructures?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial designs of collagen peptide assembly using metal-ligand interactions have provided fascinating microstructures, some of unprecedented sizes and shape.  The intellectual merit of the proposed studies is focused on gaining a firm understanding of the parameters and mechanisms of the assembly process.  The metal-promoted assembly of collagen peptides into micro-scale materials is evocative and may have broad impact on many areas of science, including bio-nanotechnology, tissue engineering and drug delivery.  The results of the proposed scientific questions will, therefore, have a broad impact on society, as will the training of the students who participate in this interdisciplinary area of research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    One of the major structural building blocks in the human body is a protein known as collagen.  Collagen is an essential part of skin, bones, tendons and other structural support in the body.  Materials using collagen have shown great promise for applications such as wound healing and tissue regeneration.  Natural collagen usually forms fiber structures (Figure a), and these structures are important for collagen's biological roles.     In our research we have developed an approach to generate alternate collagen-based materials.  This research starts with small pieces of collagen that we are able to glue together, or assemble, at a molecular level in ways that are quite different than natural collagen.  This assembly process can produce collagen-filled spheres (Figure b), collagen disks (Figure c), hollow spheres (Figure d) and three-dimensional collagen meshes (Figure e) to name a few.  New collagen structures of these types may have enhanced biological properties over natural collagen.  For instance, these structures may have broad impact in areas such as drug delivery, cell and tissue delivery, wound healing and in vivo imaging.     This research brings together many scientific areas, including chemistry, biology and engineering.  As such, it has been an excellent training ground for undergraduate and graduate students.
