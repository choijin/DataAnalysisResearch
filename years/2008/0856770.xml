<AbstractNarration>This collaboration is building upon a successful biotechnology program and an experienced team at Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) by adding Utah Valley University (UVU) and numerous high schools in the region in order to enhance matriculation and success in biotechnology and other STEM disciplines.  Using a 2+2+2 pipeline approach, the collaboration is creating an integrated network of activities that encourages and supports students as they move from the junior year of high school through two- and four-year institutions.  This includes strengthening the secondary programs by providing high school teachers and students with research-based learning opportunities, increasing the number of biology and chemistry courses at SLCC, creating learning communities in gateway courses, expanding biotechnology courses and laboratories at UVU, establishing service learning and community outreach activities, and assisting with child care support for working parents at SLCC.  The strong support from secondary and post-secondary institutions, industry, and the state of Utah increases the broader impact of this project by establishing networks, providing support mechanisms, and building capacity among institutions in the entire northern and central region of Utah.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Utah faces many challenges in its public education system including large class sizes, very low per&shy;-pupil spending, and a continuing surge in enrollments.  These challenges are affecting schools at both the K&shy;-12 and higher education level.  However, Utah also ranks well in terms of high school graduation and literacy.  With a relatively young, growing population, there is an opportunity to enhance connections between high schools and colleges that will lead to greater participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  With connections to high schools, universities, and businesses, Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) and Utah Valley University (UVU) are gateways to higher education for a large number of students along Utah's Wasatch Front.  With a regional economy that is rapidly expanding and strong growth in businesses based on science and technology, this NSF-&shy;funded project was designed to strengthen pathways leading to degrees in STEM disciplines in Utah with a particular emphasis on life science degrees.  This work incorporated practices that have been shown to have strong effects on student motivations and persistence in STEM including project-based learning, strong professional development experiences, and early college opportunities for high school students.  More broadly, this work has accomplished the creation of networks of professionals that extend from high school through university studies, strong scientific experiences for students at the very beginning of their journey toward a college education, and sustained efforts in curriculum reform.  The project used the following approaches to accomplish its goals:  The creation of research based learning opportunities in high schools   To accomplish this goal, SLCC and UVU worked with partners at the Great Salt Lake Institute and science educators from area high schools to create a microbial sequencing project.  High school teachers that took part in this project came from different counties and districts that spanned a wide geographical area.  Over the course of the project, teachers came together at Salt Lake Community College to learn the science behind genomics and how that knowledge is applied in real world settings.  Teachers then had the opportunity to work with their students to conduct actual genomic work with a salt-tolerant microorganism that lives in the Great Salt Lake.  Over the course of our project, hundreds of high school students took part in the microbial sequencing effort.     Creating seamless transfer opportunities between SLCC and UVU   SLCC and UVU collaborated closely in all aspects of this project.  The result is a remarkable partnership that benefits STEM students.  Over the course of this project, these two institutions developed a seamless articulation agreement, cooperative agreements on financial aid, shared curriculum, and a process in which students starting at community college can complete their bachelors degree while still on the SLCC campus.  In addition, the cooperation between the colleges and high schools was expanded so that more students are able to start on a degree pathway while still in high school.  This allows them to start early and finish their degree sooner than would otherwise be possible.     Improving math courses required for STEM majors   Math curriculum was revised to include projects that are carried out as a joint exercise between a science faculty member and a math faculty member.  Science faculty members worked directly with math students to conduct science projects as part of the math class.  Students then used their math skills to analyze the outcomes to their experiments.  In this way, barriers between disciplines were broken down, student engagement improved, and connections across disciplines were established.  This effort has created a new focus on workshop-based learning strategies at SLCC.          Last Modified: 11/30/2015       Submitted by: Craig Ca...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
