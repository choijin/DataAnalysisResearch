<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education at the interface between quantum many-body physics and quantum information science. A major thrust of the research is to advance the understanding of the relationship between correlations in quantum many-body systems, emergence, and entanglement.  Concepts in quantum information theory will be used to investigate how condensed matter systems are entangled.  The PI aims to develop measures of entanglement in Kondo impurity and spin systems, as well as systems of itinerant fermions and bosons.  The PI will also investigate the connections among entanglement, topological order, and fractional quasiparticles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the research is to provide both qualitative and quantitative measures of entanglement in many-body quantum systems and to discuss its feasible control in cold atomic systems and in nanostructures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports training students in advanced theoretical methods and involving undergraduates in research at the frontiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education that will elucidate connections among two rapidly evolving areas: one concerned with how to use quantum mechanical states for computation, and the other concerned with understanding quantum mechanical systems with many interacting particles, like the electrons that conduct electricity in a metal. Quantum mechanical systems of interacting electrons can exhibit emergent phenomena, including new states of matter. Notable among these are magnetism and superconductivity in which a material is able to conduct electricity without losses. The research enables a cross-fertilization of ideas that are developed in two contexts, quantum computation and condensed matter theory, and may lead to advances in both areas. This research is fundamental and contributes to the intellectual foundations of new technologies for electronic devices, information technology, and communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports training students in advanced theoretical methods and involving undergraduates in research at the frontiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Among the many topics covered in this research, the most intriguing is that of entanglement and entanglement entropy. Entanglement refers to a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon in which different parts of a system, possibly widely separated, are correlated by what is called "spooky action at a distance".   For example if two elementary particles are emitted from a common source in an entangled state, a measurement of the roperties of one, affect the outcomes of measurements on the other. Like it or not (Einstein did not) this feature is real and is here to stay, although it is very fragile and can be destroyed upon  any contact with the external world.      This research focuses on entanglement in many-body systems like a solid where not two but 1023 particles are in an entangled state. Great progress has been made recently in uderstanding how to compute this entanglement. One common way is to divide the system into two parts, and focus on just one. While the system as a whole may be in a definite quantum state (and with zero entropy) the subsystem can be doing many things as the the other half is allowed to vary  at will subject only to some overal restrictions like conservation of particle number. The logarithm of the number of possiblities is called the entanglement entropy. The paper by Son et al (2012) gives a very  physical way to understand this entropy in terms of the fluctuating number of particles in the chosen half.
