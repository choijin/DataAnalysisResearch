<AbstractNarration>The initial year of this project is focused on developing a recruitment plan to target prospective students and working with feeder schools to identify and recruit students who would be successful STEM graduates. Because the University accepts students only after they have successfully completed their first two years of college, generally at a community college, the track record for a successful STEM career is well established. The project supports three cohort groups. Each cohort group is comprised of ten students, actively recruited under this funding. Students who demonstrate academic success, an interest in the STEM disciplines, and have financial need receive up to $7500 per academic year, based on need. The University ensures that these students receive academic support by staff as well as community support through working as interns with local military and civilian organizations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
