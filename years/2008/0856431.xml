<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to provide accurate estimates of the probability of achieving a target level of improvement in the next surrogate based design optimization cycle, hence increasing the cost-effectiveness of the overall design process. A major challenge in the design optimization of complex engineering systems such as those found in the  automotive (e.g., crashwordiness), aerospace (e.g., liquid rocket injector), oil (e.g., chemical flooding) and biomechanical (e.g., knee implants) industries is how to meet the conflicting objectives of improved performance, reduced costs and enhanced safety considering the time constraints present in industrial environments. Surrogate-based design optimization (SBDO), which proceeds in stages or cycles, has shown to be an effective approach to address this challenge. It refers to design optimization that relies on the use of surrogates or metamodels (computationally inexpensive) built/updated on reduced samples of computationally expensive/high fidelity simulations collected at each of the cycles.  Each cycle is costly,  and in spite of the progress, the current state-of-knowledge regarding SBDO lacks statistics-based stopping criteria for assessing the merit of investing in another cycle of optimization versus accepting the present best solution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will address the shortcomings of present industrial practice through the use of alternative surrogate model estimation and appraisal information to provide a rigorous stopping criterion for SBDO. The research will be validated addressing one of the most significant problems in biomechanical engineering: the design of artificial knees for minimizing wear and hence avoiding the need for a second replacement. Wear analysis of artificial knees is computationally very costly and the limit on number of simulations makes it an ideal application of SBDO. The results are expected to be disseminated through computational tools which will be freely available via the internet, and conference presentations, journal publications and engineering design optimization courses. The research will benefit from an ongoing collaboration with Brazilian, Venezuelan, and French researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The optimization of complex engineering system is usually based on computer simulations.  Often the results of these simulations are fitted with algebraic expressions, called surrogates, that estimate the performance of the system for intermediate designs. The design optimization then proceeds in cycles of simulations leading to improved surrogate accuracy followed by the identification of promising designs for the next step of simulations.  Because simulations are often expensive and time consuming,  a major challenge is to know when to stop the process because progress is too meager to justify the time and cost. The objective of the project was to develop criteria that would allow the designer to reliably stop.  Initially, the research focused on calculating the probability of a desired improvement occurring in the next cycle of simulations. We followed an approach based on models of uncertainty in the prediction of the surrogates. The research established that the probability calculations are statistically meaningful, but that they are not accurate enough to provide a reliable answer as to when to stop.   We next explored whether the history of progress in the optimization can be used to estimate how much progress should be expected in the next cycle. Again, we found that such estimates are useful, but they are not accurate enough to allow by themselves a decision on when to stop.     Finally, we have developed a criterion that combines the estimate of the improvement in the next cycle with the probability estimate that this improvement will be achieved. For a series of test problems we found that a stopping criterion combining the two ingredients is correct about 70% of the time. That is, when it counsels the designer to continue, there is about 70% chance that the next cycle would provide at least the improvement deemed sufficient  for justifying the expense of another cycle. Similarly, when it counsels stopping, there is about 70% chance that if continued the next cycle will not provide sufficient improvement.
