<AbstractNarration>Large macromolecular assemblies involving multiple proteins and genomic DNA are important themes in biological mechanism and regulation in all organisms.  An integral aspect of many systems involved in genetic recombination, gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA repair is that proteins bound at different locations along a single DNA molecule interact through looping and wrapping of the bound DNA.  Understanding the detailed structure and interactions of these large assemblies poses a major challenge to structural biologists because the intact protein-DNA complexes are too large for high-resolution techniques such as x-ray crystallography or NMR.  Other techniques such as single-molecule experiments require at least a low-resolution model of the complex for their interpretation.  Tangle analysis, a branch of mathematical knot theory, in conjunction with difference-topology experiments has become a powerful emerging approach for the analysis of looped nucleoprotein assemblies both in vitro and in vivo.  At present, tangle analysis provides only two-dimensional information in the form of solutions to topological equations; moreover, the solutions to many problems of interest are often not unique.  Knowledge of the relative energies of tangle solutions is essential in order to evaluate the physical and biological plausibility of a particular structural model.  Tangle analysis will be fused with semi-analytical and numerical calculations of DNA-loop free energies to develop a theoretical description of the structure of complex nucleoprotein assemblies. These new methods will be implemented in the computer program KnotPlot, a powerful and extensible multi-platform tool for visualizing and manipulating physical knots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insights into the structures of looped protein-DNA assemblies are crucial for developing new molecular strategies for treating cancer, understanding the immune system, and ameliorating the biological effects of aging. These insights can be gained from knowledge of the geometry and energetics of DNA bound by multiple protein molecules and are critical for understanding underlying principles of biological mechanism and regulation.  The importance of DNA looping in living cells is underscored by an abundance of accessory proteins that facilitate looping by effectively altering the mechanical properties of DNA.  The team will apply a mathematical and computational approach along with novel biophysical techniques to elucidate the relationship between biological structure and mechanism in Mu transposition, a model system for retroviral integrases such as that of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  Because these methods can be applied both in living cells as well as in solution, it is possible to investigate the role of the intracellular or intranuclear environment and intrinsic levels of DNA-bending accessory proteins, in regulating loop-mediated protein-DNA interactions.  These insights will advance our understanding of biological regulatory networks and pathways, which will have direct benefit to multiple areas of molecular medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Synopsis Under specified conditions, free energy is a thermodynamic quantity given by the difference between mechanical energy and the product of absolute temperature and entropy, Changes in free energy govern the direction of all processes in nature including chemical and biophysical processes in living systems. A quantitative treatment of how free energy depends on molecular geometry and interactions, the so-called free-energy landscape, is central to understanding protein and RNA folding, motion and energy transduction in molecular machines, macromolecule-small molecule interactions, genome organization, and many other biological phenomena. For biological systems, accurately calculating a systemÆs conformational free energy (free energy as a function of molecular geometry) is one of the most challenging problems in computational biology and chemistry. Despite the importance of DNA-protein structures in living systems, these structures have generally eluded standard methods for computing conformational free energies because the inherent flexibility of molecules on these length scales results in large structural fluctuations in rugged potential energy landscapes. In this collaborative project we have developed novel methods both for accurately calculating conformational free energies of semi-flexible models of nucleoprotein assemblies and for experimentally measuring the free-energy changes associated with the formation of DNA loops.  DNA loops are structures that form through the simultaneous binding of a protein complex to two or more widely separated DNA sequences along a genome.  These nucleoprotein structures are an especially important geometric feature common to all genomes and are essential for the regulation of transcription and other processes.  The essence of our computational approach is to treat a mathematical model of a looped nucleoprotein complex on two length scales: a base-pair-level description on the sub-nanometer scale for DNA segments that make direct contact with proteins mediating the loops via protein-DNA interactions, and a coarse-grained description that uses base-pair-averaged properties applied to much longer chain segments (tens to hundreds of nanometers) that connect the ends of DNA segments buried within the protein-DNA complex.  Free-energy calculations for the two length scales must be handled in mathematically different ways: the protein-bound segments are treated as undergoing small fluctuations about a minimum-energy state, whereas the larger connecting loops are subjected to a gradual virtual heating process from a frozen ground state corresponding to the mechanical-energy minimum.  Summing the free energies for the protein-bound and looped components of the entire protein-DNA complex thus obtained gives the total free energy of the system.  This new method can be applied to free-energy calculations for other types of semi-flexible macromolecu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
