<AbstractNarration>Abstract, GK-12 0841361 (U. of New England, Zeeman)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description. A Systemic PARTnership Aimed at Connecting University and School (SPARTACUS) project forms linkages among university researchers and their graduate students with the K-12 community. Focusing on the hydrologic cycle in a coastal watershed it conveys the importance of interdisciplinary efforts in scientific and social issues, to K-12 students and teachers through the work of Graduate Fellows and their advisors. Interrelationships of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and geology are examined in a local watershed using the Saco River Coastal Observing System (SaRCOS). It investigates how precipitation drives river discharge, which in turn, governs the coastal current, which influences coastal weather. While scientifically important, these phenomena are also tangible to students at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The project engages K-12 students and teachers in authentic inquiry-based learning in STEM-related disciplines. This unique project brings together school districts? needs, scientific research, and place-based inquiry education. Graduate Fellows gain an understanding of the educational process, develop communication skills and team building, and appreciate the importance of K-12 outreach as a professional commitment. Place-based inquiry projects are used to engage students in active learning. Schools benefit from professional development of teachers, and enrichment of the learning environment, while society gains greater scientific and technical literacy. The schools encompass rural to urban settings, including the two largest and most ethnically diverse districts in Maine. Replication of the model is highly viable since it is grounded in local environs and research, effectively connecting the community, school and university.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Impact to the University  Each graduate student in the University of New England masterÆs program must present their findings to a professional organization and prepare a manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Over the six years of the project, the Fellows and Principal Investigators produced nearly 100 papers and presentations on the FellowsÆ research. These theses and publications are available through the UNE library. Once data are published, theses are released in digital form for easy distribution to others in the field. Links to the students, their abstracts and/or theses are all posted on the UniversityÆs web site.  Dialogue has also increased across the UNE campus on the value of outreach to the K-12 education community. Conversations at all levels of the administration have encouraged professors and their graduate students to follow the roles modeled in the SPARTACUS project, sharing their research and expertise with teachers and students in the region.  Broader Impact  The strongest impact of this program to society will be felt in the Saco River watershed, the fifth largest river in Maine and largest in Southern Maine. The research conducted by Fellows increased understanding of the watershed and its estuary and provided needed information that will be available for community decision-makers. Some of the important outcomes from research conducted through SPARTACUS will help improve management of the ecosystem.  Numerous studies conducted by the Fellows also will affect those dependent upon Gulf of Maine fisheries both economically and as consumers. These studies ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
