<AbstractNarration>In order to cope with time-varying input characteristics and demand for upgradability in new-generation communication systems and multimedia applications, embedded systems are being driven to provide tremendous flexibility through extensive configurations.  Hence, along with performance, power, and reliability requirements, embedded systems now require hardware reconfiguration and self-adaptive system methodologies. In order to provide an effective, affordable, and seamless (from the application layer) transition from one configuration to another, system synthesis plays a crucial role.  To achieve this, there is a need for the right balance between static compilation and dynamic configuration management. This project develops adaptivity-driven system synthesis tools coupled with a dynamic configuration management layer for adaptive embedded system with hardware configuration support. The research focuses on design of novel algorithms and optimization methods for design tools supporting self-adaptive systems. This project 1) develops holistic task scheduling and resource management methods which are adaptive-aware and consider the reconfiguration overhead, 2)develops system level layout planning for resource upgradability and configuration sequence awareness, and 3)develops efficient dynamic design making methods for configuration management layer which evokes the right configuration based on the current system state. The broader impact of this research is that the developed design tools can be deployed in future self-adaptive systems for software-defined radio and multimedia applications where programmability and flexibility are as crucial as computation power. The PI plans to develop new courses, recruit under-represented groups into her research, and facilitate outreach to other researchers and industry by providing online access to the developed design tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    In the era of big data and IoT platforms, embedded systems are at the cornerstone of the Internet of Things (IoTs) and cyber physical ecosystems (CPS). On-device  computing brings a more reliable and efficient data processing by reducing loads of wireless communication between devices and servers or clouds. However, embedded processing are challenged by limited storage, energy, and/or computing resources. This is more challenging in the era of big data and IoTs, where high-demand applications such as data analytics, data-driven real-time decision making, event monitoring, etc. require highly compute-intensive processing. Embedded general-purpose processors (CPUs) such as ARM processors cannot deliver energy efficient, and yet, high performance execution of such resource-intensive kernels.  Hardware acceleration is the use of hardware such as GPUs and FPGAs to perform such functions more efficiently than the software running on a CPU.  Hardware acceleration is deployed to offload such compute-intensive tasks from CPU to specialized hardware; hence, improving the overall performance and energy efficiency of such applications. Instead of GPUs that provide software level acceleration, we focus on FPGAs as hardware accelerators that offer reconfigurable custom hardware with millions of underlying parallel system logic cells. This will place FPGAs before GPUs by delivering a more energy efficient accelerated computing platforms. However, runtime reconfiguration of FPGAs and resource management at custom hardware level bring more challenges in context switching at the system level, which we addressed in this project.  Embedded system design deployed in IoT and CPS applications, requires a hardware-software co-design framework in order to decide which set of tasks run on CPUs and which compute-intensive tasks run on accelerators. System-level design tools play a crucial role to provide energy-efficient and high-performance implementation of applications in embedded systems under stringent resource constraints. This project focuses on hardware-software co-design of embedded systems with reconfigurable hardware accelerators.  Tight integration of embedded systems with physical worlds and things in IoTs with dynamic and unexpected changes in environmental conditions and application requirements, mandates a vast variety of tasks with different application quality (or accuracy) to be processed on embedded systems. For example, energy availability in battery-operated or intermittently-powered embedded systems (e.g., solar-powered devices) come with uncertainty during operation. Performance of embedded systems under long intensive processing or extreme environmental conditions are degraded over time which mandates dynamic changes in the system to achieve a sustainable operation. Due to resource constraints, planning to integrate all possible tasks on embedded devices is not possible. Hence, the system has to be able to adapt to such unexpected variation by dynamically adapting the characteristics of its underlying resources. Examples are runtime reconfiguration of tasks running on hardware accelerators, and runtime reconfiguration of operating frequency of CPUs to dynamically manage energy consumption according to computational demands and resource availability.    The theme of this project is system-level planning for runtime adaptation and reconfiguration during hardware-software co-design of embedded systems to achieve reliable and sustainable operation. For example, given a sequence of tasks in a ready-queue for hardware acceleration on FPGAs, the proposed design tools provide a task ordering and resource allocation such that all tasks are processed while meeting timing deadlines and application quality/accuracy requirements.
