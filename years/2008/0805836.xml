<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0805836&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Olga Plamenevskaya&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on contact topology in dimension 3 and the&lt;br/&gt;related version of knot theory, the study of Legendrian and&lt;br/&gt;transverse knots. Contact structures on 3-manifolds encode subtle&lt;br/&gt;topological information, and knots in contact manifolds (tangent&lt;br/&gt;or transverse to the contact planes) have many additional&lt;br/&gt;properties. The goal of this project is to better understand the&lt;br/&gt;relation between and find new applications of various invariants&lt;br/&gt;of contact structures and Legendrian and transverse knots. More&lt;br/&gt;specifically, the PI will study various versions of the contact,&lt;br/&gt;Legendrian and transverse invariants in Heegaard Floer homology;&lt;br/&gt;she proposes to investigate knots via associated contact&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, such as those obtained by surgery on Legendrian knots&lt;br/&gt;and branched covers of transverse knots. A related part of the&lt;br/&gt;project is to develop similar invariants in knot homologies&lt;br/&gt;arising from quantum algebra (Khovanov and Khovanov-Rozansky&lt;br/&gt;homology).  An intriguing relation between Heegaard Floer theory&lt;br/&gt;(defined via holomorphic disks) and the quantum algebraic knot&lt;br/&gt;homologies exists outside of contact geometry; the PI proposes to&lt;br/&gt;study this relation in presence of a contact structure. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, in her previous work the PI suggested a transverse&lt;br/&gt;knot invariant in Khovanov homology.  The interplay between&lt;br/&gt;Heegaard Floer and Khovanov homologies allows to use this&lt;br/&gt;invariant to prove tightness of certain contact structures on&lt;br/&gt;branched double covers of knots. Further progress on this project&lt;br/&gt;could yield quantum algebraic tools for studying contact&lt;br/&gt;structures in a more general setting, and would improve our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the relation between theories of a very&lt;br/&gt;different nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is on geometric topology, an area of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics that studies shapes of curved spaces (manifolds) in&lt;br/&gt;various dimensions.  In dimensions 3 and 4, this can be thought&lt;br/&gt;of as understanding the structure of space and space-time, and is&lt;br/&gt;particularly interesting and important. The study of knots in&lt;br/&gt;dimension 3 plays a major role in topology and has important&lt;br/&gt;connection to other sciences (for example, DNA and certain&lt;br/&gt;proteins can be knotted). The proposed project focuses on study&lt;br/&gt;of 3-manifolds and knots in presence of a contact structure, an&lt;br/&gt;object somewhat analogous to an electric field in physics.&lt;br/&gt;(Historically, the study of contact structures was first&lt;br/&gt;motivated by classical mechanics, optics and thermodynamics.)&lt;br/&gt;Contact structures are important objects by themselves, but also&lt;br/&gt;encode valuable information about the space they live in. In her&lt;br/&gt;research, the PI plans to use tools and ideas from different&lt;br/&gt;branches of mathematics such as geometry and quantum algebra. The&lt;br/&gt;broader goals of the project thus include a better understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the relation between these different branches, as well as new&lt;br/&gt;results in and applications of the topology of contact manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
