<AbstractNarration>This award supports research in numerical simulations of binary compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) accurate and efficient enough to be used for parameter estimation of sources of gravitational wave signals to be measured by detectors such as LIGO.These simulations will also be used to calibrate and drive the construction of faithful semi-analytical gravitational wave templates for parameter estimation in (e.g.) LIGO data analysis. The main numerical techniques to be used for both black hole and neutron star simulations will be&lt;br/&gt;high order and pseudo-spectral multi-domain methods. Special effort will be spent on methods for extending binary simulations of orbiting compact objects using these techniques all the way to the merger and ring-down regimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address current obstacles in the ability to study with very high accuracy the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing binary compact objects, by combining the application and development of novel analytical and numerical techniques. The final goal is to develop both numerical and semi-analytical models that can be used to infer the sources of gravitational waves from their detected signals. The results of this project will have a broad impact on areas of computational relativity, modeling and detection of gravitational waves, and will likely drive the development of some new numerical techniques, which should be useful in rather general fields of computational physics involving time-dependent problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported theoretical and numerical research in black holes studies aimed at improving our understanding of the gravitational waves that they emit according to EInstein's General Relativity theory of gravitation.   Such gravitational waves are expected to be measured directly for the first time in a few years by earth-based interferometer detectors, such as LIGO, funded by the NSF.   In this project, advanced numerical techniques to improve the accuracy of numerical simulations of black holes were developed. Many of these techniques are broadly applicable, however, to many fields of science and engineering. That is, beyond gravitational wave physics, which has been the driver for this particular project.   One of the components of this project included supercomputer simulations of colliding black holes. Students, both at the undergraduate and graduate level, were trained as part of the project, both in theoretical physics, scientific computing and mathematical modeling.  Part of the theoretical work included developing a framework for studying what happens once two black holes have collided, for example, forming a single black hole which settles down to a stationary final state emitting gravitational waves. One question that was addressed is what is the fine structure of the spectrum of the waves emitted in this process.
