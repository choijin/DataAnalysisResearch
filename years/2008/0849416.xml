<AbstractNarration>This award supports the continuation of the summer undergraduate research (REU)&lt;br/&gt;program in the Department of Physics at Lehigh University. Each summer program lasts ten weeks, with most students beginning around June 1.   The student is expected to become involved in all aspects of a particular research project of suitable challenge and duration. The program involves research, weekly faculty seminars and lab tours, a student symposium at the end of the summer, and various social functions that foster the interaction of undergraduate students with faculty and graduate students.   The topics of research available to undergraduates include Astrophysics, atomic and molecular physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, optics, nanotechnology, plasma physics, and statistical physics.   The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Department of Physics at Lehigh University has hosted a summer "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" (REU) program for the last 26 years.  The NSF REU site grant (PHY-0849416) supported this program from 2009&ndash;2014.  During that time period, 155 students out of 3,459 applicants were selected to participate in the program.  Most of the participating students would not otherwise have had the opportunity to engage in "real" research as undergraduates.  The participants, who represented 88 colleges and universities from all regions of the country, included 81 men and 74 women with an average GPA of 3.66.  Twenty-six participants are members of minority groups that are currently underrepresented in Physics.   The Department of Physics at Lehigh University has a strong, internationally recognized research program that is fully integrated with a strong commitment to undergraduate education.  Each year, the REU summer program involves research, weekly seminars presented by faculty members, lab tours, a student symposium at the end of the summer, and various social functions that foster the interaction of undergraduate students with faculty and graduate students.  A group housing arrangement, subsidized heavily by the university, greatly enhances both the academic and social experiences of the participants.   Program participants gain research experience at a critical point in their undergraduate careers, as well as an excellent preview of graduate school.  The students make significant contributions to a wide range of research projects during their summer work, and the program has had an important impact in enabling promising students to pursue careers in science and other technical disciplines.  While the 2014 participants are still undergraduates as of this writing, over the 25 year period 1989&ndash;2013, approximately two-thirds (66.1%) of the participants in LehighÆs program have gone on to graduate studies in science and engineering, and most of the remaining students obtained jobs in fields of science and technology.  The program also works to increase diversity in the field by providing a significant number of research opportunities to members of groups that are currently underrepresented in physics.
