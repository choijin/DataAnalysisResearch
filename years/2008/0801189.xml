<AbstractNarration>Geschke plans to study applications of filtrations of Boolean algebras, Banach spaces and C-star-algebras to problems in measure theory, functional analysis, set-theoretic topology and topological dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Filtrations can often be used to construct automorphisms of or homomorphisms from the structures under consideration.&lt;br/&gt;In other cases, interesting properties of a structure can be characterized in terms of the existence of a filtration of a specific type. &lt;br/&gt;The following topics will be considered:  Cofinalities of Boolean algebras, C-star-algebras and Banach spaces, automorphisms of the Calkin algebra and other C-star- and Boolean algebras,  Borel liftings for measure and category with a large size of the continuum, the structure of phase spaces of minimal dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many natural questions about properties of certain infinite structures cannot be decided using the usual axioms of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;This is where logic and set theory have to be used to analyze the situation.&lt;br/&gt;Boolean algebras are sufficiently nice, so that set-theoretic methods can be applied very directly in order to answer questions about them.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding this interaction between Boolean algebras and set theory helps in getting the right intuition about applications of set theory to questions about more complicated structures. &lt;br/&gt;Large structures can often be analyzed by breaking them into smaller pieces that fit together nicely.&lt;br/&gt;This approach has been particularly successful with Boolean algebras.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore it should be applied systematically to study other infinite structures as well.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
