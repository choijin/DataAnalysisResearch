<AbstractNarration>The work to be carried out under this award will develop the needed infrastructure and apply it to study realistic compact binary systems that can give rise to gamma ray burst phenomena. To this end the required physics modules will be incorporated in a new infrastructure framework able to exploit the new generation of high performance computers. The implementations of this infrastructure will allow study of  the system in depth, with the goal of predicting and interpreting aspects of observations of electromagnetic and gravitationalÂ waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work serves to advance computational and numerical techniques  for an exciting scientific problem, as well as the creation and dissemination of advanced tools for distributed computing. The research to be carried out has as its goal to give an unprecedented description of possible (short) gamma ray burst systems and to develop a new computational model to efficiently utilize petascale computing. Finally, this study involves the training of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most stars exist in binary systems, that is, they have a companion star to which they are gravitationally bound and about which they orbit.  We have developed and used numerical (computational science) techniques to simulate how stars in binary systems interact with one another when they are in tight orbits -- orbits in which the separation between the stars initially is not much larger than the sum of the diameters of the two stars.  Astrophysically, our focus has been on binary systems containing compact stars -- white dwarfs, neutron stars, and/or black holes.  The simulation tools that we have developed have allowed us to study exotic physical phenomena that arise through the tidal interactions and violent mergers of such compact systems.    In simulations of tightly bound double white dwarfs, tidal stresses strip material from one star, that material falls as a well-defined mass-transferring stream toward the companion star, and crashes supersonically onto the surface of the companion.  The resulting supersonic shock front heats the accreting material, but our simulations show that the photon radiation that is emitted from this heated material does not reverse the flow as had previously been supposed.    Simulations of merging binary neutron stars show that the magnetic fields that initially exist in the two stars can be significantly amplified during the merger.  However, the strength of the magnetic field does not grow to a level that significantly affects the gravitationally driven dynamical flows associated with the merger.  We have also carried out numerical simulations of binaries that intially contain a neutron star and a black hole.  Such mergers result in the emission of strong gravitational wave signals whose characteristics (for example, amplitude and frequency spectrum) are not significantly modified if the neutron star initially contains a magnetic field.  We have simulated the coalescence of binary black holes in the situation where a magnetic field threads through a gaseous disk that initially surrounds both black holes (that is, a circumbinary disk).  During the merger, our simulations show the natural formation of a pair of relativistic "jets" that are aligned with the original orbital axis of the binary. This may explain why energetic jets are often observed eminating from the centers of galaxies.  The astrophysical insights summarized above have been made possible through our development of numerical algorithms that accurately simulate the (general as well as special) relativistic dynamical flow of gaseous material that may or may not be coupled to strong magnetic fields in the presence of strong gravitational fields -- for example, in the vicinity of black hole singularities.  Other algorithms have enabled an analysis of dynamical flows that are coupled to photon radiation in weaker gravitational fields.  These algorithm development efforts have led to more accurate simulation techniques and have illustrated that a new computational execution model -- high performance parallex (HPX) -- offers an avenue by which complex numerical algorithms can be built to execute very efficiently on high-performance computers that have many thousands of computational cores.
