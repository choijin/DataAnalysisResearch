<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the systematics of South American water beetles (Hydradephaga), including diving beetles, burrowing water beetles, and whirligig beetles.  Diving beetles are remarkable for their size and intricate color patterns. They also exhibit interesting differences between males and females; males have adhesive disks on their bodies that let them stick to the females during mating, whereas females have grooves that allow them to resist mating.  This project will determine how many species there are in this group of beetles, and how they are related to each other.  The project will test whether changes in male adhesive disks are mirrored by corresponding changes in the grooves on the females. DNA sequences will also be used to determine which larvae will grow in to which adults.  One product of this work will be an interactive, fully illustrated, on-line identification key for the water beetles of the Neotropics.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will provide training in monographic and revisionary systematics for one Ph.D. student, two master's students, and four undergraduates, the latter for at least two years each.  Summer workshops will be provided for local-area high-school teachers so they may take knowledge of systematics back to their classrooms.  The public school system in Albuquerque and the University of New Mexico are significant minority-serving institutions with Hispanics and Native Americans as major constituents.  In addition, two university courses will be developed, one of which will be offered during the summer term, so that students can be taken to South America to collect insects relevant to the revisionary part of the proposed research.  These collections will be processed by the students and deposited at the Museum of Southwestern Biology at UNM.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biological systematics is the scientific discipline of documenting the diversity of life on the planet.  No group of life is more dominant in diversity than insects, with nearly a million known species and many millions more unknown.  Among these, beetles (the order Coleoptera) are the most diverse with nearly 1 out of every 4 living species a type of beetle. Water beetles in the family Dytiscidae ("diving beetles") are an especially diverse group with about 4500 known species, with many of these in South America.  This grant focused on projects and training related to this group of beetles in South America.  Approximately 75 new species of diving beetles were discovered and relationships among some groups were investigated using DNA sequenced data.  Entire genera were "revised," or treated in their entirety with illustrations, tools for identifications, and summaries of all their known biology.  Over 40 publications were supported in total or in part by this grant, with one, a book called The Diving Beetles of the World, published this year and covering all the genera of Dytiscidae throughout the world.  The book would not have been possible without this grant.  A major focus of these projects was student training, and this grant contributed to the training of nine graduate students and over 20 undergrads in biological systematics.  Students participated in field campaigns to collect specimens,  either in research expeditions or one of three formal field classes developed through the University of New Mexico to Peru, Nicaragua or Costa Rica. Students also assisted in preparation of specimens for inclusion in the Museum of Southwestern Biology.  Grad students developed systematics research projects of their own, and, in many cases, undergrads helped with other projects or, in many cases, led their own systematics projects resulting in, often, first authored, peer reviewed papers.  Students also presented at major meetings, especially the Entomological Society of America national meeting.  Several of these undergrads are now in their own graduate programs throughout the country.  Broader impacts beyond the training of students and production of significant research poducts include development of research results that will aid those studying water-related problems in South America from freshwater aquatic ecologists to investigators of water quality and water use management.  Many thousands of specimens were collected and are now housed in the Museum of Southwestern Biology where they represent a publicly accessible library of biological diversity resource for researchers into perpetuity.
