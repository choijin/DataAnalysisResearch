<AbstractNarration>The Internet will shape the history of the 21st century.  Governments around the world realize this, which is why, out of 40 countries studied by the Open Net Initiative, Internet censorship increased from 3 of 40 in 2002 to 26 of 40 in 2007.  The U.S. must set effective policy regarding this, but the inherently computational issues lead to a great deal of uncertainty.   We are studying the dynamics of modern Internet censorship implementations to understand how their low-level mechanisms (for example, at the level of individual Internet packets) affects the application-level behavior of censorship that web users actually experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Internet censorship implementations are inherently computational, thus whether or not content is available to a user can depend on key issues such as routing and protocol dynamics.  Current characterizations of censorship are incomplete, not founded on quantitative measurements, and cite experiments that cannot be reproduced.  We are addressing this by laying a solid computational foundation for Internet censorship research.  Central to this effort is Internet measurement of existing censorship implementations to understand and compare their dynamics at the packet- and application-level.  This will impact both policy development and the future design of computer networks to address Internet censorship, a critical issue that directly harms U.S. interests by hindering the ability of human rights organizations and U.S. government agencies to disseminate information.  Understanding the connections between Internet censorship and computational issues will also enable the integration of this research throughout the computer science curriculum at UNM and other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Internet censorship and surveillance threaten many activities that are considered important parts of democratic society, such as the ability of journalists to protect their sources, the ability of activists to plan peaceful assemblies, or the ability of human rights advocates to reach at-risk populations.  There are many research efforts to better understand censorship and surveillance online and build tools to help users to use the Internet effectively and safely.  But existing research efforts are hampered by some very fundamental limitations that this grant has made significant progress toward ameliorating, specifically:  It is difficult to obtain censorship measurements from every part of the Internet, since typically you need to be in a country to measure what is censored in that country; It is difficult to obtain complete lists of what keywords are censored in a country, since you are limited in the number of attempts you can make to see if something is censored or not; and, It is difficult to measure surveillance, since it typically has no effect on a user's Internet experience.   To address challenge #1, this project pioneered TCP/IP side channels as a way to measure Internet censorship.  TCP/IP side channels are a way to measure something about the Internet between A and B, where A and B can be any two machines anywhere on the Internet, without special access to A or B or any of the Internet routers between A and B.  For example, we can tell if a web server in Norway is blocked in China by sending messages to the server in Norway that appear to be from a client in China, and then monitoring the client in China to see if it is receiving unsolicited replies from the machine in Norway (we can determine this based on the client in China's shared state for communicating with other hosts on the Internet).  Using this set of techniques, we are able to measure censorship in the IP or TCP layers between any two parts of the world, any time, from right here in New Mexico.  We are now collaborating with researchers from the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, U.C. Berkeley/ICSI, Stony Brook Univ, and Princeton to carry out global-scale longitudinal measurements of Internet censorship.   To address challenges #2 and #3, we have reverse engineered many Chinese chat programs to determine which ones perform keyword-based censorship and surveillance in the client software itself.  Such programs typically download an encrypted and up-to-date censorship and/or surveillance keyword list every time the program starts and then decrypt it in memory.  By obtaining the URLs and decryption keys we can monitor the lists.  This gives us complete censorship and surveillance lists, and their daily updates.   PI Crandall has graduated four Ph.D. students as part of this project: Roya Ensafi (2014, now a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton), Peiyou Song (2013, now at Google), Bilal Shebaro (now a tenure-track faculty member at St.  Edward's University), and Mohammed Al-Saleh (now a tenure-track faculty member at the Jordan University of Science and Technology).  The PI has five more Ph.D. students in progress, and the project also included many undergraduate researchers, most of whom are now in graduate school at UNM or other places.  These students received training in many aspects of cybersecurity, especially reverse engineering and Internet measurement.  Many of the students involved in this project represent groups that are traditionally underrepresented in computer science.   Outreach was also a major goal of the project.  PI Crandall, in collaboration with UNM's Anderson School of Management, has built up a summer high school outreach program from eight students in 2013 to an NSF-GenCyber-funded effort of about 30 students from all over the state of New Mexico this summer.  Crandall and his students gave numerous demos to students at recruitment events or programs such as the NSF-funded New Mexico Cafe Scientifique, and also taught a ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
