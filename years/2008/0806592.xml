<AbstractNarration>This is a joint project between Virginia Tech and Lehigh University (US team members) and international partners consisting of the University of Warwick (UK), the University of Oxford (UK), Novgorod State University (Russia), and the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics (China). The research addresses the mechanisms controlling the piezoelectric response in lead free systems by systematically studying the local domain and crystal structure and their effect on properties. (Na1/2Bi1/2)TiO3?BaTiO3 (NBT-BT) single crystals of compositions close to morphotrophic phase boundary (MPB) are used as the representative lead free system.  The nanoscale domain structure and its ferroelectric response are studied as a function of electric field, pressure and temperature to identify the phase transformational sequences in the MPB region and to determine the presence of intermediate bridging phases. Another challenging issue confronted in this research is formulation of the mechanism of domain engineering in the lead free materials. Both the local nano-structure and the microstructure of the lead-free crystals is studied using diffraction and spectroscopic techniques to delineate the symmetry relations, nature of the dipole moment, long-range average crystal structure, order/disorder in the atom?s local environment, and orientation of polarization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies enable the understanding of the structure-property relations on the nano- and macro- length scales and are used to identify similarities and differences between MPBs in lead-free and lead-based systems. Wide dissemination of the results obtained is done through joint publications in peer-reviewed journals, by developing a website on lead free materials, and by organizing the symposia on lead ? free piezoelectrics at future annual scientific meetings. A US ? UK, US ? Russia, and US-China student exchange program is implemented to expose the graduate students working on the project to an international research environment. A website will be launched in the second year of this effort posting all the developments, achievements, publications, and power point presentations. A pilot education program will be initiated with Montgomery County School (Blacksburg, VA), with focus on incorporating lead-free piezo-actuators and sensors into their robotics program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
