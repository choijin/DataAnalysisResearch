<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL ID: 0811770&lt;br/&gt;PI: HIGGS, CECIL F.&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: A 3D CMP-AWARE NANOSCALE IC DESIGN METHODOLOGY USING PHYSICS-BASED MODELING WITH SILICON VALIDATION VIA TEST AND DIAGNOSIS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;It is well known that ?Moore?s Law? states that computer chips will double their speed nearly every two years due to technological advancement. This advancement is typically due to the size of the transistors on the chip which are rapidly becoming as small as a nanometer (which is 1000 times thinner than a human hair). Since the transistors are smaller, more of them can be put on a chip which leads to faster computational times. Unfortunately, the processes needed to manufacturing these computer chips are highly complex and the final product often comes out defective or with lower performance than the original design. One particular manufacturing process, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), is a major contributor to performance degradation and manufacturing costs. By combining chip defect testing models with advanced CMP computer models, the principal investigators (PIs) propose to research and develop a breakthrough computational methodology for predicting the impact of the CMP manufacturing process on the chip at the design stage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CMP is a complex process in which the wafer surface that contains the chips is polished by pressing it against a rotating pad that is flooded with a slurry consisting of a fluid with abrasive nanoparticles. In order to accurately model this process, sophisticated computer models must be developed through collaborative research at the interface of electrical and computer engineering, applied physics, and mechanical engineering. A predictive computational tool resulting from this research would lead to radically improved concurrent engineering where chip designers are enabled to create bolder designs since they would be aware of the ramifications of CMP on their layouts. The resulting impact would be more sophisticated computer chip designs that exploit the most advanced materials which might normally be avoided due to the uncertainty of the effect of CMP on the materials. Due to the PIs on-going involvements with the recruitment and education of minority students, this work will also provide numerous opportunities to expose America?s next generation of engineering students at the pre-college and college levels to cutting-edge research in semiconductor technologies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
