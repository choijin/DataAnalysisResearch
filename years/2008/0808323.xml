<AbstractNarration>There is evidence that large storms, such as hurricanes, are becoming more frequent due to global climate change.  One consequence of increased storm activity is that more material from the ocean ends up on land, for example, seaweed deposited onto beaches.  This transfer of biomass represents a flow of resources from the marine to the terrestrial ecosystem.  Understanding the ecological responses to this flux of marine resources can help predict how increasing hurricane frequencies will affect coastal ecosystems.  This research project investigates how seaweed, which is deposited on land in large amounts by storms, influences an ecologically important interaction between ants and trees on islands.  In this mutually beneficial interaction the trees provide food in the form of nectar for the ants, and in return the ants protect the trees from attack.  Without their ant guards, trees are eaten by a variety of other insects, with potentially devastating consequences.  Ants will be excluded from trees on islands with seaweed added or removed to determine how marine resources influence the positive effect of ants on plants.   The investigators will include a diverse group of undergraduate students in this research and have a strong record of working with both male and female undergraduates representing a variety of ethnic backgrounds.  This project will also support the research of a doctoral student in community ecology.</AbstractNarration>
