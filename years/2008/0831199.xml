<AbstractNarration>Modern organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, government  &lt;br/&gt;agencies, and universities, collect and use personal information from  &lt;br/&gt;a range of sources, shared with specific expectations about how it  &lt;br/&gt;will be managed and used. Accordingly, they must find ways to comply  &lt;br/&gt;with expectations, which may be complex and varied, as well as with  &lt;br/&gt;relevant privacy laws and regulations, while they minimize  &lt;br/&gt;operational risk and carry out core functions of the organization  &lt;br/&gt;efficiently and effectively. Designing organizational processes to  &lt;br/&gt;manage personal information is one of the greatest challenges facing  &lt;br/&gt;organizations (see, e.g. a recent survey by Deloitte and the Ponemon  &lt;br/&gt;Institute [TI07]), with far-reaching implications for every  &lt;br/&gt;individual whose personal information is available to modern  &lt;br/&gt;organizations, i.e. all of us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project responds to these challenges by developing methods,  &lt;br/&gt;algorithms and prototype tools for integrating privacy, compliance,  &lt;br/&gt;and risk evaluation into complex organizational processes. It  &lt;br/&gt;explores, articulates and characterizes formally the scope and nature  &lt;br/&gt;of privacy-expectations of stakeholders as well as those of key  &lt;br/&gt;regulations, such as HIPAA, GLBA, COPPA, BASEL 2, and Sarbanes-Oxley  &lt;br/&gt;(SOX). It incorporates the diverse perspectives and areas of  &lt;br/&gt;expertise of its multidisciplinary research team, which includes  &lt;br/&gt;three computer scientists, one philosopher, and collaborating  &lt;br/&gt;researchers from IBM. This industry connection facilitates  &lt;br/&gt;interaction with product teams that have served complex organizations  &lt;br/&gt;concerned with business process integrity, information security,  &lt;br/&gt;privacy, and information risk management. The research builds on  &lt;br/&gt;"contextual integrity" (a philosophical account of privacy) as well  &lt;br/&gt;as language and risk-based methods for privacy policy specification  &lt;br/&gt;and enforcement. Extensive training and educational opportunities are  &lt;br/&gt;provided to undergraduate and graduate students and research results  &lt;br/&gt;integrated into courses at CMU, NYU, Stanford, and UPenn.</AbstractNarration>
