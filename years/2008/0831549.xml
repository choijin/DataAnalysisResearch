<AbstractNarration>Cross-layer design problems in wireless networks are usually very complex, &lt;br/&gt;since they require simultaneously optimizing a large amount of algorithms &lt;br/&gt;and parameters. Most existing solutions for cross-layer optimization rely &lt;br/&gt;on heuristic procedures to solve this problem. However, to obtain an optimal &lt;br/&gt;utility for the wireless user, cross-layer optimization should be formulated &lt;br/&gt;rigorously as a sequential decision problem that takes into account the &lt;br/&gt;capability of the various layers to autonomously make forecasts about their &lt;br/&gt;experienced dynamics, and perform foresighted adaptation, while adhering to &lt;br/&gt;the existing layered network architecture. To address this challenge, the &lt;br/&gt;investigators study a new, systematic framework for cross-layer optimization &lt;br/&gt;that allows each layer to make autonomous and foresighted decisions on the &lt;br/&gt;selected transmission strategies (e.g. protocol parameters and algorithms), &lt;br/&gt;while cooperatively maximizing the utility of the wireless user by optimally &lt;br/&gt;determining what necessary information should be exchanged among layers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves two main thrusts: (a) Develop a novel cross-layer &lt;br/&gt;optimization framework with message exchange among layers in which each layer &lt;br/&gt;optimizes its own protocol parameters and algorithms based on its own &lt;br/&gt;experienced dynamics and the information exchanged with other layers, in &lt;br/&gt;order to cooperatively maximize the wireless user?s utility in a foresighted &lt;br/&gt;manner while adhering to the layered network architecture; (b) Design layered &lt;br/&gt;on-line learning algorithms for the cross-layer optimization to allow each layer &lt;br/&gt;to interactively learn the experienced dynamics and other necessary information &lt;br/&gt;from other layers, such that the cross-layer strategies can be optimized &lt;br/&gt;cooperatively. This research leads to a fundamentally new way for designing &lt;br/&gt;wireless networks, systems and applications, where devices evolve and become &lt;br/&gt;smarter, by learning from their interactions with the environment over time.</AbstractNarration>
