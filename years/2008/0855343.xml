<AbstractNarration>This project is increasing STEM graduation rates through targeted recruitment of two distinct audiences. The first audience is high school students who are dual-enrolled in community college courses as they are completing the requirements for a high school diploma. Students in this group are being counseled to enroll in sufficient STEM courses during their high school years such that they receive an Associate Degree along with their high school diploma. Upon graduation, they are being encouraged to pursue a STEM bachelor's degree. The second audience that is being targeted through this project is recent veterans or soon-to-be veterans from the armed forces. Capitalizing on the significant improvements in the GI bill, veterans who have expressed an interest in STEM careers are being targeted for enrollment in STEM programs. The students who are participating in the program are being supported by a number of measures shown to increase student persistence in STEM fields. Undergraduate research opportunities, seminars with practicing professionals, and meaningful career counseling are all project components designed to retain students and to prepare them for careers in STEM. A math-readiness summer experience is also being conducted for promising STEM students who may need extra support before they begin their university studies. The results from this project are being rigorously assessed through a variety of formative and summative measures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Central Texas 2-STEP was a partnership among a lead comprehensive University (Tarleton State University), a cooperating comprehensive University (Texas A&amp;M University &ndash; Central Texas) and a Community College (Temple College). Led by the Principal Investigator, Dr. John P. Idoux, Research Professor at Tarleton, and Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Daniel Spencer, Associate Vice President at Temple College, the grant provided support for several "best practice" activities that were designed to 1) attract students to STEM fields at the community college level; 2) enhance and solidify their interest in STEM; 3) guide them to completion of a STEM-Intensive Associate degree; and 4) encourage them to continue to the next level of STEM degree achievement. Students targeted for participation were 1) high school juniors and seniors enrolled full-time in residence in a face-to-face STEM-Intensive college curriculum in Temple CollegeÆs "Middle College" Program; 2) traditional community college students with expressed interests in STEM; and 3) transitioning military personnel whose backgrounds and goals indicated an interest in STEM. All of the "best practice" activities were highly successful in achieving the goals of the grant project. Those activities are being continued by Temple College since the conclusion of the grant period.  Those activities are 1) a Math-Readiness Summer Workshop; 2) Peer-to-Peer Tutoring in introductory "gatekeeper" STEM courses; 3) "Seminar/Career Counseling Sessions by Practicing STEM Professionals"; and 4) the opportunity to participate in a full-time, 10-week summer STEM research project as a working member of an established research team.  Some specific positive outcomes from the 2-STEP project are: 1) a three-fold increase in the number of full-time Middle College students from the start of the project in Fall 2009 to the 171 full-time students in Fall 2015; 2) significant increases in STEM enrollments from among the other two groups of targeted students; 3) increased participation in STEM studies from among groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in STEM; e.g., enrollment demographics among the participating students was ~60% female and ~50% minorities; 4) demonstration that the targeted student groups, which are ones that were not usually addressed in the former NSF-STEP initiative, are fertile ground for involvement in STEM studies; 5) an increase in the percentage of all second year Middle College students who earned a STEM-Intensive Associate Degree during the years of the project compared to the years prior to the project; i.e., 82% vs 29%, respectively; 6) virtually all students who completed the Middle College Program went on to a four-year university and 80 to 85% enrolled in a STEM B.S. program; 7) increased research efforts by faculty and students; 8) increased communication among STEM faculty; 9) recognition of the value-added exposure for community college STEM students to seminars and career counseling by practicing STEM professionals as a contributing factor in retention; 10) demonstration that peer-led tutoring in introductory, "gatekeeper" STEM courses can be a contributing factor in both performance and retention; 11) an appreciation that the integration of research and education has a valuable, contributory place in the community college environment; 12) increased awareness by Temple CollegeÆs leadership officers regarding the facility, equipment and technology needs of the STEM disciplines; 13) enhanced acknowledgement by community leaders in Central Texas of the positive workforce impact from having an increased number of STEM educated individuals in the region; and 14) reports by regional print and electronic media and presentations by the grant PI and Co-PI to various groups in the region produced an increased interest in and an expanded awareness of STEM among i) regional school districts, private schools, home schooling entities and colleges and universi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
