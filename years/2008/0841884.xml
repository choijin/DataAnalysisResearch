<AbstractNarration>Snowshoe hares provide the classical textbook example of cyclical, synchronous fluctuations in population size. Hare cycles in Canada and Alaska are legendary for their 8-11 year regularity and their 20- to 50-fold amplitude difference between peak and low population densities. Equally as remarkable, population fluctuations are synchronized across much of this range. Cyclic dynamics and spatial synchrony appear to break down in the southern parts of the hare's range, where habitats for snowshoe hares are more fragmented and movements among populations more difficult. The factors responsible for population synchrony and for the breakdown of synchrony, remain speculative. By extending a unique, spatially extensive time series of hare dynamics in the continguous US, PI Mills proposes to test long-held hypotheses accounting for a latitudinal gradient in hare dynamics and the role of population connectivity in generating these geographic patterns. Nine years of preliminary data suggest that southern populations exhibit greater temporal fluctuations than previously recognized, and that these populations are more distinct genetically than are northern populations spanning a similar spatial extent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding patterns and causes of hare dynamics will advance the basic understanding of factors that influence large-scale population processes, with implications for conserving and managing many ecological systems. Population cycles and synchronous dynamics, though famously exemplified by snowshoe hares, occur in many taxa, including various insects, fish, oaks, viruses, grouse, and large mammals including caribou and muskox. Of particular conservation concern is the possibility that population synchrony and connectivity may directly affect the long-term persistence of a species. An additional application of this research to conservation arises because Canada lynx, which feed almost exclusively on snowshoe hares, are federally threatened in the U.S. outside of Alaska. The PI has established a formal program for undergraduate mentoring, and plans to involve a host of graduate and undergraduate students in this field project. Finally, all data collected will be available to the general public within 1.5 years of their collection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The regularity and spatial synchrony of 10-year snowshoe hare cycles in northern forests are classic textbook phenomena in basic ecology.  Studying these cycles has broad practical importance because hares are a dominant herbivore and the nearly exclusive prey of the federally Threatened Canada lynx, and because research on underlying mechanisms of cycles opens doors to understanding population dynamics of wild species.  Although well-described in their northern range, hare cycles are essentially unstudied in the continental U.S.  In this region, where the persistence of their specialized predator (lynx) is most tenuous, hare cycles are thought to be dampened and possibly non-synchronous.  In its first 5 years, this LTREB project facilitated a long-term core data set consisting of &gt;1,300 hare genetic samples and hare abundance data spanning 12 &ndash; 16 years for 35 sites in Wyoming and Montana.  To date, this core dataset contains the most extensive (across space and time) and intensive (based mostly on capture-mark-recapture estimates) time series of snowshoe hare abundance (and genetic samples) in the southern range of a widely distributed species.   By reaching out to hunters, trappers, and hare researchers across North America to complement the core LTREB monitoring data, the researchers supplemented the core site data with &gt;300 time series and 1,014 genetic samples from 16 U.S. states and 12 Canadian provinces.  Analyses of the genetic data with microsatellite and mtDNA markers indicate that hares form three genetic groups that correspond to patterns of synchrony in population dynamics, suggesting a role for dispersal (of hares and/or their predators) in synchronizing snowshoe hare populations.   This project has facilitated a close working relationship with international colleagues, including Scotland (Dr. Glenn Iason), Canada (Dr. Karen Hodges), and Austria (Dr. Klaus Hacklander).  Especially strong collaborations (nurtured by the Portuguese Science Foundation and the NSF International Program supplemented by this LTREB) have emerged with Dr. Paulo Alves, current President of the World Lagomorph Society at University of Porto, Portugal.  Dr. Alves and the PI of this grant have submitted at least 5 proposals in the U.S. and Europe.  The project has garnered widespread interest among policymakers and forest managers in the U.S. and Canada, as it has implications for recovery planning for Canada lynx (a specialist on hares) and more broadly for understanding how forest fragmentation at a local scale affects population dynamics across a landscape.  The PI gave at least 2 invited lectures or discussions per year related to this research to state and federal agencies including National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management.  The time series and genetic samples obtained across northern North America from about 100 biologists, trappers, hunters, and naturalists (to complement analyses from the local core LTREB study areas) have both increased the scope of the project and provided an outreach platform to a group of researchers and the public who have become invested in the outcome.   Over the 5 years of the grant the field and lab work from the sampling at the core LTREB sites has involved 3 graduate students (two female) and 53 undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds (e.g. 31 females and 22 males, 2 native American females, 2 Hispanic females, 3 combat veterans); five of these have conducted undergraduate Honors/Senior thesis projects. Also, 3 graduate students have used the data for some of their research, and helped mentor undergraduates.  In addition, seven journal articles have been published to date.
