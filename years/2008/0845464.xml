<AbstractNarration>****Non-technical abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this CAREER award is to combine research efforts to investigate novel functionalities in atomic-scale-engineered complex-oxides going beyond the limitations of conventional semiconductors with education and outreach programs to train a new generation of scientists and engineers in the areas of materials physics and nanoscience.  One of the promising material systems for post-silicon nanoelectronics is complex-oxides. Complex oxides exhibit a wide range of functionalities such as high critical temperature superconductivity, (anti)ferromagnetism, and ferroelectricity that do not exist in conventional semiconductors. Moreover, entirely new functionalities can be created when different complex oxides are combined into a heterostructure. This project will investigate emergent functionalities hidden in this new materials family, utilizing a newly developed atomic-layer engineering technique.  In order to bring the excitement of these research activities to a broader community and train a new generation of scientists and engineers, a number of education and outreach programs will be developed aimed at K-12 and university students.  Hands-on demonstration modules for middle-school students will be developed for the mobile Rutgers Science Explorer program.  Pre- and in-service high-school teachers will learn research methods in the lab and develop teaching modules for high-school students reflecting their experience in a materials physics research lab.  Graduates and undergraduates, especially from underrepresented groups, will be actively involved in the main research activities and outreach programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The research component of this CAREER project will create and investigate a number of novel complex oxides and their heterostructures anticipated to show previously nonexistent functionalities and properties such as:  highly-tunable high-mobility d-band 2DEGs, new multiferroics, and artificial high-temperature superconductors, utilizing a newly developed complex-oxide atomic-layer MBE. These studies will deepen understanding of electron-electron correlation effects in 2D d-band electrons, interfacial coupling mechanisms between magnetism and ferroelectricity, and the effect of atomic-scale control parameters such as modulation doping on superconducting properties of artificial high-temperature superconductors, and pave the way to a new age of complex-oxide nanoelectronics.  In order to bring the excitement of these research activities to a broader community and train a new generation of scientists and engineers, a number of education and outreach programs will be developed aimed at K-12 and university students.  Hands-on demonstration modules for middle-school students will be developed for the mobile Rutgers Science Explorer program.

Broader Impacts  The development of easily implementable techniques that have practically eliminated the source oxidation problem in oxide MBE environment is expected to extend the applicability of the MBE technique to a broader family of oxide materials that were previously difficult to handle with MBE.  On the topological insulator side, this award enabled me to provide high quality TI thin films to more than twenty groups around the world covering US, Canada, Singapore, Korea, Japan, Italy, and Netherlands.  Some of them have already led to a number of breakthrough discoveries in TI research as evidenced in the publications listed below.  This implies that the CAREER award, even if it was a single-PI award, benefited over 20 groups around the world by training and networking numerous next generation scientists under the common scientific theme of topological insulators.  On the education side, this grant allowed the PI to support three graduate students and a postdoc: among them two are from underrepresented groups: one female and the other Hispanic.  PI has been also actively involved in multi-faculty courses to expose graduate students to the latest research advances, through two courses: Seminar in Physics and Surface Science II.  In addition PI has mentored 13 undergraduate students and a high school student.  Many of these students presented their works in either nation-wide conferences or local workshops, and most of them pursue their career in related STEM areas. PI also maitains his group website (mbe.rutgers.edu), where all the major efforts going in the group are posted in a timely manner.
