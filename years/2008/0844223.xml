<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Floral and Faunal Community Responses to Late-Quaternary Climate Change&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Williams, Stephen Jackson, Eric Grimm and Russell Graham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose a study of the responses of species and communities to&lt;br/&gt;late- Quaternary environmental variations and, in particular, the environmental drivers of species turnover, community assembly and disassembly, and the formation of no-analog communities. Their research will demonstrate the power of NEOTOMA, a new community paleoecological database that reduces informatics costs and removes barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration by storing in a single database most of the major late-Neogene paleoecological databases. The proposed research will be the first-ever synoptic analyses of late-Quaternary community dynamics in North America that directly integrate fossil pollen, plant-macrofossil, and faunal records.  The PIs propose improving the resolution of the NEOTOMA database by obtaining 100 new AMS radiocarbon dates for key vertebrate fossil localities, adding recent high-quality records to NEOTOMA, revising existing chronologies in NEOTOMA in light of this new data, and mapping all data for 15 time-windows covering the last 21,000 years. These time windows are more finely subdivided than the original FAUNMAP synthesis, and will permit study of species responses to the rapid climate changes of the last deglaciation. The PIs will test such hypotheses by comparing the distributions of the floral and faunal no-analog communities to each other and to the distributions of no-analog climates. They will create plant based and animal based biome maps to see whether such maps are complementary or in contradiction. The PIs will further conduct generalized dissimilarity modeling to reveal patterns of species turnover, along environmental gradients, in both space and time.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has used the large climatic and ecological changes during the last deglaciation (21,000 years ago to present) as a model system in order to 1) better understand the effects of climate change on biodiversity and the distributions of species and communities and 2) assess the predictive skill of biogeographic models commonly used to project ecological responses to 21st-century climate change.  Drawing on fossil data from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, we built a new generation of mapped plant distributions in eastern North America over the last 21,000 years at a 1000-year resolution, developing new methods for assessing the quality of radiocarbon dating and inferring the timing of biostratigraphic events such as the widespread decline of spruce abundances (Blois et al. 2011).  We combined these paleovegetation maps with state-of-the-art paleoclimatic simulations from CCSM3 (a global climate model), then used this joint paleoclimatic and paleoecological dataset to test hypotheses about the stability of species-climate relationships over time (Veloz et al. 2012) and model the climatic controls on species distributions and community turnover.  We showed that models that predict changes in community composition as a non-linear function of climate (specifically, a model known as generalized dissimilarity modeling) successfully predicted spatial and temporal patterns of community turnover during the last deglaciation (Blois et al., 2012, 2013).  As part of this work, we tested a fundamental assumption in biogeographic theory, known as the space-for-time assumption, which holds that the processes and patterns governing spatial patterns of biodiversity can be used to understand and model temporal processes that cannot be observed directly (for example, climate-driven changes in biodiversity during the latter part of this century, or during the last deglaciation).  The space-for-time assumption is widely used but rarely tested; our work provided strong support for the space-for-time assumption (Blois et al. 2013).  This research thus upholds one of the central tenets of biodiversity modeling while at the same time pointing out the challenges of modeling species and community distributions under climatic conditions beyond the range of climates found at present.  We have also shown that the shifts in species distributions during the last deglaciation closely tracked climate change at millennial timescales, even during period of relatively fast climate change (Ordonez et al. 2013).  In addition to the implications of this work for climate adaptation science, broader impacts include the training of an early career postdoctoral scientist and the generation of new high quality datasets for testing the predictive ability of biodiversity models.  All key datasets and results from this project have been made publicly available through the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, as supplemental information for journal articles, and on the researchers public websites. Results from this work were widely disseminated through traditional academic outlets (papers, scientific presentations), through talks and panel discussions with general audience, through workshops targeted for K-12 educators, and through social media outlets such as Twitter.
