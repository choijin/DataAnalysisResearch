<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Robert Compton of the University of Tennessee will continue and expand his research on negative ions. Studies of dipole and quadrupole bound anions will focus on photodetachment of these weakly bound anions in the difficult energy region near threshold (millielectron volts). Measurements of the photodetachment threshold will provide accurate electron affinities of these anions which can be compared to less accurate values obtained by Rydberg electron transfer and electric field detachment methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resonantly-enhanced multiphoton dissociation experiments will be conducted at the Netherlands free electron facility (FELIX) on vibrational spectroscopy of multiply charged anions. Collisional dissociation studies of multiply-charged anions  are being carried out at the ELISA ion storage ring in Aarhus, Denmark.  Another goal is to record the first photodetachment circular dichroism cross section for a chiral negative ion such as the tartaric acid anion and dianion.  All of these studies will have a strong theoretical component This research will be conducted with the assistance of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as with collaborators within and outside the United States. Through their participation in this research and the collaborations with other American and international groups the students will gain valuable experience that will prepare them for advanced studies or employment in the academic, government or industrial sectors of the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This brief report summarizes the basic research activities on "Negative Ions" by the University of Tennessee Chemical Physics Group over the past four years.   The studies of four graduate students  and one post doctoral student were presented in ten peer reviewed publications.  These experimental studies received theroetical support  from groups in New Zealand (Dr. Peter Swerdtfeger), University of Pittsbugh (Dr. Ken Jordan), University of Arizona (Dr. L. Adamowicz) and Southeastern Lousianna University (Dr. T. Sommerfeld).  In addition, experimental collaborations with the groups of Dr. K. Bowen (Johns Hopkins Univ.) as well as European groups at the Free Electron Laser in Holland and the Electrostatic Storage Ring in Aarhus, Denmark.  Negative ions are known to be present in solutions, the atmosphere, plasmas, and interstellar space.  The simplist of all  negative ions, that of  hydrogen, is employed in many accelerators throughout the world such as Spallation Neutron Sources.  The understanding of the structure of negative ions represents a severe test of Quantum Chemistry calculational methods.  Our studies of "exotic negative ions" such as multipole bound anions and multiply charged anions have supplied bench marks for this emerging field.  A number of years ago we first examined the formation of dipole-bound and  quadrupole bound anions (along with  Drs. Scherrmann  and Defrancois). These exotic species are negative ions in which the extra electron is bound primarily by the mulitpole moment of the molecule.  We have established that any molecule with a dipole moment greater than 2.5 Debye will form a bound negative ion state.  In a recent study we found that the classic HCN- dipole bound negative ion was only stable in low  (J&lt;3) states of rotational excitation!  Previous to this study scientists make the approximation that electrons move "fast" compared to nuclei.  This is known as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.  However, in such weakly bound systems the electron cannot "keep up with" the nuclei  and rotations slough off the electron!  Given there extreme fragility one might ask the question "What roll do these ubiquitous dipole-bound anions play in nature?".  Some have speculated that they may contribute to the origin of the so-called "diffuse interstellar bands" which have been a mystery for over 100 years.  In another possible answer to this question we have shown that dipole-bound states are "doorway" states to the more stable "valence bound" anions which are more common in all of chemistry.  In other studies we have suggested that the dipole states could explain some remarkable electron transport processes in gases and liquids.  The "almost free" electron is envisioned to hop from one dipole to another without scattering.  Amino acids are known to support dipole bound anions and we recently published a paper which discusses the possible influence of dipole-bound states on electron transport within molecules containing amino acid derivatives.    The structure of singly- and doubly-charged negative ions has been studied using photoelectron spectroscopy, collisional dissociation and multiple photon infrared spectroscopy.  For example we reported the first vibrational spectrum for the important SF6- anion as well as a number of multi-charged anions including environmentally important salt cluster anions.   All of these studies were supported by state-of-the art theoretical calculations.            Last Modified: 12/22/2013       Submitted by: Robert N Compton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
