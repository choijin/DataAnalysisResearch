<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to increase the understanding of how individual and school level factors shape the academic achievement of Latino adolescents using quantitative and qualitative data. This objective will be accomplished using the data and resources of the New York University-Center for Research on Culture, Development and Education (CRCDE), a center, currently funded by the National Science Foundation that employs an integrative conceptual framework and multiple methods to examine how various contexts influence youths? academic engagement and performance. To conduct this research advanced methodological training in mixed methods and statistical procedures will be completed through courses and participation in seminars offered by the university and CRCDE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study provides a major contribution to the academic achievement research across disciplines by using quantitative and qualitative data to examine how relative and concurrent associations among individual and school level factors shape Latino academic achievement over time, especially examining how perceived academic competence, psychological adjustment and adolescents? perceptions of their school climate (e.g., teacher/student relationships) influences academic achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The evidence generated from the proposed research may be translated to create appropriate intervention efforts and educational policies to help Latino youth remain in school, graduate from high school and continue into higher education. Findings from this research study will be disseminated through written materials and presentations to a variety of audiences interested in improving the educational outcomes among underrepresented groups, including the research community, schools and parents, education practitioners and policy organizations.</AbstractNarration>
