<AbstractNarration>Validation and Verification (V&amp;V) are essential parts for reliable solution of large complex problems in many fields of engineering and science. They address the reliability of the selected mathematical models and their numerical treatment for prediction of physical and medical phenomena of interest in the view of the available experimental data and uncertainties. Such predictions are the basis for important engineering, scientific, public health, etc. decisions. Although few workshops on this general topic have taken place in last few years the proposed workshop will concentrate on specific problems in engineering (tail hook of the Navy airplane) and medicine (spread &amp; control of spatial diseases such as influenza). It will show the entire process of the modeling, validation, verification and prediction and its theoretical basis. The workshop will bring together engineers, experimentalists, mathematicians, statisticians and public health surveillance experts to discuss together the fundamental problem of V&amp;V in the relation to the specific problems and in general, especially for the large scale computational science problem. Good procedures for V&amp;V are crucial for extreme scale computational simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
