<AbstractNarration>Proposal No. 0801334&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fabrication of the NEM and NEMFET Logic Gates&lt;br/&gt;via Top-Down and Bottom-up Processes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H.-S. Philip Wong&lt;br/&gt;hspwong@stanford.edu&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;250 Word Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to demonstrate for the first-time ultra-low power logic gates based on nanoelectromechanical (NEM) switches and NEM field-effect transistors. The proposed devices will solve the ever aggravating leakage and static power consumption problem of the CMOS technologies. The approach is to pursue simultaneously the lithography-based top-down processes and the nanowire/carbon nanotube-based bottom-up techniques. The proposed research aligns well with the EPDT program which aims at improving the fundamental understanding of devices and components based on the principles of electronics and electromechanics. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit resides in the experimental realization of extremely low power ULSI logic systems combining two traditionally distinct domains (MEMS and CMOS logic). Micron-sized MEMS devices will be extended into the nanoscale regime. The ultra-low power operation of the proposed devices follows from the fact that the signal propagation is based not only on the movement of charge but also on the displacement of a solid rod. This distinguishes the NEM relays and the NEMS-based transistors from the conventional MOSFETs. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts will advance diversity in the nanoelectronics workforce and provide intellectual technology transfer, integration of research and education, public education, minority student outreach, and promotion of partnerships. Specifically, collaboration with the producers of the award-winning Silicon Run Film Series will result in new educational films on MEMS and nanoelectronics. They will serve as a resource to educators teaching in these new fields and assist with the professional development of instructors in supporting disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Two NEW devices have been invented during the course of this project. They are particularly promising as they pave the way for NEW applications beyond what has been envisioned for NEM relay technology so far. Nanoelectromechanical Memory     NEM relays are promising for nonvolatile (NV) memory applications due to their inherent electromechanical hysteresis. The Nanoelectromechanical Memory (nRAM) is a simple two-terminal NEM switch where the stored logic states are represented by the beam position ("0" = beam up, "1" = beam down). The most significant feature of the nRAM is the sharpness of the hysteretic transitions, enabling to implement a crossbar array without using cell selection devices. This improves the device density considerably and makes the 3-D integration possible, since no transistor or diode is required.  Analog Nanoelectromechanical Relay with Tunable Transconductance  NEM relays naturally fit to the requirements of logic and memory devices due to its features including zero leakage, infinitely sharp on/off transitions, and a square hysteresis window. However, analog signal processing with the NEM relays is not feasible since the drain current amplitude cannot be controlled by the gate voltage. We show by simulation that a three-terminal NEM relay combined with a feedback resistor provides a tunable transconductance Gm over an adjustable input-voltage range. An analog NEM transistor (NEMT) consists of a NEM relay in series with a feedback resistor Rf . The whole structure is perceived as a single 3-T device, where the source terminal S corresponds to the free end of Rf. As in an STM, the operation of NEMT is based on the control of a tunneling current across a subnanometer air or vacuum gap.  The input and output resistances of NEMT are practically infinite, favoring its use as a transconductance amplifier. NEMTs can be integrate...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
