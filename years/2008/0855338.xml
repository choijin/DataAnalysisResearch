<AbstractNarration>The Nuclear and Particle Physics group at Norfolk State University (NSU) is involved in experimentally exploring the basic interaction that keeps the nucleus together, namely, the strong interaction.  The group's research efforts are focused in the study of the structure of the nucleon and of other sub-atomic particles (hadrons).  This research is carried out at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Virginia.  Through this program NSU faculty and students will be involved in experiments at the forefront of research in the field, thereby strengthening the national participation of minorities in nuclear and particle physics research.</AbstractNarration>
