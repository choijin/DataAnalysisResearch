<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: PHANTOME: PHage ANnotation TOols&lt;br/&gt;and MEthods&lt;br/&gt;Institution: San Diego State University Foundation&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 03/09/09&lt;br/&gt;Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet. Since the most&lt;br/&gt;abundant living organisms on Earth are bacteria, the majority of these viruses are&lt;br/&gt;phages, the viruses which infect bacteria. Through their diverse lifestyles and gene&lt;br/&gt;products, phages play important roles in horizontal gene exchange, in structuring&lt;br/&gt;natural microbial communities, and in global biogeochemical cycles. Phages carry&lt;br/&gt;genes for some of the deadliest toxins known and can also carry genes which confer&lt;br/&gt;adaptive advantages to the hosts they infect. Furthermore, phage genes and the&lt;br/&gt;proteins they encode are the outcome of evolution over eons, the products of which we&lt;br/&gt;would be able to exploit if only we could decode the information in the phage DNA&lt;br/&gt;sequences. The number of available phage genome sequences is increasing rapidly; on&lt;br/&gt;the other hand, they represent the largest global reservoir of uncharacterized genetic&lt;br/&gt;material. Bioinformatic tools necessary for interpreting this data has lagged behind the&lt;br/&gt;growth in genome sequences. Grants to develop a platform and toolbox of&lt;br/&gt;computational tools for phage genome analysis have been awarded to support&lt;br/&gt;collaborative research in the laboratories of Drs. Robert Edwards, Department of&lt;br/&gt;Computer Sciences, San Diego State University, Mya Breitbart, College of Marine&lt;br/&gt;Sciences, University of South Florida, Jeffrey Elhai, Biology Department, Virginia&lt;br/&gt;Commonwealth University and Matthew Sullivan, Department of Ecology and&lt;br/&gt;Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona. Dr. Elhai is an Associate Professor, the&lt;br/&gt;other three investigators are Assistant Professors. This collaborative project is creating&lt;br/&gt;new computational tools to establish a consistent nomenclature for phage genomes, to&lt;br/&gt;annotate phage sequences, both from completely sequenced phage genomes and from&lt;br/&gt;environmental phage metagenome sequences. Most importantly, this project will&lt;br/&gt;engage a wide spectrum of researchers, regardless of their computational background,&lt;br/&gt;to access the wealth of information contained in phage genomes through familiar&lt;br/&gt;graphical interfaces. These collaborators have developed an extensive and far-reaching&lt;br/&gt;education plan that targets high school students, undergraduate students and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students. The students trained in the use of the tools will rotate into trainer roles via user&lt;br/&gt;forums and workshops. The postdocs will be working across all the labs and thereby&lt;br/&gt;gain an unparalleled panoramic view of phage biology.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0850356 PI Name:Edwards, Robert&lt;br/&gt;Printed from eJacket: 03/10/09 Page 1 of 1</AbstractNarration>
