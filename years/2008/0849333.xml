<AbstractNarration>This project is part of a series of National Research Council studies that seek to develop the scientific goals for fields of physics and astronomy for the next decade and beyond.  The focus of this project is nuclear physics research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past decade, new U.S. initiatives in nuclear physics have been successful not only in expanding the understanding of basic nuclear science, but also in translating that understanding into applications with enormous societal impact.  Representative samplings of the areas that have been advanced in the last ten years are successes in probing the quark structure of the nucleus, in investigating the physics of quark-gluon plasma and in studying nuclei near the limits of stability.  Applications now range from isotope production for medical use and material analysis techniques to energy production and the finding of solutions for nuclear forensics and defense-related problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this study is to develop a strategy that can serve as a framework for the field through 2020 and beyond.  This strategy not only will build on recent successes in the field, but also will evaluate how to take advantage of potential international collaborations.  There are a number of international efforts either underway or in development, and an important part of this project will be to have the U.S. nuclear physics research communities determine how best to advance the science in this field, whether it be through collaboration in these international projects or the development of additional facilities that will help address the many as-yet unresolved questions in this field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  National Research CouncilÆs  Decadal Survey of Nuclear Physics     This grant provided partial support for the National Research CouncilÆs (NRC) decadal survey of nuclear physics.  This is part of NRCÆs larger effort to assess and discuss the outlook for different fields in physics and astronomy, Physics 2010, which takes place approximately every ten years.   A report has been prepared as a result of the study that is intended to inform those who are interested about the current status of research in this area and to help guide future developments of the field.  A pdf version of the report is available for download, for free, at http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13438.     Among the principal conclusions reached in the report are that the nuclear physics program in the United States has been especially well managed, principally through a recurring long-range planning process conducted by the community, and that current opportunities developed pursuant to that planning process should be exploited.  In the section entitled "Building the Foundation for the Future," the report notes that attention needs to be paid to certain elements that are essential to the continued vitality of the field.  These include ensuring that education and research at universities remain a focus for funding and that a plan be developed to ensure that forefront-computing resources, including exascale capabilities when developed, be made available to nuclear science researchers.  The report also notes that nimbleness is essential for the United States to remain competitive in a rapidly expanding international nuclear physics arena and that streamlined and flexible procedures should be developed for initiating and managing smaller-scale nuclear science projects.
