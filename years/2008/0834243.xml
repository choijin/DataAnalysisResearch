<AbstractNarration>This project will fund the development of components and their integration for Spiral 1 of an end-to-end prototype of a suite of network infrastructure that would enable researchers to carry out novel network science and engineering experiments, i.e., to do science that currently can not be done. Spiral 1 will attempt a first, trial integration and operation of components on multiple national backbones. Spiral 1 will be developed as quickly as possible to identify and reduce programmatic and technical risk and to help the research community achieve a shared vision by providing a working prototype. It will stimulate broad community participation and build a strong academic and industrial base. Twenty-nine projects, working in five teams will compete in the design and implementation of the network infrastructure control framework. System engineers will perform top-down integration planning and project guidance. While a well-integrated, orderly system may not be possible until Spiral 2 or 3, Spiral 1 will take the critical first step towards creating this radically new kind of experimental infrastructure with end-to-end, virtualizable, and sliceable capabilities, which are entirely novel. Once this first spiral exists, it will co-evolve with the community?s emerging research and education agenda. The larger impacts are potentially huge, allowing for transformative research in network science and engineering that has never been done before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         GENI's Goals  The Global Environment for Network Innovations - GENI - is a suite of research infrastructure that comprises a distributed laboratory deployed across the United States. (See Figure 1.) GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems by providing a suite of infrastructure for "at-scale" experiments in future internets.       GENI supports a wide variety of experiments, including the following:         Experiments ranging from small to "at-scale" experiments. Both experiments that are compatible and experiments that are incompatible with todayÆs Internet. Not only controlled, repeatable experiments, which which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks, but also trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to todayÆs Internet and that engage large numbers of users. A variety of classroom and research experiments.   Although GENIÆs goal is to support "at-scale" experiments on future internets, our plan has never been to build a separate, parallel set of infrastructure "as big as the Internet," which is clearly infeasible. Instead, the approach has been to "GENI- enable" existing testbeds, campuses, regional and backbone networks, cloud computation services, and commercial equipment to be programmable, virtualized and sliceable, so that they could support end-to-end experiments.       GENI's Results  GENI has addressed its initial purpose of supporting innovative research, and it has gone beyond these goals in a number of ways. The GENI project office and the GENI community have built GENI with an initial at-scale deployment now in place. GENIÆs use in the classroom is lowering the barrier for laboratory-based learning in computer science education. It is increasingly finding application in data- and compute-intensive domain sciences. Furthermore, GENI infrastructure is supporting advanced application development in areas of societal impact, through initiatives such as US Ignite. (See Figures 2 and 3.)  GENI continues to see explosive growth in usage for both research and education &ndash; over 6,500 unique users have turned to GENI, allocating over 188,000 GENI configurations. (See Figure 4.) GENIÆs user base reaches more than 180 US universities and over 30 countries. (See Figure 5.)  Building upon the prototyping activities performed under this award, the initial nationwide GENI deployment is nearing completion, incorporating over 60 GENI racks at universities, regional and backbone networks, and partner institutions across the US. GENI hardware and concepts are increasingly extending beyond GENI proper and being integrated with campus scientific computing infrastructure. More researchers from the GENI community are publishing their results &ndash; the bibliography of GENI-relevant publications now exceeds 260 entries.   Educators continue to develop GENI-based curriculum and employ GENI in their classrooms. In the last complete semester (Fall 2015), instructors used GENI in at least 19 different courses with total enrollment of over 800 students.      Future Directions  The GENI community and GENI technology are playing a vital role in leading the development of research cyberinfrastructure. Key GENI concepts are increasingly embedded into new projects, such as the NSF Future Cloud research platform. Similarly, the central GENI notions of slicability and deep programmability are finding their way into future internet and distributed cloud research testbeds worldwide. (See Figure 6.)      As GENI is being created and improved, it is engaging an unusually wide range of participants from a cross-section of US institutions. This community is designing and developing GENI technology, deploying GENI on their campuses, and using GENI in their research. Many universities are applying GENI in their courses, with the potential to transform totally how experimental computer science is taught and learned.   Perhaps most imp...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
