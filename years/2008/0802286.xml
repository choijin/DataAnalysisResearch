<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Joel H. Collier of the University of Cincinnati will design, synthesize, and characterize a family of peptide-based molecules that can be self-assembled, easily manipulated, and chemoselectively stabilized to form synthetic extracellular matrices. Factorial experimental design will be utilized to tune these materials in a systematic fashion to produce synthetic gels and surfaces that maximize a specific desirable biological outcome, in this case epithelialization to form a functional barrier tissue. The development of synthetic materials that can predictably interface with living cells in a manner that is biospecific, multi-functional, and tunable has become one of the more fundamental and difficult issues in the field of biomaterials chemistry. This research represents a strategy towards designing synthetic materials that are both complexly bioactive and tunable, a combination of properties that is facilitated by the materials' modularity and self-assembling nature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Collier will promote two complementary outreach programs designed to take advantage of the multidisciplinary nature and personal relevance of biomaterials chemistry. To enhance the retention of minority undergraduates in the sciences, a research co-op program will be established in collaboration with the extensive co-op program of the University of Cincinnati. To enhance the interest of young people in pursuing technical careers, an intermediate-level outreach program will bring the hands-on excitement of the research lab to local public middle schools. The broader impacts of this work include training undergraduate and graduate students in multidisciplinary science with a focus in macromolecular chemistry, working towards the goal of enhancing minority retention in the sciences, and inspiring young minds to consider exciting multidisciplinary scientific careers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through this project, we designed new materials that can function as specialized matrices for culturing cells.  In order to replicate the structure and function of cellsÃ† normal extracellular matrix, we designed short protein fragments that could spontaneously self-assemble into chemically defined hydrogels suitable for cell culture.  The modular engineerability of these materials allowed us to tune various properties such as the stiffness, the spatial arrangement of different bioactive cues, and the complex combination of multiple cues together.  This modular system enabled the use of experimental styles not commonly applied to cell/matrix biology, including response surface methodology and factorial experimentation.  Through these experiments, we systematically identified optimal combinations of biological factors that could accelerate the growth and function of various cell types, including endothelial cells and epithelial cells.  The project also supported two outreach programs to encourage scientific interest and abilities among grade school and undergraduate students.  The first was a presentation/interactive session taught to middle school students, where they learned about biomaterials such as hip implants through a multimedia presentation, and where they subsequently synthesized their own hydrogel biomaterials in the classroom.  The second was a laboratory internship for undergraduate students, who were immersed in the science of designing, constructing, and analyzing synthetic culture matrices for cells.   In sum, the major impact of the project was two-fold: designing better materials for culturing cells in 3D, and encouraging the development of young scientists.
