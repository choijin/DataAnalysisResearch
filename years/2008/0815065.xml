<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to strengthen the theoretical and practical foundations for understanding, developing and implementing assessments embedded in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) curricula. The project aims to interweave threads from four research areas: 1) cognitive science, 2) curriculum development, 3) instructional practice and teacher preparation, and 4) educational measurement and psychometric modeling to advance knowledge of assessment in STEM. The main product will be a monograph that will unify and extend disciplinary understandings; identify important questions, issues and problems relevant to informative assessment for future research; and articulate a broad-based multidisciplinary research agenda for informative assessment. A key assumption underlying this proposal is that successful implementation of effective mathematics and science curricula depends on the presence in the classroom of high quality embedded assessments that inform the teaching and learning processes, and is sensitive to the needs of diverse learner groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synthesis research in this project will be structured by an organizing framework of aspects of assessment validity, based on reviews of multiple research literatures, and guided by advice from a outstanding panel of experts from across the four supporting research areas whose work and expertise are centrally relevant to STEM teaching and learning and whose interests include assessment, and the needs of diverse populations. The project will enhance knowledge and understanding of assessment in STEM areas and to improve the broader theoretical perspectives and practical foundations underlying informative assessment. The project?s main goal to bring informative assessments significantly into K-12 STEM classrooms nationwide, and other education and training settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
