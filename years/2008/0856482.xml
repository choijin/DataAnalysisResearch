<AbstractNarration>In 2004, the Oklahoma Center for Information Assurance and Forensics Education, which was subsequently renamed the Cyber Security Education Consortium (CSEC), was established as an ATE regional center for cybersecurity education (NSF Award No. 0355246) serving the state of Oklahoma and sections of surrounding states.  Following four successful years of operation, the current grant renews the center for a second phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With broad support from business and industry, government agencies, law enforcement, the military, and the intelligence community, CSEC is creating a high-tech workforce in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas.  The goal is to bring jobs to this eight-state region, where the quality of life is good and costs are low, and to reverse the tide of outsourcing and offshoring that has sent so many specialized high-tech jobs and facilities overseas.  The center is implementing high-quality cybersecurity education programs in 19 metropolitan areas (31 educational institutions), which comprise eight of the 50 largest cities in the country (Dallas, St. Louis, Denver, San Antonio, Kansas City, Nashville, Memphis, and Oklahoma City) and 11 other mid-sized cities (Tulsa, Knoxville, Little Rock, Colorado Springs, Wichita, Shreveport, Chattanooga, Fayetteville [AR], Springfield [MO], Fort Smith [AR], and Topeka).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSEC is a cohesive partnership of technology centers, community colleges, and the University of Tulsa, one of the premier NSA Centers of Excellence for Information Assurance Education, which serves as a mentor to the other institutions.  The center offers courses, certificate programs, and degree programs for college students and professional development for faculty members.  In addition, the center provides education and training opportunities to transitional adults and high school students.  Articulation agreements provide students with seamless educational pathways, allowing them to move from associate degree programs to bachelor's degree programs to master's and doctoral programs.  The center's faculty development initiative incorporates an effective "train the trainer" model, which trained 105 instructors during the center's first four years.  Faculty have access to a year-long residency program at the University of Tulsa, in which they receive intensive training and may pursue MS or PhD studies; a 25-day certificate program, which prepares instructors to teach courses in each of five core cybersecurity areas; multi-day workshops offered at locations around the country; and quarterly curriculum working group meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSEC institutions implement a comprehensive, nationally recognized cybersecurity curriculum covering five core areas: information assurance, secure electronic commerce, network security, enterprise security management, and digital forensics.  The curriculum blends theory and practice, legal and ethical issues, and an intense laboratory component.  It is incorporated in degree and certificate programs and maps to industry (Cisco, Microsoft), vendor-neutral (Security+, SCNP/SCNA), and federal (CNSS 4011-16) certifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major focus in the center's second phase is the creation of curricula in the strategic areas of secure coding, automation and control systems, and mobile communications devices--areas in which a significant demand for experts has emerged.  Each of these three specialized curricula involves a foundational course, one or more advanced courses, and a capstone course, which culminates in students (including incumbent workers) receiving a certification in the technical area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An organizational focus of the center's second phase is the creation of "centers of excellence" in every major city in the eight-state region.  These centers focus on a curricular area (such as secure coding, automation and control systems, or mobile communications devices) driven by local industry needs, and serve as hubs for education, training, and outreach activities in their focus area, catalyzing job creation and economic development.</AbstractNarration>

Simultaneously, CSEC has attempted to create centers of excellence and special programs in automation and control systems, secure coding and mobile communications devices.  As of the project end-date of September 30, 2017, 40 two-year institutions were active in CSEC and were offering courses based on CSEC?s core cyber security curriculum.  Since the start of this project in 2010, CSEC has assisted 26 two-year consortium institutions in building cyber security programs.  One institution, Red Rocks Community College (Lakewood, CO), received a prestigious Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE/2Y) designation from the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security in 2016-17.  At the start of this project, only two CSEC members, Oklahoma City Community College (Oklahoma City, OK) and Rose State College (Midwest City, OK), were designated as CAE/2Y institutions.  As of the project end-date, nine CSEC institutions have received CAE/2Y designations:  (i) Bossier Parish Community College (Bossier City, LA); (ii) Francis Tuttle Technology Center (Oklahoma City, OK); (iii) Jackson State Community College (Jackson, TN); (iv) Manhattan Area Technical College (Manhattan, KS); (v) Oklahoma City Community College (Oklahoma City, OK); (vi) Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education (Stillwater, OK); (vii) Richland College (Dallas, TX); (viii) Red Rocks Community College (Lakewood, CO);  and (ix) Rose State College (Midwest City, OK).

Since CSEC?s previous final report in 2011, 183 CSEC instructors have participated in the program &ndash; 408 instructors since CSEC?s inception.  CSEC?s remarkable growth is largely due to this highly successful program, which covers theory and practice and provides an intense hands-on laboratory component. Instructors are also coached on teaching techniques and approaches for upgrading technical content.  CSEC institutions have designed and implemented rigorous cyber security curricula encompassing the five core areas listed above.  The core areas cover the breadth of the discipline, including its technical, operational and managerial dimensions and legal and ethical issues.  New CSEC institutions have modeled their academic programs on the five core areas.  CSEC has also created centers of excellence and special programs in automation and control systems and advanced curricula in secure coding and mobile communications devices. As of the project end-date, CSEC institutions offered more than 75 distinct cyber security courses, 17 A.A.S. or A.S. degrees, 26 certificates of mastery and two B.T. degrees. CSEC institutions have instituted 123 articulation agreements that provide students with advanced placement, dual enrollment or cyber security course credit.

Since CSEC?s previous NSF ATE final report in 2011, 1,080 students have received associate?s degrees in cyber security and 230 have received bachelor?s degrees.  Meanwhile 1,184 students have completed certificate programs and CSEC institutions have awarded a total of 1,208 CNSS certificates.  Since CSEC?s inception in 2004, 1,630 students have received associate?s degrees in cyber security and 401 have completed bachelor?s degree programs.  Meanwhile 2,199 students have completed certificate programs and CSEC institutions have awarded a total of 2,278 CNSS certificates.     Over its lifetime, CSEC has assisted at least 75 two-year institutions in its eight-state region and 50 institutions elsewhere in the country in training instructors, developing curricula and building cyber security programs.  CSEC has also helped support and grow the IT-based industry in its eight-state region.  Over its lifetime, CSEC institutions have educated and trained at least 11,000 students and members of the workforce in cyber security, setting them on the path to successful professional careers.  Indeed, CSEC?s academic and workforce development initiatives have served as mechanisms for reducing the outsourcing and offshoring of information technology jobs, in general, and cyber security jobs, in particular.
