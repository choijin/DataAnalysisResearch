<AbstractNarration>Novel catalytic methods for synthesizing the 8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane nucleus are to be developed in this project, with two fundamentally distinct strategies under investigation.  In the first of these, a transannular cascade reaction involving an oxa-Michael/aldol/oxa-Michael mechanism will be developed.  In the second project area, a metal-catalyzed [2+2+2] tricycloisomerization reaction will be investigated for generating the 8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane moiety. Two alternative tactics for implementing each of these fundamentally distinctive strategies will be examined.   Specifically, inter- and intramolecular nucleophilic addition by oxygen to initiate the Michael/aldol/Michael cascade will be studied in the first case.  In the [2+2+2] cycloisomerization segment of the project, two catalysts [Rh(I)-Sn(II) and CpRu+] will be evaluated for reactivity and mechanistic profiles. A positive consequence of the bridged polycycle-generating cascade reactions to be developed will be short and versatile synthetic routes to the biologically interesting steroidal alkaloid cortistatin A.  Beyond this, broad adaptability of these methods is anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Steven D. Burke of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Professor Burke's research efforts revolve around the development of methods and strategies for the synthesis of biologically active substances.  Successful development of the methodology proposed will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  It is clear from the current state of organic synthesis that virtually any molecule of interest can be synthesized.  The challenge is to develop synthetic methods that allow for greater efficiency and less waste, while transferring seamlessly from discovery to production scale.  Meeting this challenge necessitates a greater reliance on catalytic processes, whose influence we seek to magnify by development of tandem, cascade, and "one-pot" transformations that introduce multiple functionalities and stereogenic centers with unprecedented brevity.  Rhodium(I)-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylation (AHF) establishes an asymmetric carbon and a versatile aldehyde from alkenes with perfect atom economy, inexpensive reagents and robust catalysts, allowing for the ready functionalization of molecules and opening new opportunities for simplification in complex molecule synthesis.  Previous studies have demonstrated that the AHF conditions tolerate the presence of reagents that "stand-by" until the reactive aldehyde functionality is installed before triggering a secondary reaction in a tandem or cascade fashion. This catalytic methodology affords a powerful and attractive partner to established methods such as aldol, cycloaddition, and allyl transfer reactions, while avoiding reliance upon chiral pool feedstock and stoichiometric auxiliaries.  Our efforts to set new standards of synthetic efficiency by telescoping the power of catalytic transformations, including rhodium(I)-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylation (AHF) were realized in the total syntheses summarized in Table 1.  This summarizes the efficiency comparisons between our published syntheses, developed with the support of two years of support from NSF Award 0848616, and those multiple syntheses published earlier that featured other strategies and methods.  Through incorporation of rhodium(I)-catalyzed hydroformylation, along with novel AHF-based synthetic strategies, we synthesized these natural products with strikingly greater efficiency than all previous attempts.  Novel reaction tandems utilizing the products from AHF were developed to telescope the exquisite control of the Rh(I)-catalyst.
