<AbstractNarration>This award will fund the on going research program of the Wayne State University Elementary Particle Physics group on analyses of the CLEO-c data. The group consists of two faculty, Professors Bonvicini and Cinabro, and three graduate students working towards their PhD degrees. The NSF supported the group participation in the construction and operation of the CLEO detector as well as data taking. This research grant will enable the continuation the group analysis effort and allow them to complete the physics analysis of the CLEO-c data. The Analysis effort concentrate on the studies of three body charm decays using the Dalitz technique, measurements of D D-bar mixing parameters taking advantage of the quantum correlations of the D mesons produced at CLEO, and in rare charm decays. The three graduate students will concentrate on searches for higher order Fock states in rare semi-leptonic D decays and correlated Dalitz plot studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will also support the extensive involvement of the group in undergraduate student's research via an REU/RET program. This program achieves its intrinsic goals of promoting undergraduate and younger student interest in careers in science, technology, and engineering, especially among the under-represented, and making connections with K/12 teachers. The group found that in addition the students and teachers in the program have been able to make a significant contribution to their research effort.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported research into the nature of extreme forms of matter called heavy quarks.  Quarks are the basic building blocks of protons and neutrons that live in the nucleus of all atoms.  Quarks come in different types and all but two of them are very short lived.  Studying the behavior of the heavy quarks give us a glimpse of how the universe works answering basic questions about how it got to be the way it is.  Five graduate students studied the decays of heavy quarks into lighter quarks.  Two of them graduated with PhD's and went on to work in the medical industry.  One is on the verge of getting a PhD, and another on the verge of getting a Masters degree.  These two are both planning to go on to careers in IT.  A fifth graduate student is planning to continue research to her PhD in a few years.  All of these students produced, or will produce, papers in refereed journals adding to our knowledge of the beahvior of the heavy quarks, giving us insight on how things like the proton work, and eventually leading to exploitable technolgies.  Besides the insight we get into how the world works the main product ot this research is trained, research professionals who more often than not go to work in industry rather than continuing on in basic research.  This grant did well in supporting five students on that road.       Last Modified: 09/17/2013       Submitted by: David A Cinabro]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
