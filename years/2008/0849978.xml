<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morehouse College is developing a Pre-engineering Program for 32 students that aligns with the National Academy of Engineering's Engineer of 2020 vision. Engineering principles will supplement basic science studies in engineering relevant fields (e.g. physics, chemistry, computer science and mathematics) through coursework, research, support programs and service projects. With a B.S. degree in the new Morehouse Pre-engineering program, graduates will be able to articulate to graduate engineering programs.  Graduates of the Morehouse pre-engineering program who continue their engineering education in graduate school will possess the leadership, social proclivity and academic breath obtained with a liberal arts degree and the engineering competency of an advanced degree.</AbstractNarration>

This initiative, called the Renaissance Scholarship Program (RSP), was successful in reducing the average unmet financial need of Morehouse students and thereby helped ensure greater persistence to degree in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Students applications were evaluated by a committee composed of STEM faculty members representing all STEM departments in the Division of Math and Science.

Applications were examined carefully to ascertain student interest and proclivity in attending graduate school.       An average of eleven scholarships were awarded over a six year period averaging $6,407 per scholarship.  An obvious benefit of the program is that it will increase the number of underrepresented individuals attending graduate schools.  The primary goal of the program was satisfied.  In fact, the four year graduation rate for the class of 2015 at Morehouse was approximately 34.6%.  However, STEM students who were awarded Renaissance scholarships graduated in four years at a rate of 60.7% Students of course, were monitored and mentored during the course of their matriculation.  In the future we would like to expand this program and improve tracking mechanisms to monitor students as they complete their graduate studies and eventually enter the workforce.
