<AbstractNarration>EEC-0851742&lt;br/&gt;P.I. ? Keith Strevett&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site program at the University of Oklahoma, School of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science (CEES) will engage 10 undergraduate students in research focused around the overall theme of "Sustainable Technology for Infrastructure and the Environment. The research project topics include basic theoretical and laboratory studies of unsaturated soil dynamics which will lead to a more sustainable road design to computer simulation of complete systems such as a bridge-foundation-soil system subjected to man-made (e.g. blast loading) and natural (e.g. earthquake) hazards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research projects, students will be engaged in a series of enrichment activities that will help them become more confident as researchers, including workshops on developing a research project, technical writing, giving effective presentations, graduate school preparation, and ethics in engineering and science. Social activities will be an integral part of the students' experience with the goal of building friendships and collegiality between the students and faculty mentors. At the end of the program, participants will be required to make an oral presentation of their summer work to all faculty and invited colleagues from local agencies. Finally, during the following academic semester at their home institution, participants will give an oral presentation of their summer work at an appropriate forum and submit a final written report to their faculty mentor at the University of Oklahoma. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU program will motivate and prepare undergraduate students to pursue advanced degrees in the critical areas of infrastructure systems. Such engineers are needed in consulting and industry in order to be good stewards of our natural and built environment, and they are needed in research laboratories and academia to further the development of sustainable technologies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
