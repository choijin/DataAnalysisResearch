The Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR) was added to the CA in 2004 and the Wyoming Cloud Lidar (WCL) to CA6 in 2010.  Summary of NSF science projects supported:  During this CA, we flew the UWKA 980 hours of which 80%, averaging 130 hours per year that were directly in support of fourteen NSF project deployments.  With the two additional deployments of the WCR and WCL installed on the NSF/NCAR C-130, we averaged a total of about 3 deployments per year during CA6.  The projects supported are summarized in the attached table.  Broader impacts and Intellectual Merit:  The UWyo has instrumented and operated aircraft for atmospheric research since the 1960's. Faculty members of the Department of Atmospheric Science have been recruited to support a unifying scientific theme: clouds and aerosols.  This has motivated advancements in measurement and data collection systems on the UWKA &ndash; notably the in situ cloud sensor suite, and most recently the multi-beam 95 GHz WCR, and the upward and downward pointing WCLs. These advancements have been provided to the geosciences community at large by their support under the NSF Lower Atmosphere Observing Facility (LAOF) Program.  As an advanced degree?granting institution, there have been and continue to be unique opportunities for students to learn about the principles of observational atmospheric research. Students obtain hands?on experience with aircraft instrumentation, calibrating sensors, and participating in airborne scientific flight planning, flight direction, and data collection. There are also unique opportunities for students to participate in major observational field projects, and in the planning and operational aspects of those projects as well. Several aspects of this deserve special note: - There has been increased involvement of both undergraduate and graduate student involvement in the flight operations themselves, facilitated by our adding an additional seat in the aircraft. About 100 students have been able to participate in research flight missions during CA6, about half of them from institutions outside UWyo. - The presence and accessibility of the UWKA, WCR and WCL in provides unique opportunities undergraduate research, and for advanced degree study in the UWyo Department of Atmospheric Science.

The goal was to make requesting facilities easier and more accessible. - The UWKA staff supported NCAR Advanced Studies Program educational summer colloquium jointly with the NCAR Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL), UWyo Department of Atmospheric Science and Colorado State University (CSU), Department of Atmospheric Science. The colloquium was titled "Exploring the Atmosphere Observational Instruments and Techniques", and was conducted May 31 to June 12, 2009, at NCAR. UWKA staff presented several lectures and hands-on tutorials during this colloquium which attracted 25 top student participants. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
