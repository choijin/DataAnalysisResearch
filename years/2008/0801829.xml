<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to create a nanoscale system that achieves ultra-rapid, high-resolution analysis of biomolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins. The approach is based on a combination of nanopore device fabrication, predictive physics-based diagnostic algorithms to control biomolecule transport in the device, and integration of these subsystems to demonstrate high-speed biomolecule analysis with much higher resolution than currently possible.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses the challenge of developing nucleic acid and protein sequencing platforms that achieve orders-of-magnitude savings in time and cost. This is essential to transform current understanding of the genetic basis of disease and thereby revolutionize many areas of medicine and biotechnology. This work takes an integrated approach to the critical issues of device fabrication and high-performance operation. It combines a wafer-scale process (based on advanced electron-beam and atomic layer deposition techniques) to fabricate the first reproducible arrays of engineered nanopore devices, with a novel computational diagnosis platform that couples hierarchically detailed simulation engines and mathematical algorithms to adaptively refine the nanopore device performance for ?single-nucleotide? resolution.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This program will develop interdisciplinary and diverse science and technology manpower by training three graduate and nine undergraduate students across five engineering and science disciplines, enhanced by collaborations with national laboratories. Three of the undergraduate trainees will be recruited from underrepresented minorities by active collaboration with a campus program for creating research opportunities for underrepresented minorities. The project will develop hands-on modules for undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education courses in circuit diagnosis, nanofabrication, and nanosystems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
