    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this early career development (CAREER) project is to develop a framework for cooperative human-computer Model Updating Cognitive systems (MUCogS). Commonly used numerical modeling techniques, such as finite or boundary elements, provide accurate representations of simple structures, but until data and additional observations are incorporated into these models they often fail to represent the physical parameters of complex existing structures with desirable levels of accuracy. Model updating techniques are used to enhance these numerical models based on experimental data. Current model updating techniques obtain one model that best matches the existing structure by minimizing the error between experimental measurements and data produced by the numerical model. The analyst is limited to the selection of an initial model, adjusting few algorithm parameters or ?knobs? and has little control on the process performed by the algorithm itself. This research changes this paradigm by designing advances algorithms to detect several plausible solutions to the model updating problem. A trained engineer can use his/her engineering judgment to select one or several appropriated models for subsequent analysis. Through this framework MUCogS formally include the analyst on the model updating technique creating a cooperative human-computer system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has direct application in any field of structural engineering that incorporates numerical modeling of existing structures (e.g., earthquake engineering, wind engineering and structural health monitoring). The successful completion of this research will significantly enhance an engineer?s ability to validate innovative designs, evaluate the performance and detect damage of existing structures. This advancement directly impacts state, federal and private budgets dedicated to infrastructure maintenance and replacement. The educational component of this research includes the development of engineering judgment among undergraduate students by nurturing critical thinking through the implementation of inquiry-based teaching in structural engineering classes. The outreach activities focus on exposing urban schools, with a significant population of minority students, to structural engineering. In addition, undergraduate research assistants are included on the research activities during the duration of the project.</AbstractNarration>
