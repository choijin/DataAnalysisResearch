<AbstractNarration>Crocodylia (alligators, gharials, and crocodiles) is one of the major extant reptilian clades.  Therefore,a basic grasp of the structure and function of crocodilian genomes is essential to developing a comprehensive understanding of genome evolution, structure, and function in amniotes.  Furthermore, because the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds, their genomes represent the best group through which we can gain an outside perspective on avian genome evolution and function.  To facilitate comparative genomics and the testing of a variety of hypotheses involving Crocodylia and other amniotes including birds and mammals, this research focuses on (1) investigating crocodilian genome diversity and evolution through detailed analysis of mobile elements (MEs), and (2) providing fundamental information about genome organization, gene synteny and regulatory sequences in three crocodilian species. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of molecular and computational tools, including BAC library construction and analysis, Cot library construction and analysis, and structure/function analyses of the resulting data via GBrowse and GO (Gene Ontology) annotation.  The research will complement and enhance international efforts to understand the genetic underpinnings of genome structure and function by illuminating the impact of mobile elements on genome structure and function in a critical amniote lineage and by providing information on important developmental genes and conserved non-coding elements in the lineage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The research will serve as a focal point for local high school teachers to experience current research in molecular biology and evolution through integration into a functional research laboratory.  The teachers will then be helped in incorporating their new knowledge and experiences into their teaching for the benefit of their students.  The research will also be part of ongoing collaborative partnerships between Mississippi State University and student researchers from local historically black colleges and universities.  Finally, these efforts will inform general aspects of evolution and genomics and highlight crocodilians, organisms of broad public interest. The use of these charismatic megafauna will enhance the public's interest in evolution and genome biology, along with its understanding of both.</AbstractNarration>
