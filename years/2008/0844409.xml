<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the emergence of pathogenic strains of microbes, using Vibrio vulnificus, which is an important bacterial component of the aquatic coastal ecosystem that is abundant in summer months in sea sediment, zooplankton, and molluscs. V. vulnificus is a fish pathogen that causes the disease vibriosis and is an opportunistic pathogen of humans. Many Vibrio species thrive in warmer waters and both their local abundance and their geographic range have expanded in the last decade, as ocean temperatures have increased. Some environmental isolates of V. vulnificus cause severe disease with mortality rates over 50%, but how and why these strains develop is an enigma. This project will apply an array of modern molecular genetic approaches, ranging from phylogeographic analyses to ecological genomics, to advance understanding of the genetic events that allow virulent isolates to emerge and to evaluate the association of such events with climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will advance the still rudimentary understanding of microbial evolution and adaptation to the changing aquatic environment.  It will develop V vulnificus as a model organism for understanding the emergence of pathogenic microbes and the role of global environmental change in this process. This CAREER project includes extensive outreach and educational contributions, including the mentoring and research-based training of many high school and undergraduate students, two PhD students, a post-doctoral researcher, and K-12 teachers. Additionally, a public website will be developed to disseminate research results and other information on Vibrio. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Adaptation for many bacterial species takes the form of acquisition of large genomic regions containing new traits. These new traits allow each species to adapt to their niche in new and different ways. Sialic acids are nine carbon amino sugars that are part of all mucous surfaces. Some bacteria can synthesize sialic acids. In our work, we demonstrated for the first time that the marine species Vibrio vulnificus synthesizes a novel sialic acid variant that it uses to decorate it cell surface. We demonstrated that different bacterial isolates produce different amounts of sialic acid and this affects their survival when associated with a host. We showed that V. vulnificus specially decorates its cell wall with a novel sialic acid variant and loss of sialic acid synthesis makes the organism more sensitive to certain antibiotics. Interestingly and unusually, we also discovered that V. vulnificus can also scavenge another type of sialic acid from its surrounding environment and use it as a nutrient source. Both traits are not universally present among bacteria and in Vibrio species the genes involved were acquired on large genomic islands by horizontal gene transfer. Our work demonstrated the importance on sialic acid metabolism to fitness and survival of Vibrio species. In addition, we found that the utilization of sialic acid as a nutrient source is found in a large number of human commensal species suggesting that this is an important trait for the fitness and survival of the human microbiota. This ability to utilize novel carbon sources allows bacteria to out-compete each other in different environments. We showed that the sialic acid metabolism islands are unstable in the bacterial genome and can excise out. We determined the mechanism of island excision, the first step in their transfer to another species. We demonstrated that a key enzyme excisionase present within an island is promiscuous and have dual-functions. Our data demonstrated that excisionases promote excision of island regions and act as negative transcriptional regulators of integrase &ndash; most likely through binding at the promoter region. We found that precise levels of each component integrase and excisionase are required for excision. We foudn that an excisionase on one island can aid excision of another island.&nbsp;Knowing the mechanism of island excision is important to understanding the evolution and spread of these elements to their non-pathogenic counterparts, and could be useful in predicting the mobility of unknown genetic elements.
