<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for management and support of national networking activities for the Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE).  There are eleven separate Centers within the U.S. that are coordinated via the Central Coordinating Office (CCO). The CCO will be organized by three PI?s; Gail Scowcroft, Associate Director, Office of Marine Programs, University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography will act as the National Network Coordinator (NNC);  Annette deCharon, University of Maine, will organize the development of a national website and support more centralized web development at all Centers; and Dr. Billy Spitzer, New England Aquarium, will help with long-term strategy development and organization of the National Advisory Committee (NAC). This project builds on their prior work as the National Interim Leadership Team, a group that was formed to serve the COSEE Network during a one-year funding hiatus for the existing CCO.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed CCO team will work closely with the National COSEE Council, the NAC, and the NSF Program Officers to address a national gap in the coordination of ocean science education, facilitate communication between the Centers, and improve overall network functioning. The CCO will move the Network forward on a number of key initiatives that strengthen it, reduce duplication, and enhance the overall impact of COSEE. One important role of the CCO is the facilitation of the transfer of best practices between Centers. Site visits will allow the CCO team to investigate activities and products from Centers that might further other Centers? goals. By facilitating such transfers, the CCO provides a unique and useful addition to the current network. Perhaps one of the most significant tasks of the CCO in achieving intellectual merit is to increase the number of ocean scientists who participate in ocean science education and outreach. The CCO plans to annually expand the number of ocean scientist/educator partnerships formed through COSEE activities. Documentation is key to sharing ?lessons learned?; thus CCO deliverables include ?user friendly,? accessible national evaluation database and a national website. The Broader Impacts of this proposal include developing materials and providing support for ocean science educational outreach to the public and to K-12 teachers and students. The CCO will also strive to broaden the participation of under-represented and under-served (U/U) students in the various activities supported by the COSEE network by developing partnerships with U/U groups and professional societies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background  In 2002, the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE) was established to "spark and nurture collaborations among research scientists and educators to advance ocean discovery and make known the vital role of the ocean in the lives of humans." Over more than a decade, COSEE evolved into a well-coordinated national Network with 270 institutional partners.  The COSEE Web Working Group (WWG) was formed in 2007 with the charge of examining "how Centers can work together interactively to make existing/future COSEE information more accessible, engaging and up-to-date." The WWG met regularly to discuss, test, and implement new functionality including an integrated content management system (CMS) and integrated web presence (http://www.cosee.net plus individual CenterÆs URLs).  Major Activities  The COSEE.net website has provided a central hub for the posting of news, events, educational and scientific resources. Site content includes links to all individual Center websites, reports from meetings, workshops and activities, an archive of events and news items, and a database of vetted resources. The site also provides a hub for documentation of Network- and Center-level activities.  Over several years, COSEE.net has grown and evolved to meet the changing needs of the Network. As the Centers conclude their National Science Foundation-funded operations, the Network is transitioning to an independent entity: the Consortium for Ocean Science Exploration and Engagement. After this transition occurs, content created by the original Centers will continue to be hosted on COSEE.net.  Key Outcomes &amp; Specific Objectives  During COSEE.net/CMS development, the following outcomes helped to meet several COSEE objectives:  1. Unified identity across Center sites  The CMS activity also included development of new or revamped websites for eight Centers. These CMS-based websites have a consistent appearance and functionality but maintain their individuality through the use of varying backgrounds, photos, and content. The CMS templates allowed for time-efficient addition of new CentersÆ websites.  2. Central repository for Network documents  An internal repository for COSEE Network documents with password-protected access was created to support the need for documents, image, audio, and visual files to be stored for internal use. The software was upgraded in 2010 to provide easier access and more functionality for COSEE members.  3. Searchable directory of members  To promote collaboration, an online searchable directory of COSEE participants was implemented. The directory includes individualsÆ roles within COSEE, primary professional affiliations, photos, as well as background and contact information.  4. Hub for Center-developed resources  A key feature of the Network website presence was a CMS that provided a means for individual Centers to share resources to COSEE.net. Using this functionality, nearly 250 educational resources have been posted. Visits to these resource pages make up 16% of web traffic on COSEE.net.  5. Ability to post shared Events, News and Blogs  The CMS also provides the means for individual Centers to share events, news, and blog posts to COSEE.net. This stream of up-to-date content on the COSEE.net homepage has fostered broad engagement in COSEE-related activities.  6. Documentation of COSEE effective practices  A key focus of COSEE.net content is describing models of effective practice, which can be replicated beyond the Network. Since 2008, the number of content pages on COSEE.net has grown significantly (484%) to a total of 426 individual pages.  7. Case studies on scientist-educator partnerships  The "COSEE Scientists Making an Impact" section of the website was created in 2013 in to showcase 13 partnerships between educators and ocean scientists. Each case study includes several pages of content, video interviews, and educational resources.  8. COSEE Highlights  In 2014, a new section was publish...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
