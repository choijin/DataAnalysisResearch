<AbstractNarration>This EES Program builds upon the successful NSF-funded Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) Program. This scholars program provides financial and academic support to first-year engineering students and new transfer students from two year community colleges who are academically qualified and have unmet financial need, with special consideration given to women, racial/ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities. The fundamental objectives of EES are to increase: (1) the number of talented students with financial need earning undergraduate engineering degrees; (2) the number of underrepresented students earning undergraduate engineering degrees; and (3) the retention and graduation rates of students earning undergraduate engineering degrees. EES Fellows will have access to a specific set of support programs, called the EES Community, designed to support and enhance their academic success. EES Fellows will participate in academic advising and EES seminars focusing on professional and academic development and career planning.</AbstractNarration>
