<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;In recent years the ubiquity of microbial communities in nature has become apparent. For example, bacterial surface-associated communities, biofilms, are the most common mode of bacterial growth and are oftentimes resistant to environmental stress or antimicrobial treatment. However, it is still not clear how individual cells self-organize into these communities and how a community as a whole responds to environmental cues. This project aims to discover the mechanisms of self-organization in dynamic single-species biofilms (swarms).  In these swarms, bacteria display collective surface motility, cooperatively sense the environment, execute collective developmental programs, and often differentiate into distinct cell types that perform specialized functions. Research on mechanisms of biofilm formation addresses questions similar to those in developmental biology; connecting macroscopic phenotypes and biochemical pathways in individual cells. Even when the genome composition of the cells is known, relating mutations affecting emergent spatio-temporal patterns to mechanisms of intercellular signaling and motility remains a challenge. Decoding these mechanisms from phenotypic observations is a complex reverse-engineering problem that cannot be solved solely by traditional experimental research. A complementary approach combining agent-based modeling and biostatistical image quantification with experimentation will address this problem. This research focuses on self-organization in spreading or aggregating biofilms formed by Myxococcus xanthus, an important model organism for studying microbial cooperation, development, and collective motility. This bacterium uses two motility systems and multiple sensory and signaling pathways to move over surfaces, forming a variety of population patterns. These patterns reveal motility coordination of individual cells as well as their ability to collectively sense and respond to environmental cues. This project will develop an approach to decode diverse phenotypes and uncover intercellular interactions using mathematical models that mimic experimentally observed patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project include the development of new methods that bridge gaps between subcellular, cellular, and multicellular scales in spreading bacterial biofilms. Despite the focus on a specific model system (M. xanthus), the project will elucidate general mechanisms behind collective motility behavior. More than 50 bacterial genera use surface motility to form various types of dynamic biofilms, and many of these are important in industry. The methods and software developed for this project will be made available to the Myxobacteria research community worldwide. Developed tools and results of the research will be incorporated into a M. xanthus model organism database (xanthusBase) based on Wikipedia principles of community participation. Answering complex biological questions in the post-genomic era will require a new generation of life scientists with cross-disciplinary training in combining experimental and computational methods. To broaden the impact of this project, the PI seeks to improve and expand Systems Biology education on various levels, attract a diverse pool of talented students to the field of computational and systems biosciences, and contribute significantly to their training.  The cornerstone of the educational component of this project is training  for postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school teachers and their students.  In addition the training includes a plan for outreach to include students from members of underrepresented groups.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes  Is it possible that "one plus one would be greater than two"? The answer is "No" for basic arithmetic but "Yes" when you deal with the systems of interacting agents in which the whole becomes larger than the sum of its parts. Such systems are studied by a wide range of science and engineering fields, e.g. social scientists and economists studying human behavior, civil engineers investigating the development of traffic jams on roads, ecologists investigating ecosystems, and cellular biologists researching intercellular signaling. In this award we investigated the interactions that allow a population of soil-dwelling predatory bacteria Myxococcus xanthus to self-organize into highly dynamic multicellular structures. The results summarized below show that for such complex problems quantitative approaches such as computer modeling and statistical image analysis can complement traditional experiential biology approaches and lead to new biological insights.  1.      Mechanics matter  Traditionally, investigation of collective behavior of bacterial cells have been focused on the biological and biochemical details i.e. specific genes activated when cells are together, intercellular molecules allowing cells to communicate, signaling molecules on one cell surface activate other cells on contact. But what about physical or mechanical interactions of cells? Using biophysical models that simulate mechanical behavior of individual cells we investigated how physical interactions among model cells affect the observed behaviors. By comparing our model results with experimental data, we were able to uncover the basis of individual cell movement from pairwise interactions between cells as front part of one cell bumps into the side of another. Using a similar approach, we were able to reverse-engineer that physical interactions between cells and underlying surface are essential for rod-shaped cells to align their directions and collectively move together.  2.      The how and why of making waves  One of the most visually mysterious examples of self-organization in Myxococcus xanthus is the emergence of traveling waves swiping through a population of millions of bacterial cells. In these waves cell density periodically changes in space and time &ndash; high cell-density crests are separated by low cell-density troughs. We developed a computer simulation with thousands of cells to study this phenomenon and compared our results with the experiments performed in our collaboratorsÆ labs. Our work not only uncovered the set of basic intercellular interactions that are responsible for these waves but also showed that formation of these waves helps cells to be better predators.  3.      æIt is better to know nothing than to know what ain't soÆ (Josh Billings)  The expression "A picture is worth a thousand words" is commonly used. But arguably to capitalize on this worth we need methods to extract thousands of numbers from each picture and then use statistics to draw meaningful conclusions from these numbers. We use this approach to test the mechanism of cell aggregation in M. xanthus. Ability of M. xanthus cells to come together forming aggregates with 100,000 fellow cells when food is scarce is critical for its lifecycle. The process of aggregation is highly dynamic and researchers have been accumulating a lot of microscopy images illustrating this process. Nevertheless, the mechanism of cell aggregation still remains elusive. As a step to uncover this mechanism, our group developed algorithms to automatically extract quantitative data from each image and used statistical methods to test several leading hypothetical mechanisms of aggregation. The results show that none of these mechanisms really consistent with the experimental observations and something else is going on. Therefore, new theories consistent with our image analysis results need to be developed and our next NSF-funded project would aim to formulate these.  4.      Educat...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
