<AbstractNarration> The Utah Museum of Natural History (UMNH) holds scientific research collections of more than 71,000 specimens of vertebrate animals (mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians). There has been steady growth and expanding use of these collections, and the present museum facility is no longer adequate. UMNH is constructing a new $103M building that will include climate-controlled collection storage and new research laboratories. This project will fund new collection storage cabinets and shelving, a freezer for storing the vertebrate tissue collection, and will support moving the vertebrate collections to the new facility.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; The UMNH vertebrate collections are international in scope, but emphasize the biologically rich Intermountain Region of the western USA. As a primary resource on regional biodiversity, they are used by scientists, resource managers, educators and students at all levels. They support scientific research on an expanding range of topics. Their historical depth provides insight into how climate change and shifting land-use practices have altered animal communities in this region. The collections form the basis for museum exhibits and public programs on regional natural history and scientific research, emphasizing the relevance of historical collections to current resource management and conservation. This project will augment all of these activities through improvements in collection storage, maintenance and accessibility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported a project to create new facilities for the vertebrate zoology research collections of the Utah Museum of Natural History (now the Natural History Museum of Utah) at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The collections include more than 80,000 specimens and associated data for vertebrate species (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals), principally from Utah and surrounding states but also from many other regions including Central America, Australia, and Southeast Asia. The collections constitute one of the most important sources of information on vertebrate biodiversity in the intermountain region of the western US. Because they have a deep history of more than a century they provide valuable insights into how natural communities have changed with the passage of time, a topic of increasing importance given recent concerns about climate change. The collections include specimens prepared in various ways for different purposes. While this greatly expands the range of research uses, it also presents management challenges. Some specimens are preserved whole in formaldehyde solution and stored in alcohol. These present health and safety concerns requiring adequate ventilation in laboratories and storage areas with enhanced fire detection and suppression systems. Many specimens are prepared dry as study skins and/or skeletons. These must be stored under appropriate temperature and humidity conditions and protected from damaging light and insect pests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>Until recently, the collections were housed in an older building with limited and inadequate environmental controls and facilities.

In 2008, the University started construction of a new museum building which opened to the public in November 2011. The new building includes expanded collection space with optimal storage environments and excellent research laboratory facilities. NSF funds from this award and matching institutional funds were used to purchase new storage equipment for the vertebrate collections (specimen cabinets and shelving), more than doubling storage space and providing room for continued collection growth for many decades. Because conditions in the old building provided poor protection from insect pests, all dry specimens and other organic materials that were prone to pest infestation needed to be rendered pest-free before they could be installed in the new building. This was done through &ldquo;cryo-fumigation&rdquo;, a process that uses rapidly reduced temperature and&nbsp; storage for several days below freezing to kill any potential pests without resorting to hazardous chemical poisons.
