    <AbstractNarration>Goldsztein&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807269&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this project is to develop mathematical tools&lt;br/&gt;for the understanding and prediction of the behavior and&lt;br/&gt;properties of heterogeneous materials. In these studies, the&lt;br/&gt;length scale of the heterogeneity is generally much smaller than&lt;br/&gt;the size of the material. The particular problems considered&lt;br/&gt;here are the transport of solute and heat in porous media and the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the flow within poroelastic materials due to&lt;br/&gt;time dependent applied loads. The particular mathematical&lt;br/&gt;techniques to be used include asymptotic and homogenization&lt;br/&gt;methods, numerical simulations and modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The problems studied here are motivated by applications of&lt;br/&gt;scientific and technological interest. Examples where solute&lt;br/&gt;transport in porous media plays an important role, and thus the&lt;br/&gt;results of this project have an impact, include: the transport of&lt;br/&gt;contaminants in soils, the transport of nutrients in bones, the&lt;br/&gt;intrusion of salt in fresh water in soils near ocean coasts,&lt;br/&gt;movement of minerals (e.g. fertilizers) in soils, recovery&lt;br/&gt;techniques in oil reservoirs, etc. Heat transport in porous&lt;br/&gt;media plays an important role in the transport of reactive&lt;br/&gt;solutes in rocks and soils (the reactions produce heat and the&lt;br/&gt;transport of that heat is coupled with the fate of the solutes,&lt;br/&gt;nuclear waste is included here), solar receivers, building&lt;br/&gt;thermal insulation materials, fuel cells and drying technology. &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, while flow within poroelastic materials occurs in&lt;br/&gt;many systems such as soils and rocks, a main motivation of the&lt;br/&gt;project is the transport of nutrients in bones and the stresses&lt;br/&gt;generated by the flow within bone, which are believed to play a&lt;br/&gt;role in the remodeling of the bone (i.e. change of bone shape and&lt;br/&gt;size due to gain and loss of bone mass in different regions of&lt;br/&gt;the bone).</AbstractNarration>
