<AbstractNarration>This Small Grant for Exploratory Research award supports fundamental research of a rapid flash conversion process that can reduce graphite oxide to graphene by simply exposing it to a pulsed light source such as a camera flash.  Graphite oxide is the most promising precursor for bulk production of graphene and has caught wide interest in both academic and industrial researches in the past few years.  Conversion of graphite oxide to graphene has relied on either chemical treatments that often requires highly toxic reagents such as hydrazine, or high temperature annealing under controlled atmospheres.  This brings many processing disadvantages and limits the applications of graphene materials.  A rapid light based process should have great advantage because it is chemical free, energy efficient, and allows site specific ?photo surgery? to modify local areas on the material using a photo-mask.  Deliverables include demonstration of rapid flash conversion of graphite oxide to graphene, documentation of material characterization results, and proof of concept demonstration of using flash conversion to pattern graphene materials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results from this research will advance the knowledge and understanding, and create enabling techniques for the manufacturing and processing of the graphite oxide/graphene materials.  It can catalyze advances in many areas including electronics, polymer composite, sensors and actuators.  Results from the proposed research will be disseminated for teaching and outreach activities, too.  When cutting edge research discoveries are made using a consumer camera flash, it should naturally catch wide public interest.  It will be used to raise public awareness of science and engineering, and engage students, especially women those from underrepresented groups.  New science projects and demonstrations based on the results will be designed for the middle schools in the Chicago area through the already established outreach channels.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
