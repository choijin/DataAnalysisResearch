<AbstractNarration>Spatial and temporal data are critical components in many applications. &lt;br/&gt;This is especially true in analytical applications ranging from scientific &lt;br/&gt;discovery to national security and criminal investigation. This exploratory &lt;br/&gt;research develops of new methods for modeling and querying spatial, temporal &lt;br/&gt;and thematic (STT) data. The methods differ significantly from traditional&lt;br/&gt;approaches for STT data management; they follow a paradigm that goes beyond &lt;br/&gt;querying for resources to querying about the relationships between resources.&lt;br/&gt;Three STT data management advances this will lead to are: &lt;br/&gt;(1) new query operators that exploit the graph-centric nature &lt;br/&gt;of Semantic Web data models, (2) new indexing and query processing &lt;br/&gt;techniques for STT data that are specialized for Semantic Web data models &lt;br/&gt;and (3) an extension of the SPARQL RDF query language to support STT queries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second aspect of this project is to compare the STT-RDF &lt;br/&gt;approach described above with an alternative approach based on OWL-DL &lt;br/&gt;and qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. This exploratory &lt;br/&gt;study evaluates whether the STT-RDF analytics approach provides a &lt;br/&gt;more efficient and expressive query language than the &lt;br/&gt;OWL-DL approach with space-time ontology. Specifically, &lt;br/&gt;(1) for the queries that can be encoded in both the formalisms, &lt;br/&gt;is the former implementation more efficient? and (2) are there &lt;br/&gt;queries that can be formulated in the STT-RDF analytics formalism&lt;br/&gt;that cannot be expressed as OWL-DL queries? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this project, special attention is given to&lt;br/&gt;repeatability of experimental results. All code will be open source, &lt;br/&gt;and all benchmarks, datasets and ontologies will be available &lt;br/&gt;through the project web site at&lt;br/&gt;http://knoesis.wright.edu/research/semweb/projects/stt/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Analytical applications are increasingly exploiting complex relationships among named entities as a powerful analytical tool. Such "connect-the-dots" applications are common in many domains including national security, drug discovery, and medical informatics. Semantic Web technologies are well suited for this type of analysis. It is often necessary that the analysis process spans across multiple heterogeneous data sources, and ontologies and semantic metadata standards help facilitate aggregation and integration of this content. Furthermore, many event centric situations involve spatial, temporal and thematic elements.  A key objective of this research was to develop advanced spatio-temporal-thematic query processing framework which led to the development of query operators and query language extensions to more naturally and comprehensively express queries involving complex relationships, and the algorithms to process them.  This research also evaluated expressiveness of two alternative query representations, and showed how one approach favored by the community is not powerful enough for expressing certain queries.   Use of background knowledge is often key to deeper analysis. This research saw unique opportunity to tap into the power of the Linked Open Data (LOD), which grew from about 5 billion facts (triples) to over 25 billion triples during the course of this research.  However LOD consists of large number of weakly connected ontologies -- islands of information from typically high quality sources and expressed in rich semantic web framework. Alignment of these ontologies (i.e., interlinking and integration) is key to exploiting the knowledge it represents.  Correspondingly, this research developed powerful techniques and tools for ontology alignment, which were demonstrated to be best in the class. The ontology alignment work can serve as the foundation for convenient querying of large collections of linked data by non-computer specialists and for developing comprehensive applications that use structured and semi-structured information from a variety of sources and domains in LOD such as medical knowledge and public government data.   This project resulted in a comprehensive array of outcomes, including (a) education and training of undergraduate and graduate students including introductory and advanced classes that integrated this research, several invited/keynote talks at international conferences/meetings, and support for undergraduates and graduate theses/dissertations (undergraduate involvement was facilitated by REU supplement), (b) 20 publications including several in  high quality and highly selective venues, (c) collaborations and interactions with a large as well as a small company involving student internships and knowledge transfer for potential commercial exploitation, (d) release of at least five public datasets (accessible from the project's web site) and an open source ontology alignment tool for use by the research community and supporting repeatability and comparison of research outcomes, and (e) participation in and inputs to Semantic Web related standards activities within the World Wide Web consortium.  Subsequent proposals and funds will enable further advancement and application of research initiated in this project.
