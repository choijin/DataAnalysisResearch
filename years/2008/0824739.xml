<AbstractNarration>The specific interaction of the ribosome with the nascent peptide plays an important role in the regulation of expression of bacterial and eukaryotic genes. The molecular mechanisms of sensing the sequence of the nascent peptides and the mechanics of the ribosome response are poorly understood. Furthermore, the generality of the nascent peptide-mediated regulation of gene expression is unknown. The main aim of the project is to identify new bacterial genes regulated by ribosome stalling and to better understand the stalling mechanisms. In the first aim of the proposal, ribosomal elements which are universally involved in the stalling response will be identified. The mutants deficient in stalling will be then used in a whole-cell proteomics screen for genes whose expression is affected by altered ribosome stalling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study are expected to illuminate one of the basic aspects of protein synthesis. The anticipated findings may also have important practical implications and can open new venues for regulating gene expression in bacterial and eukaryotic cells for biotechnological and medical purposes. The study will be closely integrated with teaching activities. Undergraduate, professional and graduate students will be involved in research. All efforts will be made to continue engaging underrepresented minorities in experimental research. The results of the study will be disseminated to the general public through press releases, UIC podcasts, and public lectures.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

We discovered that the ability of the ribosome to recognize specific proteins can be affected by small molecules, including the molecules of antibiotics. Because of that, the ribosome can "sense" not only the presence of a specific protein, but also the presence of small molecules. As the result of our studies, we have a much better view of how the ribosome operates, how antibiotic resistance genes are regulated and how some medically important antibiotics work. This new knowledge expand our understanding of the key molecular mechanisms of life and will help to develop better drugs to treat serious diseases.
