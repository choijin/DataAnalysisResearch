<AbstractNarration>Global climate is predicted to change dramatically in the 21st century with warmer temperatures and more extreme climate events expected over most land areas. The consequences of these changes may include shifts in the geographical range of animal and plant species, including many species of trees.  Models developed to predict plant and animal response to climate change often do not consider the importance of genetic variation within members of a species or the interactions of that species with other organisms, which could slow or hasten distribution shifts.  This study tests the hypothesis that the ultimate effect of climate change on a tree species and its associated community will result from the interplay between the responses of different tree genotypes to both climate stresses and to the herbivores, competitors and mutualists with which the trees interact.  Specifically, this research examines the influence of genetic variation in resistance and susceptibility to insect herbivory on tree responses to drought as mediated by interactions with shrubs that compete with trees for water and soil fungi that enhance uptake of soil resources.  The project involves population genetic analysis, and field, common garden and greenhouse studies of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), a widespread tree particularly sensitive to climate change.  The broader impacts of this project include student training with an emphasis on recruitment of underrepresented minorities, student exchanges between Mexican and US institutions, education of prisoners through the Arizona Department of Corrections and outreach to managers whose lands are dominated by pinyon pine suffering high mortality.</AbstractNarration>

We found that insect resistant and insect susceptible pinyon pines differed dramatically in their response to climate change; insect susceptible trees were surprisingly drought tolerant as their survival and growth during drought was much greater than that of their resistant neighbors.  These survival and growth traits were passed on to their offspring, which also survived and grew better in a large simulated drought experiment conducted in nature. Susceptible trees fathered more seedlings than their resistant neighbors, due largely to greater pollen production. Greenhouse experiments demonstrated that beneficial soil fungi were important contributors to the differential growth of resistant versus susceptible seedlings.

Differences between the growth of seedlings from resistant versus susceptible mothers were particularly dramatic in low moisture conditions, consistent with observations of natural populations of adult trees over a twenty year period.  The soil fungi associated with susceptible trees have been identified through DNA analysis and analysis of the sporocarps (mushrooms) they produce as a new species, now named Geopora pinyonensis.  Our results indicate that genetic variation within a species is extremely important to the climate change response of P. edulis.  In addition, just as there is increasing recognition that the microbes assocated with humans are important to their health, our work shows that the microbes associated with plants can be critical to their growth and survival in response to a drying and warming climate.

Several additional NAU undergraduate students received training, and instructors from tribal and community colleges joined our research team during two summers.
