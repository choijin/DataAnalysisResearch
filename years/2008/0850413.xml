<AbstractNarration>This work will produce a stratigraphic template of Pleistocene climate change in the North Atlantic over the past 3 million years. Working with colleagues in the UK, the PI will generate and correlate high-resolution stable isotope and paleo-magnetic intensity records along a proximal to distal transect from the mouth of the Labrador Sea across the belt of detritus left by ancient ice-rafting events in the North Atlantic. The project will document millennial-scale variability in ice-rafting, ocean circulation, and geomagnetic properties with the goal of addressing important questions about the evolution of the Earth's climate during a critical period of transition (the mid-Pleistocene transition) and mechanisms for abrupt climate change. In addition, the results will provide a stratigraphic framework for the broader scientific community studying climate change in the North Atlantic. Further broader impacts of this work include international partnership and student exchange with NERC-funded UK scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The interpretation of the climate archive in marine sediments over the last ~ 3 million years is of paramount importance in climate research. The complex interaction of the atmosphere, ice sheets, and ocean circulation, in a warming world characterized by elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, can only be understood through the climate archive preserved in marine sediments.  The documentation of the evolution of the planet from the Pliocene warm period prior to 3 million years before present, characterized by atmospheric CO2 values similar to today, through the development of Northern Hemisphere glacial-interglacial cycles with lower than present atmospheric CO2 values, is critically important to predictions of our climate future.     In 2004, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 303 to the North Atlantic provided unique (~300 m long) drill cores from regions characterized by relatively elevated sedimentation rates. Considerable care was taken to recover complete sedimentary sections by drilling multiple holes at each site, by careful shipboard analysis of the recovered cores.  Under this project, we have measured and analyzed environmental records from these cores, with special emphasis on the stratigraphy, meaning the correlation of these sedimentary records to other sedimentary records from around the globe and the generation of timescales.     Why is stratigraphy (correlation and timescale) important?  The ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica have provided us with some of the most important climate records, partly because the age control associated with ice cores has particularly high resolution allowing assessment of leads-and-lags in the climate system.  Ice-cores, however, are restricted to Greenland and Antarctica and do not extend far back in time. One of the major challenges in ocean and climate science is to generate stratigraphies (correlations) in marine cores that rival the stratigraphic resolution available from ice cores.  This project has applied new methods of stratigraphy to marine sediments, utilizing a combination of two global signals: (1) relative paleointensity (RPI) of the geomagnetic field and (2) oxygen isotope data that are sensitive to the amount of fresh water (including ice) stored on the continents in the past.  We have used so-called ætandemÆ correlation of these global signals, recorded in the North Atlantic sediment cores, in order to provide enhanced age models.  As a result, we have improved the time control on North Atlantic marine sediment records, and provided new high-resolution sedimentary reference records.  The improved time control has led to the detection (through time-series analysis) of important mode transitions in the behavior of the North Atlantic since the onset of Northern Hemisphere glacial-interglacial cycles, some 3 million years ago.
