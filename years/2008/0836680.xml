<AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled NUE: Development of the NanoEngineering Minor Option (NEMO) at the University of Houston (UH), under the direction of Dr. Dmitri Litvinov, will introduce nanoscale science, engineering, and technology through a variety of interdisciplinary approaches into undergraduate education.  The proposed program will integrate and expand the existing nanotechnology courses into a comprehensive nanoengineering program. The impact and associated outcomes of this program is in training engineers who will be prepared for the challenges of the emerging nannotechnology job sector.</AbstractNarration>
