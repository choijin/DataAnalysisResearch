<AbstractNarration>Cyber threats have escalated rapidly over the past decade. "Zero-day&lt;br/&gt;attacks" have become significant, delivered increasingly through&lt;br/&gt;seemingly innocuous means such as web pages, images, and documents.&lt;br/&gt;Malware is rampant, being installed surreptitiously on millions of&lt;br/&gt;computers around the world using a combination of spam, phishing,&lt;br/&gt;malicious shareware and freeware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's defenses use techniques such as signature-based scanning and&lt;br/&gt;file integrity monitoring to detect the presence of malware, and then&lt;br/&gt;remove them. Unfortunately, clever adversaries can quickly develop&lt;br/&gt;malware that conceals itself from these detection mechanisms, and&lt;br/&gt;hence defeat such reactive defenses. In contrast, this project will&lt;br/&gt;develop an approach that dramatically improves defenses against&lt;br/&gt;malware, and put a computer owner back in control over the&lt;br/&gt;attackers. This approach, based on synthesizing and enforcing&lt;br/&gt;low-level information flow properties from generic high level&lt;br/&gt;policies, will be used to identify components of a computer system&lt;br/&gt;that are critical for its trustworthiness, and preserve their&lt;br/&gt;integrity. In doing so, the approach will enable users to continue to&lt;br/&gt;use popular operating systems, applications, and add-on software, while still&lt;br/&gt;assuring system security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will develop techniques to protect (a) the OS&lt;br/&gt;and critical applications from untrusted code or data, (b) critical&lt;br/&gt;applications from modules and extensions (e.g., browser plug-ins and media&lt;br/&gt;player codecs) that run within the same address space, and (c) the OS kernel&lt;br/&gt;from damage due to untrusted kernel extensions such as device drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, this project will train several graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, the research will be integrated into the teaching activities of&lt;br/&gt;the PIs, and finally, the solutions developed will be distributed as&lt;br/&gt;open-source software and/or tools.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
