<AbstractNarration>Eicken 0856867&lt;br/&gt;University of Alaska Fairbanks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to build on activities of the Seasonal Ice Zone Observing Network (SIZONet). SIZONet Phase I led to the development of the sea-ice system services (SISS) concept, describing societal benefits (and potentially negative impacts) derived from the ice cover. By assessing the nature and extent of SISS, the PIs are able to build a sea-ice observing network that is responsive to the needs of both the scientific community and key stakeholders. SIZONet builds on collaboration with several international partners, and spans the entire latitudinal extent of the Arctic seasonal ice zone (SIZ). Based on common protocol and coordinated observation strategies developed in the context of an international working group led by the project team, SIZONet Phase II refines and narrows the scope of the project and focuses on sustaining core observations. The aim is to provide data and information to scientists and stakeholders that: (1) address the most urgent information needs identified by the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) and related efforts; (2) meet sea-ice user information needs, centering on access, use of ice as a platform, and ice as coastal hazard and regulator of coastal erosion; (3) contribute to development of down-scaling approaches for climate modeling and remote sensing; and (4) are directly tied to SISS, allowing existing collaborations to grow into partnerships that can help track and predict Arctic environmental change and meet long-term information needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations include shore-based and drift-ice measurements of ice motion, key mass-balance variables and critical snow and ice properties such as albedo, as well as airborne ice thickness and property surveys. Measurements in coastal ice, of greatest interest to key stakeholders, include hydrographic moorings, survey measurements and integration of satellite imagery. Local ice observations and joint ice-trail mapping provide a link between sea-ice geophysics and indigenous sea-ice expertise. All SIZONet data is ingested into an archival and dissemination system linked to the Alaska Ocean Observing System, the Geographic Information Network of Alaska, and the Cooperative Arctic Data and Information System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We have recently witnessed significant changes in all aspects of the Arctic marine environment, the most striking of which is the rapid loss of summer sea ice and the ongoing transformation of the year-round ice pack toward a seasonal state. The primary goal of SIZONet has been the acquisition, archival and dissemination of datasets describing the key properties of the seasonal ice zone during this transition with a focus on the Pacific Arctic sector. Over 50 such datasets are listed under the project at NSF&rsquo;s Arctic Data Center. These have been used by members of the SIZONet reaserch team and other scientists in over 40 peer-reviewed scientific publications as well as for validation of remote sensing and model development. Some of the key findings from research using SIZONet data include:</p> <p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the maximum annual thickness of landfast sea ice at Barrow has decreased by an average of 2 cm per year since the year 2000 (see Figure 1). Moreover, since 2014 the landfast ice has started thinning over 3 weeks earlier than at any time during the previous 14 years &nbsp;&ndash; a shift that is associated with early-season bottom ice melt and has implications for the biological coupling between the sea ice cover and the underlying ocean.</p> <p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at Utqiagvik and other coastal Alaska sites, shorefast ice stability has been reduced substantially in the past two decades, impacting ice use by coastal communities. These changes are driven by a combination of factors, including loss of multiyear ice and destabilization of coastal ice by strong currents and advection of warm water.</p> <p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accurate measurements of sea ice thickness in late winter can significantly improve seasonal forecasts of summertime sea ice extent, though that snow-depth anomalies can also be a substantial factor in determining uncertainty of predictions.</p> <p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp; Airborne electromagnetic surveys provided the first measurements of grounded sea ice thickness on Hanna Shoal, finding the ice to be over 30 m thick and underscoring its significance for marine mammal habitat and as a maritime hazard (Figure 2).</p> <p>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp; anomalous sea-ice conditions around St Lawrence Island have a strong influence on the number of favorable days for subsistence hunting activities and are therefore likely to affect local food security.</p> <p>In addition to their use by other scientists, SIZONet data have been utilized by federal agencies, private sector companies and local residents in Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow). Water-depth measurements made at the SIZONet sea ice mass balance site floating landfast ice near&nbsp; Utqia?vik have been used by NOAA to assess performance of a temporary tide gauge, data from which will directly improve navigational safety in nearshore waters. Data from SIZONet airborne sea ice thickness surveys have also been used by a number of private sector companies for assessments of bottomfast ice distribution, evaluation of hazardous ice at Hanna Shoal and validation of emerging sensor technologies for detecting sea ice hazards. However, it is the residents and local organizations of Utqiagvik who have made most immediate use of SIZONet data. Subsistence hunters have used real-time sea level and ice thickness data from the mass balance site together with imagery from the webcam and coastal radar to help assess the safety of landfast ice. Members of the Barrow Whaling Captains Association, the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission and the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management have incorporated SIZONet observations in the context of co-management of marine mammals, while the North Slope Borough School District have used SIZONet data to develop curriculum materials jointly with researchers from our team.</p> <p>In addition to the datasets and findings described above, SIZONet has also helped build scientific capacity within Alaska Arctic coastal communities through the involvement of local experts at all key stages of planning, observation, dissemination and analysis. This is a legacy that will strengthen local efforts to adapt to and mitigate against the impacts of Arctic change and build bridges for future community-based research. One such link is currently being developed through the translation of the SIZONet community sea ice observations protocol and database interface for use by Greenland coastal communities.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/02/2017<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;Mahoney</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0856867/0856867_10027683_1490989316583_MaxIceThickness_Timing_2000-2016--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0856867/0856867_10027683_1490989316583_MaxIceThickness_Timing_2000-2016--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sea ice thickness and melt onset changes at Utkiagvik (formerly Barrow)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0856867/0856867_10027683_1490989316583_MaxIceThickness_Timing_2000-2016--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sea ice thickness and melt onset changes at Utkiagvik (formerly Barrow)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: a) Annual maximum sea ice thickness measured at the SIZONet mass balance site on landfast ice near Utkiagvik (formerly Barrow) b) Timing of onset of thinning of landfast sea ice.
