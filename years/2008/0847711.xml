<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0847711        PI: Guelcher, Scott              ORG: Vanderbilt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  CAREER: Bioactive Weight-Bearing Bone/Polymer Composites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  A common location of disabling fractures occurs in the vertebral bodies of the spine, accompanied by painful spinal instability and pronounced bowing of the spine.  Injectable poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cements stabilize compression fractures in vertebral bodies and restore support to the spine.  However, PMMA cements can induce tissue necrosis arising from high polymerization temperatures, and can promote bone resorption near the implant/bone interface due to stress-shielding.  Consequently, a physiological alternative to existing materials is needed that: (1) has biomechanical properties comparable to those of trabecular bone to stabilize the fracture and minimize stress-shielding, (2) is administered by minimally invasive surgical techniques, and (3) actively participates in the healing process by integrating with recipient bone and remodeling.  Composites comprising mineralized allograft bone particles (MBPs) and resorbable thermoplastic polymers have mechanical properties comparable to trabecular bone and actively participate in the healing process.  However, these biomaterials are fabricated by compression-molding at elevated temperatures and therefore cannot be injected.  To overcome these limitations, a family of composites comprising MBPs and resorbable polyurethane (PUR) networks will be designed and developed.  They are processed as reactive liquids at ambient temperature and cure in situ at 37 C, which renders them suitable for injection.  Reactive liquid molding also enables control over binding between the polymer and both the reinforcing MBPs and host trabecular bone, thus strengthening the implant after cure.  Dynamic mechanical, compression, bending, and rheological properties will be measured.  Remodeling of the composites will be investigated in vitro in a co-culture model of osteoblasts and osteoclast-like cells.  A key component of the project will focus on establishing relationships governing the effects of the bone-polymer interfacial structure on mechanical properties and in vitro remodeling of the composites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:    The project will integrate research and education through activities aligned with the goals of the Vanderbilt School for Science and Math (VSSM) and the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE).  The VSSM, a part-time high school located on Vanderbilt campus and dedicated to public school students grades 9-12, is a joint venture with Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS).  In conjunction with core instructors at the VSSM, the PI will develop grade-appropriate (e.g., 9-12) curriculum components incorporating biomaterials, regenerative medicine, and bioprocess engineering.  Scientific knowledge discovered during the execution of the project will also be disseminated through the development of two required undergraduate courses: Introduction to Engineering and Bioprocess Engineering.  Both courses will be developed to support recent changes to the undergraduate curriculum in the PI?s home department (CBE).  Additionally, through research assistantships, graduate, undergraduate, and high school (through the School for Science and Math) students will gain experience in the design, synthesis, and characterization of biomaterials for bone regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Currently, no bone grafts are available that have sufficient strength to stabilize the fracture while actively healing to form new bone.  Development of biologically active grafts with bone-like strength would therefore improve treatment of weight-bearing fractures. The overall objective of this grant application was to design injectable, settable, and resorbable bone grafts with initial bone-like strength that degrade and are replaced by new bone.   To accomplish our goals, we fabricated poly(ester urethane)/ceramic composites using allograft bone, calcium phosphate, and bioactive glass as the ceramic component.  We found that interfacial bonding between the poly(ester urethane) and ceramic phases dramatically increases the mechanical properties of the composite.  When caprolactone was polymerized on the surface of bioactive glass particles, the fatigue life of the composites was increased by a factor of ten compared to non-polymerized bioactive glass particles. Poly(ester urethane)/bioactive glass composites supported new bone formation in preclinical models of bone regeneration.   We also designed novel poly(thioketal urethane)s that degrade by cell-secreted reactive oxygen species.  Poly(thioketal urethane) is stable in water, but degrades in the presence of reactive oxygen species secreted by infiltrating cells. Thus, poly(thioketal urethane) offers advantages to poly(ester urethane) due to its greater stability in water.  When combined with calcium phosphate ceramic particles, PTKUR composites supported new bone formation and healing in preclinical models of bone regeneration.   Composite bone grafts developed under this award are currently being tested in weight-bearing bone defects in a large animal preclinical model.  Preliminary findings reveal that the grafts stabilize the defects and integrate with host bone at early time points.  Long-term studies are currently ongoing to demonstrate that the grafts will stabilize the bone defects throughout all stages of healing. We have partnered with a biomedical device company to pursue additional preclinical testing and development.  If successful, the composite bone grafts could transform the clinical management of weight-bearing bone fractures.
