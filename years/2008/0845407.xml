<AbstractNarration>NSF Proposal #0845407&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Theory and Application of Small-Sample Error Estimation in Genomic Signal Processing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Ulisses Braga-Neto&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genomic Signal Processing (GSP) is the engineering discipline that&lt;br/&gt;studies modeling and statistical issues related to biological signals&lt;br/&gt;measured by high-throughput technology, such as gene-expression&lt;br/&gt;microarrays or protein-abundance mass spectrometry. Research in GSP&lt;br/&gt;typically involve the discovery of reliable molecular markers for&lt;br/&gt;disease diagnosis and prognosis, using pattern recognition or machine&lt;br/&gt;learning approaches. Such approaches rely on the accuracy of error&lt;br/&gt;estimation for classification and prediction. This is particularly&lt;br/&gt;critical due to the small sample sizes that are common in GSP&lt;br/&gt;applications. Novel robust small-sample error estimation methodologies&lt;br/&gt;in GSP are needed in order to enable reproducible scientific discovery&lt;br/&gt;that leads to genuine medical advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has as its goal solving significant computational and&lt;br/&gt;statistical problems that exist in small-sample error estimation.&lt;br/&gt;Among the open problems that will be addressed are (1) to obtain exact&lt;br/&gt;and approximate representations of the joint sampling distribution of&lt;br/&gt;the estimated and true errors for linear continuous classifiers, which&lt;br/&gt;will lead to better-performing error estimators and practical tools to&lt;br/&gt;assess significance of results; (2) to study error estimation for&lt;br/&gt;discrete classifiers, including the binary coefficient of&lt;br/&gt;determination (CoD), using both analytical and complete enumeration&lt;br/&gt;approaches; (3) to develop the methodology of bolstered error&lt;br/&gt;estimation, addressing the application in high-dimensional spaces and&lt;br/&gt;with adaptive kernels, with an emphasis on feature selection; (4) to&lt;br/&gt;apply these error estimation techniques to the problem of biomarker&lt;br/&gt;discovery for diagnosis and prognosis in cancer and infectious&lt;br/&gt;diseases, in partnership with medical collaborators at Translational&lt;br/&gt;Genomics (TGen), the Johns Hopkins Medical School, and the Oswaldo&lt;br/&gt;Cruz Foundation, Brazil (FIOCRUZ).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    In signal processing applications in Medicine, the objective often is to derive reliable biomarkers, which may be prognostic gene or protein expression markers to classify patients at-risk for cancer or severe forms of infectious diseases, or diagnostic expression signatures for classifying among different grades of such diseases.

This NSF project focused on the advancement of the theory and methods of small-sample error estimation.

This project contributed to the training and professional development of the future generation of scientists by supporting in total or in part six Ph.D. students and a Post-Doctoral associate.   The results of this project were broadly disseminated with the research community through a total of 28 publications in scientific journals and one textbook, in addition to more than a dozen conference publications.
