<AbstractNarration>Measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) is an important diagnostic tool in clinical ophthalmology. Elevated IOP is the leading cause of Glaucoma, a disease leading to damage of the optic nerve and subsequently, to blindness. Currently IOP is measured via the Goldman?s applanation tonometer, a mechanical device that measures the force required to flatten the cornea to a prescribed contact area. Palpation (digital) tonometry measures the intraocular pressure through the eyelid and therefore, does not require anesthesia and instrument sterilization. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a wearable tactile sensor that can be used for frequent measurements of IOP at home. The proposed tissue modeling and analysis will generate a 3D stiffness map of the eye and improve our understanding of the mechanical properties of the eye and its tissues. Societal benefits of the proposed research include reduced need for hospital visits and better management of episodes of elevated IOP and glaucoma. Further potential applications include prostate and breast cancer screening.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. An innovative application of LEGO Mindstorms educational robotics to the task of testing of the proposed sensors will provide participation opportunities for undergraduate students and STEM teachers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
