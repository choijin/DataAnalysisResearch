<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate and demonstrate a fundamentally new approach to millimeter and submillimeter-wave imaging based on wavefront processing and multiplexing. The approach is to exploit state-of-the-art millimeter/submillimeter-wave solid-state devices to realize electronically-controlled wavefront modulators and, in conjunction, apply calibration/error-correction techniques to remove systematic errors associated with imaging systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work lies in its potential to fundamentally transform the conventional approach to millimeter/submillimeter-wave imaging based on focal plane arrays. This research directly addresses the central difficulty impeding the realization of large millimeter-wave imaging arrays,  the problem of processing a large number of outputs from a dense array of receivers. In addition, the proposed electronically-controlled coded masks will open a vast array of new wavefront processing techniques and system architectures for research and application to millimeter-wave imaging,  techniques that have so far been impractical, but can dramatically improve system performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include significantly improved instrumentation for scientific fields that directly rely upon millimeter-wave imaging (spectroscopy, astronomy, and, recently, medicine). Moreover, the societal benefits of improved millimeter-wave imaging encompass public security (e.g., screening/monitoring of cargo) and quality assurance (e.g., manufacturing and process control), as well as medical diagnostics. The role of millimeter-wave imaging as a fundamental research topic relevant to public safety issues will be emphasized to introduce service/outreach-oriented undergraduate thesis projects (for example, scanning foods/medicines in sealed packages) into the curriculum, an approach that has shown success in promoting diversity and attracting students from different disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
