<AbstractNarration>Much has changed in the geological sciences since the NRC's report "Basic Research Opportunities in the Earth Sciences" which started ten years ago.  This new project, "New Earth Science Research Opportunities at the National Science Foundation," has the same objectives and will use the same methods as the previous study to identify and make recommendations about the next generation of basic research opportunities at the NSF's EAR.  A committee of experts will be asked to come to a consensus on new research opportunities and it will be aided in its deliberations by published literature, input from scientists at committee meetings, as well as through symposia held at major Earth science meetings, e.g., annual meetings of the AGU and GSA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth scientists tend to work on highly specific projects in specialized subdisciplines. The fundamental research questions underlying these projects are often implied or stated in technical terms.  It will be challenging to think beyond these subdisciplines to develop the next generation of research opportunities likely to drive the field as a whole.  This study will seek to overcome this challenge by careful choice of a committee of experts in the Earth sciences.  Committee members will be well-respected individuals who have a reputation of thinking broadly and beyond their individual specialties.  Some will be members of the National Academy of Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this report is to communicate the importance of Earth science to nonspecialists, including members of Congress, university administrators, and the general public. Members of these groups may not have a sophisticated understanding of the complexity and excitement of Earth science.  A wide dissemination of the final NRC report may increase the visibility of and funding for the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[National Academy of Sciences Report: NEW RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES IN THE EARTH SCIENCES  A national strategy to sustain basic research and training across all areas of the Earth sciences will help inform the response to many of the major challenges that face society in coming years. Issues including fossil fuel and water resources, earthquake and tsunami hazards, and profound environmental changes due to shifts in the climate system will all be informed by new research in the Earth sciences. The National Science FoundationÆs Division of Earth Sciences, as the only federal agency that maintains significant funding of both exploratory and problem-driven research in the Earth sciences, is central to these efforts, and coordinated research priorities are needed to fully capitalize on the contributions that the Earth sciences can make.  Goal  To help define a coordinated research intuitive, the National Academy of Sciences formed a committee to:  Identify high-priority new and emerging research opportunities in the Earth sciences over the next decade, including surface and deep Earth processes and interdisciplinary research with fields such as ocean and atmospheric sciences, biology, engineering, computer science, and social and behavioral sciences. Identify key instrumentation and facilities needed to support these new and emerging research opportunities. Describe opportunities for increased cooperation in these new and emerging areas between EAR and other government agency programs, industry, and international programs. Suggest new ways that EAR can help train the next generation of Earth scientists, support young investigators, and increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the field.   The committee was fully vetted for conflicts of interest and served pro bono to allow the committeeÆs findings to be fully independent.  Findings  The committee published a report with color figures that defines seven key research opportunities for the Earth sciences:  The Early Earth The Dynamics of Heat, Chemicals, and Volatiles in EarthÆs Interior Faulting and Deformation Processes Interactions Among Climate, Surface Processes, Tectonics, and Deep Earth Processes Co-evolution of Life, Environment, and Climate Coupled Hydrogeomorphic-Ecosystem Response to Natural and Human-caused Change Biogeochemical and Water Cycles in Terrestrial Environments and Impacts of Global Change   The committee also recommended finding new mechanisms for geochronology laboratories that will service the geochronology requirements for a broad suite of research opportunities while sustaining technical advances in methodologies.  A final set of findings suggest ways to train and diversify the next generation of Earth scientists:  Bring the Earth sciences into the high school curriculum at the same level as chemistry, biology, and physics (e.g. AP Earth Science) Provide gap-year internships to incentivize early exposure to the Earth sciences for students who defer college entry for a year.  Support place-based research that incorporates indigenous landscapes and ways of thinking to attract indigenous students. Foster the scientist author through training and support for scientists interested in popular science writing such as online science blogging or nonfiction book writing.   Outcomes  A 132 page report titled, "New Research Opportunities in the Earth Sciences" was published by National Academies press and is available for free download at: http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13236  A report synopsis for the lay person is also available at: http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Research-Opportunities-Earth/13236       Last Modified: 09/13/2012       Submitted by: Mark David Lange]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
