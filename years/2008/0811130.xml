<AbstractNarration>The focus of this proposal is on the mathematical analysis and efficient &lt;br/&gt;implementation of a new class of Krylov deferred correction accelerated &lt;br/&gt;"method of lines transpose" for time dependent PDE's. The method first &lt;br/&gt;discretizes the temporal direction using Gaussian type nodes and spectral &lt;br/&gt;integration, and the resulting coupled elliptic equations are preconditioned &lt;br/&gt;using deferred corrections, in which each correction procedure only &lt;br/&gt;requires the solution of a decoupled system using available fast elliptic &lt;br/&gt;equation solvers. The preconditioned nonlinear system is then solved &lt;br/&gt;efficiently using iterative Newton-Krylov techniques. Preliminary numerical &lt;br/&gt;experiments show that this method is unconditionally stable, very efficient, &lt;br/&gt;and can achieve arbitrary order of accuracy in both time and space. In &lt;br/&gt;particular, no CFL constraints have been observed and the time step size &lt;br/&gt;only depends on the smoothness of the solution and hence is "optimal".  &lt;br/&gt;Highlights of the PI's preliminary results include (a) a time domain &lt;br/&gt;Maxwell equation solver which provides accurate results for a long-time &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic wave simulation problem for which most existing time &lt;br/&gt;integration schemes fail; and (b) a symplectic Schrodinger equation solver &lt;br/&gt;which preserves the structure of a Hamiltonian system with singular &lt;br/&gt;potential while most existing numerical techniques quickly blow up. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is well known that inaccurate numerical algorithms have caused many &lt;br/&gt;costly project failures, examples include the sinking of the Sleipner A &lt;br/&gt;offshore platform in Gandsfjorden near Stavanger, Norway, on August &lt;br/&gt;23, 1991, which was due to inaccurate finite element analysis and resulted &lt;br/&gt;in a loss of nearly one billion dollars. The purpose of this proposal is to &lt;br/&gt;use advanced mathematical analysis and develop numerical techniques that&lt;br/&gt;can efficiently provide accurate and stable numerical simulation results &lt;br/&gt;to important science and engineering problems. In particular, the PI &lt;br/&gt;will study and implement a novel class of numerical algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;time dependent problems modeled by partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;The success of this project will bring new tools and techniques to a &lt;br/&gt;wide class of applications in science and engineering that are impossible&lt;br/&gt;to solve efficiently and accurately using existing techniques, examples &lt;br/&gt;including the design of optimal drug structures in biochemistry, the study&lt;br/&gt;of cosmos structure in astrophysics, and improved understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;physics that govern hydrologic processes in Earth system science. &lt;br/&gt;This project also focuses on the training of a new generation of scientists &lt;br/&gt;capable of developing advanced numerical tools using sophisticated &lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
