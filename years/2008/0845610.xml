<AbstractNarration>Cryptographic hash functions are ubiquitous in modern cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;They are an integral part of digital signature and public-key&lt;br/&gt;encryption schemes, access control mechanisms, digital time-stamping&lt;br/&gt;routines, message authentication codes, and file synchronization&lt;br/&gt;utilities. They are implemented in point-of-sale terminals, ATM&lt;br/&gt;machines, operating systems, web browsers, routers, and mobile phones,&lt;br/&gt;to name just a few.  Yet the design and analysis of hash functions has&lt;br/&gt;received relatively little attention from the cryptographic community,&lt;br/&gt;a shortcoming underscored by recent high-profile attacks on the&lt;br/&gt;often-used MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work aims to advance our understanding of cryptographic hash&lt;br/&gt;functions in theory and practice by developing three complementary&lt;br/&gt;themes.  First, it further solidifies the formal foundations of&lt;br/&gt;hashing.  This means establishing new and meaningful notions of what&lt;br/&gt;means for a hash function to be "good".  Additionally it explores the&lt;br/&gt;powers and limitations of new analytic frameworks (for example,&lt;br/&gt;indifferentiability and human-ignorance), and search for a sharper&lt;br/&gt;view of design heuristics (in particular the random-oracle and&lt;br/&gt;ideal-cipher models.)  Second, it investigates the design of "small"&lt;br/&gt;hash functions, called compression functions, with small domains and&lt;br/&gt;fixed ranges.  Designs based on permutations, blockciphers and&lt;br/&gt;tweakable blockciphers are especially interesting.  Third, it develops&lt;br/&gt;methods for transforming compression functions into "big" hash&lt;br/&gt;functions with flexible domains and ranges; traditionally, the range&lt;br/&gt;of a hash function is a string of a single fixed length.  Also&lt;br/&gt;targetted is the problem of combining the outputs of multiple&lt;br/&gt;primitives for the purpose of security preservation in the presence of&lt;br/&gt;faults.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cryptographic hash functions are ubiquitous in modern technology, used by web browsers, operating systems, ATM machines, mobile devices, and in-vehicle networks, to name just a few applications.  At a very high level, they process data of various sizes (e.g. an individual internet packet, your entire hard-drive) and output a short "fingerprint" that characterizes that data.  Moreover, this fingerprint is unique is specific ways, does not leak information about the data, and is often treated as being a random string of bits.  This project was largely concerned with developing tools for analysizing the security of existing hash functions, and supporting the design of efficient and security hash functions for future needs.  It succeeded in several ways.  First, it both deepened and broadened the research community's understanding of how to build good hash functions.  It also provided evidence of fundamental limitations on how efficient hash functions (within a broad class of practical importance) can be while remaining secure.  Because of their ubiquity, our work on hash functions led to advances in other areas of cryptography.  For example, this project supported a deep, mathematical analysis of the random number generator that is part of the hardware of all recent Intel processors. In a different direction, the project led us to give the first mathematical analysis of the encryption protocol used by TLS (version 1.2), which is the main tool for providing secure communication on the Internet.  Even farther afield, this project fostered initial ideas for technologies aimed at circumventing Internet censorship.  Some of the technologies developed in this project have transferred to the real world, resulting in commerical products that protect (among other things) credit card information and support compliance with federal regulations.  The project also yielded open-source software libraries.  All of our scientific results were published in top-tier conference proceedings or journals.  From an educational perspective, this project supported the development of two new university courses (one on cryptography, one on randomized algorithms), and provided input to several others.  It directly supported the research and education of two PhD students and two masters students, and indirectly aided another three PhD students.  Three of these seven students are members of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in computer science.       Last Modified: 09/04/2015       Submitted by: Thomas Shrimpton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
