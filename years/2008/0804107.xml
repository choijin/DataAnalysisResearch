<AbstractNarration>Drying of the subtropics is a ubiquitous and robust result within model projections of 21st century climate. This drying impacts several areas with important agricultural economies and rising populations, most notably northern Mexico, the southwestern United States, southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. According to the models, this drying sets in immediately in the future. The projected amplitude is such that the U.S. Southwest will go over to a permanent Dust Bowl or 1950s drought level of aridity in the next few years to decades. While the future drought raises the specter of a return of conditions akin to Medieval mega droughts those have been linked to persistent La Nina-like states but future droughts appear to be a result of general warming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted to determine the causes of the drying of the Southwest and the subtropics using coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) and simplified models. Both thermodynamic changes - whereby rising humidity leads to amplification of existing patterns of water vapor transport by the mean circulation, making dry areas drier and wet areas wetter - and changes in atmospheric circulation that shift patterns of precipitation and evaporation are involved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will &lt;br/&gt;a) determine within coupled GCMs the relative contributions of thermodynamical and dynamical mechanisms to subtropical drying and what changes in atmospheric circulation (MMC, transient eddies and stationary waves) are responsible for the dynamical contribution to drying indifferent areas,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) use diagnoses of coupled GCM and a hierarchy of simplified models to determine the causes of the changes in atmospheric circulation, examine the impacts of changes in tropical and extratropical SSTs and tropospheric temperatures, and study low level warming at higher latitudes and stratospheric cooling,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c) determine the interactions between eddies, the mean circulation and water vapor transports that underlie shifts in precipitation and evaporation zones and subtropical drying, examining both winter and summer seasons, and&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;d) contrast the dynamics of tropical forcing of naturally-occurring droughts with the dynamics of anthropogenic drought as a means to identify the causes of current and future drought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the research comes from understanding the fundamentals of how the tropical and global atmosphere circulation and hydrological cycle respond to external forcing which will lead to an improved understanding of the general circulation, in particular, the interactions between eddies, the mean flow and moist processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader implications of the research concern the future of water resources in the arid lands of North America. The work will improve understanding of model projections of human-induced climate change and subtropical drying and, hence, aid assigning of confidence to the predictions. The PIs will communicate results to the climate research community and also to those making water-related decisions and work to educate a wider public on these matters through publications, open addresses, the media and the internet.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Climate models project that the subtropics will dry and expand as a consequence of rising greenhouse gases and associated global warming.  If correct and this actually occurs increased stress will be placed in semi-arid areas on water resources that are already stretched to the limit.  The work funded here was an attempt to determine why subtropical dry regions dry further and expand as greenhouse gases rise, whether this is occurring and how to distinguish it from natural variability of hydroclimate that can temporarily also dry the subtropics.      To address these questions we used a combination of model simulations and observations.  Much of the work was focused on determining the mechanisms that cause natural drying in the subtropics to mid-latitudes during La Ni&ntilde;a events and contrasting these with the mechanisms that cause subtropical drying and expansion as greenhouse gases increase.  We examined thermodynamic  &ndash; relating to changes in the humidity of the air &ndash; and dynamic &ndash; relating to changes in the winds - mechanisms.  It was determined that the subtropical to mid-latitude drying (including over southern North America) that occurs during La Ni&ntilde;a events is primarily caused by changes in atmospheric circulation that are ultimately forced by the cool tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures that comprise the La Ni&ntilde;a event.   We also determined the chain of causality that links tropical Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies to changes in the long term mean atmospheric circulation and storm tracks that govern where precipitation occurs over North America.  This work has provided a thorough account of the mechanisms of naturally varying precipitation variations that, if persistent, can cause drought occur over North America.     We then examined climate models and determined that both thermodynamic and dynamic processes are equally responsible for subtropical drying and expansion in response to rising greenhouse gases.  It was Atmospheric warming allows moistening of the atmosphere and intensification of the transport of water vapor.  This makes dry areas drier and wet areas wetter and hence dries the subtropics.  However global warming also causes changes in the atmospheric circulation and,  in particular, the descending branch of the Hadley Cell expands poleward and the mid-latitude storm tracks shift poleward.  We showed how these two related phenomena cause a poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zones.      For both natural La Ni&ntilde;a-induced subtropical drying and global warming induced subtropical drying the storm tracks shift poleward.  However we showed that this is for different reasons.  In the La Ni&ntilde;a case it is caused by tropical sea surface temperature anomalies forcing mean atmospheric circulation anomalies which feedback positively with the storm tracks and cause a poleward shift of the Pacific storm track and drying in regions like southern California, the southwest, Texas and the southeast.  In the case of global warming, increasing carbon dioxide cools the stratosphere and causes changes in the stratospheric flow that then propagate down into the troposphere and to the surface.  This also results in a poleward shift of the storm tracks and subtropical drying and expansion.  Hence it is possible to distinguish between the mechanisms of natural and anthropogenic subtropical drying.      We applied this to an analysis of global changes in hydroclimate over the past decades.  It was found that hydroclimate variations over this period have been dominated by natural variability associated with the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation but that, once this impact has been removed, there is evidence that global hydroclimate has changed in a way consistent with the model predictions of what should have happened to data as a consequence of rising greenhouse gases and ozone depletion.  This work raises confidence in projections of subtropical drying and expan...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
