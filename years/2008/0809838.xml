<AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Eric Borguet of Temple University. Prof. Borguet and his students will investigate the chemical reactivity of molecules at solid-liquid interfaces in order to gain molecular level understanding of the rules that govern charge transfer and transport at charged interfaces. This will enable transformative advances in electrochemical and nanoscale science that will be important in a variety of areas including molecular electronics, electrochemistry, catalysis, information storage, solar energy conversion and sensors. The study will provide excellent educational training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees in a highly multidisciplinary research area involving the development and application of state of the art electrochemical imaging methods to analyze complex interfaces of increasing technological importance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One goal of molecular electronics is to develop molecular wires, whose resistance to charge transport is linear rather than exponential with length.  With colleagues at Duke University, we demonstrated that at least two classes of molecular wires,1, 2 display linear length dependence of conductivity.  This is an exciting and important result as to date most systems showed an exponential dependence.       Our EC-STM investigation reveals the mechanism of potential induced phase transitions on Au(111) in aqueous electrolyte.3  Key findings are a new phase of the Au(111) surface, different from reconstructed (22 &times; &radic;3) and the unreconstructed (1 &times; 1) states, from which reconstruction proceeds rapidly.3  We developed a novel surface electrodeposition scheme to grow parallel arrays of equally spaced (&lt; 4 nm apart), nanometer width metal wires using physisorbed molecular templates.4  We demonstrated the effect of pH in STM observation of redox chemistry in ordered porphyrin monolayers.5   In contrast, the simplest, tetra-phenyl porphyrin, insoluble in aqueous solution, showed no evidence of redox induced STM contrast.6     Our group has developed novel ultrabroadband, ultrafast infrared sources.7  Our ultrafast vibrational Sum Frequency Generation (vSFG) experiments have revealed how electric fields influence ultrafast vibrational dynamics at aqueous-charged solid interfaces.8-10 Our studies showed how salt leads to deprotonation at charged colloidal-aqueous interfaces.11  Combining time and frequency domain vSFG with simple molecular structure calculations we deconvolved the response of individual functional groups, including a terminal methylene (CH2) group, and determined the dephasing dynamics.12  We investigated charge transfer dynamics at semiconductor-oxide interfaces, revealing that SHG can determine dopant type and density in silicon near its interface with SiO2.13  Our research contributed to development of a simple contact angle apparatus that will hopefully make interfacial science more accessible to education.14 Using contact angle, FTIR and vSFG to characterize chemical modified solid substrates, we discovered surface chemical and physical characteristics that promote neuronal cell adhesion and differentiation.15     Our NSF funded research has resulted in 15 publications in the past 3 years, over 40 invited talks and over 30 contributed presentations.  12 undergraduate, high school and graduate students, as well as 3 post-doctoral fellows, have received training through NSF support.         1.
