<AbstractNarration>Dr. Huterer will study statistical isotropy of the universe on its largest scales, following on other recent studies that indicate that the underlying sky in the cosmic microwave background observations is not statistically isotropic. Traditional approaches for extracting cosmological parameters would be invalid if the universe is not isotropic, requiring new techniques for estimation. The funded research will study the distribution of galaxies and other sources in surveys covering wavelengths from radio to gamma-ray, and will complement the traditional studies based on previous satellite observations.  An alternative representation of cosmological perturbations on the sky using multipole vectors will be used for tests of alignments and isotropy in the large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work will include an education/outreach program aimed at tutoring teachers, and involvement with the Exhibit Museum (and planetarium) of National History in Ann Arbor to introduce cosmology exhibits and increase visibility of this institution in the wider Detroit metro area.</AbstractNarration>

In other words, if we could smooth out the distribution of all objects in our observable universe, what would we observe?
