<AbstractNarration>OPTIMAL TRIANGULATIONS FOR SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT FOR PROPOSAL#0830209&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent progress in scientific computing motivates new triangulation&lt;br/&gt;problems. As new numerical methods being developed, new geometric&lt;br/&gt;constraint formulations that are key in the accuracy and convergence&lt;br/&gt;analysis of these methods emerge. In this two-year project, practical&lt;br/&gt;and theoretically sound algorithmic solutions for a number of&lt;br/&gt;triangulation problems will be studied. More importantly, new software&lt;br/&gt;based on these solutions will be developed and made available to the&lt;br/&gt;public. In particular, first ever software for computing acute and&lt;br/&gt;non-obtuse triangulation problems will be deployed. Such software are&lt;br/&gt;sought for in scientific computing as a geometric tool to be coupled&lt;br/&gt;with the widely used finite volume methods as well as in graphics&lt;br/&gt;applications. Practical algorithmic solutions for other triangulation&lt;br/&gt;problems such as minimum weight Steiner triangulations which is&lt;br/&gt;expected to find use in networking applications, will also be studied.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, parallelization of the aformentioned algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;solutions will be studied within this project. The project will ensure&lt;br/&gt;its broader impact through distribution and integration of new robust&lt;br/&gt;software. Project personnel consists of one graduate student that will&lt;br/&gt;be selected among underrepresented groups in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;____________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
