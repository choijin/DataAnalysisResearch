<AbstractNarration>In the Center for the Physics of Living Cells (CPLC) experimentalists, computational physicists, and theorists will jointly attack the extreme technical challenges posed by quantifying processes in living cells with the sensitivity needed to explore how life organizes itself, weaving molecular systems into the fabric of living matter. Specifically, the Center will: (1) push in vitro single molecule techniques to a 10- to 100-fold increase in sensitivity, spatio-temporal resolution, and throughput for concurrent detection of multiple observables; (2) use synthetic nanostructures to manipulate single molecules, enabling measurements of both forces and molecular conformation with sub-microsecond resolution; (3) observe individual events within single cells, enabling time- and space-resolved studies of gene expression and other key cellular processes; and (4) extend computation to biologically relevant timescales, and theory to greater biological realism, enabling the detailed interpretation of the dynamics of biological systems from the molecular to the cellular level. The interaction between theory, computation, in vitro and in vivo experiments will be at the core of the Center's mission. A concrete example combining these four approaches will be to build a truly quantitative and dynamic physical picture of transcription and translation machinery, used by the cell to copy DNA into RNA and then into proteins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will provide exciting educational opportunities on and off campus. For Ph.D. students, the Center will build a community around special seminars, symposia, tailored courses, and joint mentoring, and help generate a new generation of scientists who are fluent in both physics and biology.  This new science will be brought to the undergraduate level in the form of courses, online computing and visualization environments, and a single-molecule laboratory course where they can acquire hands-on experience. The Center will recruit minority students into the REU programs and summer workshops through partnership with primarily minority institutions and participation in two annual scientific meetings for under-represented minorities. At the high school level, the Center will expand an existing program in which Ph.D. students can act as mentors for teachers on and off campus, introducing visualization tools and modern molecular biology concepts into the classroom. To address young students directly, the Center will establish a pilot program at a girls middle school. This program will provide contact with students as they begin their formal science education, exposing them to modern biophysical concepts and tools. To the scientific community, the Center will provide visualization and simulation tools to enable the study of macromolecular assemblies and cells. Likewise, the state-of-the-art instrumentation developed by the Center will lead to mainstream applications in biological sciences and is expected to have major commercial impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly funded by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) as part of a partnership to foster research and education at the mathematical and physical sciences - life sciences interface.  Participating programs in MPS include the Physics Frontiers Centers program, the Experimental Physical Chemistry program, and the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.  Participating program in BIO include the Biomolecular Systems cluster, the Genes and Genomes cluster, and the Neural Systems cluster.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of the NSF Center for the Physics of Living Cells (CPLC) at the University of Illinois is to create a quantitative, predictive and physically-based description of living systems.  This formidable challenge cannot be tackled by a single investigator, but requires the collective efforts of experimental, computational, and theoretical biophysicists. The CPLC has enabled the assembly of a team of collaborating scientists to undertake this research. The Center has had the broader impact of creating a dynamic, diverse community of early-career scientists trained in interdisciplinary science, many of whom are now themselves embarking on academic and industrial careers launched by their experience in the CPLC.  Through a multitude of channels, the CPLC has been able to communicate the exciting science emanating from the research to researchers nationally and internationally, as well as providing inspiration to a broader community that includes school children and the public-at-large.  Life has evolved during nearly 4 billion years into a miracle of complexity, with levels of organization and feedback that encompass ecosystems, multi-cellular communities, cellular structure, gene regulation, cooperative interactions of numerous proteins and the physical basis of replication, transcription and gene expression.   At the core of this complexity is the cell itself, the "atom" of biology.  To explore the living cell, CPLC has developed physics-based techniques that make major advances in imaging, molecular manipulation, computer simulation and theoretical analysis of the processes occurring at the molecular level.  As a result of our work, it is now possible to image (in vitro) DNA and analyze its motions with sub-nanometer resolution in specially-designed optical traps that combine novel laser and fluorescence techniques.  We can watch molecular motors moving their "cargo" (proteins, for example) within living cells, and measure the tiny but important forces they exert on one another.   We have been able to develop a "treadmill" for bacteria, trapping them with lasers in one spot while feeding them with nutrients, so that we can watch with unprecedented resolution and precision how they swim.  Using these techniques, we have been able to understand how they adapt to their environment and search for food.  We have developed single molecule techniques to determine quantitatively the coordinated interactions between complexes of proteins in living cells, imaged using fluorescence techniques to reveal their composition and activity.  The detailed information about the cellÆs constituents is a massive data stream that we have used to develop sophisticated simulations of whole cells and the networks of biochemical reactions that drive their metabolism and gene expression.  This has entailed major algorithmic advances, as well as innovations such as the use of graphical processor units to perform intensive computational functions.  At the level of individual atoms, it has become possible to calculate the structure and dynamics of the HIV capsid, a grand challenge that required analysis of 64 million atoms in the largest simulation of its kind.  These simulations revealed unsuspected conformational variation and candidate binding sites for antiviral drugs.   We have learned to calculate mathematically how genetically identical cells can become differentiated through fluctuations in protein number arising from stochastic gene expression.  These calculations have shown how cells can switch from one state to another rapidly, a fundamental mechanism by which bacterial communities can adapt to new ecological niches.  In all these advances, disseminated through over 200 papers in the most high-impact scientific journals, collaboration between the participating senior investigators was critical for the success of the projects, because they involved the combination of multiple experimental, computation and theoretical techniques, as ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
