<AbstractNarration>The primary objective of the investigators is to encourage talented undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;students to pursue graduate study and research careers in computer science.  The &lt;br/&gt;program directly impacts students by giving them first-hand experience with some &lt;br/&gt;of the most rewarding activities that characterize graduate study and research &lt;br/&gt;careers: conducting research as a team, disseminating results, and participating &lt;br/&gt;in a community of scholars.  The research projects are drawn from a number of &lt;br/&gt;important fields of computer science.  The importance of teamwork and participating &lt;br/&gt;in a scholarly community is emphasized to the students.  It should be noted that all &lt;br/&gt;of the student participants in this program are enrolled at undergraduate-only &lt;br/&gt;institutions.  Thus, the program extends research experiences to students who are &lt;br/&gt;not enrolled in large research institutions, and who thus might not have the &lt;br/&gt;opportunity to participate in research otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular projects vary with the specialties and interests of the faculty &lt;br/&gt;members participating in any given year.  Project areas include pen-based computing, &lt;br/&gt;computer-supported cooperative work, assistive technology (text navigation for the &lt;br/&gt;visually impaired), natural language processing (text summarization), functional &lt;br/&gt;programming languages, wireless sensor networks, programming pedagogy, and virtual &lt;br/&gt;reality.  In addition to providing an orientation to their research projects, &lt;br/&gt;faculty mentors sponsor orientation activities to help the students appreciate the &lt;br/&gt;nature of research and the value of working cooperatively.  Students are encouraged &lt;br/&gt;to collaborate formally and informally.  Students have several opportunities to &lt;br/&gt;present their work to other REU participants as well as to external audiences.  &lt;br/&gt;Finally, students learn about the graduate school application process in part by &lt;br/&gt;visiting a major research university.</AbstractNarration>
