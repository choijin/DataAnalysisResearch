<AbstractNarration>AST-0807444&lt;br/&gt;Tremaine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) operates one of the largest and most influential postdoctoral programs in astrophysics in the world.  The focus is on theoretical astrophysics, but observers who interact well with theorists are also recruited.  The postdoctoral fellows are chosen from a wide range of fields in astrophysics, with the expectation that they will work independently on any topic that they choose, learning largely on their own, from one another, and from the steady stream of junior and senior visitors.  However, the primary duty of the IAS faculty, apart from their personal research, is to mentor the postdocs, who also have access to many excellent resources at Princeton.  This model attracts and helps to develop researchers of exceptional quality.  IAS astrophysics alumni are spread throughout the US astronomical leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for seven postdoctoral fellows in astrophysics for five years.  Because of IAS matching funds, this award covers about 30% of the actual cost of each fellow, but enables the IAS to host all seven fellows.  The breadth, size and quality of the postdoctoral program at IAS give it a broad impact on astronomy research and education.  Former IAS postdoctoral fellows are at the most active teaching and research institutions in the country, and have introduced many of the innovations and practices at IAS to the institutions where they spend their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
