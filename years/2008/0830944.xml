<AbstractNarration>The University of New Mexico (UNM) will develop and deploy DataNetONE (Observation Network for Earth), a sustainable long-term data preservation and access network, with related search and discovery, data integration, and user services and analytic tools. The goal of the DataNetONE (Observation Network for Earth) project is to enable scientists, decision-makers, and citizens to understand the nature and pace of change on Earth and to address associated environmental, social, and technological challenges. The initial focus will be on multi-disciplinary observational data collected by biological and environmental scientists, national and international research networks, and environmental observatories. DataNetONE will be extended to serve a broader range of science domains both directly and through interoperability with other DataNet deployments. The project is under the direction of Dr. William Michener at the UNM. DataNetONE is designed to enable the long-term preservation of diverse and complex multi-scale, multi-discipline, and multi-national science data by providing open, persistent, robust, and secure access to well-described and easily discovered Earth observational data. Expected users include scientists, educators, librarians, resource managers, and the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential impact of long-term preservation and integrated access to diverse and complex multi-scale, multi-discipline, multinational science data is transformative in the speed with which researchers will be able to assemble and analyze data sets and in the types of problems they will be able to address. Scientific investigations that will be greatly facilitated by DataNetONE include understanding the relationships among human population density, atmospheric nitrogen and carbon dioxide, energy consumption and global temperatures; understanding and predicting the emergence and spread of diseases like avian flu; critical areas where local or regional changes may have strong effects on earth system interactions, feedbacks, or teleconnections; the impact of "megapolitan-ization" on ecological systems; and the interrelationships among coupled human and natural systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vast amounts of data are needed by researchers, educators, decision-makers and citizens to understand the nature and pace of change on earth.  Such data are needed to understand and respond to droughts, floods, emerging diseases, land use changes, loss of biodiversity and other stressors. DataONE (Data Observation Network for Earth) has been designed as an organization and a set of information technologies that would make it easy for researchers and others to find, access and use a broad array of biological, geophysical and social data.  DataONE has focused on four key activities: (1) building an information system that enables one to discover and access data across a large number of international repositories where data are held; (2) creating a toolkit of tools that aids researchers in working with stored data; (3) engaging a community of scientists, engineers, librarians, and educators in building and using DataONE tools and services; and (4) teaching scientists, students and others how to better and more easily find, manage, use and interpret data for the benefit of science and society.  DataONE successfully built an information system that allows one to easily search dozens of data repositories worldwide and find desired data.  An individual can go to the DataONE website (http://dataone.org), type in one or more keywords into a search bar, and then rapidly be pointed to a subset of related data and documentation that helps in understanding and using the data.  Focusing on specific locations and time periods can further refine the data search.  The end result is rapid access to the data needed to answer science questions, inform decisions, and include in class exercises and teaching.  Hundreds of thousands of important data products are now discoverable and the advanced search tools make it easy to pinpoint those data that will be most useful.  It is important that scientists and others be able to easily use data once it has been discovered and downloaded via the DataONE website.  DataONE has developed an Investigator Toolkit that contains several tools that benefit researchers, software developers and others.  For example, the DMPTool is an easy-to-use web tool that helps scientists create data management plans that describe how their data will be treated during and after a research project is completed.  Thousands of high-quality data management plans have been created using this tool.  Other tools allow one to easily access and analyze data via statistical analysis packages and cite data products in common citation management systems.   The best and most useful information systems and software tools are designed with input from the user community.  DataONE convened eleven highly successful working groups over the five&ndash;year period that engaged more than 150 scientists, information technologists, librarians, and educators.  The working groups focused on understanding community needs, creating the information system and various tools, developing education programs, and participating in other essential activities.  As examples,  (1) The Usability and Assessment Working Group surveyed the needs of more than 1300 scientists and subsequently engaged small groups of scientists in testing and improving the usability of tools and services.  In addition, a now 200-member strong DataONE Users Group guided development and routinely tested various tools and services.  These and related community-building activities have helped ensure that DataONE tools and services can be easily and successfully used by thousands of users.   (2)  The Exploration, Visualization and Analysis Working Group tested various data-intensive analysis approaches, leading to the creation of the 2011 and 2013 State of the Birds reports for the United States.  (3)  The Citizen Science Working Group developed best practices guides for managing data and created the framework for the Citizen Science Association&mdash;a large community of practice that supports...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
