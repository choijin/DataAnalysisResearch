<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this CAREER project supported by the Theoretical &amp; Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Xiasong Li of the University of Washington will carry out research to develop computational methodologies for the study of reaction properties and dynamics of large scale systems, such as nanostructures, biomolecules and polymers.  In particular, Li will address non-adiabatic effects in molecular dynamics, coupling of single and double excitations in excited state electronic structure, and simultaneous optimization of the electronic ground state and molecular geometry.  The educational plan focuses on involving high-school and undergraduate students in summer research programs, collaborating with community colleges, and promoting the inclusion of computational science in the undergraduate curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides creating new methodologies, the proposed research will help interpret experimental data in terms of the molecular-dynamic theory it develops.  This work addresses very important and challenging problems with the potential for high impact.  A physical chemistry course will be developed that relies on new insights rather than mathematical derivations, an approach that is also helpful in engineering and industrial applications.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT  The accurate prediction of excited-state electronic structure and dynamics from first principles is crucial to attaining a detailed mechanistic understanding of the light-matter interactions that drive the fundamental processes implicated in energy conversion, energy storage, and photocatalysis.  Excited-state electronic structure methods have ushered in an era of rational design for advanced functionalized materials and hold the promise of expediting the development of many proposed and emerging technologies, most notably in the areas of photonics and spintronics as they apply to information processing and storage. The primary goal of this project is to provide accurate and reliable guidance for experimentalists through furthering the development and application of theoretical/computational chemistry.  In order for the application of quantum mechanics to molecular systems to be simultaneously predictive, accurate and tractable, innovative advances in computer software and mathematical algorithms are demanded.  The computational/theoretical tools developed in our group as well as the chemical systems to which they are applied are experimentally motivated, and largely focus on modeling excited state electronic structures and the way these nonequilibrium electronic configurations evolve in time. The PI's independent research at the University of Washington supported by this award can be categorized into two broad and coherently integrated research areas:  (i) method developments, including first-principles electronic dynamics and Ehrenfest dynamics using real-time, time-dependent density functional theory; near-linear scaling methods for optimizing molecular geometries and excited state electronic wave functions;  (ii) scientific applications, including understanding the physical underpinnings of exotic  electric/magnetic interactions among charger carriers in diluted magnetic semiconductors; laser-controlled molecular reactions; electron-hole and charge transfer dynamics in organic materials and semiconductor nanocrystals; and optical properties of organic chromophores.  The information gleaned from the proposed research has broad implications for each of these technologies by providing researchers a deeper understanding of the excited state electronic structure/function relationships. This project furthermore results in the development of new materials with novel photophysical properties for application in a variety of scientific contexts from fundamental research to energy conversion.
