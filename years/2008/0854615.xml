<AbstractNarration>Multiple climate drivers at regional scales often interact with large scale climate forcing to trigger, sustain, and even amplify extreme conditions.  Understanding the interactions and feedbacks between the two scales is important for characterization of the dynamical and physical mechanisms associated with regional climate variability and predictability.  The Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) is a unique region, replete with complex terrain and other surface heterogeneities imposed by the presence of large inland lakes (Victoria, Tanganyika, Malawi), The Great Rift Valley system, and high mountains (Kilimanjaro, Kenya, Rwenzori), and as such provides a conducive setting for interactions between large scale and local climate systems on various spatial and temporal scales.  This unique geographical setting therefore presents challenges in quantitative understanding of cause-effect relationships between regional climate variability and individual or combinations of processes.  The principal investigators (PIs) will conduct an extensive regional climate simulation intercomparison to evaluate regional climate model performance over the GHA subregion.  They will identify and address some of the deficiencies in regional climate models (RCMs) associated with suboptimal customization and objective parameter adjustments that are critical in the adequate simulation of certain aspects of the regional climate.  They will also investigate, through a suite of sensitivity experiments related to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the equatorial Indian Ocean and land use patterns, the link between moisture transport from Indian Ocean via the Turkana Channel Jet and climate patterns over parts of western Ethiopia and Sudan, regions often ravaged by extreme droughts.  Finally, high-resolution regional climate change scenarios will be developed to address issues of impacts assessment for the most important and vulnerable systems in the region:  water resources of Lake Victoria and the Nile Basins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The consequences and impacts of climate variability and change on food production, water resources, and human health are potentially more adverse over the Greater Horn of Africa than in any other part of the world.  This research will contribute significantly toward our understanding of the interactions between mesoscale and large scale processes influencing the multi-scale variability of GHA climate.  By taking a comprehensive audit of the weaknesses and strength of the performance of the regional models, the PIs will be able to improve the physics parameterizations based on observed local conditions of the regional climate.  The societal benefits that would accrue from improved sub-seasonal to inter-annual climate prediction are enormous.  Another important contribution of the project to the needs of the GHA sub-region will be to help in capacity building, by training one Ph.D. student.  The PIs will also put their model inter-comparison results on a public webpage where other scientists can access the information and make suggestions for further improvement.  In addition, they will reach out to the major climate applications centers in the region such as the Intergovernmental Authority for Development Climate Prediction and Applications Center (ICPAC) for the GHA sub-region, located in Nairobi, so that they can establish a research-applications collaboration for the purposes of effective dissemination of their results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to improve understanding and characterization of different physical and dynamical mechanisms and processes associated with the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) climate variability and change using a hybrid of observational/empirical and regional climate modeling approaches. In general, we have demonstrated that improved understanding, predictability and prediction of different aspects of the GHA climate at different spatial-temporal scales requires appropriate representation of both local and large-scale processes in regional climate models.   In sum, in terms of its intellectual merit, the major project outcomes are the following.  First, using a combination of observational analysis and numerical simulations, we investigated the primary moisture sources and sinks associated with different rainfall regimes and demonstrated that prolonged persistence of deep Indian monsoon troughs during June-August season of the dry years coupled with strong Somali Jet leads to prolonged dry events over northern GHA during peak months of La Ni&ntilde;a conditions (October-December). On the other hand, the meridional component of the Somali jet weakens during the periods preceding the peak of El Ni&ntilde;o episodes leaving a weakened westerly flow that rapidly transition to easterly flow over Indian Ocean,leading to early onset of wet events over southern GHA  but drier northern parts.   Secondly, we successfully customized the latest version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT),   to study impacts of  present and future climate   over the two primary Nile River sub-basins: Equatorial lakes (White Nile) and Blue Nile. Using surrogate climate change scenarios, we showed that simulated Nile flow regime over these two primary catchments was particularly sensitive to variations in base flow, groundwater flow delay, as well as upper soil layer water retention capacity.  Thirdly,  through observations and modeling, we showed that changes in land surface characteristics can significantly influence both localized and broader scale patterns and processes associated with climate anomalies over the GHA. Land Use and Land Cover classification from Landsat satellite data shows there has been rapid conversion of forestlands to agriculture over central parts of the GHA sub-region (western and central parts of Kenya) between the periods 1986 and 2000, with actively cultivated land increasing from  6.55%  to  17.89% during that period.  Our  sensitivity simulations, mimicking similar Landsat land use/land cover changes, showed significant surface changes in wind flow patterns and evolution of surface fluxes of heat and moisture, as well as   remarkable changes in the upper soil  water content and retention of as much as 3mm/day when forestland is converted to agriculture; a scenario that  amplify the severity and persistence of localized dry conditions.  Fourthly, we have shown that there is relatively minimal inter-model variability  for both CMIP3 and CMIP5 projected GHA climate changes by the middle of 21st century, but larger inter-model differences and uncertainty towards the end of the 21st century especially for projected temperature.  Finally, through sensitivity experiments and modification of  hydrological processes and land use/land cover characteristics in regional climate modeling this project has shifted the modeling paradigm for the GHA: that to improve understanding of the hydro-climate variability and changes of the GHA one requires a full and dynamic coupling of climate-hydrologic-land use processes. PI Anyah has initiated preliminary work to customize a fully coupled climate-hydrologic modeling system for the region, to enable investigation of climate-hydrology-land use change connections, interactions and feedbacks.  In terms of the broader impacts, the key outcomes include the following.  One of the eminent achievements of this project was the successful organization of the inter-comparison of multi-m...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
