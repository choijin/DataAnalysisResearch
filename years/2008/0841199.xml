<AbstractNarration>The goal of the University of Idaho GK-12 program is to improve graduate Fellow communication, teaching, collaboration, and teamwork skills, while increasing inquiry-based science taught in rural middle and high schools in Idaho and Washington. Graduate Fellows will be from interdisciplinary degree programs: Waters of the West - Water Resources, Environmental Science, and Environmental Engineering. The STEM theme will be water resources and the environment as a context for learning physical, Earth, and life sciences. The theme and interdisciplinary approach will raise working knowledge of water resources, one of the most compelling and complex topics facing the world today. Fellows will use their research to convey scientific concepts to students, linking the science content to local water resource issues (e.g. aquifer depletion, floods and droughts, or the inter-relationship of salmon, hydropower dams, and Indian Tribes) that are relevant to the teachers, students, and community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will serve seven rural school districts, including the Lapwai (Nez Perce Tribe) district, which is 82% Native American; all schools are within river basins subjected to integrated analysis by the Waters of the West program. Five specific impacts are: (a) Fellows will effectively communicate scientific concepts in classroom and public contexts, (b) Fellows will successfully apply collaboration and teamwork skills in teaching and research (c) Fellows will demonstrate inquiry-based teaching skills, (c) STEM teachers will demonstrate increased content knowledge, mentoring skills, and confidence and competence in inquiry-based teaching, and (e) grade 7-12 students will demonstrate increased scientific knowledge, excitement, confidence and career awareness.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This sustainability effort is called The Confluence Project (TCP) and shares the same goals as the original GK-12 program by partnering graduate students with high school science teachers to deliver inquiry-based science education to high school students. TCP also brings place-based, project-based education to the classes it works with. High school students learn science by going into the field to conduct research with graduate students and other local experts. Thus far, this program has been well-received by teachers, students and school administrators. In order to continue this program into the future with potentially limited funding, graduate students will receive training and focus their efforts on leading field experiences and mentoring students to do research projects. We have found that through those tasks, graduate students greatly improve their science communication, teamwork and teaching skills.
