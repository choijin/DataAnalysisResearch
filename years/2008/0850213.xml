<AbstractNarration>This S-STEM project broadens the participation of underrepresented minorities and women by providing financial and academic support leading to 17 students obtaining their Bachelors degrees in Computer Science. Scholarships are awarded to 9 freshman and to 4 community college students transferring in as juniors, with four more community college students when the first 4 graduate.&lt;br/&gt;A network of mature organizations with proven track records provides academic support for underrepresented minority and female CS Scholar students. These organizations offer tutoring, career guidance, scholarships, access to internships, and university research opportunities for CS Scholars. CS Scholars benefit from a special summer preview orientation, regular cadre activities to foster a group identity, and a CS Scholars lounge of their own adjacent to the CS labs. CS Scholars are paid to return on visits to the high schools from which they came, serving as role models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: CS occupations are vitally important and include occupations with rapidly increasing demand. While the population in the US is becoming more ethnically and racially diverse, computer science is becoming less diverse, with fewer women. To meet the demand for skilled CS workers, it is essential that we as a nation reverse this trend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: CS Scholars increase by 17 the number of African Americans, Hispanics, and women in CS. While being mentored by existing upper-level CS undergraduate students, CS Scholars serve as role models to approximately 1,000 high schools students per year. School visits and presentations are part of existing collaborations with area high schools and community colleges. CS Scholars are encouraged to participate in existing research programs. Four CS Scholars are given the opportunity to travel to national conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From 2010 to 2015 the NSF-funded UIC CS Scholars program provided social support and scholarship support up to $10K/year per student, targeting financially needy undergraduate students from groups underrepresented within Computer Science: women, African-American, Latino, and Native Americans. We had 52 applicants, and provided support to 27 of them.  Of the 27 students who received CS Scholars support, 11 have already graduated and are working in CS/IT, and an addtiional 7 are on track to graduate by the end of this Spring 2016 semester, for a total of 18.  Seven student dropped out of the program because of poor academic performance or family issues (26%), and two students received support but are not yet ready to graduate.  Cumulative grade point averages across all the semesters for the cadre of CS Scholars was 3.15 / 4.0  Of the total supported students, twelve CS Scholars are female (44%), nine are Latino (33%), five African-American (19%) and two Native American (7%).   Twenty-two of the students (81%) are female and/or part of a racial group underrepresented in Computing.   Approximately half (13/27 = 48%) started at UIC as Freshman, with 14 (52%) coming in as transfer students and the remaining five being existing students supported only for one or two semesters near the end of the grant funding cycle.  One lesson learned in this project is that technology is no substitute for human interaction, particularly when it comes to nurturing at-risk students through successfully completing a CS major, when they often lack family and home community supports.  Each year students had individual counseling sessions with a program manager.  Of the students responding 87% ranked these sessions as very or extremely helpful.  Program activities included summer orientation sessions and monthly dinners, both geared to develop community among participants. For summer orientation sessions 91% of CS Scholars who were involved in these activities and responded to the survey indicated the orientation activities were helpful (27%), very (18%) or extremely (45%) helpful. Monthly dinners had a theme such as networking, study abroad, interships, interview skills, and what to expect in particular classes.  Of student respondents, 93% indicated that the monthly group dinners were very or extremely helpful to them. The summer orientation activities and monthly dinners allowed us to built a supportive community where for a brief period of time these students were not in the minority.  Through matching funds from the UIC College of Engineering students were exposed to Chicago cultural opportunities which they might not have had otherwise.   One female CS Scholars graduate worked in industry for a year and now has a full-ride scholarship in a Ph.D. program at Carnegie Mellon's Computer Science program.  Of survey respondents, 33% indicated that majoring in CS at UIC would have been impossible without this scholarship. The remaining students all indicated the scholarship helped substantially (6.7%) or very much (60%).  A third of the CS Scholars are the first in their family to be graduating from college.  For another third of them only one parent graduated from college.  By summer of 2016, UIC CS Scholars will have contributed to broadening participation in computing by equipping 15 students from the underrepresented groups of females, African-American and Latino students to enter the CS/IT workforce.
