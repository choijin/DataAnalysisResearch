<AbstractNarration>Why do leading advocacy organizations in transnational networks construe certain global problems, but not others, as international issues? How do certain issues rise to global prominence while other social problems fall by the wayside? The study will answer this question by collecting data on the rise and fall of issues in the transnational human rights network. First, it will capture variation in the human rights issue agenda through surveys and interviews with human rights activists, and analysis of advocacy websites. Second, it will explore reasons for this variation through a series of focus groups with activists from leading organizations in the human rights network. Participants will be asked about what is and is not on the human rights agenda; how this changes over time, and why. These data will yield insights as to how ideas move through and (sometimes) gain footholds in transnational communities of practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant numbers of Masters and Ph.D. students from the University of Pittsburgh and Carleton University will be trained to conduct interviews and focus groups, as well as in the systematic use of qualitative data analysis software and scientific methods for reaching vailid inferences about large, unstructured text datasets.  This project will integrate rigorous, computer-assisted qualitatitive methods into the study of transnational networkds.</AbstractNarration>

We explored this question by studying agenda-setting practices within the human security network, a collection of NGOs, UN agencies, governments and think-tanks concerned with increasing human well-being globally across a range of thematic areas: peace and security, development, human rights, humanitarian affairs, health and the environment.  As we discovered through surveys and web analysis, the network pays much more attention to certain human security threats than others. Common issues associated with the area of "human security" include child-soldiers, poverty, and womenÆs rights, for example, but do not include gang violence, traffic accidents or elder-care. In fact human security specialists argue that many important human security problems are neglected or ignored.  We held a series of focus groups to try to understand how practitioners set their organizational agendas and how this affects the overall issue agenda within a global network like "human security."
