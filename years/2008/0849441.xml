<AbstractNarration>The UW-Stout Applied Science Program, composed of three departments, biology, physics and chemistry with concentrations in biotechnology, nanotechnology, materials science and environmental science, is experiencing unprecedented growth. The goal of this project, Polytechnic Mission, Applied Science Vision, is to capitalize on this growth and enhance the successful Applied Science Community, infrastructure already in place to initiate an innovative model for the recruitment, retention and career success of academically able but financially disadvantaged and underrepresented STEM students. In this model (10) $10,000 renewable recruitment scholarships are awarded to incoming STEM students and (20) $5,000 nonrenewable retention scholarships are awarded to current and future applied science students over four years. The model incorporates a holistic approach to STEM education, including a summer bridge program, intensive advising, faculty and peer mentors, participation in a learning community that encompasses students living on campus and off, undergraduate research experiences, and opportunities to present on research experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default">NSF S-STEM dollars were used to create and implement an Applied Science Scholar Community program that integrates a holistic approach to recruiting, engaging and retaining underrepresented students (URM) in STEM fields.&nbsp; NSF S-STEM funding has resulted in a significant increase in under-represented minority students from URM students making up 6% of the Applied Science students at project inception to URM students making up 14% of the Applied Science student population. We believe this increase is a result of the ASFL scholarships as well as a combination of factors that are directly related to implementation of ASSC Program. The high-impact practices implemented as part of the Applied Science Scholar Community model, including the extensive programming in the freshmen Applied Science 101 course and the establishment of a new living learning community effectively immersed an incoming freshmen population into the ASSC. After their first year on campus, students had a better awareness of the opportunities available to them through the program, university and off-campus communities. Students were also able to communicate how the various components of the scholar community benefited their current educational experience and future career opportunities. The programming integrated into the living learning community that centered on diversity related topics appeared to have a positive effect on program climate for URM students. Through on-going formative assessment, the NSF S-STEM scholars identified key areas that would assist them in their academic and career goals and would help them to be retained in the Applied Science Program at UW-Stout. A key outcome of this assessment was the implementation of Winterm Access to Research Mentors (WARM), a new, complementary opportunity, created as a direct result of feedback from focus groups with our under-represented NSF S-STEM students. WARM experiences occurred during the final two weeks of Winterm break. The objectives of the WARM experience were to provide students the opportunity to further establish faculty mentor relationships, focus on a specific research activity, and work with campus career services to refine their resumes and learn how to search and apply for summer internships, which are required within the Applied Science Program. The students identified these types of activities, particularly the faculty mentorship, as the most important facet of their success and connection to the Applied Science Program.
