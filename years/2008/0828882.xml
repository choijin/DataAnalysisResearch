<AbstractNarration>PI: Ghovanloo, Maysam&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0828882&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problem Statement: The number of people with disabilities is increasing among all age groups, especially the elderly (+65) who currently comprise 12% of the U.S. population. Individuals severely disabled as a result of various causes from spinal cord injuries to stroke, cerebral palsy, and ALS find it extremely difficult to carry out everyday tasks without continuous help. Despite the wide variety of assistive technologies (AT) available for individuals with lower levels of disabilities, the above population is still considered underserved, and would greatly benefit from having more choices, particularly in utilizing adaptable ATs that can take advantage of whatever remaining capabilities that they might have. We intend to help individuals with little or no upper extremity functions to improve their quality of life by enabling them to control their environment, drive their powered wheelchair (PWC), and access computers by simply moving their tongue. Intellectual Merits: The main purpose of the proposed research is to develop an unobtrusive, minimally invasive, low cost, and wireless AT called the 'Tongue Drive' system (TDS), which can potentially substitute some of the arm and hand functions in people with quadriplegia. Conceptually, the TDS consists of an array of small magnetic sensors located inside the mouth, on an orthodontic brace (internal version - iTDS), or outside of the mouth, mounted on a headset (external version - eTDS). The sensor array measures the magnetic field of a small permanent magnet, the size of a grain of rice, which is attached to the tongue by means of tissue adhesives, implantation, piercing, or clipping. The sensor signals are transmitted wirelessly to an external ultra-portable PC, which is worn by the user. The received data is processed to determine the coordinates, orientation, and relative motion of the magnet with respect to the array of sensors in real time. This information is then used to control the movements of a cursor on the PC screen, and to perform all other functions that can be done with a mouse pointer or a joystick. The principal advantage of the TDS is that a few magnetic sensors and an inherently wireless permanent magnet could potentially capture an unlimited number of tongue movements, each of which can represent a specific user command. A set of dedicated tongue movements could be tailored for each individual user based on his/her preferences, lifestyle, and remaining abilities, and mapped onto a set of customized functions for computer, PWC, and environmental access. Thus, TDS can offer a high degree of adaptability and cover a large group of users with different levels of disabilities. In addition, the TDS has the potential to provide its users with proportional control, which makes it a lot easier to maneuver PWCs in crowded and confined spaces. This research also involves a thorough evaluation of the TDS efficacy, usability and user acceptability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: We intend to help the most severely disabled individuals to live active, selfsupportive, satisfying, and productive lives, equal to the other members of the society. Paralysis is considered to be one of the most expensive types of disabilities. Solutions such as the TDS could help reduce healthcare and assisted-living costs, increase the employability of people with disabilities, and allow users to participate more fully in the society, while relieving their family members or dedicated caregivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational Plan: The PI's main educational objective is to stimulate the interests of undergraduate and graduate students by taking advantage of the 'multidisciplinary' nature of the proposed research. Undergraduates will be recruited through senior design and presidential undergraduate research award (PURA) to participate in development of the TDS graphical user&lt;br/&gt;interface. A graduate student will also be involved in the proposed research by developing the TDS hardware and sensor signal processing algorithms as well as helping with human trials.</AbstractNarration>
