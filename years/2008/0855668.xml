<AbstractNarration>This research program explores the physics of quantum coherence effects in optical crystals doped with rare-earth or transition metal ions. Such ions have atomic like structure of discrete energy levels in the band gap of the host materials. They are often refereed to as atomic gas lattices or frozen atomic gases. Their potential advantages are high atomic density, absence of atomic diffusion and collisions, compactness, scalability, robustness and compatibility with optical fiber communications.  We study the possibilities of the efficient control of both linear and nonlinear optical responses (such as resonant absorption, refractive index, group velocity, frequency conversion, etc.) based on excitation of the long lived spin coherence in these materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the broader impact the research program extends fundamental concepts of atomic and quantum optics to solid-state physics. The exploration of quantum coherence phenomena in solids may open realistic prospects for various applications, including quantum information storage and processing, improvement of spatial resolution, controllable optical delay lines, development of new solid-state lasers (in particular, in the traditionally difficult UV, VUV and X-ray frequency ranges), efficient frequency conversion, generation of ultimately short pulses, ultra-sensitive magnetometry, spectroscopy, metrology, and  others. It provides excellent opportunities for young researchers to be trained both theoretically and experimentally in the advanced fields of quantum, coherent, nonlinear and ultrafast optics, photonics, solid-state and laser physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual merit  1)      Control of resonant interaction of &gamma;-rays (x rays) with the nuclear ensembles   The concepts and ideas of coherent, nonlinear and quantum optics deeply penetrate into the range of 10-100 kiloelectronvolt (keV) photon energies, corresponding to gamma-ray (hard x-ray) radiation. Still the number of tools for coherent manipulation of gamma-photons-nuclear ensembles interactions remains rather limited. We demonstrate an efficient method to control the gamma-photons waveforms. It includes a transformation of the individual photons into a sequence of ultra-short pulses with the pulse duration much shorter than the initial photon duration (Fig.1b), into double humped pulse (so called "time-bin" qubit) and triangular pulse(Fig.1c) , insert).     The method is based on the resonant interaction of gamma-photons with an ensemble of nuclei, uniformly vibrating with frequency exceeding the linewidth of the resonant transition, and with amplitude exceeding the photonÆs wavelength. The developed technique is expected to give a strong impetus on emerging field of quantum gamma-optics, providing a basis for realization of the single gamma-photon-nuclear ensemble interfaces such as quantum memory protocols, quantum information processing and quantum communication.  2)      Control of resonant interaction of light with atomic ensembles  a) Attosecond pulses via periodically interrupted resonant interaction   A new method to produce VUV and XUV attosecond pulses based on the drastic transformation of this high-frequency radiation as a result of the propagation in the near-resonant optically thick medium, when the parameters of the resonant atomic transition are controlled by the strong low-frequency laser field (Fig.3). The potential advantages of the suggested method include high conversion efficiency, no need in the external phase synchronization, possibility to generate sub-femtosecond pulses in VUV, possibility to directly generate 10-100 attosecond pulses in the active media of XUV plasma lasers (Fig.4).      b) Quantum memories via continues phase matching control   . We suggested a new method, to store single potons which is based on the continuous phase-matching control in an extended resonant medium. Contrary to the other techniques, the method does not require neither a knowledge of the arriving moment of the signal photon and its shape no the preliminary preparation of the medium (such as introducing of the artificial inhomogeneous broadening or atomic frequency comb profile within the inhomogeneous absorption width).      c) Optically produced and controllable photonic structures   A method to produce a spatial modulation of the refractive index in the resonant atoms which are homogeneously distributed in space is suggested. It is based on the spatial modulation of the refractive index provided by an external standing wave of a laser field via the ac-Stark effect. It allows one to produce photonic structures in a homogeneous atomic media, such as dielectrics with the homogeneously distributed impurities, atomic, or molecular gases, simply by illuminating these materials with the standing waves of a laser field.     Broader Impact  1)      Control of resonant interaction &gamma;-rays (x rays) with the nuclear ensembles        A method to coherently control the temporal shapes of gamma-photons has been proposed and experimentally realized. It is based on the resonant interaction of gamma-photons with an ensemble of nuclei with modulated frequency of the quantum transition. Frequency modulation of the resonant atomic transition, achieved by a uniform vibration of the resonant absorber due to the Doppler effect. In particular, the temporal compression of an individual gamma-photon into coherent ultrashort pulse train or double humped pulse or triangular pulse has been demonstrated (Fig.1,2).      Due to extremely short wavelength (less than 1 &Aring;) the developed methods of coherent control of nucle...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
