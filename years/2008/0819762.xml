<AbstractNarration>The underlying mission of the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will enable - through interdisciplinary fundamental research, innovative educational outreach programs, and directed knowledge transfer - the development and understanding of new materials, structures, and theories that can impact the current and future needs of society. The Center supports a broad-based interdisciplinary research program. The research is conducted in three interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). These include Design of Nanomaterials for Electrochemical Energy Storage and Conversion (IRG I), which seeks to accurately model, predict, and determine how thermodynamics, phase behavior, and kinetics are modified at the nanoscale, and will use the resultant knowledge to design materials with energy and power-delivery capabilities far superior to those currently available. IRG II on Mechanomutable Heteronanomaterials aims to develop multicomponent polymeric systems with mechanical properties that can be changed on-demand for possible use in sensors and biological applications. Multimaterial Multifunctional Nano-Structured Fibers (IRG III) explores the design, fabrication, characterization, and physical phenomena of a new class of multicomponent nanoscale fiber materials containing conductors, semiconductors (glassy and crystalline) and insulators. In addition there are two Initiative Projects: Engineering Living Cells via Nanomaterials (Initiative I) and New States of Frustrated and Correlated Materials (Initiative II). The first initiative seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of how functionalized polymer multilayers can be integrated with living cells in a manner that preserves cell viability, and allows for new synthetically engineered functionality, whereas the second seeks to synthesize, characterize and examine the fundamental spin physics of new, single crystal materials based on a two-dimensional triangular and kagom√© lattice. The Center has a strong, wide-ranging education program directed toward graduate students, undergraduates, middle and high school students and K-12 teachers. Emphasis is placed on including underrepresented minorities in these programs. The education activities enjoy the broad participation of MIT students and faculty and are closely linked to complementary programs in other MIT administrative units. The Center operates shared facilities, including 1) a Materials Analysis Facility, 2) a Crystal Growth and Preparation Facility, 3) an Electron Microscopy Facility, and 4) an X-ray Diffraction Facility. The Center has an effective industrial outreach program, facilitated by a relationship with MIT's Industrial Liaison Program and Materials Processing Center.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Center as a whole - Intellectual Merit: MRSEC supported research, educational outreach activities and industrial interactions have resulted in numerous important achievements that have had wide-ranging impact from the education of the next generation of scientific leaders to the transfer of critical fundamental knowledge to industry and other researchers around the world.  During this grant, MRSEC-supported faculty have published about 320 papers citing prime and partial MRSEC support including many in high profile journals such as Science, Nature, Nano letters, and PNAS.  About 45% of these papers were authored by two or more MRSEC-supported faculty members: a testimony to the highly collaborative research enabled by our center.  More than 90 graduate students and post-docs have launched their careers after being trained in a highly interdisciplinary MRSEC environment.  Broader Impact: In the educational outreach arena, about 6470 total participants have benefited from our various programs including 668 core participants (those spending a week or more at MIT) and about 5800 special program participants (MIT Museum Day, Cambridge Science Festival, etc.).  Our diversity focused strategic efforts have resulted in an average overall center program (educational outreach participants, graduate students, post-docs, faculty, etc.) populated with 45% women and 15% minorities. Our Shared experimental facilities (SEFs) supported the research of about 1,100 individual users per year from within MIT and outside companies, universities and hospitals. Pioneering research supported by the MIT MRSEC on the use of high-throughput computing to accelerate innovation in the energy sector helped to establish the framework for President Obama√Üs recently launched (2011) Materials Genome Initiative.  Research Achievements: The MIT MRSEC collaborative research programs included interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs), and seed and initiative projects.  Key accomplishments are outlined below.  IRG-I:  Design of Nanomaterials for Electrochemical Energy Storage and Conversion: This IRG sought to model, predict, and determine how thermodynamics, phase behavior, and kinetics are modified at the nanoscale, and use the resultant knowledge to design battery materials with power-delivery capabilities superior to those currently available. They provided to the scientific community a suite of advanced in-situ techniques useful for probing key performance issues with lithium based batteries.  They also pioneered the use of self-replicating viruses to template the low temperature growth of nanomaterials relevant to energy technologies such as batteries and fuel cells.  In addition, they have demonstrated the value of using computational methodologies to predict new material properties and significantly decrease the time from materials discovery to real world applications.  IRG-II: Mechanomutable Heteronanomaterials: This IRG worked to discover and develop new tunable nanostructured systems with an emphasis on mechanical behavior. Research by this group has revealed through atomistic-based multiscale simulations and experiments that the concept of geometrically controlled "mechanomutability" &ndash; i.e. the capability of a material to change its mechanical properties reversibly in response to an external stimulus as mediated by shape and size is indeed realizable.  IRG-III: Multimaterial Multifunctional Nano-Structured Fibers: This IRG explored a new class of multicomponent nanoscale fiber materials containing conductors, semiconductors (glassy and crystalline) and insulators.  They demonstrated that it is possible to incorporate into readily manufactured fibers an amazing range of new materials and functionality including piezoelectric effects, photonic nanostructures, nanowire arrays, and a variety of electronic and optical devices.  This approach has enabled, for the first time, the creation of fibers with a high density of electrical interconnects that may b...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
