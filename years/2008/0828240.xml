<AbstractNarration>SES-0828240&lt;br/&gt;Lingxin Hao&lt;br/&gt;Mindelyn Buford, II&lt;br/&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research will study the processes by which highly-educated, foreign-born, Black persons (Nigerian and Ghanaian immigrants) integrate into U.S. society.  Specifically, it will examine how Nigerian and Ghanaian immigrants (1) make the decision to migrate to the United States despite racial inequality in the U.S.; (2) become recognized as part of Black and foreign-born groups by the U.S. government, society, and labor market; and (3) assimilate into different sectors of the society. Data is collected through a background survey, in-depth interviews, social network analysis, and "shadowing" observations with Nigerian and Ghanaian immigrants residing in Maryland.  These data will be supplemented by archival research on the social structure of the home societies to provide a complete view of migrant backgrounds and experiences.  These migrants have a class advantage, but race disadvantage in the U.S., and thus provide an interesting case to compare to other non-White immigrants and native-born African Americans.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study has broader implications for education, social science research, and society.  First, it will promote teaching, training and learning as the research design, methodology, empirical findings, and theory construction will be integrated into courses on migration, race and ethnicity, social inequality, and research methodology.  Second, the research could potentially inform the process of how to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups. Finally, findings from this study could inform policy debates in the U.S., Nigeria, and Ghana on migration, race, and ethnicity.</AbstractNarration>
