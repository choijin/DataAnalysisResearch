<AbstractNarration>Engineering Other - (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the rate of technological change growing rapidly and technological systems becoming increasingly complex, engineers capable of designing adaptable systems from both a systems level and a component level are needed for the US to remain competitive. Addressing this problem requires a transformative change in engineering education. Thus, a long-term goal of this project is to make this transformation a reality across the nation. Short-term goals of the project include the development of Technology Leaders, a transportable interdisciplinary program that will prepare engineers and technicians to lead geographically-distributed teams in the designing and building of multiscale agile systems.  Building on prior work at the University of Virginia, Central Virginia Community College, and the Learning Factory at Penn State, the Technology Leaders program will integrate three elements: a new interdisciplinary, design-focused undergraduate curriculum; the hands-on Multiscale Agile Systems Technology Lab (MAST Lab); and applied summer educational experiences for students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary impact of this work was the development of an interdisciplinary engineering program, the Technology Leaders Program (TLP), that engages students in both system level and component level design.  Students from both the University of Virginia and Piedmont Virginia Community College participate in the TLP, with the community college students being able to transfer to the University of Virginia to complete their BachelorÆs degree.  Demonstrating such a program is a significant impact in that a) in being interdisciplinary, it aligns more closely with real engineering work experienced after graduation than traditional engineering programs and b) in focusing on both systems and components, addresses the development of high level knowledge and skills normally acquired only after graduation through experience.  Unfortunately, most engineering graduates still have little if any experiences working with students from other disciplines on real projects. The status quo is for students to gain few if any real world engineering design experiences through classes and, when they do, to work on such projects with other students from their own discipline and only in their senior year.  The Technology Leaders Program changes this completely, engaging students in interdisciplinary design experiences during every academic year.  Furthermore, typical undergraduate engineering education focuses solely on teaching component level design skills. Systems level skills &ndash; skills focused on integrating components into larger systems &ndash; are left to be developed through experience.  The Technology Leaders Program is designed specifically to engage electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering students in systems integration as they are developing their component level design skills within their majors.   At the same time, the TLP exposes systems engineering students to component level design while they are learning system integration skills within their major. We are able to create such a unique educational program due to the availability of low cost technologies that enable hands-on design opportunities for students.  Electrical prototyping with microcontrollers and sensors, mechanical prototyping with motors, actuators, and 3d printing, and systems and information prototyping with information and analytics systems are all accessible at low cost.  To this end, we have developed an integrated systems design studio outfitted with all of the equipment and resources necessary for the rapid development of integrated electromechanical systems. In addition to the development of the Technology Leaders Program, we also conducted engineering education research related to student learning of interdisciplinary engineering design knowledge and skills.  Among the key findings to date are:Interdisciplinarity means something different to engineering than it does in the humanities (where the majority of the prior work in interdisciplinarity has been conducted).  The single largest difference is that interdisciplinarity within engineering engages a team of specialists who need to know how to work together; with the humanities, interdisciplinary skills have mainly been studied within individuals where, for instance, one person is able to use the language and theories from multiple disciplines to analyze an issue.  Conceptions of leadership among female students are different than those of their male counterparts, with males associating leadership with directing teamwork, running meetings, and project oversight and females associating leadership with facilitating collaboration among team members, being responsible, and contributing to the team.  These findings align with the larger literature on this topic. Given that engineering is male-dominated in the United States &ndash; and that interdisciplinarity in engineering is inherently linked to teamwork (see first bullet) &ndash; this discrepancy of leadership perspectives impacts the experience of fema...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
