    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: Estimating Compensated Discount&lt;br/&gt;Functions&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Boston University&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 07/11/08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research uses economic experiments to empirically test fundamental theories&lt;br/&gt;about how people make economic decisions in dynamic situations. Existing&lt;br/&gt;experiments on intertemporal choice do not provide conclusive evidence for or against&lt;br/&gt;these theories, because they do not control for the fact that subjects might expect&lt;br/&gt;changes in their future financial situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators conduct a series of experiments designed to address this problem. In&lt;br/&gt;their experiments, they ask subjects to decide between dated prizes that are contingent&lt;br/&gt;on the subject's real income. The prizes are either a money payment to the subject or a&lt;br/&gt;contribution to a charity chosen by the subject.&lt;br/&gt;The experiments are conducted in Iceland in collaboration with researchers from the&lt;br/&gt;Internal Revenue Services of Iceland and the University of Reykjavik. Iceland is unique&lt;br/&gt;because under Icelandic law personal income tax returns are public information, so the&lt;br/&gt;investigators will be able to determine each subjects actual earned income in future&lt;br/&gt;years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will resolve a debate in economics that is directly relevant for public&lt;br/&gt;policy. Researchers have been concerned that many people do not make consistent&lt;br/&gt;choices in dynamic situations. If this is the case, then society may be better off with&lt;br/&gt;public policies that constrain individual choices about retirement savings, unhealthy&lt;br/&gt;behaviors, and other goods where an individual may choose pleasure today despite&lt;br/&gt;large costs in the future. The results will tell us if inconsistent choices are truly a&lt;br/&gt;widespread phenomenon.</AbstractNarration>
