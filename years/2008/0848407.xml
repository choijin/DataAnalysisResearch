<AbstractNarration>There has been a recent large increase in interdisciplinary research that combines work in computer science, information technology, and creativity. This workshop brings together the researchers that have been funded by the CreativeIT program at the National Science Foundation to discuss advances, research issues, and the future related to the following topics:&lt;br/&gt;Understanding Creative Cognition and Computation. Research in this area leads to cognitive models that serve as inspiration for computational models of creativity, support for human creativity, and approaches for educating people to be more creative. &lt;br/&gt;Creativity to Stimulate Breakthroughs in Science and Engineering. This area considers the role and performance of artists in developing new technologies, discovering new patterns in information, and in finding new ways of seeing, knowing, and doing computer and information science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;Educational Approaches that Encourage Creativity. This area considers a broad range of approaches to teaching that encourages creativity: multi-disciplinary teaching and learning, design studio teaching, skills development through making and doing, and open-ended problem-based learning. &lt;br/&gt;Supporting Creativity with Information Technology. This area both develops new software and user interfaces to support users in being more creative and evaluates their performance through user studies either in controlled environments with empirical studies or in the context of a complex problem or situation with ethnographic studies.</AbstractNarration>
