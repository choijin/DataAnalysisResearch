<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the development of general principled methods&lt;br/&gt;to efficiently include domain knowledge expressed as constraints into &lt;br/&gt;clustering algorithms. This not only allows improved clustering quality &lt;br/&gt;and algorithm performance but also finding insights that are novel and &lt;br/&gt;useful with respect to existing domain expertise. For example, phylogenetic &lt;br/&gt;trees built using hierarchical clustering should be consistent with existing &lt;br/&gt;domain knowledge such as that several species could not have evolved from &lt;br/&gt;one another. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing clustering under constraints work has focused on non-hierarchical &lt;br/&gt;clustering with conjunctions of must-link and cannot-link constraints that &lt;br/&gt;assert that two objects must or must not be in the same cluster. This work &lt;br/&gt;can be interpreted as expressing knowledge using a limited logic comprised &lt;br/&gt;of instances as objects, two binary relations (must-link and cannot-link) &lt;br/&gt;and a single connector (and).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make three primary contributions. Firstly, it will examine &lt;br/&gt;a more complete logic to represent knowledge by adding in new relations, a &lt;br/&gt;complete set of connectives (not, and, or, implication), universal and &lt;br/&gt;existential quantifiers and new objects. This logic can express a large &lt;br/&gt;variety of knowledge such as minimum/maximum cluster separation, cluster &lt;br/&gt;width and even forcing distributions of certain objects across clusters. &lt;br/&gt;Secondly, it will investigate incorporating constraints beyond non-hierarchical &lt;br/&gt;clustering algorithms into algorithms for hierarchical agglomerative clustering, &lt;br/&gt;graph and social network clustering, and feature selection for clustering. &lt;br/&gt;Lastly, it will explore the computational challenges of using constraints by &lt;br/&gt;identifying easy to satisfy sets of constraints and developing a framework to &lt;br/&gt;explain why some constraint sets are more useful than others.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will demonstrate and validate its technical contributions on two &lt;br/&gt;core application domains: analysis of pandemic micro-simulations results to &lt;br/&gt;aid in disaster preparation and image mining. The long term vision is to &lt;br/&gt;incorporate knowledge efficiently in a principled manner into other data mining &lt;br/&gt;tasks such as classification, anomaly detection and association rules.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project outreach for high school and undergraduates students will be in the &lt;br/&gt;form of hands-on discovery learning courses with emphasis on the two core &lt;br/&gt;application domains. For graduate students and researchers the tutorial slides, &lt;br/&gt;papers, datasets and software generated from the project will be freely &lt;br/&gt;available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on this project may be found at the URLs &lt;br/&gt;http://www.constrained-clustering.org and http://www.cs.albany.edu/~davidson.</AbstractNarration>
