<AbstractNarration>The investigator plans to adapt his simplified algorithm of Hironaka's resolution of singularities to different types of resolution problems. The Hironaka theorem on resolution of singularities plays a central role in Algebraic Geometry. It constitutes a basis of proofs of many theorems in Algebraic and Analytic Geometry. The theorem on desingularization is proven in characteristic zero and is known only in some special cases in positive characteristic. This is a major drawback for many theorems which rely on desingularization and which can be proven in characteristic zero only. The project deals with studying some new ideas and developing  a new relatively simple approach to the resolution problem in positive characteristic. By suitable modification of the basic notions (like order, marked ideals and etc) introduced in the algorithm in characteristic zero the investigator plans to approach the problem of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic. The new notions open some new possibilities  in related areas. In particular, the new invariant proposed in the project, so called p-order, may have interesting applications in  problems related to studying singularities in positive characteristic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal splits into two parts. First, the investigator plans to show how &lt;br/&gt;to reduce in a canonical way the resolution of general singularities to the singularities of the special form (singularities of Giraud hypersurfaces of maximal contact). Understanding these singularities is considered to be the key for solving the problem. Second, the investigator plans to approach the resolution of singularities by using the introduced language and the inductive scheme developed in the first part. Although the problem seems very difficult, using new tools significantly simplifies it and allows us to better understand the problem in many particular situations. Moreover the investigator plans to analyze and generalize the simplified algorithms of Hironaka desingularization and the Weak factorization from the point of view of further potential applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Project summary   The project deals mainly with three major topics in Algebraic Geometry:   -factorization of birational maps  - the invariants of singularities  - resolution of singularities      In one of the papers written jointly  with Donu Arapura and Parsa Bakhtary   the investigator strengthens  his Weak factorization Theorem.  The generalization says that given two birationally equivalent compact nonsingular algebraic varieties  together with simple normal crossing divisors i.e. subsets locally analytically isomorphic  to unions of coordinate hyperplanes in the affine space, there exits  a sequence of , so called, monoidal transformations which transform one of the sets ( a variety with the divisor ) into the other.      The main difference is that we do not require the complements of the simple normal crossing subvarieties to be isomorphic ( they are just birational).     This powerful tool allows to compare two seemingly very different objects by reducing the comparison to very simple  monoidal transformations. The latter are easy to describe and control. This allows, for instance, to establish some new birational invariants.  As an application of the strengthening of the Weak factorization theorem we show that the dual complexes associated with  a variety and a simple normal crossings subvariety  are very  similar ( homotopically equivalent) for biartionaly equivalent varieties. In particular their cohomology and homotopy groups are identical.  2. The above  allows us to construct the invariant of singular points i.e. the points where the  variety is not locally isomorphic to an affine space. A possible invariant is a homotopy type of the dual complex of the fiber of a sufficiently good resolution of singularities or the cohomology and homotopy group of this dual complex. We also study some of these invariants from a different perspective of, so called, Deligne weight filtration. As was shown by Deligne one can find inside the cohomology groups  of algebraic varieties some uniquely defined sequence of nested subgroups forming a Weight filtration.    In particular, this can be related to the dual complexes associated to the fibers of a sufficiently good resolution of singularities.   The investigator  shows  jointly  with the coauthors that the higher cohomoloqy groups of the  dual complex associated to a good resolution of  rational hypersurface singularity vanish. This  is  motivated by a classical results of Artin for rational surfaces.    3. In the previous papers the investigator gave a simplified proof of the celebrated Hironaka resolution theorem. It says  that any algebraic variety X over a field of characteristic zero (or an analytic space)  can be desingularize i.e. there exists a  nonsingular variety Y and  an proper birational map from Y to X,       Building upon the above the simplification the investigator   jointly  with Bierstone,  Grigoriev and Milman gives in one of the recent papers  an effective algorithmic description of the  Hironaka resolution algorithm. They found the estimates  for the vital functions: degree of polynomials, number of monoidal transformations, and  the number of operations needed to complete the algorithm. This is a fundamental question when dealing with algorithms and its computational and practical aspects. In particular, it has already  found some  recent applications  over the fields of positive characteristic. One can show that if the degree of polynomials defining  a variety and their number is relatively small comparing to the characteristic then the variety can be desingularize.    Intellectual merit: Good understanding and description of singular points is  critical for many problems in Algebraic geometry and far beyond, as these points contain vital information for  studying algebraic and analytic varieties, and more general spaces.  The Hironaka theorem on resolution of singularities plays a central role  in Algebraic Geometry. It constitutes a basis  of proofs o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
