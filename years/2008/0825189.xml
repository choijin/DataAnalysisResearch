<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to pattern, at the nanoscale, functional nanomaterials for electronics and sensing applications.  The patterning will be accomplished using a novel, elastic nanoimprinter, as opposed to the traditional rigid nanoimprinters, which greatly alleviates the need for precision alignment between stamper and substrate, and allows multi-layer nanoimprinting.  This new manufacturing method makes possible the nanopatterning of functional nanomaterials such as metal conductive traces synthesized from nanoparticles.  These metal conductive traces are first deposited as a nanoparticle ink, patterned by a nanostamper, and subsequently sintered at low temperatures to form fully continuous, low-resistance metal traces that are fully compatible with a wide variety of polymer substrates and active materials.  The approach taken in this research is to 1) characterize the fluidic and thermal properties of nanoparticle solutions (nanoparticle inks), 2) characterize the mechanical properties of nanoimprinting stamps for improved fidelity nanopatterning, 3) conduct both experiments and theoretical analysis of thermal sintering of nanoparticles, 4) make a quantitative analysis of the adhesion between the nanoimprinted features and substrates, 5) perform an analysis of the influence of mechanical deformation on the performance of nanoimprinted materials and 6) develop multi-layer, multi-material nanoimprinting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits and broad impact of this research will be a new, low-cost, high-performance manufacturing technology that will eliminate the need for both vacuum and lift-off processes. Nanoimprinting via elastic stampers also allows multi-layer materials to be imprinted.  This new manufacturing technology will make possible major cost reductions and major quality improvements in flat panel displays, large area electronics, electronics on flexible substrates.  Other benefits include new technologies for the creation of biodetection circuits.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
