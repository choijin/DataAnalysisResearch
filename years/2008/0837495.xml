<AbstractNarration>Loyola University, in collaboration with the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, proposes a planning project for an effort to broaden participation in computing among students in the densely populated Chicago metropolitan area.  Proposed activities will focus on a coordinated effort at high school outreach: extensive metro-wide outreach to high schools growing out of a rich network of connections among college and high school students, faculty, and staff that includes an emphasis on interdisciplinary work as well as exposure to varied career paths, and community-building activities.  Proposed activities are designed not only to cultivate a larger, stronger, and more diverse corps of computing professionals but also one that is more outward-looking and more service-oriented.  This project is seen as the first step in building a larger Alliance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project involved a number of activities to engage underrepresented minorities in computing, with a goal of generating interest and deepening their understanding of the concepts and opportunities in computing.  We worked with middle school girls, high school girls, undergraduate women and K-12 teachers. Computer science faculty and education researchers collaborated to develop an age appropriate computing curriculum for middle school students that included many interactive activities along with computer programming.  The curriculum was used during a two-week computer discovery camp offered during the summers of 2010 and 2011.  The studentsÆ attitudes around computing were evaluated along with the camp activities.  In response to strong interest of the summer campers, we have developed a Saturday computing activity series that is ongoing.  The initial effort and demonstrated success of the camp has been leveraged to get the resources necessary to continue the summer camp and school year activities.     This project got undergraduate women and a K-12 teacher involved in computing research.  One of the main research projects involved a newly formed collaboration with Chicago Zoological SocietyÆs Brookfield Zoo around mobile devices and social networks.  The undergraduates played a significant creative role in developing the project and characterizing the wireless environment.  The  undergraduates shared their research project experiences with middle school students during the summer camps and high school students during open houses and on planned outreach visits.  Along with descriptions of the undergraduates research and educational experiences, we conveyed the breadth of computing and highlighted computing career opportunities.
