<AbstractNarration>Improved meteorological simulations for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) will be developed for further analysis of data from the 2006 MILAGRO (Megacity Initiative: Local Global and Research Observations) field campaign. The objective is to better understand meteorology and air pollution in the MCMA and regional effects of the MCMA plume. Satellite remote sensing data will be used to evaluate and improve numerical weather simulations, with a focus on urban impacts on local meteorology such as the urban heat island and urban-induced circulations. Data assimilation techniques will be used to improve the simulations and to better quantify uncertainties. Forward and backward trajectories based on the meteorological analyses will be used to evaluate mixing processes in the Mexico City basin and the impact of different source regions on air quality. Data on gas and aerosol phase concentrations will be combined with trajectory simulations to further identify possible source regions and to evaluate the strength of impacts from known sources, including industrial, volcanic, and biological. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will assist in the development of science-based environmental policies for Mexico City as well as provide insights into other urban areas worldwide. Visualization tools will be used to demonstrate air quality issues and to increase stakeholder participation through workshops and outreach activities with both government agencies and local academic and research institutions. The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students as well as research and mentoring opportunities for a graduate student and a post-doctoral researcher who will be involved in the analysis and modeling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Using advanced meteorological models and transport models, this project promoted the analysis of measurements taken during a large international field campaign held in Mexico City and the surrounding region. We explored the adverse health effects of particulate matter and identified atmospheric tar balls in fresh forest fire smoke. We estimated the emissions and the transport of pollution from a large industrial complex outside the city and found a novel way of comparing the computer simulations of the pollution plume with data obtained from satellites. We characterized particle aging and processing in the region by combining simulations with measurements taken by aircrafts and by controlled ("CMET") balloons. We identified possible sources of lead which is a neurotoxin. Finally, we showed that there is a significant heat island in Mexico City that varies according to the time of year and the time of day. Models were used to explore the impact of increased vegetation in the basin on the heat island.     This project supported the training of a graduate and undergraduate student in the sciences. The investigator was involved in presentations and meetings with policy makers regarding ways of improving air quality. An all-day training class was given on using trajectory modeling to better understand air pollution. Outreach presentations were made to school and community groups. The high school visits were based on a combination of role playing, numerical estimation games and active learning which led to very positive feedback from the students.     The Research Opportunity Award enabled undergraduate students from Carleton College to acquire and analyze data from single-particle mass spectrometry experiments.  Analysis has focused on the metals detected in the particles, as well as on the bromine detected over the past few years in the Milwaukee area.  The students involved in the project have had multiple opportunities to present their work at various national meetings, including the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR)Æs annual "Posters on the Hill" event in 2010, with an audience of politicians and government staff.  Both students have since graduated from Carleton and are continuing into graduate study.  The students are both women and one is a first-generation college student.
