<AbstractNarration>Scholarship assistance is being provided to two cohorts of full-time undergraduates (1) majoring in Computer Science (CSC) or (2) majoring in Information Technology (IT) or Mathematics (MTH) with a minor in CSC... The project focuses on increasing enrollment in CSC and maximizing student retention, graduation rates, and placement in careers and/or graduate schools. Scholarship recipients are benefiting from a network of support services provided by the Mathematics and Computer Sciences Department, faculty advisors, and the Student Financial Services and Career Services Offices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are strongly encouraged to augment their primary major by either taking a minor in a related field or by having a second major. The scholars are encouraged to engage in research projects (either as independent study or as joint faculty-student projects) and to participate in internship and co-op placements. Faculty interaction with professional and public organizations and with industry serves to provide additional opportunities for student research, internships, and co-op placements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
