    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: Synthesis and Integration of Magmagenetic Controls for&lt;br/&gt;Subduction Factory focus sites&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The MARGINS program ends in 2009, and the organization,&lt;br/&gt;synthesis, and integration of the most important results is a high priority for each of the&lt;br/&gt;four experiments. This proposal outlines a 3-year collaborative effort (between 5 US and&lt;br/&gt;2 Japanese scientists) to do this for key aspects of the Subduction Factory experiment.&lt;br/&gt;In co-operation with the LDEO database group, geochemical and isotopic data for fresh,&lt;br/&gt;young igneous rocks from the Izu-Bonin-Mariana and Central America Subduction&lt;br/&gt;Factory focus sites will be compiled and filtered to generate a Subduction Factory&lt;br/&gt;Geochemical Reference Library of high-quality data for each arc system. Forward&lt;br/&gt;models to explain the most important differences between the chemical and isotopic&lt;br/&gt;compositions of lavas erupted from the volcanic front and rear-arc volcanoes at the two&lt;br/&gt;focus sites will be generated and tested against compositions in this Library. Models will&lt;br/&gt;be site-specific, using all available geophysical observations to generate thermal&lt;br/&gt;structure and melt distribution models appropriate for each focus site. Best estimates for&lt;br/&gt;the compositions of subducted sediments and oceanic crust at each focus site will be&lt;br/&gt;used as input to thermodynamic models simulating equilibrium metamorphic reactions,&lt;br/&gt;dehydration, and melting of subducted sediments and oceanic crust (slab) within the&lt;br/&gt;subduction zone. Interaction of these slab fluids and melts with overlying mantle&lt;br/&gt;peridotite to yield primitive basalt will be modeled using the "Arc Basalt Simulator"&lt;br/&gt;(ABS), an Excel macro that explicitly separates key forcing functions and is designed to&lt;br/&gt;be flexible and accessible. Several improvements to ABS will also be accomplished&lt;br/&gt;during this project.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is in response to calls for synthesis and integration efforts&lt;br/&gt;by the 2004 MARGINS Review Committee. Dissemination of results and training Earth&lt;br/&gt;scientists to use ABS will be accomplished at two free workshops at national scientific&lt;br/&gt;meetings. A lesson plan that uses ABS and the Subduction Factory Geochemical&lt;br/&gt;Library to explore the most important controls on subduction-zone magma genesis will&lt;br/&gt;be developed; this will be aimed at upper division Geoscience majors and beginning&lt;br/&gt;graduate students. Broader dissemination of the most important results to the general&lt;br/&gt;public will be accomplished via development of a Wikipedia entry for "Subduction&lt;br/&gt;Factory".&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0840794 PI Name:Stern, Robert&lt;br/&gt;Printed</AbstractNarration>
