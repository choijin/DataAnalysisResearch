<AbstractNarration>The investigator will work on two projects connected with arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;geometry.  The first project is to study the existence of rational&lt;br/&gt;points in algebraic families of varieties, and to build a library of&lt;br/&gt;diophantine subsets of the field of rational numbers, where a&lt;br/&gt;diophantine set in this context means the set of rational parameter&lt;br/&gt;values for which the corresponding variety in a family has a rational&lt;br/&gt;point.  In particular, the investigator will explore families whose&lt;br/&gt;fibers are Chatelet surfaces or more complicated conic bundles, for&lt;br/&gt;which the Brauer-Manin obstruction produces interesting diophantine&lt;br/&gt;sets.  A long-term goal of the first project is to construct a model&lt;br/&gt;of the integers using diophantine sets, because this would disprove a&lt;br/&gt;conjecture of Mazur regarding topology of rational points and&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously prove the undecidability of the problem of deciding&lt;br/&gt;whether a multivariable polynomial equation has a rational solution.&lt;br/&gt;The second project is to study countable unions of subvarieties over a&lt;br/&gt;countable algebraically closed field, such as the field of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;numbers, and in particular to prove that in naturally occurring&lt;br/&gt;situations, there exists a closed point outside the countable union,&lt;br/&gt;as required for various constructions.  Examples include the union of&lt;br/&gt;rational curves in a non-uniruled variety, the moduli space locus of&lt;br/&gt;abelian varieties isogenous to a Jacobian, the locus in the base of a&lt;br/&gt;family of varieties where the Picard number of the fiber jumps, and&lt;br/&gt;unions of subvarieties arising from iteration of endomorphisms of&lt;br/&gt;varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arithmetic geometry lies at the intersection of number theory and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry: like algebraic geometry, it studies the solutions&lt;br/&gt;to multivariable polynomial equations, but it does so under the&lt;br/&gt;number-theoretic restriction that the coordinates of the solutions be&lt;br/&gt;integers (whole numbers like -37) or rational numbers (fractions like&lt;br/&gt;-3/5) or perhaps elements of some other number system different from&lt;br/&gt;the traditional systems of real numbers or complex numbers.  Such&lt;br/&gt;questions were studied for their intrinsic interest since the time of&lt;br/&gt;the ancient Greeks, and in the 20th century they found unforeseen&lt;br/&gt;applications to cryptography and error-correcting codes.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator's research focuses not on these applications, but on the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions underlying and surrounding them, such as the&lt;br/&gt;question of whether it is possible to write a computer program to&lt;br/&gt;decide whether an arbitrary multivariable polynomial equation has a&lt;br/&gt;solution in rational numbers.  The research covered by this grant will&lt;br/&gt;study patterns in families of equations in the hope of deducing a&lt;br/&gt;negative answer, while also proving the existence of solutions&lt;br/&gt;satisfying infinitely many constraints in a larger number system.</AbstractNarration>
