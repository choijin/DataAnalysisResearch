<AbstractNarration>Atmospheric Sciences (41)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two modules are being developed for "Weather and the Atmosphere" and "Analysis of Climate and Weather Observations". These two courses are part of the undergraduate curricula in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado.  The primary motivation behind this effort is to provide students with opportunities for 'hands-on' experiences using environmental sensors and data. This project is using rooftop laboratory instruments and measurements of fundamental parameters to help students understand radiative processes in the Earth's atmosphere and to investigate key elements of the hydrological cycle. At the introductory undergraduate level students are becoming familiar with environmental sensors and their operation and are being introduced to applications of data on a phenomenological level. Upper-division undergraduate students are using these data to develop a quantitative understanding of the radiative energy budget at the surface, to compare with model simulations, and to gain a practical understanding of instrument and measurement theory, sensor calibration, and measurement uncertainties. The progress and effectiveness of this project is being determined by external evaluators at the University of Colorado. The evaluation approach involves a series of formative and summative tools (both qualitative and quantitative) and is intended to help determine the impact of the proposed curriculum on participating students.</AbstractNarration>
