<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Washington State University is deeply committed to fostering an environment that pro-motes diversity. Despite this commitment, challenges remain in achieving gender equity among the faculty and leadership in sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The premise of the Excellence in Sciences and Engineering (EXCELinSE) at WSU&lt;br/&gt;project is that women are lost from the academy at critical transition points: after the PhD; pre- tenure; post-tenure; and at personal milestones (e.g., childbirth). Our project goals are to: (1) increase representation of women in STEM disciplines by providing institutional support at these critical points; (2) develop/disseminate innovative strategies for other research-intensive, rural, land grant universities; and (3) create an infrastructure that provides the highest institutional support, and insures transformation beyond the lifetime of the grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our four major initiatives are: (1) Preparing and Recruiting a Diverse Faculty, designed to encourage new women STEM PhD graduates to consider academic careers; (2) Work/Life Initiative, to address institutional and individual barriers to retention and advancement for all university faculty members; (3) Leadership Training Initiative, which addresses climate and leadership barriers to recruitment, retention and advancement; and (4) Institutionalizing Transformation Initiative, which is aimed at organizing, monitoring and assessing institutional progress, and disseminating best practices to the broader academic community. These initiatives will be implemented through the Center for EXCELinSE at WSU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These initiatives include innovations that address our unique situation and have the potential to impact our peer institutions, including: (1) The EXCELinSE Summer Doctoral Fellows program, where women STEM PhD candidates from other research institutions spend the summer on the WSU-Pullman campus, attending workshops on research and academic careers, receiving mentoring from faculty members in STEM disciplines, and working on completing their dissertations; (2) The Dual-Career Partnership with University of Idaho, to provide reciprocal partner accommodation resources at both universities; (3) The Infant Care Placeholder program; and (4) The External Mentoring program, in which STEM faculty women are linked with successful women faculty at other universities for mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The research component of this project will provide insights into diffusion of new practices through academic organizations and the impact on departmental cultures and leadership. By identifying the departmental-level factors that enhance or inhibit the institutionalization of initiatives, this research will benefit other institutions seeking transformation. We will both import successful ADVANCE initiatives from other institutions and demonstrate our own innovative initiatives that are unique to our situation (e.g., the Dual Career Partnership with the University of Idaho), that will benefit both WSU and the broader research university community (e.g., the EXCLEinSE Summer Doctoral Fellows Program), that are applicable to research-intensive, rural, land-grant institutions (e.g., Infant Care Placeholder program), or that are applicable to the general academy (e.g., the External Mentoring program).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. Addressing the special challenges associated with women faculty in STEM disciplines at small, rural communities has implications for other similar institutions. For example, the Summer Doctoral Fellows program will benefit not only WSU but other research institutions that hire the fellows after they complete the program. This project will advance our understanding of the impact of preparing future faculty for the professoriate, creating a work/life responsive workplace, and leadership initiatives on attracting, recruiting, and advancing women in academic STEM disciplines.  Improving the climate for all faculty will result in the retention and advancement of a diverse faculty which provides more role models for students. This will ultimately lead to increases in students pursuing careers in STEM, thus addressing a national need.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Whereas some of the activities associated these initiatives have been more focused on Intellectual Merit, others have emphasized Broader Impacts, with both types of activities benefiting their direct participants, and the WSU community at large. The latter are particularly relevant to the Institutional Transformation objective, aimed at organizing, monitoring and assessing institutional progress, and disseminating results and best practices to the broader academic community. Not only have the most successful of the ADVANCE programs (noted below) have been institutionalized at WSU and extended to Under-represented Minority (URM) male faculty in any discipline, supported by the provost&rsquo;s office going forward, many of &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; developed in the context of ADVACE related activities are being implemented at WSU as well. For example, Implicit Bias presentations/trainings, developed in the context of ADVANCE, are being utilized in current job searches (e.g., Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture), and have been disseminated to WSU Human Resources office. The Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) reporting, initiated under the ADVANCE grant from NSF, has provided important benchmarks with respect to faculty satisfaction with various aspects of their professional life at WSU, enabling us to compare our scores to those of &ldquo;peer&rdquo; institutions. Continued use of these metrics, supported by the WSU provost, will enable us to make sure that ongoing institutionalized ADVANCE programs at WSU continue to be as&nbsp; effective as the NSF funded efforts have been. For example, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">External Mentor Program</span> aimed primarily at Intellectual Merit and administered under the Leadership Training Initiative, has resulted in 50 successful scientific collaborations between WSU faculty and recognized experts from external institutions, already resulting in multiple presentations/publications, as well as grant proposals. Importantly, this program had a positive impact on its participants, as for example, they indicted it was very beneficial to their career development in the feedback we obtained. Activities under the Work/Life and Preparing and Recruiting a Diverse Faculty Initiatives, have been associated primarily with Broader Impacts, with all of these efforts benefiting the WSU community at large, and enhancing the contributions of its constituents. For example, the ADVANCE <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&ldquo;Transitions&rdquo; Program</span>, institutionalized at WSU and supported by the provost&rsquo;s office going forward, provides resources to URM faculty across all of our colleges/departments, along with women in STEM disciplines. This move toward a long- term/sustainable administration of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transitions Program</span> is a result of the success and perceived/reported benefits of this program, which enables faculty to obtain short-term assistance with work-related duties during situations that involve significant personal challenges (e.g., illness, child birth, etc.). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SelectPlus</span> represents institutionalization of the NSF ADVANCE Sitter City, supported by WSU&rsquo;s Human Resource Services (HRS), and makes access to care-providers available for all faculty and staff. Importantly, activities performed under the Preparing and Recruiting a Diverse Faculty Initiative have continued to inform the WSU community at large regarding issues critical to successful recruitment and retention of diverse faculty. For example, a number of workshops and presentations have been offered on the subject of Implicit Bias, and its impact on hiring practices. In addition, multiple speakers, most currently Dr. Billie J. Swalla, Professor of Biology and Director of the Friday Harbor Marine Laboratories, provided information regarding best practices and strategies for preparing, recruiting, and supporting diverse faculty at their institutions.
