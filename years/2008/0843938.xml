<AbstractNarration>Healthy humans effortlessly and accurately perform a wide range of voluntary movements and actions.  Considerable work has revealed many brain sites involved in performing voluntary actions, including areas in the frontal and parietal cortices.  By contrast, substantially less is known about brain areas which are involved in the intention to move and when and how these intention-related brain sites mediate movement planning.  The current project will use neuroimaging to identify regions in the human cerebral cortex that contribute to planning and preparing voluntary movements.  They will also use and novel mathematical methods and analysis tools to describe when each brain region becomes involved in the action planning and the interactions among brain regions.  The project outcome will yield a spatial and temporal map of brain activity related to action intention.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include development of analysis tools that can to assess patterns of brain activity related to basic human functions of sensation, perception, thought and action.  The methods may also be useful to any system that has sets of time-varying signals, particularly brain-computer interfaces.  The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students, some of whom participate in K though 12 outreach programs; thus, the research activities will become disseminated to the local public community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF funded project aimed to understand how the brain mediates the intent to move by identifying individual areas that code for eye and hand movements and to understand how brain areas interact when humans plan and perform voluntary movements.  We proposed to record activity in the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) while healthy young adults performed in several different laboratory tasks.  In these tasks, the participants used hand or arm movements to move toward targets appearing on a visual display.  Participants either freely selected a target among a set of possible alternatives or received directions which target to select.  In separate experiments, the planned movement became changed by switching the movement goal either immediately before or exactly when movement started.  Additionally, we studying how brain networks mediating voluntary eye and hand movements interact, since reaching movements to visible targets invariably involve eye movements.       We had several principal research findings.  First, we developed new statistical methods to reveal interactions between brain areas.  The impact of these findings concerns potential use of these novel and improved analytic methods to reveal how brain regions interact.  Second, with fMRI and EEG, we discovered specific sites in the frontal and parietal lobes of humans that specifically coded for freely chosen and for instructed movements.  Additionally, we found regions in frontal and parietal that became preferentially active when participants changed the direction of intended movements.  These results increase understanding of the brain substrates underlying dynamic changes in movement intention and should have impact on future brain-related studies of voluntary movement and how physicians address disorders of voluntary movements.  Third, we provided additional details about how the brain controls integration of eye and hand movements, by showing that brain signals controlling hand movements have complex interactions with the direction of a personÆs line-of-sight.  These results will have significant impact on the design of experiments that couple hand and eye movements and also will bear on the clinical understanding of optic ataxia, a neurological deficit occurring after parietal lobe dysfunction.       A further impact of this works relates to involving undergraduate and graduate students, some from underrepresented minority groups and many women, in the projects.  Involvement of these individuals will increase and diversify the personnel pipeline for biological-based research.
