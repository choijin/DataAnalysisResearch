<AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Bioprocessing Research and Development &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0832549 South Dakota School of Mines; David Dixon &lt;br/&gt;0832554 University of Hawaii; Scott Turn &lt;br/&gt;0832505 South Dakota State University; William Gibbons &lt;br/&gt;0832498 North Carolina State University; Steven Peretti &lt;br/&gt;0832522 Kansas State University; Mary Rezac &lt;br/&gt;0832520 State University of New York, Stony Brook; Devinder Mahajan &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal request seeks funding to establish a multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Bioprocessing Research and Development (CBRD). The proposed center is comprised of six universities, and is focused to make transformative discoveries to enable the lignocellulosic and fats and oil based bio-industries meet the challenges set forth by the US President, federal and state agencies and the American public. The research proposed is highly consistent with the USDA and DOE roadmaps and well integrated with the Sun Grant centers. The topic is timely and very crucial to the US, with strong academic and industry interest. The proposed research is highly interactive and multi-institutional, and has strong potential to be transformative through new discoveries. Universities participating in the proposed center have identified six initial research foci, and each of these focus areas will be addressed through numerous research projects.  Additionally, the focus of the proposed center will be on activities that support and extend recent advances made by industrial partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CBRD is positioned to make transformative discoveries that enable the lignocellulosic and oil and fats based bio-industries to meet the challenge of declining petroleum supply.  The wide range of institutions and projects proposed present numerous mechanisms for broader impact.  The proposed center will serve as an educational environment, to fill the workforce pipeline with engineers and scientists needed to make use of these opportunities.  This center will also provide a network of information flow to the public sector: involve K-12 outreach activities and involvement from minority participation throughout the country. It Is anticipated that the center will have direct participation from tribal colleges and historically black colleges and universities. Technology transfer is well addressed in the center plan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CBERDÃ†s mission was to conduct collaborative research focused on delivering technology solutions that enable widespread commercialization of biomass-derived fuels and products.  While accomplishing this goal CBERD assisted government and industry in achieving the National priority goal of augmenting our petroleum-based economy with renewable energy, chemicals and biomaterials.  At the CBERD University of Hawaii site research focused on: 1) developing methods to measure soil carbon content in volcanic soils commonly found in Hawaii that are used for growing Eucalyptus for energy purposes, 2) developing methods based on life cycle analysis principles to determine energy ratios (bioenergy product output divided by fossil energy input) and greenhouse gas emissions associated with bioenergy/biofuel production systems in Hawaii, 3) exploring the physics and chemistry of how ionic fluids work so as to develop economic systems for separating bio-oils from their parent material, 4) modifying the properties of biomass materials to improve their performance as fuels in thermochemical conversion systems, 5) conducting an experimental evaluation of the influence of nonthermal plasma arc reforming parameters on product gas quality and contaminant control in landfill gas, and 6) exploring water electrolysis as a tool to generate small bubbles for separating algae from water, a process called electroflotation .  All of these innovations where focused on improving the economics of bioenergy and biofuel systems.  Information generated will be used to achieve the biorefinery vision, enhance process design, and support economic competitiveness.  These projects provided opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in research identified as current needs by industry partners.  This research training in systems analysis, experimental methods, and instrumentation prepared the next generation of engineers and scientists needed to support development of iomass based energy and bioproducts industries.  The specific results of this work are found in theses, dissertations, conference presentations and publications and journal publications which can be accessed through the Internet.
