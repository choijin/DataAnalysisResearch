<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a spectrometer to detect fast neutrons which will allow the characterization of the background environment for sensitive underground experiments.  These experiments, such as searches for WIMP dark matter, neutrinoless double beta decay, and detection of solar neutrinos, are some of the highest priority directions in nuclear and particle physics, and understanding the backgrounds in which they must operate is essential to their success.  &lt;br/&gt;The spectrometer proposed here will use a technique called capture-gated spectroscopy, with a lithium-loaded liquid scintillator, and will be able to measure both the fluence and energy of neutrons up to 50 MeV.  &lt;br/&gt;This technique also has important applications in homeland security and neutron dosimetry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
