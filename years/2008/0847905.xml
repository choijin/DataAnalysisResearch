<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through its 56-year history, the Ichthyology Collection (at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) has grown from an un-cataloged teaching collection to become one of the largest repositories for freshwater, Chesapeake Bay, coastal, and deep-sea fishes in Virginia (http://web.vims.edu/ich_coll.html?svr=www). Co-PIs Hilton and Sutton have outlined a series of renovations aimed at safeguarding the specimens contained in the collection and making them more accessible to the scientific community. The planned physical renovations of collection space, including construction of a mezzanine and upgrading collections-related equipment, will improve the efficiency of the collection and will permit significant expansion space for the collections. Upgrading to a digital x-ray system will increase the availability of specimens to colleagues throughout the world. The development of a frozen tissue facility will ensure the long-term viability of the growing VIMS tissue collection. These renovations will increase the use of the collection by VIMS researchers, outside researchers, and in public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an institution, VIMS has a unique three-partite mission, which includes research, education, and advisory service, and the Ichthyology Collection is an integral part of this mission, serving a broad community of basic and applied research scientists and fisheries managers. With funds from this proposal, Hilton and Sutton will train a graduate student in collections management, and will oversee other students and public volunteers working in the collection. Over 600 members of the public visit the VIMS Ichthyology Collection each year, and Hilton and Sutton have outlined plans for the renovation of the popular VIMS coelacanth display, which will include make it more accessible and attractive. As part of this display, the VIMS Ichthyology Collection generally will also be highlighted in order to introduce visitors to the important role that natural history collections and specimen-based research play in the mission of institutions such as VIMS.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
