<AbstractNarration>Abstract 0832026 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Mathematics Teacher Leadership Center (Math TLC) is proposed by the University of Northern Colorado and its Core Partners, the University of Wyoming, Greeley School District #6 (CO), Morgan County School District (CO), Poudre County School District (CO), Laramie County School District 1 (WY), and Carbon County School District 1 (WY).&lt;br/&gt;Math TLC is an integrated partnership to improve mathematics in middle, secondary and post secondary education in the north Rocky Mountains region.  Key to this Teacher Institute project is working with teachers and districts to retain new and continuing teachers in the field and develop leadership capacity.  The Partners will develop and implement a Master's degree in Secondary Mathematics, and a Teacher Leadership Program in mathematics for teachers, grades 4-12.  Research is to be carried out on the impact of both these programs on student achievement.&lt;br/&gt;The Master's program (32 credit hours) will support 4 cohorts of 15-18 teachers per year and the Teacher Leadership program (24 credit hours) will support 3 cohorts of 10-12 teachers per year, over the five year project.  The courses will be a combination of face- to-face and on-line delivery.  More than 95,000 students from grades 4 through 12 are potentially impacted over the life of the project: 23,700 directly by teacher enrolled in the master's program and 71, 000 students of teachers who will work with Teacher Leaders. An intensive recruitment program is planned to attract teachers from Native American school districts in Colorado (Southern Ute Indian Reservation and Ute Mountain Indian Reservation) and Wyoming (the Wind River Reservation).&lt;br/&gt;The research program will study the impact of professional development (PD) on teachers' mathematical understanding, pedagogical content knowledge and cultural competencies for teaching diverse students in Colorado and Wyoming.  The study will track teacher change and its effect on student achievement, grades 6-12, and will advance knowledge of teacher leadership development through a quantitative design experiment of the leadership model proposed by the project. &lt;br/&gt;The transformative concept in Math TLC is the development of the online master's degree shared jointly by the Universities of Northern Colorado and Wyoming in combination with a leadership program.  Success will require substantive institutional affiliation and will transform PD for isolated rural teachers by providing significant mathematics content integrated with culturally informed pedagogical methods, by creating master teachers and teacher-leaders that have the expertise to intellectually engage underserved groups.&lt;br/&gt;The comprehensive dissemination plan includes a web portal for the online distribution of research and implementation outcomes, publications of findings in peer reviewed journals and presentations at regional and national meetings. The Partnership will actively work in the future to broaden the collaborative to include additional school and university partners.&lt;br/&gt;The benefits to society are improved mathematics teaching and learning in socio-economically, culturally, and ethnically diverse classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Summary  The Math Teacher Leadership Center (Math TLC) served mathematics teachers in Colorado and Wyoming through a collaboration led by the Universities of Northern Colorado and Wyoming. Across five years, 134 teachers in the Math TLC masterÆs and teacher leader programs (a) deepened their understanding of the content they teach, (b) enhanced their math teaching skills, and (c) developed their capacity to be effective with diverse learner populations. To date, 60 of the 90 secondary school math teachers who started the masterÆs program have completed it and 44 third through twelfth grade math teachers have participated in the 24-credit hour teacher leadership program. As part of our efforts to increase math teachersÆ capacity to be effective with diverse populations, we created a course called Culture in the Math Classroom (CIMC).  Faculty (20) and graduate students (13) developed expertise in online course design and delivery. All together the project delivered 68 courses in the masterÆs program. In the teacher leadership program, we developed 12 courses, each of which was offered twice, with 4 courses offered online. Math TLC programsÆ online delivery is unusual in that it relies on live class meetings using online videoconferencing instead of the asynchronous meetings common in online instruction. Intellectual Merit  The research team developed both a written test to measure pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of secondary mathematics teachers and a real-time teaching observation protocol. Teachers in the masterÆs program had substantial growth in PCK as measured by these instruments, with the greatest growth among novice teachers. The research team extended existing models of PCK to include attention to knowledge of discourse. Project personnel have reported on the new array of skills developed, and old skills honed in new contexts, by teacher participants, faculty, and researchers in 28 publications, 28 presentations, and 3 dissertations. According to Math TLC research, CIMC course projects productively engage teachers in exploring equity and diversity issues in their math classrooms.  Broader Impacts   The joint Masters in Mathematics: Teaching Emphasis is institutionalized at UNC and UW and continues to serve secondary math teachers across both states. Graduates of this program are qualified to teach high school math courses offered for college credit from all Colorado and Wyoming institutions of higher education.  Participation in project research enhanced the expertise of faculty (10), graduate students (24), and postdoctoral scholars (3) to study the development of mathematical knowledge for teaching at the secondary level, the role of culture in the math classroom, and the impacts of instruction through online video conferencing. At a conference for 36 mathematics teacher educators from around the U.S. we shared CIMC course materials and processes (about 70 documents).  The work on the masterÆs program has positioned UNC and UW to offer an entirely online program to a nationwide audience.
