<AbstractNarration>Natural selection is expected to efficiently remove detrimental traits from animal and plant populations; yet, traits such as infertility persist in natural populations.  Persistence of detrimental traits such as infertility may be caused by "selfish" behavior of chromosomes during meiosis, that is, chromosomes that carry harmful traits also carry genes for their own preferential inheritance.  This research investigates the cellular and genetic mechanisms, evolutionary history, and fitness consequences of a selfish chromosome in the model wildflower Mimulus guttatus. The projects include cytogenetic determination of whether selfish chromosomal transmission (termed meiotic drive) is caused by divergence in chromosomal structure and/or function, crossing experiments to investigate the genetic basis of differences in the strength of meiotic drive, field measurements of the lifetime effects of carrying selfish chromosomes on reproduction, and surveys of the distribution of selfish chromosomes among populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because research on Mimulus will allow tests of theories about the persistence of selfish chromosomes natural populations, these studies will provide rare insight into a poorly understood, but potentially ubiquitous (and highly influential), biological process. In addition, the project will develop, for broad dissemination, a set of laboratory modules using Mimulus as a model to teach fundamental concepts in genetics and evolution. Postdoctoral scholars, graduates, and undergraduate students will be engaged in generating these educational materials, as well as trained for careers in biology through participation in the research.</AbstractNarration>
