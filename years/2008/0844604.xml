<AbstractNarration>Cells in the nervous system communicate at specialized regions called synapses.  When a nerve fires, calcium ions enter synapses from the surrounding extracellular fluid and cause neurotransmitter molecules to be released into the synaptic cleft between the communicating cells.  However, the sequence of molecular events leading from calcium entry to transmitter release remains unknown.  To better understand this important process, this research will combine laboratory experiments and large-scale computer simulations to build detailed 3-D models of calcium-triggered neurotransmitter release at the synapse between a nerve and muscle cell in the frog.  In many respects, the frog synapse is quite similar to many mammalian synapses (including human), and yet it presents unique opportunities for combined laboratory and computational studies.  This makes it an ideal choice for creation of highly realistic and accurate models.  Using these models, hypotheses will be developed and tested to explain how synapses use calcium to trigger neurotransmitter release, and how repeated nerve firing changes release, as occurs at all synapses as they respond to changing behavioral conditions.  Development of realistic 3-D computer models also presents unique opportunities for transformational training and education.  Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees will participate directly in these studies, and high quality animations of the models will be adapted for use in the classroom.  The project co-directors (S. Meriney, Univ. of Pittsburgh, and J. Stiles, Carnegie Mellon Univ.) and faculty colleagues will use the new teaching material at the University of Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and Carnegie Mellon University, in undergraduate and graduate Neuroscience, Biology, and Computational Biology courses, a multi-institutional summer institute (www.ccbb.pitt.edu/bbsi), workshops, and web-based tutorials (www.mcell.psc.edu/tutorials/tlist.htm).  New teaching material will also be featured in the CMIST program, an undergraduate and K-12 outreach program at the National Resource for Biomedical Supercomputing, directed by Dr. Stiles (www.nrbsc.org/cmist).</AbstractNarration>

All of the results from these studies have been published in high profile journals in the field (13 peer-reviewed papers, and 10 conference presentations).  The results from these studies have changed the manner in which scientists think about communication between cells in the nervous system.  Findings from this research project are incorporated into the course material presented to 175 undergraduate students each year &ndash; training the next generation of scientists.

These workshops focus on teaching computational cell modeling approaches to both the experimental and computational research community ranging from undergraduate students to faculty members. Two graduate students, one postdoctoral fellow, and four undergraduate students received scientific and career training.  The research experience for undergraduate students has transformed several initially "pre-med" students into candidates for PhD training in neuroscience.  Further, the highly visual nature of our computation modeling approaches makes them ideal vehicles for generally accessible dissemination. For example, we have developed computer modeling modules targeted at high school teaching, providing teachers with visually engaging, video based, and standards aligned course material covering modern science topics.
