<AbstractNarration>non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superconductivity is probably the most widely known example of a&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanical phenomenon manifested at a macroscopic level.&lt;br/&gt;The physical properties attributed to the superconducting state&lt;br/&gt;are spectacular and include the flow of electrical current without&lt;br/&gt;loss and the expulsion of magnetic flux from the interior of a&lt;br/&gt;superconducting sample. These same properties make&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity uniquely useful for many applications. Of&lt;br/&gt;important scientific and technological importance is to understand&lt;br/&gt;how superconductivity survives to high magnetic fields. Many years&lt;br/&gt;ago, it was predicted that this is possible through a mechanism&lt;br/&gt;producing a state of matter inhomogeneous on a microscopic level.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, magnetic resonance techniques will be used to study &lt;br/&gt;superconducting systems for which there is evidence for formation &lt;br/&gt;of a new phase at high fields, including an exploration of their &lt;br/&gt;physical properties, with the aim of identifying the inhomogeneous &lt;br/&gt;phase and characterizing its properties. This work will be complemented&lt;br/&gt;by investigations of new forms of field-induced magnetic states in&lt;br/&gt;a class of magnetic insulators. Magnetic resonance is suitable for&lt;br/&gt;this type of problem because it is sensitive to the environment&lt;br/&gt;locally proximate to the nuclear spins being probed. Graduate&lt;br/&gt;students will engineer and carry out the experimental program&lt;br/&gt;under a range of extreme conditions, including very low&lt;br/&gt;temperatures and high magnetic fields. Undergraduate students will&lt;br/&gt;assist in the design and construction of specific components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of magnetic field-induced phases in superconductors and&lt;br/&gt;quantum spin systems, stabilized by large magnetic fields, will be&lt;br/&gt;studied using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. In the case&lt;br/&gt;of the superconductors, the materials are organic superconductors&lt;br/&gt;with highly anisotropic superconducting properties which weakens&lt;br/&gt;orbital pair-breaking. Evidence exists for distinct high-field&lt;br/&gt;phases in each case, making them excellent candidates for&lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneous superconductivity in a form predicted forty years&lt;br/&gt;ago but not yet confirmed, and for which its properties remain&lt;br/&gt;untested experimentally. Magnetic resonance accommodates easily&lt;br/&gt;the necessary extreme conditions, and it is a local probe&lt;br/&gt;sensitive to inhomogeneities. The quantum spin dimer system is an&lt;br/&gt;S=1 system in which the dimers sit on a layered hexagonal lattice,&lt;br/&gt;and for which thermodynamic measurements give evidence for&lt;br/&gt;multiple phase transitions as the field is varied at temperatures&lt;br/&gt;T&lt;1K. Graduate students will design and carry out the experimental&lt;br/&gt;program, and are assisted by undergraduates who will learn how to&lt;br/&gt;engineer specific components. Evidence for inhomogeneous states&lt;br/&gt;will be looked for, from which new quantum effects are expected to&lt;br/&gt;emerge.</AbstractNarration>

Results.  The layered superconductors we studied are from a class of compounds known as organic or molecular superconductors. The most significant aspect to note here is that because the interlayer coupling is so weak, the superconducting state is particularly robust against magnetic fields. The experiments confirmed the transition to a new high field phase consistent with the inhomogeneous state we were looking for. Moreover, the response to low magnetic fields is like what might be found in a textbook for the case of the magnetic field coupling to the electronic spin degrees of freedom only.  The quantum magnet system we studied was Ba3Mn2O8. This material has a non-magnetic ground state, meaning that there is negligible magnetic response at low fields. At sufficiently low temperatures, the application of a magnetic field beyond a threshold stabilizes new phases with finite magnetization. Of interest was the nature of the phases, and what generic aspects of the behavior around the phase transition can be inferred, both in static properties and the fluctuations that break up the phase at the boundary.
