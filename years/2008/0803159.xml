<AbstractNarration>Participants in human-human conversation often entrain to one another, adopting the&lt;br/&gt;vocabulary and other behaviors of their partners.&lt;br/&gt;Evidence of this has been found from laboratory studies and observations of real life&lt;br/&gt;situations. We are investigating many types of entrainment in two large corpora of&lt;br/&gt;human-human conversations to improve system behavior in Spoken Dialogue Systems&lt;br/&gt;(SDS). We want to discover which types of entrainment occur generally across&lt;br/&gt;speakers and which seem to be speaker-specific, which types of entrainment can be&lt;br/&gt;reliably linked to task success and perceived naturalness, and which types of&lt;br/&gt;entrainment can be automatically modeled in SDS.&lt;br/&gt;Our research has importance for the construction of better SDS.&lt;br/&gt;Currently, research SDS have attempted to entrain users to system vocabularies to&lt;br/&gt;improve speech recognition accuracy: Since users are likely to employ the same&lt;br/&gt;vocabulary in their answers that systems use in their queries, systems have a better&lt;br/&gt;chance of recognizing user input correctly if they can predict word usage. However,&lt;br/&gt;there has been little attempt to create SDS that entrain to user behavior, despite&lt;br/&gt;evidence that human beings rate humans and systems that behave more like them&lt;br/&gt;more highly than those that do not. Our work focuses on determining which types of&lt;br/&gt;system entrainment to users will be most important to users and most feasible for SDS.&lt;br/&gt;Our results will be disseminated through papers and presentations at speech and&lt;br/&gt;language conferences. We will also provide publicly available annotated corpora for&lt;br/&gt;future research by others.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
