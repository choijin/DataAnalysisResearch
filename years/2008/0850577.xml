<AbstractNarration>In the Williams College SMALL REU program, for nine weeks each summer, about 23 undergraduates will work in groups of about four on original research with about 6 faculty, for the summers 2009-2013.  Topics of research include stick knots, topology of particle collisions, multivariable continued fractions, completions of local rings, random matrix theory, manifolds with density and isoperimetric problems, class groups of global fields, ergodic theory, and eigenvalue distribution of various classes of random matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU is to introduce undergraduates to the excitement and challenge of doing original research in mathematics.  In the process, students naturally learn lots of background and are encouraged to present as well as publish their work, all invaluable for graduate school. The variety of mathematical activities provides a rich intellectual environment.  Our nation needs a wider appreciation and understanding of mathematics, and cannot afford to leave anyone out.  We have increased the numbers of women and minorities participating in the program over the last five years, and we are continuing to look for new and better ways to encourage applications from women, minorities, first generation college students, and other underrepresented groups.  The PI for this proposal is a woman and the co-PI is Hispanic.  Students, faculty and the broader mathematics community will benefit from the presentation and publication of original research. Students will develop a lifetime network of peers and many of them will pursue graduate studies, partially because of their REU experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the summers of 2009-2013, about 30 undergraduates each summer worked on original research in mathematics.  The students were broken up into small groups, and each group was led by a faculty advisor.  Around 70 research publications resulted, with the vast majority of them being published in peer reviewed research journals.  In addition, the undergradute participants gave talks and presented posters on their research at mathematics conferences, and many won awards for their presentations and/or posters.  By participating in this REU, undergraduates were introduced to the excitement and challenge of doing original research in mathematics.  In the process, they naturally learned lots of background material and presented and published their work, all invaluable for graduate school.   Our nation needs a wider appreciation and understanding of mathematics, and cannot afford to leave anyone out.  We increased the numbers of women and underrepresented minorities participating in the program over the last five years, and we continue to look for new and better ways to encourage women, minorities, first generation college students, and other underrepresented groups to participate.  The PI for this project is a woman and the co-PI is Hispanic, and they served as role models from underrepresented groups for the undergratuate participants.  Students, faculty and the broader mathematics community benefited from the presentation and publication of original research. Students also developed a lifetime network of peers and many of them will pursue graduate studies, partially because of their participation in this project.
