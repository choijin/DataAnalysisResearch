<AbstractNarration>Ensemble adds a computing pathway to the existing set of NSF STEM Digital Libraries (NSDL). The addition ensures that the NSDL pathways provide a more complete coverage of STEM areas. The computing pathway supports the full range of computing education communities, provides a base for the development of programs blending computing with other STEM areas, and produces digital library innovations that are propagated to other NSDL pathways. Since computing communities including computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, information science, information systems and information technology continue to rapidly evolve; the computing pathway greatly aids computing educators in those areas. The computing pathway also addresses diversity, the complex interactions across the computing communities, as well as meeting the future need for increasing the numbers of computer related graduates. Ensemble reaches across the full range of audiences for computing education from K-12 to graduate and professional education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ensemble creates a distributed portal providing access to the broad range of existing educational resources while preserving the collections and their associated curation processes. Ensemble encourages contribution, use, reuse, review and evaluation of educational materials at multiple levels of granularity. To accomplish the overall goals, the Ensemble team works directly with relevant professional societies and accreditation agencies to articulate inter-relationships among the computing communities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Ensemble Computing Education Portal is a digital library preserving the computing education resources created through foundation funding and local initiatives.  It provides a common location for finding resources to support teaching and learning in computing.  The portal also provides a location for working committees and interest groups to collaborate and to share their interim and final results as they deem appropriate.  The project has involved significant work in the field of digital libraries as well as in the discovery and presentation of digital resources.  It serves as a resource to the entire computing education community, spanning all of the types of programs that come under that heading.  This work was done and continues to be supported by a collaborative group representing six universities and several other organizations.  The distributed effort has advanced the organization and presentation of learning materials for computing education at all levels and across all varieties of programs.  The Ensemble Computing Education Portal currently hosts twenty nine collections related to computing education.  The collections vary from materials related to teaching security in computing classes, to materials for using robotics to teach topics in all the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) curriculum in high schools.  Some of the collections reside on the Ensemble server; others are hosted at the creator's own site and are represented in Ensemble by metadata.  The metadata is rich enough to allow meaningful searches over all the collections.  When material matches a user's search criteria and does not reside on the local server, a link to the host provides access to the user.    The Communities section of the portal supports a variety of activities related to teaching and learning in computing disciplines.  An example is the presentation and community feedback for the ACM-IEEE/CS 2013 Computer Science Curriculum report.  Several other curriculum reports are currently represented in the community space.  Though the funding for the Ensemble project has ended, the project continues to be supported at Villanova University in the form of a graduate assistant and at Virginia Tech, where the Ensemble server is located.  The Villaova library committed to long term support of the project when it is no longer in active development.          Last Modified: 02/24/2017       Submitted by: Frank M Shipman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
