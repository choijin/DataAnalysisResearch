<AbstractNarration>The proposal will study the economics of socially responsible investing (SRI). Socially responsible investors are motivated not only by returns but also trade off concerns about values (e.g. ethics or concern for the environment) associated with their investments. As a result, these investors discriminate against (support) the shares of companies they deem irresponsible responsible) as a means of encouraging firms to change policies. SRI has been met in the market place by manager-initiated programs, broadly known as corporate social responsibility (CSR), designed to maximize not only shareholder value but also the welfare of other stakeholders (e.g. workers and neighbors). SRI can be thought of as a market-driven initiative to provide firms with incentives to internalize externalities. There is little research on the demand for SRI, the supply of CSR and efficacy of SRI in influencing stock prices and bringing about changes in firm policies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is comprised of three papers. The first paper measures the importance of political values on the demand for SRI using data on the political contributions and stock holdings of US mutual fund and hedge fund managers. The idea is that Democratic values are more pro-SRI than Republicans values. As such, the main hypothesis is that managers who donate to Democrats (presumably sharing Democratic values) under-weight (relative to non-donors or Republican donors) stocks that are deemed socially irresponsible (e.g. tobacco, guns and defense, natural resources). This study also examines whether these values imply that Democratic managers are more long-termist with their socially responsible stocks. The second paper examines the asset pricing implications of SRI using an international crosssection of stocks with commercially available scores for their corporate social responsibility. The PI will test three hypotheses. First, do institutional investors tilt towards socially responsible stocks or do they just avoid irresponsible ones? Second, if there is indeed a tilt, do socially responsible companies receive a higher stock price? And third, if SRI investors are more long-termist, then are these firm's stock prices more stable in the sense of being less sensitive to poor performance? The third paper examines the determinants of CSR activities through the lens of three distinct economic channels. The first is that CSR is a firm's attempt, like investor relations, to improve its cost of capital. The key prediction is that firms (particularly equity dependent ones) which suffer a decrease in stock price or exit of institutional investors respond with an increase in CSR activities. The second is that SRI influences CSR behavior through a media and agency channel---managers want to avoid the bad press of corporate social irresponsibility. The key prediction here is that firms with more lax corporate governance (or greater agency issues) are more likely to be socially responsible and this effect ought to be larger for firms that are in the media spotlight. The third is that manager political values themselves matter. This hypothesis, akin to money managers, is that Democratic CEOs are more likely to support CSR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The merit of the proposal largely rests on two grounds. First, SRI is growing in importance around the world. Critics worry that governments are using the SRI-CSR nexus as a means to avoid the regulation needed to deal with difficult environmental and social concerns. CSR is also a dramatic change from the paradigm of maximizing shareholder value. Such concerns require a careful analysis. Second, SRI provides a rich context with which to conduct novel economic analysis on an important topic in economics: the effect of social norms and values on markets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In my National Science Foundation Grant, "Values and Finance: A Study of Socially Responsible Investing", I answer three long-standing questions on the relationship between social responsibility and the stock market.  First, do firms that do good (i.e. behave socially responsibly) do well (i.e. are profitable)?  Or do firms that do well do good?  Second, are managers doing good with other peoplesÆ money? Third, what are the returns to socially responsible investing?  Debates on these questions have been ongoing since the seventies when Milton Friedman declared that the only social responsibility of corporations is to make money.  Despite hundreds of academic and practitioner studies since then, no definitive answers have been forthcoming because of the difficulty of establishing causation.   I resolve this issue by developing a set of new quasi-experiments.  First, I establish that firms do good only when they do well in the sense of having financial slack.  I look at how corporate social responsibility scores changed around the Internet bubble (which temporarily increased firm financial slack).  Firms that were previously financial constrained became temporarily unconstrained during the Internet bubble and their corporate social responsibility scores temporarily increased and converged to those of their unconstrained peers. Second, I establish that the 2003 Dividend Tax Cut (which better aligned managerial and shareholder interests and reduced agency problems) led to a decrease in corporate social responsibility among firms.  Third, I show that Democratic mutual fund and hedge fund managers are much more likely to behave like a socially responsible investment fund than Republic managers.   I conclude that corporate social responsibility is very costly as firms only do good when they have enough financial slack.  A large part of corporate goodness spending is due to agency problems.  And the fact that Democratic managers boycott socially irresponsible companies such as tobacco stocks suggest that these stocks are underpriced and likely to be good investments over the long-run.  In short, there are no free lunches when it comes to social responsibility and the stock market.       Last Modified: 08/01/2012       Submitted by: Harrison Hong]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
