<AbstractNarration>Ross L. Cagan, Mount Sinai School of Medicine&lt;br/&gt;IOS-0834010&lt;br/&gt;Visual System Development 2008 Gordon Research Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of all the major senses, vision is probably the most tangible: humans and most other animals are vision-dominant organisms that use sight as the major means to navigate through the environment. This meeting, Visual System Development, is one of the elite Gordon Conferences that occurs every other year. The meeting brings together the very best scientists as well as young promising scientists for four days to share data on the mechanisms by which eyes and vision develop, how these remarkable structures connect and bring visual information to the brain, and how sense is perceived of the visual world. This meeting is considered by many to be the preeminent meeting for sharing information and ideas on vision and visual system development. In addition to bringing together researchers from premier institutions of higher learning from the United States, many of whom have been funded by NSF, this meeting also attracts a distinctly international audience. In terms of Broader Impacts, an important goal of this meeting is to share ideas and to create new ones by assembling top researchers from many different disciplines in an environment that encourages open dialog as well as scientific excellence.</AbstractNarration>
