<AbstractNarration>This proposal deals with many of the central questions concerning Fourier transforms and how they manifest themselves on bounded domains or more generally, Riemannian manifolds with boundary.  In the context of the Fourier transform on Euclidean space or the flat torus, topics such as restriction theorems, Strichartz estimates (space-time integrability estimates for wave and Schroedinger equations), and Bochner-Riesz means have been subjects of great interest for quite some time. However, many questions remain on how these theories should play out on a bounded domain.  Here it may be appropriate to think of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, and replace restriction theorems for the sphere with integrability estimates on clusters of eigenfunctions.  In this regard, the PI intends to explore integrability estimates on restrictions of these clusters to curves in the domain.  In the case of Strichartz estimates, analogies can be drawn with some of this restriction theory or a parametrix-based approach can be employed. This latter approach is currently being used by the PI and his collaborators to obtain results for general bounded domains.  Improvements on these estimates will be pursued for manifolds with a specific geometric structure such as the unit disk or the unit ball.  Finally, related problems involving Strichartz estimates in exterior domains will be examined along with applications to nonlinear equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourier analysis continues to be a significant factor in the development of both mathematical and physical theories.  In particular, it strengthens our understanding of the partial differential equations that arise in mathematical physics.  The research pursued here expects to have several applications to the study of wave phenomena and the equations which model it.  These investigations should yield insight on how the presence and shape of obstacles influence the development of waves, a subject of great scientific interest.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
