<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the University of Connecticut (UConn) entitled, RET Site: The Joule Fellows-Teachers in Sustainable Energies Research Laboratories", under the direction of Dr. Kazem Kazerounian. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site is a comprehensive program to host a total of 36 teachers and instructors (12 each year for three years, 8 from high school, 2 from middle school and 2 from community colleges) as Joule Fellows at the University of Connecticut for six summer weeks with long term academic year follow-on programs. At UConn they will participate in a rich spectrum of activities that will provide them a broad view of research methods and hands-on education and research experience in ongoing programs in sustainable energies. The planned activities of the program are integrated into the following five categories: 1) research preparation, 2) research participation, 3) professional development, 4) bridging technology and K-12 curriculum, and 5) mentorship and outreach.  To attain sustainablility and institutionalization, the project team will develop a combination of activities: an innovative Master of Engineering Education degree program, collaboration with the State to develop engineering frameworks in K-12 curricula, and building community-based enabling partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
