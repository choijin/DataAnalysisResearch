<AbstractNarration>When mothers provide nutrition for offspring throughout gestation, offspring and mother have conflicting interests.  Mothers ought to distribute nutrition evenly to all offspring, but each offspring ought to coerce as much nutrition as possible for itself.  This project will examine whether different levels of conflict, produced by different levels of relatedness within a mother?s brood, can account for the vastly different levels of maternal investment in offspring seen in nature and for different patterns of gene expression during gestation in different populations.  The project will also examine whether this conflict can be ameliorated by enhancing the nutrition available to mothers, and whether this conflict accounts for the high number of inviable embryos observed in crosses between individuals from different populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conflicting interests of mothers and offspring are postulated to be responsible for features such as the mammalian placenta, genetic imprinting, and the rapid diversification of live-bearing animals.  This project will address several of these postulated connections in the same system and thereby illuminate whether one process can offer a unifying explanation for many seemingly disparate features in nature.  It will also provide training opportunities for high schoolers, teachers, undergraduates, and a postdoctoral fellow, including groups under-represented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Parents and offspring are often in conflict over how much parental effort each offspring ought to receive.  While much research has been devoted to how that conflict emerges after birth, the same clash can occur before birth in animals in which mothers provide all the nutrition for embryonic development after the young are fertilized (nearly all mammals, a number of fish and some insects).  In these cases, genes in developing embryos can influence how mothers provide nutrition and theories about the consequences of pre-natal conflict implicate it as a driving force in the evolution of features such as placentae and genomic imprinting.  Despite the theoretical importance of such conflict, there were few direct studies of it before we undertook our work.     In the least killifish, Heterandria formosa, embryos are nourished like mammalian embryos, via a placenta that facilitates resource transfer between mothers and embryos.  In some populations of this species, offspring are born 40 % larger than in others.  This variation provides a unique opportunity to test whether pre-natal conflict between mothers and offspring, and competition between sibling embryos influences maternal investment.     Our initial observations revealed no surprises.  We found patterns in offspring size that matched what theory would predict if mothers were entirely in control of how much nutrition should go to each embryo: offspring were larger in more crowded populations in which crowding was the limiting factor on population size and smaller in less crowded populations in which predators limited the numbers of individuals.     Subsequent work produced evidence that fit uneasily with a paradigm of mothers having total control.  First, embryos express genes whose products attempt to coerce more nutrition from mothers.  Second, the results of mating males from one population to females from another revealed that embryos do influence their own size at birth.  Third, embryos compete fiercely with one another for nutrition, and this competition is particularly intense among embryos in successive broods that overlap temporally while being nourished by their mother.      These results suggested that conflict is pervasive and, where offspring are born larger, the balance has been tipped toward the offspring, whereas where offspring are born smaller, the balance had been tipped toward the mother (offspring always "want" more than mother is willing or able to provide).  This suggestion was reinforced by the results of crosses between individuals from different populations: females from populations in which offspring are small produce a substantial fraction of stillborn embryos when they are mated to males from a population in which offspring are large.  Crosses in the reverse direction do not suffer these losses, nor do crosses between populations in which offspring size at birth is comparable.     The pattern of stillborn embryos was predicted by a theory of mother-offspring conflict.  The argument is that when females mate with many males, their offspring are half-sibs, each with less of a vested interest, evolutionarily, in the welfare of their siblings.  Under these circumstances, offspring should behave more selfishly and coerce more resources from their mother.  Mothers in these populations should evolve formidable resistance to further coercion.  In contrast, when females mate with only one male, offspring are full siblings, each has a stronger vested interest, evolutionarily, in the welfare of siblings, and so should evolve to be less coercive as individuals.  In turn, mothers have no impetus to evolve much resistance to further coercion. The high rates of stillborn embryos should reflect a mismatch between genes for strong coercive ability in embryos and those for weak resistance in mothers.  The crucial test is whether females mate multiply in populations in which offspring are born larger and singly in populations in which they are born smaller.  When ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
