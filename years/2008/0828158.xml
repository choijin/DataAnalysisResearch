    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0828158&lt;br/&gt;Conner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The International Congress on Catalysis, ICC, in the most largely attended meeting of the international catalytic community. All the developments both practical and new understand in catalysis over the last four years will be presented at this meeting. This is also the best place to discuss ongoing or international collaborations within the catalytic community, both industrial and academic. Participation by US scientists is crucial to our visibility in this area that impacts over a quarter of the US economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;A major focus of this ICC meeting is on renewable, sustainable energy sources made by catalytic means. Many foreign laboratories have pioneered in these efforts and will be present and presenting their studies at this meeting. Several workshops and symposia for faculty or students are being held in conjunction (before or after) the ICC. This grant will enable US participation in these. One of the primary purposes is to provide support for junior faculty to participate in this ICC, as well as to support women and underrepresented minority candidates. This is an ideal opportunity for these groups to establish international collaborations as well as to understand the cutting edge of catalytic science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
