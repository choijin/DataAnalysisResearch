<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  ECCS-0821918&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Electromagnetic Scattering from 3-D Objects Buried in Layered Lossy Earth with Multiple Rough Interfaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name:            Xu, Xiao-Bang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution:  Clemson University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to investigate scattering of 3-D objects buried in stratified earth with multiple random rough interfaces. The approach is to develop and then employ an efficient hybrid numerical technique based on pseudospectral time-domain method with Monte-Carlo simulation.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research is more advanced than the previously published work by considering stratified media with multiple random rough interfaces, which can more faithfully model the earth and other realistic layered structures that may be encountered in practical subsurface investigations. The proposed numerical technique is based on the pseudospectral time-domain method, which is more efficient than the conventional finite-difference time-domain method, due to its significantly less computer time and memory requirement for the same or even higher accuracy, as illustrated by many published numerical experiment results. The pseudospectral time-domain technique can also deal with complex geometry with a great flexibility, and has potential for parallel computations.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research may benefit the society through a number of important potential applications in various areas including: detection of subsurface targets such as landmines for protection of our troops; geophysical exploration of mineral deposit, petroleum, and alternative energy resources such as geothermal spots; locating buried hazardous waste for environment protection; nondestructive testing of underground pipes and other underground facilities; microwave imaging of abnormal area embedded in multi-layer biological structures for detection of cancers; and modeling of indoor wave propagation through multi-layer walls for wireless internet planning. The research will also enhance three graduate courses and train five students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
