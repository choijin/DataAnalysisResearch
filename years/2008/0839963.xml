<AbstractNarration>SGER: Exploratory Research in Sketch-Based Modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores a new paradigm for designing 3D form by amplifying  traditional sketching on paper. Early work has shown that 3D design and analysis can be performed using only strokes attached to 2D planes and placed in 3D space. Apparent form emerges as the user observes from different views. This research will expand early work by adding sketch search and exploration. This work is examined in the context of a complete system for architectural design that moves from conceptual sketching to solid models. The work advances the creative design process by offering a novel approach for creating and editing 3D form, and will also impact the communication of ideas, where 2D representation has largely dominated. This work crosses and links disciplines, not only computer graphics and architecture, but other research areas related to how humans think (such as computer vision, cognitive science, psychology) and build (industrial design, civil engineering, mechanical engineering). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the expansion of the World Wide Web and success of companies, such as Google, search has become an active area of research, with methods developed for searching for items from text to 3D objects. Yet little, if no, work has addressed searching and manipulating sketches. In this research, two approaches are considered: spectrum-graph-based methods and representations in terms of spherical harmonics. Tools for exploring temporal sketch evolution and navigating relationships between sketches are also considered. A visual interface is used for forming sketch queries.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
