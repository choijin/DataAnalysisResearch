<AbstractNarration>Simulation and Modeling in Technology Education (SMTE) is a five-year project that develops and researches the academic potential of a hybrid instructional model that infuses computer simulations, modeling, and educational gaming into middle school technology education programs.  These prototypical materials use 3-D simulations and educational gaming to support students learning STEM content and skills through developing solutions to design challenges.  The virtual environment allows students to analyze and improve their designs by changing variables and observing how their changes affect design performance. Once the designs are optimized on-screen, students will construct physical models and compare their functionality and effectiveness to the simulated virtual models. A uniqueness of the Project is the development of an innovative Web-based instructor design interface and a library of objects to enable instructors to modify the context of the design problems to fit different instructional and geographic settings. The research investigates the transferability of the model and its potential to improve STEM teaching and learning.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project incorporates a cyber-enabled engineering design approach that integrates science and mathematics and uses contemporary technological tools and pedagogical strategies. The content is driven by the concepts and skills identified in the K-12 Standards for Technological Literacy (STL).  The partners are Hofstra University?s Center for Technological Literacy, the State University of New York at Buffalo, the NSF National Center for Telecommunications Technologies, Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania, and the City University of New York.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research design includes a test of three conditions: the experimental (hybrid) condition; the gaming and simulation only condition that involves students in the virtual tasks only; and students doing physical modeling task.  Testing will involve 12 teachers and 240 students with data collected in six assessment domains.  Data will be analyzed using a variety of multivariate statistical analyses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:   Simulation and Modeling in Technology Education (SMTE) was a DR-K12 project to develop and study the academic potential of a hybrid instructional model and a develop set of prototypical materials that compared two modes of instruction: (1) 3D simulation/educational gaming; (2) and real-world physical modeling experiences. The materials were originally designed to be implemented in middle school technology education classes.   SMTE created two parallel curricula: a game-based curriculum (that required about a month of instructional time), and a more traditional physical modeling curriculum using hands-on, tools- and materials-based design projects (which took slightly longer). These curricula included the same learning goals, and required students to complete similar performance tasks. The difference between them was that two different modes of learning were implemented: the use of a 3D computer game, and the use of physcial (design-and-construct) modeling that required the use of tools and materials.  The Project also developed a variation of the game-based curriculum to be used in middle school science classes to teach science concepts aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  The Project provided insights into one of the strongest methods of providing instruction for middle school students in the area of technology education. The Project found that the combination of hands-on activities and supporting computer game activities provided a strong educational foundation for the content we were presenting.   Research indicated that learning gains occurred in both instructional modes; that students were engaged in both the gaming and physical modeling mode; and that gaming is a promising educational technique for teaching about the engineering design process in a way that can economize the use of classroom resources and facilities. It was clear from our research that combining hands-on instruction and game-based instruction was a strong method of teaching subject matter in the field of technology education and of motivating students to be interested in the content.     Broader Impacts:   As society needs more and more engineers and professionals in STEM fields, this program demonstrated how students can become excited about STEM careers and engineering in particular with activities targeted toward hands-on experiences and playing serious/educational computer games. It also showed that using activities that engage students and that align with their predispositions (playing computer games and physical hands-on experiences), that the students can gain a better conceptual understand of concepts and ideas. It appears from our research that these types of curricular experiences can be used in a variety of disciplines.  SMTE materials will not only dramatically modernize technology education, but have produced a generalizable methodology and infrastructure that can engender the development of a transformative genre of hybrid STEM curriculum that integrates 3-D simulation, gaming, and real-world physical modeling. Hence the model will be transferable, and the Project, therefore, is cost-effective.  Research has investigated the degree to which the hybrid model is adaptable; and assessed its effectiveness in promoting learning and in improving attitudes toward STEM study. Results contribute new knowledge about serious gaming as a educational tools.  Project models, products, and results have been disseminated nationally through Websites, books, and conference presentations.  Field test sites encompassed multiethnic faculties and student bodies with high minority populations. Game environments naturally transcend barriers of language, geography, race, gender, and physical abilities.  External evaluation and research has been managed by the Center for Advanced Study in Education (CASE) at the City University of New York, a research group with decades of experience in evaluating NSF projects.          ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
