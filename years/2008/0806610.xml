<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The conversion of solar energy into solar fuels provides long-term storage and transport of the world?s most abundant but intermittent source of energy. In the transition from fossil fuels to hydrogen as an energy carrier, materials science will play an unprecedented role. Significant materials challenges exist in the production and storage of hydrogen related to development of renewable hydrogen energy based technologies. This joint effort between the University of Maryland and the Dayalbagh Educational Institute in Agra, India, implements a systematic study focusing on design, synthesis and evaluation of inexpensive, abundant and stable transition metal oxide semiconductor materials, hematite, titania and copper oxide, with end applications in photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen. The team brings together expertise in nanomaterials synthesis and characterization (US/India), and photoelectrochemistry (India). The objective is to improve the state-of-the-art for this class of photoactive materials through careful integration of synthesis, characterization, and simulation, and to use this basis for substantial fundamental advances in materials design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through scientific exchange, as well as exchanges of personnel, the team develops significant intellectual infrastructure for materials research, as well as optimizes use of instruments and facilities at each of the partner institutions in this international collaboration. Beyond the laboratory, recognizing that advances in materials science will not be translated into improved quality of life without a well-trained scientific and engineering workforce, the multidisciplinary and multinational team and the timely topic of materials for hydrogen generation will attract and retain more students in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
