<AbstractNarration>The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), in collaboration with the public school districts of Baltimore County, Howard County and the City of Baltimore, is recruiting and supporting undergraduate STEM majors to pursue careers in secondary teaching of STEM disciplines (Math, Science, Technology). The project targets undergraduate STEM majors at UMBC as well as transfers from local area community colleges nearing the conclusion of their sophomore year who may have not previously considered careers in teaching. The project includes a five-year support network beginning during the initial experiences of pre-service teacher education and sustaining support through the conclusion of three years as a full time teacher.  The UMBC Noyce Scholar Program provides approximately $15,000 in scholarships and stipends to three cohorts each consisting of 12 undergraduate STEM majors. Each Noyce scholar completes a bachelor's degree in a STEM discipline by the conclusion of the first phase (Initial Certification) of the program. During the completion of the second phase (Induction Support), each scholar completes a Masters of Arts in Education degree that includes an additional 18 credit hours of STEM disciplinary content. The scholars engage in paid summer STEM research laboratory experiences as both an undergraduate (summer of senior year) and during their early years as a full time teacher (summer following their second year of teaching). These experiences are supported through leveraging NSF sponsored REU and RET supplements garnered by currently funded UMBC STEM faculty. Extensive interaction with a population of high-needs students occurs during the initial summer experience, during the following academic year and during the Scholars' culminating senior year teaching internship. In addition to preparing 36 highly qualified secondary teachers of STEM disciplines, the project provides an opportunity to investigate and disseminate aspects of the model. Assessment of the key components of the undergraduate teacher preparation model provides information associated with the types of incentives, experiences, marketing strategies and collaborations that can significantly increase the interest of STEM majors for considering a career in teaching. Similar information can be learned from the components of the induction support plan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The over-arching goal for the UMBC Robert Noyce Scholars grant was to increase the number of UMBC STEM majors entering and completing the teacher certification program.   The original target number for the Noyce Scholars program was to graduate 36 teacher-candidates.  At the conclusion of this grant we were able to produce a total of 32 STEM teachers.   What is truly impressive is the overall growth of the secondary (grades 7 &ndash; 12) STEM education program.  Prior to the start of the UMBC Noyce award the five year (Spring 2005 &ndash; Spring 2009) total number of secondary (grades 7 -12) STEM program completers was 50 students, with yearly cohorts ranging in size from 3 &ndash; 19.  During the duration of the grant (Fall 2010 &ndash; Spring 2015) the five-year total of UMBC secondary STEM program completers increased by 78% for a total of 89 students.  During this five year time span cohort size ranged from 9 &ndash; 27.  It should also be noted that during the 2010 &ndash; 2015 time frame an additional 11 students entered the final teaching internship but still have outstanding assignments preventing them from being considered a "program completer."     One of the main recruitment strategies outlined in the original grant proposal was the creation of an extended summer teaching experience.  This experience was intended to be the initial teacher education experience for the perspective Noyce scholars and included 3-weeks (1.5 hrs per day, Mon &ndash; Thurs.) of controlled practice teaching.  This component of the grant was highly effective.  This summer teaching experience utilized high school students from the UMBC Upward Bound program.    This summer program was conducted from summer 2009 through the summer of 2012, with a total of 51 students participating.   Of the students who participated in the summer program, 25 received Noyce scholarships and 3 others received funding from other programs.  The Noyce grant did not have sufficient funding to provide the summer experience during the summer of 2013 although an alternative funding source (UMBC Sherman Scholars program) was secured to provide a modified summer 2014 program.  During summer 2014 an additional 11 students participated with 7 students deciding to continue in the education program.  Four of the seven students received Noyce funding.        The Teacher Quality &ndash;Chemistry (TQC) program for the past four years, has adapted the controlled practice teaching component of the Noyce summer experience.   The TQC program is a year-long professional development program authorized by Title II, Part A of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 via the Maryland Higher Education Commission.
