<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: &lt;br/&gt;Magnetic ceramic nanoparticles will be studied in this project to explore their interesting physico-chemical properties and their prospective applications in catalysis and gas sensing.  Enhanced device performance is expected for these systems at the nanoscale, due to their large activity associated with their large surface areas.  In particular, the solubility in the form of nanoparticles is considerably greater than the bulk solubility; the reasons for that are not yet understood.  Phase diagrams at the nanoscopic levels will be constructed, as they are believed to be different from those of the bulk.  This approach could provide a veritable breakthrough in the nanotechnology of magnetic systems.  The students and the post-doctoral fellow involved in this project will make a significant impact on the infrastructure at Duquesne University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: &lt;br/&gt;The project proposes the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles doped with tin, titanium, zinc, cerium, chromium and zirconium.  The techniques used to prepare the system of nanoparticles are hydrothermal synthesis and mechanochemical activation.  The structural and magnetic characterization will be performed using Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, magnetic measurements and thermal analysis.  This project determines for the first time the solubility limits of a system of nanoparticles and it uses for the first time an application based on the Mössbauer effect to infer information about miscibility.  The structural and magnetic information derived from these techniques will be related to results of measurements of the sensing properties, in order to develop tailored characteristics of enhanced chemical sensors for select applications.  This project will train undergraduate students who will work at the frontiers of science and have a significant impact on the current understanding of magnetism in solids.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
