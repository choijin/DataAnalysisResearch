<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0847758        PI: Mao, Chuanbin              ORG: Oklahoma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Genetically Modifiable Shape-Tunable Protein Nanotubes as Templates for Controlled Nano-Synthesis and Assembly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Precise assembly of nanocomponents and morphological control of nanoassemblies are still of great challenge in nanotechnology.  The objective of this proposal is to use a filamentous bio-nanostructure, Salmonella typhimurium bacterial flagellar filament (FF), as a platform to surface-display an ordered array of foreign peptides for directing the synthesis and assembly of inorganic nanomaterials and understanding protein-material interactions.  FF is a self-assembling protein nanotube (2 nm in inner diameter, ~15 nm in outer diameter) that can be purified from bacterial cell surface.  It is self-assembled (polymerized) from several thousand copies of a single protein called flagellin (monomer).  FFs from Salmonella typhimurium bacteria used in this project are unique compared to other biotemplates used earlier in nanotechnology for the following reasons: (1) The surface chemistry is genetically modifiable. (2) Their shapes can be tuned by simply changing solution conditions. (3) Their length can be controlled. (4) They show lyotropic liquid crystalline (LC) self-assembly and their helical forms can self-assemble into a novel LC structure called conical phase.  The PI will use Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and nanorods (AuNRs) as model materials to study the control of their 1D and 3D nano-assembly by individual and LC phase FFs, respectively.  He will also use silica as a model material to study the polymorphism of FFs under materials synthesis condition and FF-templated synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials and nanoholes.  The project will show how peptide display on FFs as well as polymorphism and LC self-assembly of engineered FFs can direct the nano-synthesis/assembly with a precise control over the spacing, organization and morphology of nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  This project will be integrated into the PI?s educational activities to: (1) develop an interdisciplinary bionanotechnology (BNT) curriculum at the undergraduate/graduate level, (2) train Ph.D.  specialists and undergraduate students with multidisciplinary skills in BNT, (3) equip community college (CC) students with BNT knowledge &amp; skills by partnering with CCs, (4) develop a Native American Nanotechnology Outreach (NANO) program by partnering with Native American students, high school (HS) educators and Native American Research Center for Health (NARCH) program in Oklahoma, (5) nurture ?Bio-Nano-Aware? HS students and teachers through outreach to HSs, and (6) organize ?Speaking of Nano? events and disseminate BNT research findings to Oklahoma statewide by partnering with the Oklahoma Nanotechnology Initiative (ONI).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
