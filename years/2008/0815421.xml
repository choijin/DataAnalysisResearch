<AbstractNarration>Intelligent Merit: The intent of this proposal is to conduct a national, retrospective study of specialized science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) schools that provide a more rigorous course of study for academically talented, science-focused students.  The main goal of the proposed work is to determine what contributions can be made to public policy decisions about SMT education relative to specialized schools.  The study will examine the educational and career consequences of these schools to gain better insights about their contributions to the SMT workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a three-phased approach, this study will focus on graduates from specialized high schools and their counterparts from regular high schools as a comparison group.  During the first phase of the study, graduates from one specialized high school and from a comparison group will be studied, while during phase two, three specialized schools and comparison groups will be studied.  In phase three, the study will be expanded using the same study respondents from the first two phases.  Throughout the first two phases, methods and instruments will be crafted, piloted, and revised.  Overall, the study will involve 5000 graduates from specialized SMT schools and 1000 graduates with similar backgrounds from regular high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research questions for this study include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Are graduates from specialized SMT high schools more likely to enroll in SMT-related studies and career fields when compared with graduates from regular non-magnet non-examination high schools with comparable academic and demographic backgrounds?&lt;br/&gt;2.  What school models employed by specialized SMT high schools are most associated with entrance into SMT-related studies and career fields? (School models include: residential schools, schools-within-schools, regional centers with half-day courses.)&lt;br/&gt;3. To what degree do graduates from specialized SMT high schools who pursue non-SMT degree concentrations and careers attribute value to the SMT skills and content they experienced at their high school?&lt;br/&gt;4. Do graduates from specialized SMT high schools differ in their professed understanding and personal interest regarding science-related public issues from graduates of regular non-magnet non-examination high schools with comparable academic and demographic backgrounds?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The study will likely advance discovery and understanding about how schools should be structured to ensure academically talented students, including those historically underserved, reach their fullest potential. The results could inform policy about the value of SMT schools to the STEM workforce, hence, in that regard, it could e transformative.  Key partners (e.g. schools, universities, and corporations) have been assembled to provide broad-based support to specific aspects of this project.  The qualitative phase of the study will target the perspectives of graduates on factors (e.g. education, success, ethics), other than enrollment and achievement. The advisory board represents a variety of expertise and stakeholder communities and will likely yield a wider dissemination of results and findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Study of the Impact of Specialized Public High Schools of Science, Mathematics, and Technology  Why Study Selective Science, Mathematics and Technology (SMT) Schools and Programs?  &bull;            Some students complete middle school with strong interests, skills, and knowledge in science and mathematics, and aspire to high level careers in STEM. They seek opportunities at SMT schools to build on these interests and skills with peers and teachers who share their involvement with science.   &bull;            Students who are advanced and interested in science are not being sufficiently challenged in many of todayÆs high schools.  SMT schools and programs offer one way to meet their educational needs.  &bull;            Other young people may benefit from adaptations of curricular and environmental components of SMT schools that appear to predict completion of STEM university degrees.   Overarching Research Question  &bull;            What is the impact of participation in a selective SMT school on completion of a STEM major in university?  Study Participants  &bull;            Study participants were comprised of 2004-2007 graduates of 25 selective SMT schools (N=3,510).  Same age peers with high standardized test scores who enrolled in advanced mathematics or science classes in the summer (N=603) and did not attend an SMT school served as a comparison group.    &bull;            The overall study sample was 69% white, 23% Asian, 4% African-American, 4% Hispanic, and 5% "other."  English was the primary language for 79% of the study participants, and 54% were female.  &bull;            20% of SMT school graduates who completed STEM degrees had parents with no education beyond high school; the same for 2% of the Talent Search participants.  Percentage Completing a University STEM Degree  &bull;            49.8% percent of graduates of selective SMT schools   &bull;            53.4% percent of Talent Search participants   &bull;            22.6% of all students entering college during this same time period  &bull;            26.5% of students scoring at the 95th percentile or higher in a sample of SAT-M test results (overall sample N=87,840)  &bull;            17.3% of students scoring at or above the 95th percentile on the combined SAT Critical Reading, Math, and Writing tests (sample size=87,740)  SMT Schools Are Organized into Several Models  &bull;            Residential: Draws from an entire state. All students reside on campus. (n=8 schools)  &bull;            Half-Time: Students attend a regional center for SMT courses daily. (n=7 schools)  &bull;            Full-Time Commuter:  Whole school is SMT and draws from local metropolitan population. (n=4 schools)  &bull;            School-within-School:  An academy within a regular high school.  (n=6 schools)  &bull;            A fifth model, early college, university-based school, was not included in the study because all but two are very new.
