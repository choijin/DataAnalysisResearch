<AbstractNarration>This project will continue work on the development of methods for the chemical synthesis of single-chirality, structurally uniform carbon nanotubes.  Despite intense scrutiny by scientists and engineers worldwide for nearly two decades, carbon nanotubes are still being made today by poorly understood, empirical, high temperature methods based on the transition metal-mediated capture of atomic, diatomic, and polyatomic carbon species from the gas phase.  It is the goal of this project to develop synthetic organic chemical methods that will make possible the rational chemical synthesis of all-carbon single walled nanotubes that are closed at one end and open at the other, with predefined, uniform diameter, chirality, end cap structure, and rim structure.  The project builds on and extends methods previously developed in the laboratory of the P.I. for the chemical synthesis of numerous geodesic polyarenes, including fullerene-C60.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Lawrence T. Scott of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College.  Professor Scott's research efforts revolve around the development of methods for the synthesis of nonplanar networks of trigonal carbon atoms.  Such chemistry could provide access to ultra thin, super strong, and light weight nanowires with metal-like electrical conducting properties.  Successful development of the methodology will create new opportunities for advances in nanotechnology, from materials science and bioengineering to molecular scale circuitry and electronic devices.</AbstractNarration>

If a collection of identical, short CNT could be synthesized "from the ground up" in the laboratory and they could then be elongated by the repetitive addition of carbon atoms to their rims, like adding bricks to build a chimney, then every resulting CNT would be of the same type; the diameters of all the CNTs produced and the structures of their sidewalls would all be identical.
