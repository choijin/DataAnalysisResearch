<AbstractNarration>The aquatic research community is rapidly equipping ecological sites with a broad range of sensors and instruments.  However, the development of aquatic sensing networks is significantly lagging terrestrial counterparts.  It is widely recognized that an aquatic counterpart to low cost, low power, wireless radios is needed to advance the state-of-the-art in underwater sensor networks.  Unfortunately, there are few open-architecture, low power and low cost underwater acoustic modems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project looks at an alternative hardware platform for wireless underwater communication.  Reconfigurable devices will be used to create a software defined acoustic modem (SDAM) ? the underwater counterpart to software defined radios being proposed for future generations of terrestrial communications.  The SDAM can be remotely programmed, which enables adaptive sensing capabilities and changes to the network without physically retrieving the device.  Since the communication protocol is programmed into the modem, the same SDAM board can be used for a variety of different underwater environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is to develop a prototype SDAM that uses a reconfigurable device for physical layer processing.  This requires careful design of a system architecture that can communicate with the sensors, interface with acoustic transducer(s), efficiently compute physical layer algorithms, and provide services to the rest of the network stack.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project center around the incorporation of embedded and reconfigurable computing systems into course material, and the use of the SDAM for ecological research, which enables long-term understanding of many ecological processes, including the effects of environmental degradation and climate change on coastal and lake ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Training of Undergraduate Researchers: This grant supported three undergraduate students to work engineering aspects of developing the acoustic modem.  Brian Faunce continued the work as MS student. After graduation, he founded the company AcoustiComm. Jennifer Trezzo is currently a graduate student at UCSD and a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. John Moffatt graduated and is working on related topics at state irrigation facility.  Outreach to High School Students: PI Kastner has taught the UCSD California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) program for the past three years. This is a four-week residential program to expose high school students to embedded systems. The COSMOS program is designed specifically for talented and motivated high school students with demonstrated interest and achievement in math and science.  We designed the course around six embedded systems labs that made use of the Cypress Semiconductor Development kits.  These labs were supplemented with lectures on embedded systems concepts and the C programming language to give the students the tools they would need to complete the lab assignments.  Once the students completed all six lab assignments, they developed their own embedded systems group projects with the use of one or two development boards.   Undergraduate Curriculum Development: We developed an embedded systems based curriculum for UCSD CSE30 "Computer Organization and Systems Programming."  This class was a first step into introducing embedded systems material into an early level undergraduate class at UCSD.  The embedded systems material, including 6 weekly labs that use the Cypress Semiconductor embedded systems boards, were introduced into CSE 30.  The material in this class is being adopted by other universities around the world.       Last Modified: 11/08/2011       Submitted by: Ryan Kastner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
