<AbstractNarration>This proposal involves three projects. The first concerns modeling and&lt;br/&gt;efficient simulation of heteroepitaxial growth using kinetic Monte Carlo &lt;br/&gt;and will build from prior NSF support which resulted in the&lt;br/&gt;development of a Fourier multigrid method for the fast solution of&lt;br/&gt;discrete elastic equations for complex geometries.  This work will be &lt;br/&gt;extended to develop methods for obtaining inexpensive upper bonds on&lt;br/&gt;rates, the use of local computations for elastic equations, and the inclusion of&lt;br/&gt;intermixing of multiple species.  The second project involves the &lt;br/&gt;simulation of grain boundary motion in two and three dimensions using&lt;br/&gt;a recently developed multiphase variational level set framework which&lt;br/&gt;allows one to systematically deduce level set equations for a network of&lt;br/&gt;grains moving under curvature flow. We plan to extend this formulation to &lt;br/&gt;allow the simulation of thousands of seeds by using only a few level set&lt;br/&gt;functions.  The efficient computation of high frequency wave propagation &lt;br/&gt;and the semi-classical limit of the Schrodinger equation is the third&lt;br/&gt;project. The proposed algorithm is based on the observation that most of &lt;br/&gt;the time, in these limiting regimes, the solutions are very localized &lt;br/&gt;in the wavenumber domain. This can be exploited by solving the equations in this&lt;br/&gt;domain using a fast local convolution. It is planned to update the solutions&lt;br/&gt;by  the computation of the matrix exponential using a Krylov subspace&lt;br/&gt;approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the proposed projects has the potential to have a significant impact &lt;br/&gt;on problems that are both fundamental and technologically important. &lt;br/&gt;Heteroepitaxial growth is scientifically interesting since it has effects&lt;br/&gt;on both nanoscales and mesoscales.  It is technologically relevant since&lt;br/&gt;quantum dot materials are made in this way.  Our proposed techniques will&lt;br/&gt;greatly increase the simulation speed  thereby facilitating  model development.&lt;br/&gt;The study of grain boundary motion using curvature flow is a classic problem &lt;br/&gt;in applied and computational mathematics which has importance in material s&lt;br/&gt;cience. Since there are no robust simulations of a large number grains in &lt;br/&gt;three dimensions the proposed project should have significant impact. &lt;br/&gt;The efficient computation of high frequency wave propagation has important &lt;br/&gt;facets ranging from antenna design to seismic sensing.  On the other hand,&lt;br/&gt;fast simulation of the semi-classical limit of the Schrodinger equation &lt;br/&gt;could  provide deeper insight into chemical reaction dynamics, &lt;br/&gt;molecular-surface scattering, and photodissociation, for example.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the development of efficient computational methods for three important applications thereby allowing simulations on length and time scales not previously attained in prior work. The first project was concerned with the simulation of strained epitaxial growth using kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC).  Epitaxial growth is a process by which electronic devices can be manufactured and elastic strain can result if different materials are used. KMC is a modeling approach that allows one to formulate atomistic scale models that have correct thermodynamic behavior. However, KMC simulation for strained epitaxial growth is slow because it requires one to compute the elastic field billions of time during the course of a simulation. This project focused on both speeding up the computation of the elastic field and reducing the number of times it needed to be updated.  The second project involved the simulation of grain networks which are ubiquitous in many metals such as steel. The properties of these grains can determine  the strength of the metal. In this project, we developed a computational method capable of the simulation of the hundreds of the thousands of grains.

We developed a transformation based on the Gaussian wavepacket solution that allows one to transform the Schroedinger equation into a new equation whose solutions are not highly oscillatory. This has allowed us to compute accurate solutions of the Schroedinger equation in the semiclassical limit for up to four dimensions.  These projects also involved the training of graduate students in areas of material science and computational methods for both partial differential equations and stochastic processes.
