<AbstractNarration>Mutations are errors in replication that result in offspring having a different gene than either parent. They play a fundamental role in many biological phenomena; they are the ultimate source of all genetic variation and are manifested as the rich diversity of life on earth. Mutations are also the source of genetically based diseases of humans and other organisms. Despite the biological importance of mutations, little is known of their fundamental properties, including their rate of production and their effects on the health of the organism. The goal of this project is to estimate mutation rates and to quantify the effects of mutations on the survivorship and reproduction of individuals. These characteristics will be estimated by allowing mutations to accumulate in the offspring of a number of homozygous parents, using the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Any genetic differences in the offspring must be due to new mutations. The effects of these mutations will be quantified at field sites where parental plants were originally collected. The rate and fitness effects of mutations will be determined in the field, where they would actually occur, providing a more realistic estimate than is possible in controlled laboratory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research significantly advances the fundamental understanding of mutation effects, and has broad implications for a range of biological questions from understanding the origin of heritable diseases to the role of mutations in the fate of small populations. Because the study organism, Arabidopsis thaliana, is a widely used model organism, these new mutation resources will become a valuable resource for the community of researchers studying this species or its close relatives. Students from under-represented groups will be recruited to participate in the research, and the investigators plan to develop new student labs in ecology and genetics at the high school and undergraduate levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mutations are errors in DNA replication which result in offspring having a different DNA sequence than either parent. Mutations play a fundamental role in many biological phenomena. Mutations are the ultimate source of all variations in genetics, variations that are manifested as the rich diversity of life on earth. Mutations are also the source of genetically based diseases of humans and other organisms. Despite the biological importance of mutations, we are only beginning to understand their fundamental properties, including the rate at which they occur and their effects on the health of the organism.     The goal of our project is to accurately estimate mutation rates and to quantify the effects of mutations on the survivorship and reproduction of individuals. Our research is conducted using a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis thaliana has been the focus of study by plant geneticists for decades, and more is known about its genetics than any other plant.  The general strategy we employ is to start with a single plant genotype, and then create multiple lineages from a founder individual.  Each lineage is then propagated for many generations through self-pollination. Within each lineage unique mutations occur and accumulate, gradually contributing to differentiation among the lineages.     Our approach differs from previous studies in that we are evaluating the effects of mutation in the natural habitat of our study organism.  Arabidopsis thaliana is native to Eurasia.  We have collected plants from the northern and southern ends of its native range (Sweden and France).  We then allowed plants from each of these populations to accumulate mutations over many generations.  Finally, we planted plants that had accumulated mutations and plants that had not accumulated mutations back into field sites in Sweden and France.      Our results will allow us to understand whether mutations are more likely to have harmful effects on an organism if the organism is already a good fit for its local environment.  For example, mutations may be more harmful for Swedish populations grown in Sweden than for Swedish populations grown in France or French populations grown in Sweden.  Understanding how environmental context shapes the consequences of mutation will allow us to understand long-term changes in plants and animals, as well as assisting breeders working to improve domesticated organisms.      At this point, our results indicate that characters related to reproductive performance are consistent with the idea that populations are performing best in the environment where they have been found historically.  We are completing compiling the final results of measures of performance for each mutation accumulating lineage.  We will combine this with whole genome sequences of the lineages with mutations. Altogether, we are combining resources available to a genetic model system with field experiments that are readily carried out in a plant-based study system.        The project has trained nine undergraduates at the College of Charleston, including 5 females and one student from an underrepresented minority, in the practice of research as research apprentices.  One student continued working on the project after entering a master's program at the College.  For three of these students, participation has already led to authorship of a peer-reviewed publication. In addition, the project has allowed first-time international travel for two students, travel to an international meeting for two students, and participation in field work.  Two students (one undergraduate, one master's) had the opportunity to participate in international field work, as they participated in the field plantings in both Sweden and France.  A postdoctoral scholar was also trained as part of the project.  Furthermore, the project has also allowed the principal investigator to develop curricular materials for introductory biology that integrate Arabidopsis thaliana research ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
