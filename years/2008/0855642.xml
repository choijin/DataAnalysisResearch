<AbstractNarration>Many technological marvels in modern society rely upon our ability to&lt;br/&gt;understand and control the properties of materials on a microscopic&lt;br/&gt;level, such as tuning the electrical conductivity in semiconductors that&lt;br/&gt;are used to make computer chips. In the last decade, there have been&lt;br/&gt;great advances in the creation and study of ultracold clouds of gaseous&lt;br/&gt;atoms, which are cooled by lasers to temperatures around a millionth of&lt;br/&gt;a degree above absolute zero. Ultracold atoms made in this way have the&lt;br/&gt;amazing property that their interactions can be arbitrarily controlled,&lt;br/&gt;which opens the possibility of using them to make designer materials or&lt;br/&gt;test models of complex and important phenomena such as high temperature&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity. The tool currently used to control these interactions&lt;br/&gt;is the application of a strong magnetic field, but magnetic fields have&lt;br/&gt;disadvantages; it is difficult to quickly change large magnetic fields&lt;br/&gt;or vary fields on small length scales. Prof. Killian's research group at&lt;br/&gt;Rice University in Houston, Texas will develop new techniques for&lt;br/&gt;manipulating atom-atom interactions using lasers, which are much more&lt;br/&gt;flexible and may open the way to new applications such as laser beams&lt;br/&gt;made of atoms instead of light, or the ability to make new states of matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will also involve at least two graduate students and one&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate student, and it will train them for high-technology&lt;br/&gt;careers in optics or materials. The ultracold atomic physics laboratory&lt;br/&gt;at Rice also has a partnership with the Houston campus of Yes Prep High&lt;br/&gt;School, a highly successful charter school targeting disadvantaged&lt;br/&gt;youth. This collaboration brings high school students into the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory for term-time visits and summer camps, and introduces them to&lt;br/&gt;the excitement of science at the frontiers of discovery in hopes of&lt;br/&gt;inspiring them to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math&lt;br/&gt;careers. Basic atomic physics experiments such as these are laying the&lt;br/&gt;scientific and human resources foundation today for the technological&lt;br/&gt;marvels of tomorrow.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ National Science Foundation-supported research at Rice University studies the behavior of dilute gases at temperatures as low as 10 billionths of a degree above absolute zero. In this regime, quantum mechanics dominates; more than one particle can be in exactly the same place at the same time, and a single particle can be in more than one place at a time. When a system of many particles enters this regime, the system is referred to as "quantum degenerate." The strange properties of such systems underlie important macroscopic phenomena that are more familiar to us, like magnetism and superconductivity.  In order to understand these phenomena, and search for new effects, we create simple model systems that allow us to isolate and probe the underlying physics. Ultracold atoms serve this important role because the individual particles are well characterized, and their interactions can be controlled in ways that are not possible with traditional materials.  During the period of this grant, we created the first quantum degenerate gases of atomic strontium, which opens new possibilities for studying exotic material properties.  Strontium in particular, has two valence electrons, which is unlike most other elements that have been coaxed into the quantum degenerate regime. This difference has been predicted to lead to new types of collective properties in quantum fluids. In particular, it enables lasers to be used to control the interactions between the atoms, through an "optical Feshbach resonance." Interactions can be made negligible, strongly attractive, or strongly repulsive, which is very valuable for studying the fundamental properties of these systems and also holds promise for applications such quantum computing.  The attached false-color images of strontium atoms show, from left, a sample just before the transition to a quantum degenerate regime, in which it forms a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC); the start of the BEC's formation as the atoms chill to near absolute zero (the blue "pedestal" at the bottom is atoms not yet in the condensate), and right, a pure BEC. The BEC contains about 300,000 atoms and is about 50 mm in diameter. The BEC is narrow because the atoms have entered a state that has the minimum kinetic energy possible, and thus the BEC atoms do not move as far when the atoms are released from their trap.

Students learn how to plan and execute a complicated, technical project, and then analyze and present their results. These analytic skills are valuable whatever professional path they eventually follow.  Students learn technical skills related optics, electronics, computer data acquisitions and experimental control, and vacuum systems. They also have many opportunities to improve their communication skills through presentations at group meetings, department seminars, professional conferences, and writing of journal articles and theses.
