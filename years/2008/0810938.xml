<AbstractNarration>The rapidly increasing sizes of the data sets being treated in various applications is starting to  render inadequate many of the traditional methods used in data exploration.  These methods break down not only because of  the increase in the  number of observations  (size of datasets themselves)  but also because the underlying  phenomena observed are intrinsically of high dimension, i.e., they involve a large number of variables  or parameters.  High-dimensional  datasets present great mathematical challenges but in  practice, the related difficulties are mitigated  by  the fact  that  in most  cases,  not  all the  measured variables  are  important  for  an  understanding  of  the  underlying phenomenon.   One  of  the  difficulties faced  by  current  dimension reduction techniques is that  existing algorithms are often too costly when dealing  with very  large data  sets.  To tackle  a few  of these challenges  the research team  of  this  project  will focus  on  the development of computationally efficient methods which blend classical techniques such  as PCA or  LLE, with other strategies  from numerical linear  algebra and  approximation  theory, to  reduce problem  sizes.  Thus, multilevel or divide and  conquer techniques are quite common in other  areas of  scientific computing  but received  relatively little attention in data  mining. The proposed work will  put methods of this type at  the forefront.   The research team  will also  consider tools borrowed   from  graph  theory,   specifically  techniques   based  on hypergraphs, graph  partitioning, and kNN graph  construction, to help with  dimension reduction.   Finally,  this project  will address  the complex issue of  dimension reduction by means of  tensors and the use of multilinear algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Society  is  currently facing  an  unparalleled  surge of  exploitable information in  scientific, engineering, and  economical applications.  Typical examples of such applications include face-recognition which has uses in  security and commerce for example,  and the processing of queries  on the  world-wide web.   The  data sets  generated in  these applications are not only gaining in size (more data samples) but also in  their dimension (number  of parameters  or variables  to represent each data sample).  For example,  in face recognition, where one deals with sets of pictures the size would be the number of pictures and the dimension  would  be the  number  of  pixels  used to  represent  each picture.   Reducing the  dimension of  data is  a vital  tool  used in applications dealing  with large data  sets.  It is therefore  not too surprising that  this line of research has  gained enormous importance in the last few years.  The investigators of this project will explore methods to  solve this problem,  putting an emphasis on  those methods characterized  by low computational  cost. Among  these methods  are a class  of divide  and  conquer  techniques which  divide  the sets in smaller ones on which the classical methods are applied independently.</AbstractNarration>
