<AbstractNarration>The successive innovations in semiconductor manufacturing over the&lt;br/&gt;last 35 years of Moore's law have turned what used to be a room-sized&lt;br/&gt;computer system into a single chip composed of billions of&lt;br/&gt;transistors. These levels of integration have forced a change toward&lt;br/&gt;parallelism in computer system design, including both single-chip&lt;br/&gt;multiprocessors and systems-on-a-chip. Today, these chips have a few&lt;br/&gt;tens of individual processors but future scaling will make hundreds or&lt;br/&gt;thousands available on a chip. Critical to the success of such systems&lt;br/&gt;is the hardware network that enables the processors on the chip to&lt;br/&gt;communicate with one another. Today's chips typically employ simple&lt;br/&gt;networks-on-chip (NOCs) such as bus, ring, or small grid. Future&lt;br/&gt;systems with numerous processors will need scalable and innovative&lt;br/&gt;NOCs to provide high communication bandwidth, low latency, and low&lt;br/&gt;power consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop scalable NOCs that are well suited to&lt;br/&gt;switch and wire capabilities in emerging chip fabrication&lt;br/&gt;technologies. In particular, the project would investigate new NOC&lt;br/&gt;topologies that exploit the enormous number of on-chip wires while &lt;br/&gt;reducing the number of hops to travel from a source to a destination. A&lt;br/&gt;second challenge is avoiding congestion in the network, much like&lt;br/&gt;avoiding automobile traffic congestion at rush hour. The investigation&lt;br/&gt;will develop new methods of monitoring the status of the routers and&lt;br/&gt;links in the network so that network messages can route themselves&lt;br/&gt;around network hotspots, improving network latency and bandwidth for&lt;br/&gt;all traffic. An important outcome of this research would be a public&lt;br/&gt;repository of network traces for different types of on-chip network traffic that will help improve the experimental methods of all NOC researchers.</AbstractNarration>
