<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to study the fundamental interfacial friction mechanisms and to develop new design concepts for both nanocomposites and nanoimprinting. A unique approach will be developed to quantitatively measure the interfacial friction in nanofiber reinforced metal/ceramic nanocomposites and in metal nanoimprinting. The aim is to demonstrate the principles of controlling the interfaces to achieve strong, tough nanocomposites, and non-lubricated nanoimprinting technology. In addition, a multiscale modeling at atomistic and micromechanics scales will be developed to interpret experimental results and address important questions on the interfaces in nanocomposites and nanoimprinting. The modeling and experimental work will be integrated to determine the interfacial friction mechanisms at nanoscale. The research results will provide a generic methodology for measuring the interfacial friction at the nanoscale, design guidelines for material development, and new concepts for material and process optimization strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research unifies two high-impact themes, nanocomposites and nanoimprinting, by an innovative methodology created for studying nanoscale interfaces critical to both themes. The integration of experimental measurement and theoretical analysis on the interfaces will offer insight into the interfacial phenomena and uncover new interfacial mechanisms. Our success will also generate a series of positive advances on applications, including but not limited to: strong, tough and light-weight structural material systems for next-generation engines in the aerospace; multifunctional nanomaterials for MEMS components and devices, and environmentally-friendly manufacturing. Together with the proposed basic research, a matching education program will be carried out, which will provide basic research training and education opportunities to graduate students, undergraduate students and high school students. Special effort will be made to encourage women and under-represented minority students to participate in the research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
