<AbstractNarration>This project is focusing on manipulating ultracold Rydberg atoms in spatially localized ensembles. The unique properties of such atoms make it possible for a blockade mechanism to extend over the entire sample, allowing for interesting quantum effects to be observed. The approach to this problem allows high quality quantum manipulations while accounting for key issues that arise from the complexity of the atoms. In particular, care is taken to make samples of appropriate geometry with sufficiently large Rydberg-Rydberg interactions to allow the blockade mechanism to work. To this end, resonant microwave fields induce oscillating dipole moments in the atoms. The blockades are identified by looking at the quantum statistics of phase-matched four-wave mixing light generated under blockade conditions. In a second experiment, the dephasing of collective Rabi flopping is studied in the regime of weak to poor blockade. It is predicted that dephasing will be prominent under conditions of poor blockade, but will disappear at strong blockade levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is committed to significant undergraduate involvement and has a history of its undergraduate students continuing on to graduate school in AMO physics. The PI has integrated concepts from the research project into undergraduate courses from which he recruits undergraduate researchers. The training of graduate students is a particularly important broader outcome of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the first two years of this project we studied the properties of cold Rydberg atoms when excited by light and microwaves.  These studies allowed us to learn more about the interactions between the atoms under these conditions.  This work resulted in several scientific publications and public presentations.  In the course of this work we realized some new ideas for approaches to the problem of precision measurements using nuclear magnetic resonance.  These new developments have resulted in two patents being submitted, and we changed the direction of the research to see if the ideas were correct.  The NSF gave us permission to pursue these new ideas and we did two experiments that confirmed some of the essential technology.  In particular, we demonstrated a new type of sensitive magnetometer and we also used an existing dual Xe NMR apparatus to set new limits on exotic extensions of the standard model of physics.  As a result of these investigations, we published about 15 scientific papers and gave numerous talks.  An important component of this research is the training of students.  One student obtained his Ph. D. and is now teaching physics at St. Norbert College.  Two other graduate students received substantial training but are now pursuing other work.  A fourth graduate student has had a very successful first year of research in pursuing the new magnetometer and NMR technologies.  Our research has also led to new measurement technologies that are in the patenting process.  It is quite possible that these new technologies will find industrial applications.
