    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0813944&lt;br/&gt;Prakash&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory work seeks to develop a new micro-nano hybrid tool for in-situ monitoring, characterization, and control of nanofluidic transport phenomena for applications in water purification, proteomics, molecular sensing, and on-chip separations. This microfabricated multi-layer tool with integrated working, counter, and reference electrodes will measure the impedance to transport of various species across nanoscale fluidic components like nanopores, nanochannels, and nanocapillaries. These measurements based on the principles of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) will illuminate the physics of transport within confined nanoscale geometries. Electrochemists and biologists have used impedance methods to study reaction kinetics and cell transport. However, this exploratory work is one of the first attempts to use these methods for evaluating transport across nanofluidic components leading to inherent complexity and risk in the research. If successful, it is expected that this exploratory work will lead to the development of a new microscale system for probing, characterizing, and eventually controlling nanoscale transport that will significantly enhance fundamental understanding of nanofluidics by describing in detail the role of surface charge, analyte type, electrolyte properties, surface conduction, and wall-species interactions. Developing a tool to probe nanoscale transport phenomena will open new avenues for answering fundamental questions about nanoscale transport phenomena. Quantitative information about the multitude of parameters like surface charge, surface conduction, electrolyte properties, and analyte type will lay the foundation for significant advances in the nascent field of nanofluidics. These applications are expected to provide revolutionary advances in proteomics and genomics, water purification, and chemical and biological sensors with important implications towards public health and welfare. An essential component of this research program will be to develop a new course in micro- and nanosystems with a focus on micro- and nanofluidics. This cross-disciplinary course taught through mechanical engineering will train future generation of scientists and engineers for continued impact in the growing field of micro- and nanofluidics.</AbstractNarration>
