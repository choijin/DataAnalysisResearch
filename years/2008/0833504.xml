<AbstractNarration>The "AccessSTEM: The Northwest Alliance for Students with Disabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics - Phase II (AccessSTEM2)" project will increase the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degree attainment of individuals with disabilities in the Seattle, WA region.  The primary institution, the University of Washington (UW), is partnering with Bellevue Community College (BCC), Seattle Central Community College (SCCC), and all high schools within the Seattle Public Schools system to accomplish this goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AccessSTEM-Phase 2 Alliance will increase the associate, baccalaureate and graduate STEM degree attainment of students with disabilities by attending to the following four objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Implement changes within awardee and partner postsecondary institutions (UW, BCC, SCCC) to make STEM programs more welcoming and accessible to students with disabilities (e.g., more accessible websites and science labs, STEM publications that encourage the participation of students with disabilities);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Create and expand engagement of stakeholders (precollege STEM educators, disability services, veteran associations, projects that broaden participation in STEM, and industry and career services) in fostering STEM education and careers that are welcoming and accessible to people with disabilities;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Implement evidence-based practices (e.g., mentoring, peer support, internships) to increase numbers of individuals with disabilities moving through critical junctures to STEM associate, baccalaureate, and graduate degrees and careers; and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Support and expand an online resource center that shares research and promising practices worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

A total of 465 individuals participated in five groups: (1) STEM educators, (2) disability services personnel, (3) veterans-serving organizations, (4) leaders of projects that serve to broaden participation in STEM, and (5) industry and career services. Broader Impacts: AccessSTEM2 ensures long-term impact because it  broadens the participation of people with disabilities in STEM academic programs and careers, including those who are also women, underrepresented minorities, and/or economically disadvantaged;  builds on existing networks and creates durable relationships among stakeholders in an integrated effort that enhances the infrastructure for research and education;  publishes transformational research and practices to enhance understanding and promote replication; and puts into place structures that will sustain project impact after the project funding period has ended.  Transformational project outcomes benefit society by making STEM opportunities available to more citizens and by enhancing STEM fields with the talents and perspectives of people with disabilities.
