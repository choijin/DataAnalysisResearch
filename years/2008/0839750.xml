<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project seeks to determine the feasibility of a web-based tool that provides depression treatment for Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. A recent Pentagon report estimates that approximately a third of all soldiers returning from deployment suffer from a mental health disorder and that unfortunately the military health system does not have the resources in place to address this problem due to limitations in both labor and funds. The proposed innovation will enable the military's mental health professionals to offer an effective, evidence-based and drug-free depression intervention, which will effectively mitigate stigma concerns faced by military personnel and will provide treatment at a fraction of the cost of the typical depression interventions available today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the effort will create significant value by 1) allowing VA mental health professionals to provide an easily accessible, evidence-based and drug-free depression treatment to returning military personnel suffering from depression 2) enabling veterans to seek treatment without having to face the fear of stigmatization due to seeking face-to-face treatment that is typically within the confines of a mental health care facility 3) reducing the economic burden on the military health care system by providing an effective and scalable depression treatment of at a fraction the cost of today's typical depression interventions. With an estimated 10 million veterans and 60 million civilians in the U.S.A suffering from depression, cost-effective and innovative methods to help address this burgeoning healthcare epidemic are critical to the well being of our nation. Through further research, this web-based framework can also extend to other mental health problems that plague our country such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Drug Abuse, Anxiety and Alcoholism.</AbstractNarration>
