<AbstractNarration>The High Performance Database Research Center at Florida International University  is leveraging the Hadoop framework, which implements Google's computational paradigm MapReduce and provides distributed file system services, for serving geospatial imagery and to execute spatial queries with heterogeneous predicates. This work is laying the foundation for high-performance geospatial querying. For instance, queries such as "the percentage of Florida state's land-mass that has vegetation" can be computed using basic image processing (map operation) at each image tile, followed by a simple summation (reduce operation) across tiles that comprise the aerial imagery of the Florida land-mass. A potentially infinite number of such semantic queries can thus be computed using the MapReduce paradigm and a large-scale raster imagery dataset. This exploratory work is providing a bridge between geospatial Web services and the MapReduce platform which has demonstrated success in other data-intensive applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is expected to produce a major impact on the field of geospatial data management and especially decision support based on geospatial data, by enabling decision support queries which were not previously practical.  This will provide a foundation to enable critical decision support applications in fields such as disaster mitigation and environmental protection.This work is also providing a uniquely comprehensive collection of geospatial data to a broad research community.</AbstractNarration>

TerraFly users visualize and query aerial imagery and data layers.  Users virtually "fly" over imagery via a web browser, without any software to install or plug in.  Tools include user-friendly geospatial querying, data drill-down, interfaces with real-time data suppliers, demographic analysis, annotation, route dissemination via autopilots, customizable applications, production of aerial atlases, application programming interface (API) for web sites.  The TerraFly project has been featured on TV news programs (including FOX TV News), worldwide press, covered by the New York Times, USA Today, NPR, and Science and Nature journals.  The 40TB TerraFly data collection includes, among others, 1-meter aerial photography of almost the entire United States and 3-inch to 1-foot full-color recent imagery of major urban areas.  TerraFly vector collection includes 400 million geolocated objects, 50 billion data fields, 40 million polylines, 120 million polygons, including: all US and Canada roads, the US Census demographic and socioeconomic datasets, 110 million parcels with property lines and ownership data, 15 million records of businesses with company stats and management roles and contacts, 2 million physicians with expertise detail, various public place databases (including the USGS GNIS and NGA GNS), Wikipedia, extensive global environmental data (including daily feeds from NASA and NOAA satellites and the USGS water gauges), and hundreds of other datasets.  In the present project, we used MapReduce to execute and benchmark massive data computations in the GIS domain.  The specific problems that FIUÆs team has addressed are:  Scalability in geo-textual search algorithms is an important concern.

We have designed and implemented the multiplicative update rule of the algorithm in MapReduce. Our results show fair scalability of our implementation. Shortest Paths problem has a long research history. Although exact algorithms have been developed, they are not of practical use for large scale real road networks due to their high computational complexity (cubic on the number of vertices in the graph representation). Parallel algorithms have also been developed to cope up with the problem. However, parallel solutions are mostly tied to specific parallel computational mod...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
