<AbstractNarration>Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This program involves two related projects with technological potential.  Current-Perpendicular-to-Plane Magnetoresistance of metallic magnetic multilayers is a competitor for next generation read-heads for hard-disks.  Comparing measured specific resistances (sample area times resistance) of interfaces between new pairs of carefully chosen metals, with no-free-parameter calculations made by collaborators, will let the MSU group test fundamental understanding of transport in multilayers, thus providing the basis for technological design.  Spin-transfer-torque induced magnetization switching and generation of GHz radiation in magnetic multilayers is of interest for writing magnetic random access memory and as a current-controlled source of radiation.  To clarify the underlying physics, the MSU group will measure how switching currents and radiation vary with different combinations of magnetic and non-magnetic metals.  The group also plans to study generation of vortices in nanopillars and with point contacts (the latter a collaboration), including in multilayers with antiferromagnets.  These projects will give graduate and undergraduate students experience in planning and carrying out cutting-edge research.  The program involves international collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: &lt;br/&gt;This program involves two projects, both involving metallic magnetic multilayers, alternating layers of magnetic and non-magnetic metals, with each layer only a few atoms thick.  The change in electrical resistance with applied magnetic field, measured with the current flowing perpendicular to the layer planes of the multilayer, is a competitor for next generation read-heads for computer hard-disks.  The MSU group will compare measurements of specific resistances (sample area times resistance) of interfaces between carefully chosen pairs of metals, with no-free-parameter calculations by collaborators.  This comparison will provide the basis for technological design.  Until recently, the magnetizations of magnetic layers (effectively, tiny magnets) in magnetic nanopillars could be reversed (switched) only with an external magnetic field.  However, it was predicted, and then shown, that a new phenomenon, spin-transfer-torque (STT), lets such switching be induced by passing a large enough current density through the nanopillar.  Such current-induced switching is of interest for writing multilayer magnetic random access memory.  STT also allows generation of high-frequency (giga-Hertz) electromagnetic radiation with the technologically interesting ability to change the frequency by varying the applied current.  Studies of combinations of different magnetic and non-magnetic metals will clarify the physics underlying both phenomena, thereby assisting technological design.  These projects give graduate and undergraduate students experience in planning and carrying out cutting-edge research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have been studying metallic multilayers composed of alternating layers of two different metals with each layer only several atoms thick.  The multilayers can contain either a ferromagnetic metal and a non-magnetic metal, or two non-magnetic metals.  Because the layers are so thin, the properties of their interfaces play a major role in determining the device potential of such multilayers. Most of the devices involving such multilayers utilize measurements of their electrical resistance, which determines how the electrons that carry electric current through the multilayers are scattered both within the layers and at the interfaces.  We pioneered measurements of the electrical resistance when the conduction electron flow (electric current) is perpendicular to the layer interfaces.  We have determined the interface resistances of a wide range of metal pairs.  When the two metals are lattice matched&mdash;i.e. have the same lattice structure and the same lattice parameter to within about 1%&mdash;there has been surprisingly close agreement between our experimental values and calculations involving no-free-parameters.  These agreements strongly suggest that we basically understand the scattering of electrons at metallic interfaces.  We have also now determined for a range of metal pairs the extent to which the magnetic moments of conduction electrons are reversed (flipped) as the electrons cross metallic interfaces.  A new technique that we recently developed for ferromagnetic/non-magnetic interfaces has revealed that such flipping is often significant.  It is important to understand such spin-flipping, because it is generally detrimental to device performance.  Unlike the simple scattering of electrons at interfaces, which seems to be well understood, spin-flipping of electrons at interfaces is not yet understood.  The data that we have obtained should give guidance to theorists to explain our results.       Last Modified: 07/18/2012       Submitted by: William P Pratt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
