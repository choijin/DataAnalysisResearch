<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II proposal aims to commercialize a new mesoporous silicate nanoparticles for the reinforcement of thermoplastic polymers used in the manufacture of U.S. cars and light trucks. Whereas nanoparticles, in general, provide some polymer reinforcement benefits, they typically lack the ability to provide strength as well as stiffness. Also, they normally require extensive organic surface modification for dispersion in the polymer matrix. Organic modifiers limit nanoparticles thermal stability and compromise their suitability for nanocomposite manufacturing through cost-effective melt processing methods. The purely inorganic mesoporous silicates this project plans, circumvent all of the limitations caused by organic modifies by providing a unique combination of surface polarity, mesopore size, surface area, and pore volume which optimizes interfacial interactions between the particles and the polymer matrix for effective dispersion and reinforcement. In addition to providing stiffness at particle loadings, the mesoporous silicates provide strength, which allows the amount of polymer needed to produce an automotive part to be reduced in proportion to the added strength. The polymer savings alone allow users of the technology to reduce the weight of the vehicle, achieve stiffness, and improve fuel economy at no added cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of automotive nanocomposites can directly impact the US energy economy, as well as environmental quality. The combination of reduced vehicle weight and increased fuel economy translates into a reduction in petroleum consumption and green house gas emissions. The process for producing mesoporous silicate nanoparticles is neither energy-intensive nor environmentally harmful. Based on aqueous sol-gel chemistry, this project's nanoparticles are manufactured in yields at a temperature of with no harmful waste released to the environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Due to the (global) rising price of gasoline, combined with ever more stringent fuel economy requirements, automotive OEMs are seeking every possible means to improve the fuel efficiency of their vehicles. Of the multitude of approaches being tried, it is well-understood that vehicle weight must be reduced to meet these goals. The challenge is reducing weight without compromising safety or increasing cost.  One approach being explored is increasing the amount of plastic and/or reducing the weight of the currently used plastic. In both cases, it is necessary that the plastic provide both sufficient strength as well as stiffness, so that weight savings is realized through a reduction of the amount of polymer needed to fabricate a part.

What is needed is an additive which reduces part weight without diminishing mechanical properties.  The mesoporous silicate materials developed with NSF funding (NSF Award Number IIP-0822808 entitled "Automotive Nanocomposites") achieves this objective.

Since the amount of polymer removed is greater than the amount of additive included, the additive can cost up to eight times more than polymer without impacting final part cost.  The specific objectives of the NSF sponsored research were to scale-up our Silapore particle production capacity, identify those particles which work best with certain polymers, and perform measurements to quantify physical properties of the composites. Our project achieved all of these objectives.  At the outset of this project, we were capable of producing 50 gr batches of material, but by the conclusion of the project, we were regularly producing 3-4 kg batches of material. This demonstrates that critical scale-up issues had been successfully addressed. Our technology provides the means to prepare a number of different mesoporous particles, different in terms of their textural (morphology, surface area, pore size, etc.) and surface chemistry. Our testing showed that while certain particle/polymer combinations were better than others, certain of our particles performed well across all polymer families. With low loadings of Silapore particles, typically 5-10 wt%, mechanical properties of polymers/Silapore composites were significantly increased as compared to the base polymer. Additionally, other properties, such as thermal stability, are also improved.   During the course of this research, there were two surprising findings &ndash; Silapore particles:  Reduce the cure time for epoxies (which can reduce cycle time, thereby improve production throughput); and Improve flame retardancy.   As we work to commercialize these materials, we believe that the combination of flame retardancy and improved mechanical performance provides the necessary value proposition to interest customers in our products.
