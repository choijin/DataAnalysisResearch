<AbstractNarration>The proposed research has three aims: 1) to describe the relations among children?s behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement in mathematics instruction; 2) to use observationally-based approaches to examine what occurs inside the classroom to describe the contribution of classroom processes to student engagement; 3) to examine the relation between students? engagement in learning and mathematics proficiency, considering the extent to which students? engagement serves explains the relation between classroom social processes and student mathematics achievement. Work is situated in the context of the presence or absence of two instructional approaches: inquiry-based mathematics instruction and the Responsive Classroom Approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Report for the Public  Policy-makers, researchers and educators agree that students in the U.S. lag behind in math achievement compared to other nations. Most efforts to address this problem focus on improving the content of math instruction. However, learning math involves classroom experiences and student psychological processes that need to be better understood so that teachers can engage students in the process of learning. This is particularly important in light of new mathematics standards (Common Core) that heighten the demand for students to be actively engaged in learning.  The main objective of this study was to use information gathered from various informants (teachers, students, observers) to improve our understanding of studentsÆ engagement and learning in mathematics instruction.
