<AbstractNarration>This project is centered on the further exploration of 2-methyleneoxetanes, 1,5-dioxa-spiro[3.2]hexanes, 4-oxaspiro[2.3]hexanes and 3-alkylidene-2-methyleneoxetanes, strained heterocycles with useful reactivities.  Improved access to a range of 3-alkylidene-2-methyleneoxetanes will allow preliminary examination of the utility of these compounds as inhibitors of fatty acid synthases.  Initial studies have shown that novel, oxetane-containing nucleosides, which may serve as anti-viral or anti-bacterial agents, can be accessed with this methodology. In addition, a new, mechanistically interesting approach to usefully functionalized tetrahydrofurans will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Amy R. Howell of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Connecticut.  Professor Howell's research efforts revolve around exploiting unusual, strained heterocycles as scaffolds for efficient organic synthesis.  Such chemistry will contribute to the preparation of novel, biologically interesting small molecules and will have an impact on the pharmaceutical and agricultural sectors.</AbstractNarration>

General approaches to 2-methyleneoxetanes, 1,5-dioxaspiro[3.2]&shy;hexanes, and 4-oxaspiro[2.3]hexanes had been previously developed.

Through industrial internships and career development activities, studentsobtained a foundation for making informed choices about future careers in chemistry and established networks with peers and mentors from a range of disciplines and backgrounds.  The research completed provided novel and efficient approaches to useful synthetic intermediates and laid a foundation for programs that over the long term may provide novel chemotherapies.
