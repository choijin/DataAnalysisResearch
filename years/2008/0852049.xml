<AbstractNarration>The Tuskegee University REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Eight students will be selected each year to participate in a 10-week research program in the area of integrative biosciences. Students who are rising juniors or seniors are eligible to apply. Students who do not have research programs at their institutions or from underrepresented minority groups are especially encouraged to apply. Participants can select from a number of research projects on plant genomics, biocomplexity in the environment, computational biology and bioinformatics, animal sciences and cell/molecular biology. Aside from an intensive mentored research experience in integrative biosciences research, which is defined as involving the integration of two or more science disciplines, students will be able to participate in an orientation session, an ?Introduction to Research? course, an Ethics in Science component, a Research Certification and Safety Training program, a GRE preparation workshop, and seminars in professional development skills. A field trip will also occur during the course of the program.  At the completion of the summer, the participants will write and present a report of their research projects. Research stipends, housing and travel will be provided.  Additional information is available at www.tuskegee.edu/our/, or by contacting the Program Director, Dr. Olga Bolden-Tiller at 334-727-8403 or obtiller@tuskegee.edu or the Director of the Office of Undergraduate Research, Sharee Small at 334-727-8295 or smalls@tuskegee.edu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The Tuskegee University IBS-REU site provided undergraduate students (primarily rising juniors and seniors in the STEM majors, but particularly in biology, Chemistry, Animal Sciences, Plant and Soil Sciences, other bioscience majors) a unique opportunity, taking a novel approach to conduct research by integrating multiple areas in the biosciences. We define "integrative biosciences" research as any research where the continued integration of two or more science disciplines is requisite, for example, determining the consequences of genetically-modified plants (Plant Genomics, Plant Sciences) on soil microbial biodiversity (Soil Science, Soil Microbiology, Genetics).  The primary objectives of this project were to (1) increase the number of undergraduate students, particularly minorities and those who do not have access to research opportunities, involved in integrative biosciences research in a diverse and nurturing environment; (2) broaden the recruitment pipeline for the IBS PhD program at Tuskegee University and similar programs at institutions across the country by exposing an increased number of undergraduates to a highly productive research environment in integrative biosciences; and (3) provide students opportunities to experience co-mentoring, research safety training and certification, improvements in student technical writing and presentation skills, introduction of students to research ethics, Graduate Record Exam (GRE) preparation, and greater contact of the students with minority science role models/mentors.

Although all participants have not yet graduated from college, of the 41 IBS REU participants, nine have been accepted into or enrolled in graduate programs; four were accepted to or enrolled in veterinary school; and three have secured jobs, including one of which who became a science teacher (NSF Noyce Scholar) and returned to TU during Summer 2012 as an Research Experiences for Teachers fellow.   The success of the program is best highlighted by the comments received from the program participants, such as the samples below.     -"I really enjoyed my first research opportunity.  It was a blessing and IÆll never forget what IÆve learned from Summer 2011 at TU."     -The best thing about CHEM 299 [Introduction to Research course] was "working with students from other programs."     -"&hellip;I enjoyed the networking and the amount of information presented [orientation week and certification week] the most."   -"The program helped me understand research so much more and IÆm so thankful we were able to be research certified; interacting with other REU students was fun and a great learning experience."
