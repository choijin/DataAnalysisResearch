<AbstractNarration>"RDE-RAD: Collaborative Research: Ohio's STEM Ability Alliance (OSAA): STEM Degrees and Careers for Ohioans with Disabilities" will increase the quantity and quality of students with disabilities receiving associate, baccalaureate and graduate degrees in STEM disciplines and their entry into the STEM workforce.  This collaborative project includes the following partners: Wright State University, the Ohio State University, Sinclair Community College, Columbus State Community College and numerous high schools in the Dayton and Columbus regions of Ohio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the project is to increase the quality and quantity of students with disabilities receiving associate, baccalaureate and graduate degrees in STEM and entering the STEM workforce, with the following specific three numerical goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Increase recruitment of high school students with disabilities (from a pool of 2000) and transition to STEM majors in OSAA community college and university partner institutions by 20% through student learning communities and mentoring opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Increase retention and graduation rates (associates, baccalaureate and graduate degrees) for existing STEM students with disabilities in OSAA's community college and university partner institutions from 10% to ~20% through student learning communities, mentoring (electronic and internships), and individualized STEM advisement.&lt;br/&gt;3. Increase successful entry rates of OSAA STEM graduates (associates, baccalaureate and graduate) with disabilities into STEM graduate programs or STEM employment by 5% per year (from 2007 baseline measures) through focusing on employment issues in student learning communities, industry internships and parallel employer education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation team for this collaborative project includes two independent evaluators, Dr. Dianna Newman, the Director of the Evaluation Consortium and Professor of Educational and Counseling Psychology at the State University of New York, Albany, and Dr. Jeffrey White, an Assistant Professor of Education at Ashland University.  Dr. James Altschuld, Emeritus faculty at the Ohio State University will serve as an on-site evaluation team member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of project deliverables and reports will focus on institutions in Ohio region as well as sharing the model with a national post-secondary audience via a web-based diffusion portal, presentations at national conferences and publications in professional journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Wright State University component of Ohio's STEM Ability Alliance was designed to address the underrepresentation of individuals with disability among those pursuing higher education and careers in STEM fields.  The program consisted of a collection of purpose targeted interventions to remove barriers to success for Students with Disability (SwD) and active advising to help students identify, employ, and internalize barrier removal methods appropriate to their specific requirements.    Over the eight years for which we have collected student success data, the Wright State project personnel made contact with over 300 SwD.  Of those contacted, 263 participated on one or more academic terms of project supported programming.  For these 263 SwD, our first year retention rate was 89%.  At the project's formal competion, 115 of the 206 OSAA students who had completed four years or more of coursework obtained STEM degrees (56%).  Based upon GPA and course completions, it is estimated that a minimum of sixteen more will graduate with STEM degrees after the formal completion of this project, bringing our STEM graduation rate to at least 64%.  Of the 115 students already graduated, 84 (69%) have confirmed employment in STEM careers or successful entry into a STEM graduate degree program.  These performance numbers are significantly higher than baseline success rates for all students in all degree programs at the project's home institution.  Intellectual Merit: This project serves as a clear demonstration of the efficacy of the Ability Advising model to significantly improve participation in STEM for the historically underrepresented group of Students with Disability.  The demonstration has significant value because its outcomes are measured in terms of primary outcomes (job placement and degree attainment) in addition to secondary indicators of success (retention rates).  The completed form of the project's techniques, including the interventions and advising model, are likely modifiable to improve outcomes for a wider range of underrepresented persons at relatively low cost.  Broader Impacts: We have helped a significant number of SwD in beginning careers in STEM fields.  We have also created a working demonstration of the efficacy of a tightly coupled advising and intervention model that has created permanent shifts in culture at our institution and may serve as justification for similar efforts being started at other institutions and for a broader slate of student demographics.
