<AbstractNarration>Duke University&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;Howard University&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;University of Kentucky&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award establishes a Center to conduct research and education on the environmental impacts of nanomaterials.  It will advance discovery of general principles that determine the movement and transformation of nanomaterials in the environment and their effects on organisms and ecosystems.  The Center will further translate this knowledge into the language of risk assessment to guide nanotechnology in ways that minimize harm to the environment.  This Center engages a highly interdisciplinary, multi-institutional team in integrated research to establish a theoretical understanding of how the physics and surface chemistry of nanomaterials determine their interactions with the environment, from the molecular level to that of entire ecosystems.  The Center will develop new methods for detection and tracking of natural and manufactured nanomaterials in the environment.  Information on nanomaterial properties and environmental impacts will be synthesized into models that can be used to predict environmental risk.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology holds great promise both to the nation's economic growth and to enhance our ability to live in more sustainable ways.  However, the responsible implementation of this technology is hampered by uncertainty over the environmental impacts of nanomaterials. There is an urgent societal need to understand this risk, while at the same time providing guidelines for safe design to prevent environmental harm.  This Center will conduct the fundamental research necessary to reduce uncertainty in the environmental impacts of nanotechnology.  It will contribute uniquely to a network of nanotechnology centers that serve the national needs.  The Center will also promote interdisciplinary training of the next generation of nanoscale scientists and engineers in ways that broaden participation in the newly emerging field of environmental nanoscience.  In collaboration with national laboratories, non-governmental organizations, and industry, the Center will further research and education goals and engage in outreach that informs both experts and the public at large about the safety issues surrounding nanotechnology</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Center for the Environmental Implications of NanoTechnology Project Outcomes Report The Center for the Environmental Implications of NanoTechnology (CEINT) unites groups from seven US universities and many other research partners with a single vision: to elucidate general principles that determine nanomaterial behavior in the environment and to translate this knowledge into models to provide guidance in assessing existing and future concerns surrounding the engineered nanomaterials. We study the role of nanoparticles in ecosystems, their movements through the environment, their occurrence and transformations, their interactions with organisms, the mechanisms by which they exert their influence, and the influence that these materials may have on organisms and ecosystem functions. Setting the context Responding to concerns over possible effects of nanomaterials on the environment and human health, CEINT researchers have examined how many key nanomaterials are produced, developed models describing where they may go in the environment, and performed extensive laboratory and controlled field experiments to look at how nanomaterials may transform and the effects they may produce. Enabling measurements CEINT researchers have developed high sensitivity techniques to characterize nanoparticles (NPs) in the environment and to reliably detect nanomaterials within complex surroundings such as sewage sludge, soils and sediments, and inside the cells and organs of plants and animals. Understanding nanomaterial movement and transformation in the environment Significant progress has been made in developing mathematical models that describe how nanoparticles behave in critical systems such as wastewater treatment plants, rivers and lakes, sediments, and agricultural land. CEINT has shown that chemical reactions may radically change the way that manufactured nanomaterials move through the environment and the toxicity that they may have to various organisms they encounter. The nanomaterial studies so far have not shown strong evidence of toxicity in the environment unless they are made out of materials already known to be toxic.  However, sometimes subtle effects have been observed that hint at the powerful role that nano-scale materials play in environmental systems, where the presence of naturally occurring nanomaterials is many times greater than that of manufactured nanomaterials. CEINT has developed "functional assays" or tests that allow researchers or nanomaterial producers to rapidly obtain key information on how a given nanomaterial may behave in an environmental setting. Understanding bioaccumulation, bioactivity, and ecological effects of nanomaterials We have made significant progress on understanding the NP properties that affect their uptake and biodistribution. We have worked with plant and animal species in vitro, in microcosms, and in mesocosms. Using the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans model, we have demonstrated maternal transfer of silver NPs to developing embryos. We demonstrated food web transfers between species in several systems, leading in some cases to biomagnification. We have investigated correlations between particle size, dissolution rates, coatings, and toxicity. Forecasting risk &amp; integrating data CEINT has developed modeling tools that have improved the way phenomena controlling NP fate, such as NP aggregation, NP aquatic chemistry, and NP transport, are modeled. CEINT researchers have applied modeling approaches that accommodate the pervasive uncertainty inherent to emerging science (Bayesian, Monte Carlo, and Machine Learning methods), and have identified nano-scale properties associated with toxicity indicators in efforts to understand relationships between NP composition and activity. CEINT has created a NanoInformatics Knowledge Commons (NIKC), a database of nanoparticle properties, effects, and protocols designed for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing complex data to facilitate meta-analys...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
