<AbstractNarration>Chemical biology is the research focus of the NSF REU program that is jointly hosted by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Montana State University and by the Native American Research Laboratories (NARL) at the University of Montana.  Students who participate in this REU program will perform frontier research at the interface of chemistry and biology.  Projects are available in areas of research including proteomics, protein-protein interactions, protein-macromolecule interactions, protein-small molecule interactions, protein structure-function relationships, enzymology, and small molecule synthesis.  Students will work either in the NARL or in labs at MSU, and joint group meetings and a mid-summer symposium will facilitate interactions between the two sites.  Native American students and students from Montana's Tribal Colleges are especially encouraged to apply, as are students from small colleges within the upper Northwest region of the country.  Additional information and electronic application materials are available at www.chemistry.montana.edu/reu/.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the three year period of this award, thirty-eight undergraduate students participated in our REU program in chemical biology, which is jointly sponsored between the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Montana State University-Bozeman and the Native American Research Laboratories (NARL) at the University of Montana.

Eighteen of the students were from small schools in Montana and the surrounding states, and an additional seven students were from Tribal Colleges. The remaining thirteen students were from small colleges across the United States. A goal of our REU program is to provide summer research and enrichment experiences to Native American and/or tribal college students and students from small colleges in Montana and in the upper northwest region for whom research opportunities at their home institutions are limited at best.

Students participated together (via video chat) in group meetings at which they made PowerPoint presentations about their research projects. Each week, 2-4 faculty members also attended the presentations. During the summer of 2010, NARL students visited NASAÆs Marshall Space Flight Center and participated in "Space Camp" at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center.  Both groups participated each summer in a joint symposium at Flathead Lake Biological Station (Yellow Bay, MT). All of the students made short PowerPoint presentations (10 minutes plus time for questions) at this meeting.  The students and faculty of our REU program led three workshops at the MSU site for the twenty-five high school students who were on campus doing research through MontanaÆs Apprenticeship Program (MAP) each summer.  These students are from high schools on MontanaÆs seven Native American Indian Reservations and they spend six weeks at MSU working in the research labs.  In the mornings, the high school students have enrichment activities to boost their academic skills.  REU led three three-hour labs that were modified from our undergraduate chemistry/biochemistry curriculum. The REU students served as facilitators for all of the MAP labs.  This series of workshops has very successful, for the past nine summers.  Three of the students who participated in our REU program during previous summers participated in MAP prior to REU.  At the conclusion of the summer, each REU student submitted a written report on his/her research.  The faculty and graduate mentors worked closely with the participants to use the report as an opportunity to improve the writing skills of the undergraduates.   The REU students also created a poster for an afternoon poster symposium at MSU.  About seventy-five students who participated in summer research activities campus-wide presented their research findings, and approximately one hundred faculty members, graduate students, and administrators attended the poster symposium.  To assess the impact of the REU program on our students, each student participated in an individual exit interview. Students also participated in a focus group evaluation, filled out the online survey that was provided by NSF, and filled out pre- and post-program surveys. At their exit interviews, students listed the following as important skills they gained from our program: plating fungus, prepping samples for ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
