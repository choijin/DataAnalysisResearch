<AbstractNarration>Today's cognitive radio is characterized by its capability to perceive the existence of spectrum holes through spectrum sensing, and then transmitting on these unutilized frequencies. While each individual cognitive radio is very capable and can make independent decisions, lack of user coordination and network control raises serious issues in efficiency, security and resource waste in wireless environments. These problems call for fundamental changes in cognitive communication network design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, we introduce and develop the concept of cognitive network, which is defined as an intelligent wireless system that can collect and analyze the current network conditions, and then make real-time corresponding changes in network operating parameters, such as modulation scheme, transmission power, carrier frequencies, data frame structure, coding schemes, resource allocation and security management. We provide a comprehensive framework for the development of cognitive networks from a network-centric perspective. More specifically, we plan to:  (i) Introduce a novel architecture for cognitive network; (ii) Design efficient  and secure  resource management protocols; (iii) Develop highly efficient and resilient anti-interference/interception systems through multi-layer diversity; (iv) Develop cryptographic algorithms and protocols for anonymous routing and network integrity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research on cognitive networks introduces innovative methodologies on architecture development, system design, secure and efficient network management. It will significantly improve spectral efficiency, security and interoperability of communications between versatile wireless devices, and therefore provides an ideal human-technology platform for e-commerce, national security, environmental protection, health monitoring, as well as many future applications that can benefit from fast and reliable information exchange. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
