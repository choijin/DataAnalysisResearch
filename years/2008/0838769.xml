<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through modeling and data assimilation studies, University of Washington researchers seek to reconcile information on Antarctic sea ice and its interaction with the upper ocean and the atmosphere, throughout the modern era of satellite observation (1979 to present).  Links to changes and variability in Antarctic climate postulated in terms of the patterns observed in the Southern Annular Mode, mechanisms of likely positive trends in  Antarctic sea ice extent in an otherwise warming climate, and estimates of how the Antarctic ice-ocean system may respond to changing atmospheric circulation will be considered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model to be used in the study is the Global Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (GIOMAS; http://psc.apl.washington.edu/zhang/Global_seaice), a coupled global ocean/ice/atmosphere model. Technical improvements to this model include an update of the GIOMAS model physics appropriate to the Antarctic ice-ocean system; use of NCEP/NCAR and ERA-40 reanalysis data to drive atmospheric forcing, and, through numerical experiments, estimates of parameters  such Antarctic sea ice thickness, open water, snow depth, surface temperatures etc of interest to the climate and ecosystem research communities will be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."</AbstractNarration>
