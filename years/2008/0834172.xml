<AbstractNarration>The 2008 Materials Research Society Fall Meeting will be held December 1-5 in Boston, Massachusetts. Forty-five (45) symposia will be the technical core of the meeting, among them the F08QQ Synthesis and Processing of Organic and Polymeric Functional Materials for a Sustainable Energy Economy Symposium. Photovoltaics and solid-state lighting are examples of technologies that are envisaged in a new sustainable energy economy since these technologies would enable us to use a renewable energy source and to use present energy sources more efficiently. This symposium will be the venue for discussing novel synthesis and processing methods to fabricate organic and functional polymeric materials. Session topics include synthesis of organic and functional polymers for low-dimensional and three-dimensional materials, novel methods for directed assembly and printing, synthesis of engineered polymers and materials for optimal photon-electron energy transfer, synthesis of novel architectures to optimize energy transfer across interfaces, new materials for optoelectronics and photovoltaics, "Green" synthesis and processing methods, and innovations in materials characterization &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests travel support mainly for undergraduate/graduate students, post-docs and junior faculty to attend Symposium F08QQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Materials Research Society has a longstanding tradition to provide an international forum where senior researchers from academia and industry and students can exchange and debate new ideas. The list of invited speakers includes several international experts on organic-based photovoltaics and solid state lighting. This symposium provides excellent opportunity to accelerate the progress of energy and sustainability-related scientific research, as well as a great educational opportunity for participating students. The organizers comprise an interdisciplinary international team that is well qualified to prepare and conduct the symposium. All of them are internationally recognized experts with strong track publication records. Funding for this symposium will be used to facilitate participation by graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and young faculty through travel support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International symposiums are a highly effective means to exchange knowledge and advance science and engineering in an area of national importance. New materials for photovoltaics are expected to promote the diversification of energy resources whereas solid-state lighting will contribute to energy conservation, both goals of national interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bringing together researchers with different skills and backgrounds will facilitate knowledge leveraging and dissemination. Senior researchers will serve as role models to junior faculty and students. The 2008 Materials Research Society Fall Meeting will provide excellent educational opportunities for all participants in the form of several tutorials that are free of charge.</AbstractNarration>
