<AbstractNarration>The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth recruits high-achieving and motivated undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) majors into the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program in order to help overcome the chronic shortage of highly qualified math and science teachers and greatly increase the knowledge base and capability of students in these subject areas in high-need urban districts of southeastern Massachusetts. The Noyce Scholars are recruited in their sophomore year and provide math and science tutoring in high needs schools in their junior year. In their senior year, they receive a $10,000 scholarship while gaining teaching experience in high needs schools by interning with middle school and high school math and science teachers. Upon graduation, the Noyce Scholars receive another $10,000 scholarship to complete an accelerated teacher licensure and support program (TEACH!) leading to an MAT. A total of 28 scholars in four cohorts of seven scholars are being supported by Noyce Scholarships.  The initial cohort of seven Noyce Scholars receives support for one year of their MAT program and the three additional cohorts of seven scholars (twenty-one additional scholars) will receive support for their senior year and one year of their MAT program. The Noyce Scholars then receive 3 years of mentoring and professional support when they become classroom teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new School of Education, Public Policy, and Civic Engagement at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth is committed to strengthening the educational and social fabric of southeastern Massachusetts. Within the new school, an interdisciplinary STEM Department comprised of STEM content faculty and STEM education faculty works with K-12 educators to improve teaching practices and student attainment. Arts and Sciences and Education faculty members from this school serve as content coaches for the Noyce Scholars and continue to offer enrichment seminars after the Noyce Scholars begin their STEM teaching careers. As a result, each of the four cohorts of seven Noyce Scholars is a cohort of teachers with an unusual degree of content strength, instructional mentoring, and affiliation with the STEM professional and academic community. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
