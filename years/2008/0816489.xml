<AbstractNarration>The structure and function of ecosystems is governed by patterns of nutrient limitation of plants and those organisms that consume plant remains, such as soil microbes. Often, plants and consumers are limited by the same nutrient. However, increasing evidence indicates that different nutrients can be limiters in some ecosystems, a situation known as differential nutrient limitation. This study examines why differential nutrient limitation occurs in some ecosystems but not others, and what the consequences are with respect to the utilization and storage of carbon. These questions will be tested using a network of fertilized plots in four wetlands from Rhode Island to Georgia, including both freshwater and saline systems.  Standardized sampling at all sites will ensure comparable measurements of plant and microbial productivity, phosphorus cycling and ecosystem metabolism. It is expected that differential nutrient limitation will occur in ecosystems with higher rates of phosphorus mineralization and will yield less carbon storage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study has implications for ecosystem management and provides a conceptual framework to integrate ecological studies at multiple scales by understanding how nutrient ratios affects the biogeochemical cycles that govern ecosystem energetics. It includes a commitment to students from under-represented groups, including American Indians and African Americans, through a research mentoring program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Introduction, Hypothesis and Objectives   Wetlands are important ecosystems that provide a multitude of services for humanity. For example, in addition to serving as a reservoir for freshwater, they control floods on the landscape, serve as key nursery habitat for inland and coastal fisheries, and even moderate local weather conditions. Importantly, wetlands store almost one-third of the worldÆs carbon while covering a mere 3-4% of the total terrestrial land area. Soil carbon storage in wetlands is governed by the balance between the accumulation of carbon through plant growth and losses of carbon by microbial decomposition, both of which can be affected by the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The goal of this project was to better understand these processes and their responses to nutrients, while promoting ecosystem science through community outreach efforts. This study examined why DNL occurs in some ecosystems and what the consequences of DNL are with respect to the utilization vs. storage of carbon.  Experimental Design, Research Sites and Methods   We altered the nature of nutrient limitation through selective fertilization (no fertilization, +N, +P, and +N+P) in twelve experimental plots at each of four wetland sites. Early in 2009, we established research sites in North Carolina (pocosin freshwater bog), Georgia (tidal freshwater marsh), South Carolina (tidal salt marsh), and Rhode Island (tidal salt marsh). We collected baseline data on nutrients (C, N and P) in soils, plants, and porewater, measured rates of photosynthesis, and determined how much carbon soil bacteria decomposed. The relative proportion of these variables indicates if there is a net storage or loss of carbon in the ecosystem.  As part of the broader impacts of this project, we directly engaged middle schools students and teachers from South Dakota and minority undergraduate students from North Carolina to provide them with hands on experience with research and experimentation. We also provided training to multiple graduate students, technicians, and a postdoctoral researcher.  Results        Our results show very interesting trends in soil fertility that influence the responses of plants and soil microbes to nutrient additions and therefore affect the ability of wetlands to store soil carbon. Soils from the four wetlands differed in their ability to bind P and as a consequence had different amounts of P available for plants and microbes. Similarly, these sites differed in the amount of soil N and C. Overall, the plants in Georgia grew more when N was provided and did not respond to P additions, suggesting that N availability controlled their growth. In South Carolina, the wetland plants resp...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
