<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0801896&lt;br/&gt;H. Schmidt, University of California-Santa Cruz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The objective of this research is to investigate the dynamic response of single nanomagnets within the type of dense arrays that will be found in applications including magnetic data storage, memory, or biosensor arrays. The approach to this effort will be to use time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr (MOKE) spectroscopy in conjunction with optical near-field resolution to measure magnetization changes of single nanomagnets surrounded by magnets in dense arrays. Pre-commercial prototype samples will be fabricated and provided by the industrial partner, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The dynamic magnetization response is a natural limit for the operating speed of future nanomagnetic devices, and a thorough understanding of both the intrinsic magnetization dynamics as well as the influence of dynamically changing magnetic fields from nearby neighbors is essential to optimize device performance. Here, it is proposed to gain this knowledge by (i) developing time-resolved magnetization detection of a single nanomagnet within a dense array using both far-field and near-field MOKE, and (ii) measuring dynamic magnetic properties of individual metal multilayer nanomagnets in dense arrays with sub-picosecond resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The collaboration with HGST will ensure rapid translation of the results of this research to commercial magnetic storage devices, resulting in broad societal impact through a paradigm change in the way data are stored. HGST will also provide educational opportunities for students at different levels through summer internships and involvement in sample characterization for the project. In addition, undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities will be recruited to participate in the research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
