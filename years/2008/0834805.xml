<AbstractNarration>This research project studies the feasibility of digital, programmable, software-based control of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).  MEMS are extremely small physical structures capable of movement, lithographically combined with similarly-scaled electrical circuits to produce micron-scale mechanical devices.  Examples of MEMS are tunneling accelerometers, gyroscopes, and micro-mirrors.   Currently, analog controllers are used to control MEMS because of the very small time constants required to control devices at this scale.  This project has the goal of developing a new style of embedded, software feedback controllers that communicate to sigma-delta over-sampled analog interfaces via high sample rate delta encoding. These designs are the result of research in metric-based controller decomposition that specifically seeks to achieve the potential of multi-rate, over-sampled signal processing. Direct benefits of this work are digital controllers suitable for MEMS integration that match the requirements and potential of these designs, delivering performance/power ratios that are not possible currently.  Although the chosen implementation strategy is FPGA based, the decomposition strategy should lead to very small designs, competitive in power to current low-end microprocessors, with dozens to hundreds of times the performance achieved by current software based control using digital signal processing (DSP) platforms.  The broader impact of this research project is the development of practical techniques for the design and modeling of over-sampled controllers for MEMS devices that will have direct impact in medical prosthetics, distributed sensing, and the vast range of applications that can benefit from battery-operated sensor array devices. The project seeks educational impact in the form of graduate curriculum development and of efforts to enable substantive undergraduate involvement in research.</AbstractNarration>
