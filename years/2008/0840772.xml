<AbstractNarration>Ongoing collaborative research between investigators at Miami University and Ohio State University will focus on molecular and physiological adaptations used by insects for surviving low temperature.  Specifically this work will compare two distinct responses, termed rapid cold-hardening and winter cold hardening.  The first is an extremely swift physiological response that occurs within minutes to hours after mild chilling.  This rapid cold-hardening response is ecologically important because it allows insects to continuously fine-tune their physiological function and organismal performance to match even modest changes in environmental temperature.  In contrast, winter cold-hardening allows insects to survive extreme and extended periods of cold.&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a model insect, the fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis, to investigate changes in membrane fluidity and stress (heat shock) proteins that occur during cold-hardening.  The role of calcium and calmodulin in regulating rapid cold-hardening will also be investigated. The results of these studies will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the integrated physiological events that enhance cold tolerance and allow insects to adjust their physiological performance to match changes in environmental temperature.  This research may also provide new strategies and tools for disruption of insect pest populations and for the long-term storage of insects and other organisms at low temperature.&lt;br/&gt; Another major objective is to provide outreach and professional development for teachers and students, including continued collaborations with teachers in the development and publication of inquiry-based articles in peer-reviewed, science education journals.  The two laboratories will continue their commitments to training not only graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, but also undergraduate students by providing extended research experiences that include publication of scientific papers and presentations at national meetings. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
