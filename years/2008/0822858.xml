<AbstractNarration>A new hypothesis regarding the forcing of the stratosphere is that subtropical monsoon anticyclones affect the winter long-wave pattern, and that this explains the Southern Hemisphere (SH) "ozone croissant" as well as SH stratospheric variability related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The studies build on earlier work by the Principal Investigator's group, which showed that the Southeast Asian monsoon outflow creates the wave 1 asymmetry in SH midlatitude ozone known as the "ozone croissant." During austral winter and spring, Southeast Asian convection maintains two anticyclones in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere: the Tibetan High and the Australian High. Outflow around the Australian High into the Southern Indian Ocean forms the entrance to the Australian subtropical westerly jet. This baroclinic zone is a preferred band of longitudes for ozone transport and is a fundamental cause of the ozone croissant. Intensification of tropical convection strengthens the Australian High, which interacts with a traveling extratropical stratospheric ridge that is rich in ozone. As the Australian High amplifies, the ridge stalls and merges with it; this is a second dynamical cause of the croissant. Variability of the Australian High explains approximately 40% of variability of the strength of the ozone croissant. New results also indicate a distinct ENSO signal in polar stratospheric clouds and in the ozone croissant.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to understand better the SH stratosphere, in regard to its mean dynamical structures, the pathways for ozone transport, the relevant wave-mean flow dynamics, and its variability related to ENSO. A hierarchy of simulations with assimilated ozone data sets, conserved tracers, and trajectories will be carried out. Global analyses will be dynamically filtered and applied as initial conditions in the University of Wisconsin -Madison non-hydrostatic modeling system (UWNMS), in a domain covering the Southern Hemisphere. Baroclinic life cycle experiments will be performed with zonally symmetric initial conditions and with a wave 1 Australian jet. The interactions of synoptic and planetary waves in the midlatitude surf zone will be studied and the resulting wave behavior compared to linear theory. Pathways for ozone transport from the subtropical stratosphere into the ozone croissant will be determined. The effects of forcing a subtropical anticyclone on the jet and on traveling planetary waves will be investigated. Further statistical analyses will be performed to establish the mean structure of the austral flow and the relationship between ENSO and the stratosphere, allowing the hypothesis that interannual variability of the Antarctic stratosphere is linked to tropical convection to be explored. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work are in enhancing our understanding of the climate dynamics underlying the distribution of radiatively important trace constituents, interannual predictability, and global teleconnections. A postdoctoral scholar and a graduate student will be trained, and an undergraduate will participate in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An important process in climate dynamics is the influence of tropical convection on extratropical planetary wave structures.  Several current climate change problems can best be addressed within the framework of dynamical teleconnections from the tropics to the poles.  Our recent work has focused on understanding how changes in tropical convection influence the distribution of ozone in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) via modulation of planetary wave structures.  Communication from the tropics to high latitudes can be tracked as wave anomalies in the upper troposphere / lower stratosphere (UTLS).   The influence of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon on Antarctic surface temperatures exhibits a planetary wave train pattern that is distinctive for each season.    This work explored how changes in tropical deep convection on seasonal and ENSO time scales influence the distribution of column ozone in the SH.  Monthly mean TOMS column ozone for 1982-2004 exhibits a distinctive maximum in the band 40-60oS near Australia, the "Ozone Croissant," which extends from the Southern Indian Ocean (SIO) to the Eastern Pacific (Fig. 1).  This ozone maximum amplifies and rotates eastward from August to October.  The ozone increase is primarily over the high latitude Pacific (Fig. 1c). The ozone hole is located immediately poleward of the ozone maximum, and is displaced off of the pole toward the Atlantic, in accordance with the strength and location of the ozone maximum.  An improved understanding of the dynamics of the planetary waves which underlie the ozone maximum improves our understanding of the ozone hole.   The location of the ozone maximum is directly related to the geographical distribution of outflow from tropical convection in the UTLS, which is concentrated over the SIO.  This southward flow of tropical air creates subtropical anticyclones in the UTLS and provides the angular momentum for the entrance to the Australian westerly jet.  The ozone-rich troughs in synoptic waves breaking on the jet contribute to the monthly mean ozone maximum poleward of the jet (Fig. 2; cf. Hitchman and Rogal, 2009).  As Indonesian convection contracts zonally and shifts eastward during SH spring, so do the Australian jet and ozone maximum.   A second contributing factor underlying the ozone maximum is a tropical &ndash; extratropical linkage of anticyclones in a planetary wave pattern propagating in the UTLS. Convective outflow surges lead to amplification of subtropical anticyclones (Rogal et al., 2010), which often extend into the lower stratosphere and merge with stalling planetary wave ridges.  Commonly there are traveling wave two planetary waves in the extratropical stratosphere, which modulate ozone, with more ozone in the ridges in the lower stratosphere. An amplifying quasi-stationary subtropical anticyclone can merge with a traveling wave two ridge and stall, with the ozone maximum being located south of Australia (Hitchman and Rogal 2009).  Amplification of these ozone-rich planetary wave ridges over the high latitude South Pacific contributes to the seasonal eastward shift of the ozone maximum. This interaction between subtropical UTLS anticyclones and extratropical planetary waves becomes more active from August through October.   ENSO differences in SH TOMS column ozone and planetary wave structure in ECMWF data were explored for seven El Nino (EN) and six La Nina (LN) events.   A westward shift in convection during LN of 30-50&deg; corresponds to a 30-50&deg; westward shift of planetary wave patterns from the tropics to Antarctica and of  the zonal asymmetry in column ozone (Fig. 3). The underlying convective / synoptic changes for EN and LN are distinctive for each month (Hitchman and Rogal, 2010).   The UTLS over the Southern Indian Ocean  is a sensitive region where tropical convection can influence extratropical planetary waves via excitation of subtropical highs and propagation of Rossby wave activity through the conne...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
