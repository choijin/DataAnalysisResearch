<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Moses Lee at Hope College in Holland, Michigan and Professor W. David Wilson at Georgia State University will develop a class of H-pin polyamides that possess superb binding affinities and sequence specificity, and develop a new strategy for improving cell permeability using a new ?in nucleus DNA binding promoted? strategy. A successful outcome from this project will have a profound impact in the area of small-molecule-DNA interactions and the ability to control the gene expression. It will ultimately contribute to the advancement of the personalized medicine field, as potential medicines and DNA targeted diagnostic agents. Recent work has led to the design of novel compounds, such as the polyamide analogs of distamycin, which are capable of recognizing specific DNA sequences in the promoters of genes. These compounds generally have difficulty in entering cells and localizing in the nucleus. This biological barrier has been the major stumbling block in advancing the polyamide field and there is a major effort among the chemistry and biology communities to overcome this physical obstacle. This work will develop new strategies and explore fundamental science that will enable scientists to recognize specific genes in cells and control their function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal by Professor Lee at Hope College and Professor W. David Wilson at Georgia State University has a strong broader impacts component. It fosters an interdisciplinary learning through research theme in which students will learn various sub-disciplines of chemistry, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology. This will better educate students for the future and help to ensure America?s competitive edge. In addition, special emphasis will be placed on the training of woman and students from groups underrepresented in the sciences. Professors Lee and Wilson have a long and successful record of engaging these students in their research programs. Students will be recruited from two-year community colleges either through Hope College?s NSF funded S-STEM program or through participation in the NSF Undergraduate Research Collaboratives (URC) program of the Chicago Community Colleges Consortium. High school students will also have an opportunity to participate in this project through the Hope College program called Research Across Cultures at Hope (REACH).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
