<AbstractNarration>In the last 10 years, a strange way for faults to slip has been observed.  Rather than regular earthquake fault slip in a matter of seconds or steady deformation, both of which have been known to occur for decades, large parts of deep faults move unsteadily over the course of days or weeks, then stop moving for months to years before lurching in slow motion again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new mode of sporadic coupled deformation and weak seismic radiation is termed Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) has been discovered in several subduction zones. It recurs episodically down-dip from the locked portion of the Cascadia megathrust about every 14 months. The close relationship and likely interaction of the ETS zone with the locked and hazardous portions of subduction zones mandate better understanding of the ETS phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Array of Arrays project is a comprehensive study of many of the key questions surrounding ETS utilizing a temporary seismic deployment designed to image Cascadia Subduction Zone tremor in unprecedented detail. Specifically, a set of arrays are being deployed on the Olympic Peninsula to record the ETS events occurring during Summer 2009 and Fall 2010, comprising one 40-station array, six 20-station arrays, and a line of stations connecting two of the arrays.  There is also a backbone set of 15 short-period and 7 broadband continuously recording seismometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Array of arrays is unveiling the spatio-temporal details of the tremor location and depth, its migration, its spectral content at high frequencies, as well as better resolution of tremor and low-frequency earthquake source character.  Analysis of the data from this unique array will answer many key questions about tremor and further elucidate the physics of the ETS process, and provide answers to vexing issues of Cascadian earthquake hazard mitigation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) represents a newly discovered way that tectonic plates slip past each other along subduction plate boundaries.  In Cascadia, this slow slip occurs down-dip (east of) the magnitude 9 megathrust earthquakes which rupture primarily just off shore.  Slow slip events under northern Washington state and southern Vancouver Island occur every 14 months with durations of about one month.  Rupture fronts propagate along strike at roughly 8 km/day, often propagating 300 km or more.   We deployed eight arrays of seismometers on the Olympic Peninsula to image the details of this rupture process as it passes directly beneath the arrays.  Each array contained 10 to 30 stations with an aperture of 1 km and 10-20 km between arrays. We recorded two ETS events as well as several smaller tremor swarms.   When the plates are slowly slipping they create a complex seismic signal known as tectonic tremor.  We developed methods to determine the direction seismic waves are traveling from the tremor as they approach each array.  We then use directional observations at multiple arrays to pinpoint the location of the tremor source as a function of time. This provides unprecedented resolution of tremor location revealing hitherto unseen features of spatiotemporal distribution of tremor.  Tremor, and therefore fault rupture, seems to propagate in three distinct modes:  1) The rupture front propagates along strike at about 8 km/day.  2) Rapid Tremor Reversals (RTRs) often initiate near this rupture front and propagate back, along strike at 25 times this speed. 3) Over the time scale of several minutes to an hour, tremor propagates rapidly with velocity ranging from 30 to over 100 km/hr. Most of the time, these tremor streaks are parallel to the direction of slip on the plate interface, sometimes up dip and sometimes down dip.  This streaking tremor produces bands of tremor observed over the time scale of several hours to a day. Tremor bands, with their long-axis also parallel to the plate slip direction, swept Cascadia from south to north at a velocity of 8 km/day during some ETS events.  We observe a strongly heterogeneous spatial distribution of tremor with patches that experience repeated tremor episodes and produce most of the tremor. The patches, tens of kilometers in dimension, behave like asperities on the fault plane surrounded by regions that slip aseismically. The asperities fail quasi-periodically releasing stress and appear to regulate rupture propagation and tremor generation during slow earthquakes.  We have also identified tiny (magnitude -1 to 1) repeating low-frequency earthquakes.  One family, near the down-dip edge of the slow slip region repeats 2000 times per year and is clustered into swarms with typical durations of 1 hour, occurring roughly every two weeks.  In contrast the most updip family only repeats during the large ETS events.  There is a flurry of LFE activity for a few hours as the main rupture front passes the location of this LFE followed by 5 days of intermittent LFE activity.  We believe that the intermittent LFE repeats represent rapid tremor reversals and streaks that pass through this LFE location.   Our research on tremor and slow slip is already making its way into seismic hazard maps for California, Oregon, Washingon, and British Columbia. The up-dip limit of tremor is being considered as one way to estimate the down-dip (eastern) limit of slip during a Cascadia megathrust earthquake. This information ultimately plays a key role in building codes.  In addition, two recent subduction earthquakes in Japan and Costa Rica are thought to have been preceded by slow slip. Continued monitoring of tremor and slow slip in Cascadia may also reveal signals that precede the next Cascadia megathrust earthquake.
