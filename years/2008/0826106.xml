    <AbstractNarration>This research is directed towards developing the first real-time control system for the electrospinning process that will enable greater control over critical nanofiber manufacturing characteristics, thereby improving yield and production rate. Currently, the electrospinning process is run open-loop with respect to the actual process states, and there are large, unpredictable, time varying distributions of fiber diameter. However, emerging nanofiber applications for medical products and manufacturing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) require nanofibers produced to tighter specifications. The research is focused on understanding the process dynamics in order to develop the appropriate sensing capabilities and control design that will yield effective real-time control for electrospinning. The control design efforts will be directed to meet the requirements of several advanced applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrospun nanofibers are continuous polymer fibers with submicron diameters. They offer larger surface area per mass as well as greater mechanical strength than micron scale or larger fibers, so they are suited to a variety of important applications. High-value applications for nanofibers include improved life-saving surgical instruments such as hemostats and dermal templates, cell scaffolding that enables in-vitro tissue engineering, as well as low-cost manufacturing processes for carbon nanotubes. Each of these advanced applications are in a state where commercial companies are trying to move them from the laboratory to full scale production. However, development of a production process control capability that reliably delivers the required fiber distributions with minimum waste will significantly assist making the electrospinning process become commercially successful.</AbstractNarration>
