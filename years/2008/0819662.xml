<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator will study magnetic reconnection and the associated flare energy release in the form of accelerated electrons, particularly in sigmoidal solar active regions. The proposing team will carry out a comprehensive investigation of solar flare and CME events using newly improved hard X-ray (HXR) imaging and spectroscopy techniques. They will further examine the association of ribbon-like HXR sources with sigmoid eruptions, while quantitatively analyzing the spatial distribution of accelerated electrons and its evolution in the flaring process, in order to establish the most realistic 3D magnetic reconnection scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to investigate flare ribbon dynamics, paying special attention to the early phase of solar flare and CME eruptions. Using multi-wavelength data, the proposers will examine the physics of interrelated flaring phenomena, such as contracting-to-separation development and strong-to-weak shear change in H-alpha and EUV/UV, footpoint-to-ribbon evolution in HXR, and sigmoid-to-arcade transformation in EUV and soft X-ray (SXR). The PI will also use the HXR spectral index as a probe to diagnose electron acceleration during flares. The team will study the temporal and spatial relationship between the electric field in reconnecting current sheets and the spectral index of detected HXRs, in order to better understand the electron acceleration mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that sigmoidal structures are among the most important signatures for impending space weather events, this study will contribute significantly to the National Space Weather Program (NSWP) goal of mitigating the adverse effects of space weather on society's technological infrastructure. The PI's status as a beginning postdoctoral researcher constitutes this project's education and training component.</AbstractNarration>
