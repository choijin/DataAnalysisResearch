<AbstractNarration>The bee family Apidae comprises nearly 6000 described species (~35% of the bees in the world), including a diverse array of social forms, including solitary and communal orchid bees (Euglossini), the primitively eusocial bumble bees (Bombini), the advanced eusocial honey bees (Apini), and the stingless bees (Meliponini). Understanding the evolutionary history of social behavior in apid bees requires a phylogeny at the tribal and generic levels. However, currently a clear understanding of the phylogeny of this group is lacking because different data sets provide highly conflicting results. Morphological data and the fossil record appear to suggest a single origin of advanced eusociality (reproductive division of labor, overlapping generations, and cooperative care of young), while multiple molecular studies have supported dual origins of advanced eusociality. This project will combine data from morphology, the fossil record, and large molecular data sets generated with novel 454 Lifesciences sequencing technology to resolve the conflicting results obtained by previous studies. The research will allow a re-assessment of the morphological data, and are-examination of apid fossils from Dominican, Baltic, and North American amber deposits. The combination of fossil data and DNA sequence data will allow application of relaxed-clock dating methods to estimate the antiquity of the apid bees and the antiquity of eusociality. The project will lead to a revised classification for the family and improved understanding of the evolutionary history of bees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Bees are vital biodiversity components of the natural world and are critically important for pollination in human agrarian systems.  These social insects are at risk in the biodiversity challenges facing the world, and the project will train more of the kinds of scientists needed to understand the extent of the risks as well as potential solutions for such challenges.  The project will include traditionally underrepresented groups in the research, and partnerships with several universities and museums will provide a strong outreach to the general public.  The project will facilitate education of systematists and provide basic knowledge for understanding a unique group of insects that are of great practical importance to human society.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
