<AbstractNarration>The regulated, or programmed, death of cells is central to normal development, and to disease and defense response, in both plants and animals. Despite the importance of programmed cell death, little is known about this process in plants. This project seeks to identify the molecular and cellular events leading to genetically controlled cell death in maize pollen. A particular gene, part of the maternally inherited mitochondrial genome, is suspected to cause cell death associated with the S-type of pollen sterility in maize. To unequivocally identify the responsible gene, the University of Florida investigators will use genetic transformation to introduce the products of suspect or candidate genes into the mitochondria of normal maize pollen. They expect that the death of the genetically transformed pollen will identify the gene for this pollen sterility trait. To determine whether problems with mitochondrial function precede pollen cell death, these researchers will introduce protective gene products into the mitochondria of S-type pollen. Here, they expect that the rescue of pollen function will confirm links between specific mitochondrial events and programmed cell death in plants. The Bennett College for Women collaborators will use genetic transformation to introduce a highly regulated form of the cell death gene into plant cell cultures, such that cell death events can be induced and studied at will in the laboratory. The broader scientific impacts of this project include new tools and insights to better understand and manipulate cell death pathways for plant improvement. Educational impacts include not only the training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students at the University of Florida, but also the establishment of a research program involving undergraduates at Bennett College for Women. Bennett College for Women is one of only two colleges that historically served black women. This project will therefore establish a legacy, engaging students who are members of underrepresented groups in the scientific process.</AbstractNarration>
