<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;Teamwork predominates in engineering education, yet the careful design and assessment of methods for students to learn teamwork skills is not widespread. Teaching teaming skills is a complex challenge, one for which most engineering faculty have not been prepared. This project is building on a successful, web-based system for assigning and assessing teaming in engineering education, expanding this resource to additional institutions and increasing the capabilities of the tool. The goals of this project are to equip students to work on teams by providing them with training and feedback, to equip faculty to manage student teams by providing them with information and tools to facilitate best practices, and to equip researchers to understand teams by broadening the system's capabilities to collect additional types of data through a secure researcher interface. The use of the teaming tools in STEM disciplines outside of engineering is also being investigated through this project.</AbstractNarration>
