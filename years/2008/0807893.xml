<AbstractNarration>Lu&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807893&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The variational condition provides a unified mathematical&lt;br/&gt;model for a large number of equilibrium problems.  It is also&lt;br/&gt;closely related to other mathematical problems such as&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems and complementarity problems.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator and her colleagues study the mathematical structure&lt;br/&gt;of certain finite-dimensional variational conditions, develop&lt;br/&gt;solution algorithms, and apply these to handle model input&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty in practice.  Specifically, they investigate the&lt;br/&gt;influence of the major constraint qualifications on the structure&lt;br/&gt;of the variational condition, to identify conditions that&lt;br/&gt;indicate nice solution behavior and are more general than the&lt;br/&gt;current nondegeneracy condition.  Based on these conditions, they&lt;br/&gt;analyze the sensitivity and stability of a variational condition&lt;br/&gt;with respect to perturbations in both the function and the set in&lt;br/&gt;its formulation, provide criteria to identify classes of&lt;br/&gt;practical problems that satisfy these conditions, and design and&lt;br/&gt;justify algorithms for solving these problems.  They also apply&lt;br/&gt;knowledge gained in this work to other areas dealing with model&lt;br/&gt;input uncertainty, such as robust programming and stochastic&lt;br/&gt;optimization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator studies a mathematical model called&lt;br/&gt;variational condition.  This is a general model that&lt;br/&gt;characterizes an equilibrium status.  For example, it can model&lt;br/&gt;an economic equilibrium that predicts commodity prices, sector&lt;br/&gt;activities, and consumer consumptions, or a force equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;that describes the geometry and dynamics of a mechanical&lt;br/&gt;structure, or a traffic flow equilibrium in a transportation or&lt;br/&gt;computer network.  Thus, this model provides a unified framework&lt;br/&gt;for a very large number of equilibrium problems from areas&lt;br/&gt;including economic policy studies, structural engineering,&lt;br/&gt;transportation, computer networks, materials science, and other&lt;br/&gt;areas.  It is also closely related to some other important&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems, such as optimization problems; it can be&lt;br/&gt;regarded as a generalization of optimization problems.  In this&lt;br/&gt;project, the investigator and her colleagues seek to develop&lt;br/&gt;better insight into the mathematical structure of this problem,&lt;br/&gt;and to exploit this insight to produce better computational&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and the means for justifying them.  They investigate&lt;br/&gt;what the solutions of this problem look like, how they change&lt;br/&gt;corresponding to changes in the model input, how to find a&lt;br/&gt;solution quickly and robustly, and how to identify practical&lt;br/&gt;problems that are easy to solve and have robust behavior. &lt;br/&gt;Success in the work helps to better understand, analyze and solve&lt;br/&gt;the broad class of equilibrium problems.</AbstractNarration>
