<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award.  &lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education with aim to develop a kinetic theory of fluctuating superconductivity in disordered, granular and hybrid systems.  This work is motivated by experiments on a variety of systems including: quasi one-dimensional superconducting nanowires, disordered two-dimensional films, granular arrays, hybrid metal-superconductor nanostructures, and ultracold fermionic atoms in optical traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key element of this theory is the interplay between strong fluctuations of the order parameter and nonequilibrium dynamics of electronic degrees of freedom. The developed theory will be applied to a broad range of experimentally relevant observables, such as transport, thermal and magnetic properties, as well as shot noise, Coulomb drag and fluctuations. Advanced field-theoretical approaches to the kinetics of disordered, out-of-equilibrium systems will be employed and further developed during the course of work on the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports the education of two graduate students and possibly a post-doc.  Aspects of this work will be carried out in close collaboration with experiment. The research also involves international cooperation with researchers from Germany and Russia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award.  &lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education motivated by experiments on a variety of materials and systems that are close to exhibiting superconductivity.  Superconductivity is a state of matter characterized by the cooperative behavior of electrons choreographed by quantum mechanics. One signature of the superconducting state is that it can carry electric current without loss. Near the onset of the superconducting state, the fleeting appearance of microscopic precursors of superconductivity lead to new phenomena and can alter the properties of a material or system. The PI aims to develop a theory can predict the consequences of being in close proximity to superconductivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports the education of two graduate students and possibly a post-doc.  Aspects of this work will be carried out in close collaboration with experiment. The research also involves international cooperation with researchers from Germany and Russia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
