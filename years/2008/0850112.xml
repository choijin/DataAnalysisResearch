<AbstractNarration>The Paschal-Science, Technology, and Mathematics (P-STM) Scholarship program improves the recruitment and retention of talented female students in the STEM fields by providing scholarships to four cohorts of at least 8 women who demonstrate both academic talent and financial need.  The P-STM project is building upon both the current CSEMS Paschal scholarship program and the college's current STEM recruiting efforts, providing approximately 96 scholarships over four years for 32 students to pursue degrees in one of the STEM disciplines. The intellectual merit is in (a) establishing Just-In-Time Mentoring activities, (b) establishing Math and Science Cafes, and (c) enhancing student awareness of STEM career options. The broader impact of the program is that, as a women's college, Meredith is uniquely situated for recruiting women into STEM fields as it is located near the Research Triangle Park and it offers many STEM activities for middle and high school girls on campus. The college's strong commitment to professional development for K-12 teachers contributes to P-STM scholars becoming mathematics and science teachers in elementary and secondary schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To address the national need to prepare more women for careers in STEM and to meet an institutional need to improve the recruitment and retention of talented female students in these fields, Meredith College launched the Paschal Scholarship program.  This program provided scholarship funding for academically qualified students with financial need interested in majoring in STEM fields.  The college created learning communities for our cohorts that enhanced student awareness of STEM career options and placed students in mathematics, science and IT fields upon graduation. As part of their learning communities, we established Just-In-Time Mentoring activities and Math and Science Cafes. Students in this program were designated Paschal Scholars.  The Just-In-Time Mentoring activities were intended to mentor and advise the students based on where they were in their college development.  Mentoring began with freshmen students and with the Principal Investigator being both their freshmen academic advisor and their FYE (First Year Experience) instructor for a one-hour course.  Each fall all of the students were connected with professional women working in industry, with classroom teachers or with students in graduate school during an informal meeting over dinner.  This informal meeting, typically with Meredith College alums, created a comfortable networking event and over time, prepared scholars for future careers.  Finally, the Math and Science Cafes were also an important part of the Paschal Program as they showed diverse career paths for our STEM majors and inspired our students to continue to pursue their chosen major.  From one of the scholars:  "I loved the mentor program! I really hope we keep this. The Paschal Program is fabulous. I believe it is important to meet other women in the school in the STEM fields, and this scholarship helps connect us. I also loved the FYE program because we got to meet and spend time with [the principal investigator] on a personal level. It is important to see professors outside of the traditional classroom."  At the conclusion of the grant, 64 women had been selected to participate with 78% of these students successfully graduating in a STEM field (55%) or on-track to complete their STEM degree (23%).  Scholars went into industry jobs, became public school teachers in mathematics and science or went on to graduate school.
