<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop and understand organocatalyzed reaction methodology that can lead to useful processes in organic synthesis. An effort to exploit the utility of novel phosphoric acid-catalyzed asymmetric reactions will be explored.  In this end, synthetic routes based on this technology could allow for the preparation of novel chiral heterocycles.  This chemistry will also be used as a 'chiral enabling technology,' translating the stereochemistry for subsequent transformations.  An effort will also be made to apply phosphoric acid-catalyzed aza-Friedel-Crafts chemistry to the preparation of natural products.  Mechanistic studies will be used to explain the observed enantioselectivity and to gain insight into the development of new reactions or to improve existing methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Jon C. Antilla of the Department of Chemistry at The University of South Florida.  Professor Antilla's research efforts center on the development of new organocatalytic reaction methods and their application to synthesis.  These synthetic methods could be used to prepare basic chiral synthons for the development of pharmaceuticals and for use in material science.  Professor Antilla will also pursue an educational initiative whereby under-privileged high school students from local High Schools will attend a six-week long chemistry laboratory enrichment course as part of the University of South Florida Upward Bound program. The exposure of an interactive laboratory experience in the chemical sciences should help in scientific literacy, college enrollment in the sciences, and also to acclimate the students to a college environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The new and exciting reaction methodology during this grant period are significant because such methods have the potential to be used in the preparation of biologically active natural products or pharmaceuticals. Our major new discovery was the new catalytic reactivity using Organocatalysts. This discovery is already paying dividends with new methods being found based upon this novel activation platform. The enantiocontrol (stereocontrol) element of or organic-based catalysts (Organocatalysts) is particularly important as this represents a difficult aspect of drug preparation technology. The use of sub-stoichiometric amounts of chiral material to control stereoisomer formation is cutting-edge technology for producing challenging drug stuffs. Non metal-based catalysts also have the added benefit of being potentially more environmentally benign and eco-friendly. Our scientific papers have been cited by many other researchers accross the United States, Europe, and Asia. The methods have spawned others to develop ideas based upon our catalysis. For example, one of our most cited papers was developed by a PhD student named Pankaj Jain, and his work in the allylation of aldehydes has resulted in discoveries published by computational chemists and experiementalists, and those synthesizing drugs.   Our work also has resulted in the training of PhD students and postdoctoral scholars that are already are making an impact in the United States in industry, governemnt, and academia.
