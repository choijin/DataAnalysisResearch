<AbstractNarration>This research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will yield new fundamental understanding of the surface chemistry of electroless metallization onto polymeric surfaces (EMPS). Despite widespread industrial use, the surface chemistry of EMPS remains poorly understood, so its application is largely confined to bulk-part fabrication. In particular, it is not known how chemical and physical parameters affect and may be used to control the nano-scale morphologies and properties of electrolessly plated metal. The investigation will enable EMPS to be developed beyond its current status of "dark art" into a precise enabling process for emerging micro and nano-scale technologies with quantitative predictability and control. In addition to these intellectual merits, the project is focuses on a single EMPS system the deposition of silver onto the cross-linked epoxide "SU8" and involves an integrated program of preparative chemistry, nano-scale surface analysis, and simulation. This approach will allow the team to generate deep fundamental understanding of silver EMPS, yet the understanding gained will apply broadly to other electroless metallization systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The project will broadly impact science, engineering, and education by contributing significantly to our quantitative understanding of fundamental surface chemical and dynamical processes. This knowledge will elevate EMPS to a widely applied, enabling process for myriad emerging and high-impact technologies, including micro and nano-scale device fabrication, heterogeneous catalysis, sensing, and even diagnostic and clinical medicine. The project provides an outstanding context for interdisciplinary research training, teaching, and outreach. Young scientists will develop a unique set of skills, ready to increase the competitiveness of the United States in chemistry, surface science, materials science, and nanotechnology. The program directly supports the growth of a new chemistry PhD program at UCF. The PIs have built diverse groups that actively involve graduates and undergraduates from varied backgrounds, including historically underrepresented groups. These students will bring their excitement for science directly to Central Florida schools through a newly established peer-to-peer outreach program that will help attract middle school and community college students to science and engineering careers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A team of scientists at the University of Central Florida (UCF) has studied the chemistry of Electroless Metallization onto Polymeric Surfaces (EMPS) &ndash; a low-cost, industrially scalable method for depositing metal onto plastics &ndash; and identified parameters that can be used to control EMPS at nano-meter length scales.  Stephen M. Kuebler (PI; Chemistry, Optics, and Physics), Helge Heinrich (co-PI; Physics and AMPAC), Aniket Bhattacharya (co-PI; Physics), and their students obtained new fundamental understanding that could improve use of EMPS and extend its application for creating technologically useful materials and devices, such as conductive and reflective plastics, plastic micro-circuits, electrically and optically functional nano-scale machines, and metallized anti-microbial tools for surgery.  The research supported training of seven graduate students, three undergraduates, and two high school students.  The investigators integrated research with classroom teaching by showing their students how fundamental science they were learning is applied in EMPS.  The PIs and their students improved Central Floridians' understanding of science and technology through numerous educational outreach activities designed to support the science curricula of middle- and high school students in the area.  These were conducted in collaboration with the Orlando Section of the American Chemical Society, the Orlando Science Museum, Arbor Ridge Middle School, Jackson Middle School, Orlando County Public Schools, Maitland Farmers' Market, and the Orlando chapter of Caf&eacute; Scientifique, and Central Florida Earth Day.
