<AbstractNarration>Simulations of galactic events such as black hole and galaxy mergers &lt;br/&gt;allow scientists to understand the fundamental nature of the universe.  &lt;br/&gt;These simulations create terabytes of data, which are extremely difficult &lt;br/&gt;and time consuming to analyze using traditional mathematical tools and &lt;br/&gt;techniques. To address these challenges, scientists often use data &lt;br/&gt;visualization, which provides a powerful and effective approach to &lt;br/&gt;understand interactions and behavior of simulations such as visualizing &lt;br/&gt;the radiation of gravity waves during a supermassive black hole merger. &lt;br/&gt;Visualization systems require high performance file-systems for efficient &lt;br/&gt;data management.  Over the last three years, a collaborative effort &lt;br/&gt;between the Computer Science Department and the Center for Computational &lt;br/&gt;Relativity and Gravitation at Rochester Institute of Technology resulted &lt;br/&gt;in a visualization framework called Spiegel that has been used successfully &lt;br/&gt;to analyze and visualize the simulation of a variety of galactic events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site provides students with the opportunity, environment and support &lt;br/&gt;to conduct research in data visualization and high-performance file systems &lt;br/&gt;using Spiegel as the starting point. Working in a collaborative and &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary environment, students develop solutions to a broad set &lt;br/&gt;of research problems in performing computation on massive amounts of &lt;br/&gt;multi-dimensional data. Consequently, students gain knowledge in understanding, &lt;br/&gt;critiquing, and presenting research literature. This project offers students &lt;br/&gt;opportunities to work on state-of-the-art computing techniques that are &lt;br/&gt;increasingly vital for solving research problems in modern scientific &lt;br/&gt;disciplines. Undergraduate students are encouraged to pursue interdisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;graduate studies in STEM disciplines. With specific recruiting efforts that &lt;br/&gt;target underrepresented groups such as women, minorities, and persons with &lt;br/&gt;disabilities, especially deaf and hard-of-hearing students, this REU program &lt;br/&gt;also aims to increase the size and diversity of the scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
