<AbstractNarration>Cai&lt;br/&gt;0854411&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurately and effectively computing micro-scale gas flows with heat transfer effects such as for electronic cooling is a challenging task because of rarefication, electric and magnetic field effect. Numerical schemes currently available are limited by the continuum assumption, or they are not efficient. Recent work by the PI finds additional defects in some current numerical methods. Though the Finite Different Lattice Boltzmann Method (FDLBM) is very successful for highly compressible flows and some incompressible flows with the isothermal assumptions, the PI plans to extend it to rarefied micro-scale gas flows with heat transfer effects. The proposed research will develop a comprehensive 2D and 3D gaskinetic FDLBM scheme to simulate micro-scale gas flows. Immersed boundary conditions will be implemented; and asymptotic solutions for micro-Hartmann flow will serve as validation cases. Research results will have beneficial impacts on both industry and academia. Microflows, such as those inside vacuum packaged microchips, and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors, behave differently from ordinary continuum flows. Traditional computational fluid dynamics schemes cannot simulate these microflows accurately or efficiently.  To address the problem, this project aims to develop new state-of-art simulation schemes based on micro-scale physics.  The planned tasks will buld upon the PI's experience with asymptotic methods for rarefied flows. The developed FDLBM solutions will be compared to simulations from other methods. Educational efforts will include outreach presentations in senior high schools about MEMS. Undergraduate involvement will include development and maintenance of internet materials about these topics for teaching aids. Graduate students will include training at national labs and at New Mexico State University, a Hispanic-serving university. The PI will work with the Society of Hispanic Engineers and the Alliance for Minority Participation to identify students from underrepresented groups for participation.</AbstractNarration>
