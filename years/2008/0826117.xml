<AbstractNarration>In this project, a coupled chemistry-aerosol-cloud-radiation model for the production of water-soluble iron (DFe) in ambient particles will be developed and applied to the transport and deposition of DFe to different parts of the global oceans.  The main hypothesis is that atmospheric transport and transformation of mineral aerosols play an important role in mobilizing Fe from highly insoluble mineral phases to water-soluble forms that are available for biological uptake by phytoplankton.  The objectives of this study are to reduce uncertainties in assessments of DFe fluxes to the oceans associated with the mineralogical composition of dust, crustal and combustion sources of Fe, photochemical reductive dissolution of Fe oxides, cloud processing of aerosols, chemical cycling of Fe, and model grid resolution.  The GEOS-Chem (Goddard Earth Observing System-Chemistry) model will be used with a recently implemented dust iron mobilization mechanism.  The model will be used to provide (1) coarse grid simulations to estimate average fluxes of DFe to different parts of the global ocean; (2) nested grid simulations to characterize regional features of Fe dissolution and deposition of DFe in coastal regions; (3) sensitivity studies of dust mineralogical composition and dissolution mechanisms; and (4) an assessment of capabilities in modeling mineral aerosols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will lead to an improved understanding of processes responsible for the production of DFe in ambient particles and will facilitate the assessment of the role of dust in ocean productivity and the carbon cycle.  This research will support the education of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in atmospheric science.  Outreach projects organized by the Science House of North Carolina State University will be carried out with a goal of increasing student enthusiasm for science by partnering with K-12 teachers to promote hands-on inquiry-based science learning.</AbstractNarration>

It is involved in biochemical processes, such as photosynthesis, and is an essential, often limiting, nutrient for biological production in vast areas of the world&rsquo;s oceans. When dumped into the ocean, iron can spur growth of microscopic plant-like organisms called phytoplankton. After the plants die, small portions of carbon, absorbed in the form of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), may sink to the bottom of the ocean and could lie there for centuries. Burying carbon in the oceans would help the fight against climate change that is caused by a build-up of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. Therefore, it is suggested that the atmospheric supply of iron-bearing dust to oceanic regions may play a key role in regulating biological productivity, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, and possibly climate. However, iron in mineral dust particles is primarily in the form of iron-(oxyhydr)oxides and iron-substituted clays that are not bioavailable. One of the major uncertainties in modeling atmospheric inputs of iron to the oceans relates to mobilization of mineral iron in a form that can be taken up by marine phytoplankton. In this study, we have developed the first modeling approach that directly calculates inorganic and organic acid-promoted Fe dissolution processes, photochemical redox cycling between two different oxidized forms of iron, dissolution of different Fe-containing minerals (hematite, goethite and clays), and detailed mineralogy of wind-blown dust from the major arid and semi-arid continental regions. The implementation of this newly-developed iron-mobilization mechanism into a global 3-D chemistry transport model, GEOS-Chem, revealed complex and spatiotemporally variable pattern of dissolved iron deposition over the oceans. Our model-calculations suggest that mobilization of iron contained in mineral dust can be controlled by multiple distinct processes such as mass concentration, mineralogy, and surface area of dust particles, atmospheric chemical composition, cloud processing, relative humidity and temperature. This complex model also verified our initial hypothesis that human activities could be substantially impacting bioavailable iron deposition to ocean regions. As adding iron to the oceans is still considered a possible explanation for past climate variability and a conceivable geoengineering strategy for reducing atmospheric levels of CO<sub>2</sub> caused by the fossil fuel burning, our study suggests that future earth system models should include explicit model-representations of individual processes leading to bioavailable iron production within mineral dust.</p> <p>As part of the educational outreach, our group participated in a Space Day event organized by the Girl Scouts of North Caroline Coastal Pines.&nbsp; The topic of the event was how to use technology (particularly satellites) to help with environmental issues.
