<AbstractNarration>Rational connectedness, rational simple connectedness, etc., are algebro-geometric analogues of path connectedness, simple connectedness, etc.  Just as higher connectedness and higher homotopy groups play an important role in topological obstruction theory, so the algebro-geometric analogues should play an important role in algebro-geometric obstruction theory.  In particular, new ideas coming from A1-homotopy theory should resolve the weak approximation problem of Hassett and Tschinkel. There are 3 objectives of the research component. One objective is to develop an algebro-geometric theory of higher rational connectedness analogous to the theory of topological obstruction theory, and with applications to existence of rational sections of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic fibrations. A second objective is the classification of higher Fano manifolds, the study of their connection to higher rational connectedness, and the study of their complex differential geometry. The final objective is to study the parameter spaces for rational curves on Fano manifolds which do not satisfy the higher Fano conditions. This is relevant to the open problem of proving existence of non-unirational Fano manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quite frequently in science and engineering one wants to solve a system of polynomial equations in some set of variables, and depending on some set of parameters.  An optimal case is when there is a solution to the system of equations whose coordinates are themselves polynomials (or more often fractions of polynomials) in the parameters.  There are some sufficient conditions for this optimal solution which involve the geometry of the solution set for a general choice of the parameters.  The goal is to sharpen these results to give conditions which are both sufficient and necessary, i.e., to develop a theory of "obstructions" to the existence of rational solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of the proposal has 3 parts: a program aimed at training high school math teachers from the MA program directed by the PI so that they may establish and run math clubs and math circles in their schools, a seminar/summer workshop in mathematical exposition for graduate students and recent postdocs, and a northeastern regional algebraic geometry seminar fostering interactions between graduate students in different cities across the northeastern United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI studied systems of polynomial equations with the special property that any two solutions can be interpolated by the outputs of a rational function (fraction of polynomials) all of whose outputs are solutions of the system, "rationally connected systems".  If, further, the polynomial systems of interpolating rational functions are also rationally connected, then the original system is "rationally simply connected".  With his coauthors, the PI proved that for a rationally simply connected system defined over a global function field -- one step removed from tne number fields arising in number theory -- then there exists a solution of the polynomial system over that field if and only if an explicitly computable "elementary obstruction" equals zero.  This extends classical theorems of Brauer, Hasse, Noether and Harder, and opens the door to finding solutions of many new polynomial systems arising in mathematics and other areas.    The PI has written articles in this area, written a survey book chapter for a recent book on this topic, given a graduate course on this topic, given graduate mini-courses and research lectures on this topic at international conferences and summer schools, and co-organized summer schools and conferences on this topic.  Many of these lectures were recorded and are freely available for all students and researchers online.  The PI inaugurated a new twice-yearly Algebraic Geometry in the NorthEast Series of workshops (AGNES workshops) that have run for the past 6 years.  These regularly attract 150-200 participants, more than half of whom are students and junior mathematicians.  These workshops feature research and expository lectures on cutting-edge developments, but they also feature pre-lectures to help introduce the subject to junior participants, thjey feature professional development events, poster sessions for students, and, newly-introduced, graduate mini-courses preceding the workshop.  The lectures are recorded and are freely available online.
