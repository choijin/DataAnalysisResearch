<AbstractNarration>In this project, research in the algorithm design and analysis&lt;br/&gt;of high order numerical methods, including the finite difference&lt;br/&gt;and finite volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) &lt;br/&gt;schemes, discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods, and &lt;br/&gt;particle methods, for hyperbolic and other convection dominated &lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, especially in adaptive, multiscale &lt;br/&gt;and uncertain environments, will be carried out.  Parallel &lt;br/&gt;implementation and applications of these methods will also be &lt;br/&gt;addressed.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies &lt;br/&gt;in its comprehensive coverage of algorithm development, analysis,&lt;br/&gt;implementation and applications.  Problems in applications&lt;br/&gt;motivate the design of new algorithms or new features in&lt;br/&gt;existing algorithms; mathematics tools are used to analyze&lt;br/&gt;these algorithms to give guidelines for their applicability&lt;br/&gt;and limitations; practical considerations including parallel&lt;br/&gt;implementation issues are addressed to make the algorithms&lt;br/&gt;competitive in large scale calculations; and collaborations&lt;br/&gt;with engineers and other applied scientists enable the&lt;br/&gt;efficient application of these new algorithms or new features&lt;br/&gt;in existing algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims at the design of efficient algorithms,&lt;br/&gt;which, when used on today's powerful computers, will help to &lt;br/&gt;solve many problems from diversified applications such as&lt;br/&gt;aerodynamics and aeroacoustics for aircraft design, &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetism wave simulation for communications, &lt;br/&gt;and semiconductor device simulation for the computer industry.&lt;br/&gt;The thrust of this proposal is to use powerful mathematical&lt;br/&gt;tools to guide the design of algorithms, so that they are more&lt;br/&gt;efficient, more reliable, and more robust in applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involves research in algorithm design and analysis of high order accurate numerical methods for hyperbolic and other convection dominated partial differential equations, with applications in computational fluid dynamics, traffic flow problems, hierarchical size-structured population models in computational biology, and semiconductor device simulations.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in its comprehensive coverage of algorithm development, analysis, implementation and applications.  Problems in applications motivate the design of new algorithms or new features in existing algorithms; mathematics tools are used to analyze these algorithms to give guidelines for their applicability and limitations; practical considerations including parallel implementation issues are addressed to make the algorithms competitive in large scale calculations; and collaborations with engineers and other applied scientists enable the efficient application of these new algorithms or new features in existing algorithms.  The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity are demonstrated through a suite of powerful computational tools, suitable for various applications with involving convection dominated partial differential equations, in adaptive and multiscale environments.  These tools are expected to make positive contributions to computer simulations of the complicated solution structure in these applications.  The application areas include (but are not limited to) computational fluid dynamics, traffic flow problems, semiconductor device simulations, and computational biology.  During the four years of this project (three years of funded research and one year of no-cost extension), the PI, co-PI and two Ph.D. students have performed extensive research in algorithm design, analysis and applications for high order finite difference and finite volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods, and other high order methods, for solving hyperbolic and other convection dominated partial differential equations (PDEs) governing linear and nonlinear waves.  Over 50 journal papers have been published quoting partial support from this grant.  A few highlights of the major achievements include:  (1) We have developed a high order finite difference numerical boundary condition for solving hyperbolic conservation laws on a Cartesian mesh while the physical domain is complex with its boundary not aligned with the computational mesh.  We have been able to overcome the traditional "small cell" problem for such non-aligned boundary and hence can obtain stable and accurate numerical solutions with regular time steps, thus improving computational efficiency.  This technique is expected to help improving the applicability and efficiency of many finite difference algorithms in computational fluid dynamics and other applications.  (2) We have developed high order accurate "fast sweeping" methods based on both WENO and DG schemes for solving static  Eikonal equation and general Hamilton-Jacobi equations.  These methods allow efficient solutions of these equations, which are widely used in image processing, multiphase flows and other applications.   (3) We have developed semi-Lagrangian finite difference and DG schemes for  approximating conservative form of advection equations with general variable coefficients.  The main advantage of these methods is the allowance of very large time steps in the simulation without causing instability, thereby saving a lot of computational time in applications such as plasma physics.  (4) We have developed a general framework for designing positivity-preserving high order numerical methods for solving compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics.  These methods can maintain posivity of density and pressure while maintaining high order accuracy, even in the extreme cases such as near vacuum flows.  The technique can be generalized to othe...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
