<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Minimum Sobolev Norm Methods&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this research project is to design fast and accurate&lt;br/&gt;numerical algorithms for the solution of large classes of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;equations that arise in engineering and science. In particular, the&lt;br/&gt;main concerns are the solution of integro-differential equations on&lt;br/&gt;complex domains and of signal and image processing problems. The&lt;br/&gt;approach is based on formulating the estimate of the solution of the&lt;br/&gt;equation at a point as the value of the smoothest solution (on&lt;br/&gt;average) at that point based on the given data. The resulting discrete&lt;br/&gt;equations can be shown to have specially structured matrices, which&lt;br/&gt;can be exploited to create fast solvers for these equations. The&lt;br/&gt;resulting methods have two main computational advantages. First, they&lt;br/&gt;can be designed to avoid gridding or triangulation of the complex&lt;br/&gt;domain. Second, these methods exhibit local convergence; that is, the&lt;br/&gt;rate at which the approximant converges to the solution at a point&lt;br/&gt;depends only on the local smoothness of the solution. These advantages&lt;br/&gt;enable the method to tackle equations with complicated singularity&lt;br/&gt;structures with relative ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let Hs denote a Sobolev Hilbert space whose elements have s &gt; 1&lt;br/&gt;fractional derivatives. Suppose an unknown function f in Hs satisfies&lt;br/&gt;the equation L(F) = g, where L is a linear operator and g is a known&lt;br/&gt;function. Let Ln denote n linear functionals on Hr. Let q denote a&lt;br/&gt;linear functional on Hs. Then the best minmax estimate for q(f) can be&lt;br/&gt;computed from the minimum Sobolev norm function p in Hs that satisfies&lt;br/&gt;the constraints Ln(L(p)) = Ln(g). This p can be computed very rapidly&lt;br/&gt;since the optimal p is given by a nice set of equations that has Fast&lt;br/&gt;Multipole Method (FMM) structure when written in the proper&lt;br/&gt;representation. Also, it is possible to work with Lp Sobolev spaces&lt;br/&gt;with p = 1. In these cases the optimization problem is more&lt;br/&gt;complicated and can be reduced to linear programming problems, for&lt;br/&gt;which fast solvers are being developed that exploit the underlying FMM&lt;br/&gt;structure of the constraint matrix. The theoretical work consists of&lt;br/&gt;studying the convergence of the solution as n gets bigger, and also in&lt;br/&gt;proving the FMM structure of the resulting discrete equations. The&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic work consists of designing fast algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;constructing the FMM representation and then designing fast algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for the direct (non-iterative) solution of these equations. The&lt;br/&gt;application work consists of applying these ideas to image&lt;br/&gt;segmentation and multi-rate signal processing. Also, mesh free,&lt;br/&gt;locally convergent schemes are being developed for the solution of&lt;br/&gt;integral equations and elliptic partial differential equations on&lt;br/&gt;complex domains in two dimensions.</AbstractNarration>

In this work, we develop communication-avoiding versions of these algorithms that require orders of magnitude less communication. In both cases, we have to design the algorithms carefully so as to not create numerical instability while introducing new flows of numerical computation.  Randomized Algorithms A classical problem in matrix computations is the efficient and reliable approximation of a given matrix by a matrix of  much lower rank, with applications throughout wide areas of computational sciences and engineering.  This problem becomes especially important today, as huge data sets are routinely processed with low-rank approximation techniques. Among the different approaches in the literature for computing low- rank approximations, randomized algorithms have attracted much of researchersÆ recent attention due to their surprising reliability and computational efficiency in different application areas. Typically, such algorithms are shown to compute, with very high probability, low-rank approximations that are within a constant factor from optimal, and are known to perform even better in many practical situations. In this work [S1], we point out a close connection between randomized algorithms and the classical subspace iteration method in numerical linear algebra. Based on this connection, we provide strong new insight into both randomized algorithms and the subspace iteration method. This insight further allows us to develop a new class of condition number estimators that are far more reliable than any in existence.
