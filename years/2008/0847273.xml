<AbstractNarration>Proposal Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the development of catalyst-controlled asymmetric allylation and alkylation reactions. While many methods for enantioselective allylation and alkylation reactions exist, new methods are required for efficient and practical reactions of complex synthetic intermediates.  A central hypothesis is that nucleophilic allylmetal and alkylmetal complexes will be formed in situ by transmetallation mechanisms and these species will undergo ligand-controlled reactions with electrophiles. Preliminary studies have uncovered a new class of nucleophilic allylpalladium complexes with bidentate neutral N-heterocyclic carbene ligands, which have been used to develop catalytic allylation reactions of N-acylpyrroles and alkylidene malononitriles.  The development of stereoselective conjugate allylation reactions of broad scope with mild reaction conditions is planned.  In addition, new mechanisms for alkylation reactions of electrophiles by generating alkylmetal complexes from boronic acids with first row transition metals will be proposed.  Studies to elucidate the mechanisms of the transformation will also be performed.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Elizabeth Jarvo of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine.  Professor Jarvo's research efforts revolve around the development of selective methods for the formation of C-C bonds.  Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as the transformations will be practical and efficient, which will minimize the environmental cost of the transformation. Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview. Our long-term goal is to use mechanistic analysis to construct new reactions for stereoselective synthesis. We have established new mechanisms for stereoselective allylation reactions of ketones and imines, and enantioselective silver-catalyzed propargylation reactions of imines and ketones.  Such transformations provide the basis for new strategies for enantioselective synthesis of molecules with biological activity against a variety of diseases, as well as for applications in materials chemistry.  We have co-founded an outreach program that increases awareness of and participation in STEM research.  Local middle school students from less affluent areas participate in a Day at College including performing scientific experiments in my laboratory that connect their classwork and my research program.  In addition, standard outreach activities that address undergraduate and graduate students are described.  For example, NSF-REU students participate in and contribute to our research efforts.  Highly successful mentoring and career-development workshops that target women and minority graduate students have also been incorporated.  Broader Impact.  The broader impacts of the research are significant for several reasons. The new methods we have developed will enable synthesis of complex biologically active molecules  Our improved understanding of the mechanisms of organopalladium and organosilver reactions will serve as the foundation for future development of new catalytic reactions. The silver catalysts we employ are readily available, reducing our dependence on precious metals and increasing sustainability.  Graduate students have trained in organic and organometallic laboratory techniques and in mechanistic investigation.  As part of the outreach plan, my research program in organic synthesis has been integrated with science classes for middle school students.  Graduate and undergraduate students have learned effective mentoring skills and how to communicate their results to a broad audience.  Undergraduate students have been encouraged to pursue careers in K-12 math and science teaching.  Middle school students have learned about challenging and rewarding opportunities in chemistry, and by partnering with local schools we will broaden participation of underrepresented groups.
