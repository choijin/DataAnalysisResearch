<AbstractNarration>The flow of heat from the interior of the Earth through the sea floor is of fundamental importance because it relates to or reflects a wide variety of Earth System processes. In spite of its increasing importance related to methane seeps, hydrothermal flow, gas hydrates (a potential alternative energy source), and other applications, there has been a gradual decline of U.S. heat flow measurement capability. Currently, there is no heat flow system available to the US research community. This project will establish and maintain a U.S. heat flow capability at modest cost, using existing equipment under the umbrella of the coring facility at Oregon State University. The broader impacts are clear; the proposed heat flow facility will save the U.S. heat flow capability, thereby enabling essential research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The second part of the project focuses on preparation of the outrigger probe and needle probe systems and was overseen by co-PI A. Fisher (UC Santa Cruz).  This capability is now operational and active.  The capability provides access to an initial set of accurate, robust, and relatively simple instrumentation to address scientifically important problems.  Many proposals have been written and funded to use the heat flow capability demonstrating an  interest and need by the scientific community.  This capability is also being used by the U.S. Geological Survey and has led to partnerships with industry.  We have conducted at sea training in the theory and practice of making and interpreting heat flow measurements for post-docs and graduate students.  Academic projects have included a thermal investigation of the Cascadia margin offshore Washington.  This data is critical to understanding the thermal regime and fluid flow associated with this margin that plays a role in influencing seismic processes.  Upcoming acadmic projects include a heat flow survey in the Panama Basin to better understand the evolution of oceanic crust and a heat flow survey across the Hikurangi margin, New Zealand, to investigate the thermal environment of slow-slip earthquakes observed there.
