<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology through innovative outreach. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Jessica L. Ware is "Understanding the evolution of sociality and symbiosis in the lower termites (Isoptera: Hodotermitidae): a molecular and morphological approach" The host institution for this research is the American Museum of Natural History and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. David Grimaldi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Termites (from the scientific classification order Isoptera) are unique social insects that are involved in a complex symbiosis with cellulose-digesting microorganisms residing in their hindguts. A thorough phylogenetic analysis of basal termite relationships is needed to understand the evolution of these isopteran features, social behavior and gut-symbiosis. This research is creating the first total-evidence phylogenetic hypothesis of Isoptera with a global sample of lower termite species and extant fossil data. Phylogenetic reconstructions are being recovered using both molecular and morphological data. Divergence estimation analyses, biogeographical analyses and ancestral-state reconstruction are being used to evaluate the ecological conditions under which these fascinating organisms evolved.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training objectives of this research include learning fossil morphology techniques and a systematics computer program used at AMNH. The broader impacts will shed light on the systematics of "lower" termites and evolution of complex symbiosis.  Broadening participation of under-represented groups will be encouraged through informal science education and radio broadcasts.</AbstractNarration>
