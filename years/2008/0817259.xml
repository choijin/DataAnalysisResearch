<AbstractNarration>Urban areas were once thought of as harsh, biologically sparse environments with little ecological value, but urban habitat fragments can support substantial wildlife populations.  The degree to which wildlife can move between these fragments (often city parks) is strongly influenced by the intervening urban environment.  This study will examine native small mammals (white-footed mice, short-tailed shrews, and meadow voles) in New York City (NYC) as models for the impacts of urbanization on the population connectivity and genetic structure of wildlife.  Novel genetic tools (computationally-intensive analyses of short, repeating DNA sequences with high mutation rates) will be used in combination with geographic datasets to determine I) how many evolutionarily-unique small mammal populations exist in NYC, II) how long they have been isolated (or exchanging migrants), and III) what types of urban land use facilitate or hinder the movement of small mammals and their genes between urban habitat fragments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By identifying the types and degree of urbanization that small mammals can withstand, this study will contribute to the sustainable management of urban landscapes.  This project has been designed to maximize the participation and training of undergraduates that previously had few opportunities to conduct ecological research. The Principal Investigator's home institution, Baruch College, is the most ethnically diverse institution of higher education in the country.  The student body reflects the diversity of NYC, and over 50% of Baruch students are the first in their family to attend college.</AbstractNarration>
