<AbstractNarration>It has long been recognized that the observable characteristics or traits of an organism (i.e. its phenotype) are determined by the interaction of genes and the environment. Phenotypic plasticity refers to the extent to which a given set of genes produces different phenotypes depending on the environment.  Yet, because this environmentally induced variation is not inherited, phenotypic plasticity has historically been considered unimportant in the evolutionary process.  Recent research and new technological advancements in the measurement of gene expression, suggest that phenotypic plasticity may actually be an important mechanism facilitating adaptive evolutionary change. The research proposed here will use populations of Trinidadian guppies known to be adapted to different environments as a model system.  Using a combination of field transplant and lab breeding experiments, the researcher will examine the short term and long term consequences of plastic changes in both the phenotype and gene expression. This study represents the first attempt to document the role of plasticity in the adaptive evolution.&lt;br/&gt; The researcher will integrate the work on phenotypic plasticity in guppies with an education and outreach plan.  This plan includes the development of more effective undergraduate teaching methods, increased participation in research by underrepresented groups, and professional development and training for K-12 educators.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Organisms are constantly responding to the environmental changes around them. In response to different environmental cues, genes are up-regulated or down-regulated, hormone levels increase or decrease, and a suite of other cellular, molecular, and physiological mechanisms respond plastically to changing environments. A long-standing and unresolved question is how the plasticity observed within an individual, influences evolutionary change across generations. The research supported by this grant addressed this general research question using Trinidadian guppies that occupy contrasting environments with and without predators. We measured how guppies plastically responded to the presence or absence of chemical cues from their most common fish predator during development by measuring patterns of gene expression, metabolism, color, swimming speed, body shape, growth rate, and a suite of other traits known to influence guppy survival and reproduction. We compared the direction of these plastic changes to observed evolutionary changes in nature after guppies were transplanted from a stream with predators, to streams lacking predators. To our surprise, we found that the traits that evolved most rapidly were those that exhibited plastic responses that were in the opposite direction of the evolutionary change.&nbsp; In other words, if the evolved response to a lack of predators is to grow more slowly, the plastic response is to grow more rapidly. These results reveal that when plastic changes are non-adaptive and shift the distribution of traits further away from their optimal values, natural selection acts more strongly on them and drives rapid evolution. &nbsp;In contrast, when plastic changes are adaptive and shift the distribution of traits closer to the new optimum, selection is weaker. These results have wide-ranging implications for how we approach evolutionary problems, such as the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, herbicide and pesticide resistance in agricultural pests, and the capacity of organisms to cope with environmental change more broadly. This research also led to the development of several educational outreach programs that used guppies in the classroom to teach K-12 students about the scientific method and biology.
