<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this research is to develop a new approach to realize simultaneous resonant excitations of vibrational states of precursor molecules and electronic states of reactive radicals to control and promote the deposition of crystalline carbon nitride (C3N4) thin films. The project objectives are to: 1) establish the basic science governing dual-resonance-excitation chemical vapor deposition (DRE-CVD) processes through coordinated experimental and theoretical investigations; 2) control the coating processes for optimization of stoichiometry in deposited films; 3) improve crystallization in deposited films; and 4) characterize coating materials to support process development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful implementation will have significant impact on scientific research of laser-controlled chemical processes by resonance excitation of precursor molecules and reactive radicals, as well as in the field of functional thin film deposition. This proposed approach provides the potential to realize surface coatings with controlled compositions, high energy-coupling efficiency, and low thermal impact on substrates. For applications, the proposed method is expected to provide a novel approach to material deposition on various substrates as functional coatings to enhance, improve, and optimize the substrate properties. The research activities will be integrated with educational purposes, including integrating new knowledge gained in the research in a nanotechnology course, training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduates including those from underrepresented groups, and seminars for K-12 students and teachers. Results will be disseminated to scientific, industrial, public and educational communities in ways including online publications, journal papers, annual K-12 seminars, an animation kit, and conference presentations. This project will ultimately benefit society through new and advanced electronic, biomedical, and mechanical applications and products. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
