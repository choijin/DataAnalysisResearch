<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award supports the work of the PI and his students within the Syracuse University Gravitational Wave Group to detect gravitational waves with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The research will target gravitational waves emitted by colliding black holes and neutron stars in the Enhanced LIGO detectors. This project will also use information from computer modeling of sources of gravitational waves to improve searches and maximize the astrophysical information that can be extracted from detections. The outreach component of this award will bring the excitement of the NSF's cutting edge research to the middle-school classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravitational waves and black holes are among the most dramatic predictions of Einstein's theory of general relativity. LIGO is an ambitious NSF-funded project to detect these waves and use them to explore the Universe. Detecting these waves will open a new window on the Universe and will allow us to study one of the fundamental forces of nature.  This award supports effort to build bridges between gravitational-wave astronomers, source modelers, and optical astronomers. These synergies will be essential to the success of LIGO and the field of gravitational-wave astronomy. The projects will also provide training for graduate and undergraduate student and drive development of the national cyberinfrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Gravitational waves are among the most remarkable predictions of EinsteinÆs theory of general relativity. These ripples in the curvature of spacetime carry information about the changing gravitational fields of distant objects. Almost a century after Einstein first predicted the existence of gravitational waves, scientists are on the brink of detecting them for the first time. Gravitational-wave astronomy will be a radically new tool for exploring the universe.   The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is an ambitious project to detect gravitational waves from astrophysical sources, including the inspiral, coalescence, and merger of compact objects. Compact binary coalescence provides a potentially transformative laboratory for fundamental physics and astrophysics. This award directly contributed to LIGOÆs effort to detect gravitational waves with both Initial and Advanced LIGO and to prepare to use gravitational waves as an astronomical tool to observe the Universe. The results obtained in this project will prepare the gravitational-wave physics community for the first detection of gravitational waves with Advanced LIGO. Analysis of data from Initial LIGO and Advanced LIGO's engineering runs has informed the development, implementation, and tuning of data-analysis pipelines for compact binary searches.      Gravitational-wave astrophysics offers exciting opportunities to inspire and educate students of all ages, strengthening both the diversity and competitiveness of American secondary and college students and improving the scientific literacy of the general public. Public talks were given on the results of LIGO's gravitational wave searches and on gravitational wave astronomy. Undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoc have been involved in all aspects of the work. In total, four undergraduate students, six graduate students, and two postdocs contributed to this project. Four of the five graduate students who worked on this project have recieved employment as postdoctoral scholars after graduation, the sixth went to an academic staff position. Two of the undergraduate students who worked on this project have gone on to graduate study for a Ph.D. in physics.  The work acomplished in the award helps to drive the development of scientific workflow management tools and high-throughput computing that have broad impact across the scientific community.
