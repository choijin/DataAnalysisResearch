<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) - Engineering Research Center (ERC) for Revolutionizing Metallic Biomaterials (RMB) worked to transform the current medical and surgical treatments by creating "smart" implants for craniofacial, dental, orthopedic, cardiovascular, thoracic and neural interventions. The ERC lead institution is North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NCAT) with core partner institutions, the University of Pittsburgh (UPitt) and the University of Cincinnati (UC), global research partner Hannover Medical School (MHH) and other global and national partners that include industry, innovators, and state and local government entrepreneurial networks.The ERC -RMB developed biodegradable metals with the premise that new kinds of implants can adapt to the human body and eventually dissolve when no longer needed, eliminating multiple surgeries and reduced health care costs. Magnesium based biodegradable systems offer significant therapeutic advantages over implants used today. Breakthrough activities included development, processing and testing of novel degradable alloy systems, new improved versions of existing clinical-use plates, screws and stents, innovative nanocoating technologies to yield special surface functionalities and methods to control implant corrosion, biocompatibility and improved bone growth. The ERC-RMB&rsquo;s intellectual merit impacted various materials processing/characterization (chemical, physical, mechanical), modeling and finally, biocompatibility testing.Additionally, the Mg based alloys are widely acknowledged to have enormous potential for lightweight structural applications, given their low density, high specific strength, good castability and better damping capacity. However, to actualize the widespread interest in Mg-alloys for light weighting applications, focused efforts are required to reach the strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance design end goals. In the recent years, the Center also impacted trailblazing pathways for developing the light weighting applications using data mining of the Mg knowledge and processes, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence/robot technologies for manufacturing.Additionally, supplemental awards such as the (a) Center-2-Center funding with SFI to investigate K wires with industries; (b) Veterans Supplement- Mg Alloys for Multiple Applications; (c) HBCU Supplement for the Enhancement of Ductility in Mg-alloys for Biomedical and Future Structural Applications through Innovative and Novel Processing; (d)&nbsp; HBCU Supplement for Remote Microscopy Station; and the (e) HBCU Supplement for High-throughput Mg Alloys Screening for Medical Devices, helped the ERC-RMB attain national and global recognitions.
