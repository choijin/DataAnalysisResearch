<AbstractNarration>Vivian F. Irish&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # IOS-0817744&lt;br/&gt;Dissecting gene regulatory networks controlling petal organogenesis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The formation of an organ depends on the coordination of a variety of cellular processes, including cell division, tissue organization, and patterning of the organ as a whole.   Plant organogenesis is not well understood, despite the importance of plants as sources of food, and increasingly, fuel.  This project focuses on analyzing the regulation of petal organogenesis in Arabidopsis as a model for understanding how other, more complex tissues and organs are generated.  Several complementary approaches will be taken to identify new genes involved in petal organogenesis.   These will include microarray-based approaches to identify genes required for the initial stages of petal organogenesis; genetic strategies to identify quantitative trait loci controlling petal shape and size; and molecular approaches to identify microRNA-dependent processes controlling petal organogenesis.  Genetic and molecular interactions between newly discovered and previously identified genes will define pathways essential for petal organogenesis.  These results will be used to develop a genome-level regulatory network that functions in controlling different steps in petal organogenesis.  In turn, characterizing the petal organogenesis network will be valuable in developing a systems level understanding of plant organogenesis, and the emergent properties of such a system. This interdisciplinary approach will provide a unique perspective as to how the spatial and temporal aspects of cell division, cell type differentiation, and the coordination of growth and development result in the formation of a particular organ type. Furthermore, this comprehensive characterization will also be important for generating new tools to understand and manipulate organogenesis in other, economically important plant species.  A component of this project is to provide a variety of training opportunities for a postdoctoral associate, a graduate student, and undergraduates that will foster critical analytical skills in the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the processes controlling flower development is key for developing methods to control plant productivity and crop yield.  This research project comprised a variety of studies to understand how floral organs, and in particular, petals, develop as a model for understanding organ formation in general.  Two pathways are necessary to specify normal organ growth: one specifies identity and the other drive organ-type specific growth.  Through this work, genes controlling each of these pathways have been characterized.  APETALA3 is a floral homeotic gene required for specifying petal identity, and it was shown that this gene acts in part through downregulating the expression of a number of genes required for photosynthesis and sugar metabolism. The role of the RBE gene in regulating petal-specific outgrowth was also investigated; this master regulatory gene acts predominantly through regulating a microRNA dependent pathway that in turn controls where the boundaries of organ primordia are established.  Thus RBE acts to control petal growth through delimiting the domain in which petal primordia arise. The continued characterization of these pathways is enabling researchers to have a better picture of the developmental steps necessary for building an individual organ.  This project has also been instrumental in training a number of young scientists, including two postdoctoral associates, one graduate student and one undergraduate, in scientific research.  Results from this research have been published in a variety of journal articles and reviews.       Last Modified: 09/01/2011       Submitted by: Vivian F Irish]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
