<AbstractNarration>Elliot M. Meyerowitz&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number 0846192&lt;br/&gt;Molecular Genetics of Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flowering plants grow from collections of stem cells called apical meristems.  When a seed germinates, there are two meristems-the root apical meristem from which the root grows, and the shoot apical meristem, which eventually gives rise to the entire above-ground part of the plant.  The Meyerowitz laboratory has developed a set of new live-imaging methods for studying cell divisions and gene expression in shoot apical meristems. What is proposed here is a series of studies, using these methods and plant genetics, to understand two aspects of plant stem cells.  The first is the ability of any plant tissue to give rise to a new shoot apical meristem.  This process will be followed in detail, leading to an understanding of how patterned growth originates in plant tissues.  The second set of studies will follow the effects and perception of the plant hormone cytokinin in growing shoot apical meristems, leading to better understanding of the role that this plant hormone plays in plant growth.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work include the education of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in plant developmental biology.  In addition, results and images from these studies will be used in teacher training programs, including the nationally recognized "Grounding in Botany" program, in which laboratory exercises using plants are developed by teachers for high school classrooms; and a program in which graduate students and postdoctoral scholars from Caltech spend up to six weeks at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, teaching high school and elementary science teachers in a summer teacher training program.  Finally, it should be noted that the results of the proposed studies will lead to practical abilities to control plant growth, which in turn will be a contribution to agriculture with impact on supplies of food and fuel, two of the great problems facing humanity</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Unlike most animal cells, plant cells can easily regenerate from small pieces of adult tissue in culture.  Little is known about the cellular origin of the regenerating tissues although it is widely believed that any living plant cell can divide to form new tissues.  Little also is known about the molecular mechanisms providing the cells with such remarkable abilities. Our project goal is to determine and characterize the cells that contribute to regeneration, and find clues to the molecular mechanisms driving plant regeneration.  In the commonly used Arabidopsis regeneration system, regeneration occurs through two steps &ndash; first, the formation of a mass of growing cells called callus from explants; then secondly, formation of new meristems giving rise to shoots, roots, or embryos that can grow to entire, fertile plants.  This formative process depends on plant hormones termed cytokinins.  Recent experiments have indicated the likelihood that a surprising new hypothesis is correct: that not all plant cells are capable of participating in the formation of callus, but that callus forms from only a limited set of adult stem cells, or from a limited group of cells that can be induced to differentiate into such stem cells.  We have done experiments to learn more about these cells, and the molecular events that occur when they form regenerating tissues.  First, we characterized in detail the newly discovered adult stem cell population, finding that in roots it is equivalent to what have been termed xylem pole pericycle cells, and in other organs that it seems to be the same cell type (not previously named) based on its expression of xylem pole pericycle cell genes.  Next, we have studied a situation where callus forms directly on plants in response to wounding, and appears to form from epidermal cells &ndash; an exception to our finding that callus derives from a pre-existing population of stem cells that surround vascular tissues.  Our preliminary results indicate that wounded epidermal cells begin to express genes that characterize xylem pole pericycle cells before they begin to form callus, indicating that there are some cells in plants that can convert into adult stem cells, after which they can form callus and regenerate.  We also have created new genetic strains of Arabidopsis plants in which immunological markers are expressed in the protein translation machinery of the adult stem cells, allowing the immunological isolation of messenger RNA from these cells.  Experiments to sequence these RNAs are beginning, and will give us a nearly complete list of expressed genes in the stem cell population.  Finally, in this part of the project, we have developed conditions for formation of embryos from newly generated root callus, and have done detailed microscopic imaging of the early steps in embryo formation, showing exactly the callus cell type that gives rise to new embryos. This work characterizes plant regeneration at a new level of microscopic and molecular detail, and requires changes to the textbook descriptions of the important plant regeneration process.  The second set of experiments was to investigate the role of the plant cytokinin hormones in shoot regeneration, by investigating the effects of cytokinins and their places of synthesis on the maintenance of gene expression in shoot meristems, the sources of regenerating shoots.  We have found that cytokinins are important in activating expression of one of the key genes that regulate cell division in shoot tips, the WUSCHEL gene, and have also shown that a class of mutations that cause shoot tip enlargement (the CLAVATA mutations) act in part by reducing cytokinin biosynthesis in the shoot epidermis.  We have also characterized in great detail the genes activated and repressed by cytokinins in growing shoot tips, and this characterization has given us a new appreciation of the gene regulatory feedbacks that control shoot growth and regeneration.
