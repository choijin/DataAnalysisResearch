<AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal for an I/UCRC for Net-Centric Software and Systems &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0855939 University of North Texas; Krishna Kavi &lt;br/&gt;0855944 University of Texas at Dallas; Farokh Bastani&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Net-Centrics Software and Systems (NCSS)" with a focus on rapid development of highly dependable systems for critical net-centric defense, civil infrastructure, commerce, and other application domains. The lead of the proposed Center will be University of North Texas (UNT)) with site location at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD).  Net-centricity is the key to enabling increased productivity, performance, agility, and dependability in several areas that can have significant positive impact on modern society.  The net-centric paradigm enables a rich pervasive computing environment, and enables applications to leverage a variety of relevant information, knowledge, services, and other capabilities in real-time to achieve breakthrough enhancements.  The proposed Center will develop capabilities to enable rapid high-assurance integrated modeling, analysis, design, implementation, verification and validation, deployment, and evolution of critical net-centric systems. The formation of the proposed Center will significantly enhance the existing research collaboration and greatly leverage the research capabilities of the participating institutions and industrial partners.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will encourage collaboration, and the research will expose students and faculty to state-of-the-art research projects of value to the industry.  Graduate and undergraduate students at the participating universities and engineers from the various industrial members will benefit from the I/UCRC infrastructure and industry-driven net-centric research and development projects.  By joining the diverse capabilities and expertise of the participating institutions and the real world experiences of innovative high tech companies, the proposed Center will revolutionize our national research competence.  As a leading technology innovator and a Center for technology commercialization, it will contribute to the economic growth of the nation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the establishment of the NSF Net-centric and Cloud Software and Systems (NCSS) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC).  The NSF NCSS I/UCRC is a leading research alliance for conducting significant research projects for both industrial and government customers with a special focus on promoting industry relevant research and workforce development in the emerging areas of network-centric and cloud computing based embedded systems. The center initially included the University of North Texas (lead) and the University of Texas at Dallas, with Southern Methodist University as an affiliated site.  The intellectual merit of the project lies in bringing together these academic institutions and industrial members of the center to conduct research in several critical aspects of emerging net-centric and cloud software and systems. This goal has been met and exceeded as demonstrated by the growth of the center with two new academic sites (Arizona State University and Missouri University of Science and Technology), more than 20 industrial members, over 50 publications and 4 IP disclosures on various research themes within the scope of the center research. More than 50 MS or PhD Dissertations and Theses have resulted from the research supported by the center. The center's academic institutions have collaborated on several other research projects, leveraging the existence of the center.  The research results have been very impressive for all the industrial members.  For example, one industrial member showcased one of the center projects at their annual national event to various internal divisions as well as their partners.  Also, based on the center research, another industrial member achieved significant savings for one of their products and estimated that 80% of the savings was attributable to the center research.  Another example is the selection of a pattern designed by the center by the international Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium (NCOIC) for evaluation as one of their standard net-centric design patterns.  The broader impact of the NSF NCSS I/UCRC is on the research needed for developing and deploying high quality and highly dependable software and systems for net-centric and cloud computing applications. This center has had significant broader impacts in this regard. Nearly 100 graduate and undergraduate students have participated in various projects during the past 5 years of the project. The industrial members of the center have recruited more than 25 of the graduates from the academic institutions. Several software tools, analysis data, and educational material resulting from the NSF NCSS I/UCRC research have been made available to interested researchers. The center has also actively worked with the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex Technology Business Council  (MTBC) in creating a new MTBC Special Interest Group (SIG) in the area of cloud computing and another SIG in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.  In 2012, the MTBC awarded the prestigious Tech Titan of the Future Award to the NSF NCSS I/UCRC in recognition of its innovative technology and educational activities in net-centric and cloud software and systems, especially as being outstanding in training future technologists and for technology commercialization in this area.
