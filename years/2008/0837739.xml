<AbstractNarration>The University of Massachusetts proposes an expansion of the Commonwealth Alliance for Information Technology Education (CAITE). CAITE ? an alliance of three campuses of the University of Massachusetts and six community colleges, that aims to increase participation and retention along the high-school-to-community-college-to-four-year-to-graduate-school pipeline. Much of the focus is on community colleges because of the central role they play in reaching out to underserved populations and in serving as a gateway to careers and further higher education. CAITE aims to make academic IT pathways attractive and nurturing, and to ensure that students -- particularly women and underrepresented minorities -- are adequately prepared to enter them. This extension brings in a fourth region and new regional partners. In addition, it strengthens and re-focuses the work of the existing CAITE Alliance, forging stronger direct ties to other BPC projects, modifying outreach and pathway strategies based on lessons learned from the original grant, and developing new interventions designed to increase participation and retention. The extension of CAITE will be data-driven, informed by best practices developed locally and nationally, and focused on replication and dissemination.</AbstractNarration>

CAITE is the only NSF BPC alliance to directly address community colleges, where many first-in-the-family college-goers and older and working students with families begin their college careers (44% of all undergraduates nationally are in community college).

CAITE supports novel and existing pathways towards degree completion: both traditional articulated programs and "transfer roadmaps" to facilitate student enrollment in IT degree programs; mentoring including supplemental peer-mentoring and facilitated study groups; professional development across the alliance with special focus on community college and high school faculty, advisors, and guidance counselors; and formal and informal middle and high school programs.  Outcomes related to Intellectual Merit:  Through our outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts, we are seeing more students enroll in community college IT programs and transfer into the four UMass campus computing bachelor's degree programs. CAITE's work to align 2-year and 4-year curricula and to recruit and support transfer students at UMass campuses is contributing to both growth and increasing diversity in enrollments. Where we have complete data, 5.14% of CAITE community college students enrolled in computing programs as a percentage of total enrollments vs. the 3.95% national average, and 2.19% of four-campus UMass students vs. the 1.18% national average. Enrollment in CAITE partner community college computing programs has grown by 92% (2007-11) and 78% (2007-10) in transfer programs.
