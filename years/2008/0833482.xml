<AbstractNarration>Kapiolani Community College, University of Hawaii, recognizing that our continued success is contingent upon building a formal and institutionalized ?STEM enterprise? and developing more engaged STEM faculty who can offer compelling courses as well as mentor students in undergraduate research, the College proposes to create the organizational, administrative and programmatic excellence and infrastructure needed to support such an enterprise. Our long-term goals, therefore, are to: 1) institutionalize, improve and sustain a formal STEM enterprise; and 2) increase the number of STEM faculty engaged in producing more Native Hawaiian and other STEM degree completers. This I3 project will integrate faculty innovation within a formal, sustained, always improving STEM Program tied closely to the strategic and long range directions of the College.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the I-Cubed grant at Kapiolani Community College were to (1) institutionalize, improve and sustain a formal STEM enterprise and to (2) increase the number of STEM faculty engaged in producing STEM degree completers from six to 26.

Faculty members were provided with professional development to incorporate undergraduate research into their teaching methodology, students were provided with funding to attend national undergraduate research conferences and competitions, materials were provided for the research projects, and students were supported with research stipends.  Undergraduate research was found to be a best practice for student success with a very high percentage of participants maintaining excellent academic standing and transferring to the four-year colleges at higher rates.  In addition, undergraduate researchers have earned awards at national conferences and competitions and have earned prestigious internships and scholarships.     The success of undergraduate research in the STEM program led to the realization that this initiative should be institutionalized in two ways.

This trip was followed up by a weeklong intensive boot camp to develop hallmarks of undergraduate research in several fields and develop a plan for implementing the initiative campus-wide.      The institutionalization of the STEM enterprise was measured using the Assessment of Institutional Mapping (AIM) survey, developed by the campus office of institutional effectiveness.  This tool showed an increase in the degree to which the STEM enterprise was institutionalized at the college.      The two goals of the grant, while appearing quite disparate, are actually very much connected. The second goal was to increase the number of engaged STEM faculty to 26. Without an increase in the number of engaged faculty members, the number of undergraduate research mentors would not have grown, thus limiting the research opportunities for students.  This goal was primarily accomplished through a weeklong summer institute held every May from 2009 through 201...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
