    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to develop a novel technique for high-resolution 3-dimensional surface topography measurement using a scanning electron microscope and explore its potential applications in nanocharacterization and nanofabrication. The approach will be to extend the concept of the traditional optical shadow moire technique to the electron domain to develop a so-called electron shadow moire technique. Gratings with various bar and space sizes will be designed and fabricated using MEMS technology. These gratings will be used to investigate the feasibility of the technique and determine the relationship between the grating parameters and the measurement resolution. A phase shifting technique that uses the Carre algorithm will be developed to improve the measurement resolution. A miniature computer-controlled sample holder and grating scanning device will be designed and built to implement the phase shifting technique. Software for processing electron shadow moire images and reconstructing 3-dimensional surface topography will also be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this technique will not only allow more useful information about the sample surface to be extracted from scanning electron microscope images for nanocharacterization, but also make true feedback control of nanofabrication possible in a dual-beam focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope system. It will be a new tool that scientists and engineers can use to aid their discoveries and innovations. This grant will provide research training to graduate and undergraduate students as well as high school students who are interested in gaining research experience. Special efforts will be made to recruit female and minority students for the project. Course materials and student projects for a graduate course will also be developed based on the results from the research activities.</AbstractNarration>
