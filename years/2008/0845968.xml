<AbstractNarration>The exponentially increasing demands for heterogenous services&lt;br/&gt;over Internet and wireless networks have imposed new urgency&lt;br/&gt;and great challenges for designing next-generation networks&lt;br/&gt;that achieve higher throughput, better resiliency to adversary&lt;br/&gt;attacks, and stronger security for sensitive information.&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a new network coding paradigm has emerged, which&lt;br/&gt;potentially achieves the above goals simultaneously in an&lt;br/&gt;optimal fashion. Nonetheless, to realize fully its promised&lt;br/&gt;benefits requires a clean-slate methodology of network code&lt;br/&gt;design that achieves optimal performance and maintains low&lt;br/&gt;complexity while reacting quickly to the ever changing network&lt;br/&gt;environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To that end, the investigators study coded feedback, which&lt;br/&gt;generalizes the conventional feedback mechanism that&lt;br/&gt;acknowledges non-coded traffic by incorporating the unique&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structure of network-coding. This research first&lt;br/&gt;explores the joint algebraic properties between coded forward&lt;br/&gt;and feedback packets, which are the basis for the subsequent&lt;br/&gt;development of new, efficient network protocols for next&lt;br/&gt;generation network codes. In particular, the investigators are&lt;br/&gt;interested in the roles of coded feedback that transform the&lt;br/&gt;non-coding network resource allocation algorithms to their&lt;br/&gt;coding-oriented counterparts. The rich information carried by&lt;br/&gt;coded feedback is then used to design protocols that offer&lt;br/&gt;enhanced global and local error protection and data security&lt;br/&gt;while self-adapting to network changes. The theoretic studies&lt;br/&gt;of this program follow closely practical considerations&lt;br/&gt;including the dynamic channel quality and the interference&lt;br/&gt;nature of wireless networks and the complexity of the resulting&lt;br/&gt;protocols. System-level implementation is used to verify and&lt;br/&gt;further refine the theoretic findings of this program. The&lt;br/&gt;coordinated approaches of coding theory, graph theory, and&lt;br/&gt;network optimizations provide valuable interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;training for students with Purdue University.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
