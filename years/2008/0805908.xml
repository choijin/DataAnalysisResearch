<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0805908&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Genevieve S. Walsh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two n-manifolds are commensurable if they have homeomorphic&lt;br/&gt;finite-sheeted covers.  This notion is particularly useful for&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds. For 3-manifolds which admit a geometry,&lt;br/&gt;commensurability respects this geometry. In light of the recent&lt;br/&gt;proof of geometrization for 3-manifolds, classification into&lt;br/&gt;commensurability classes is a refinement of the classification of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds by which geometry they admit. This applies to&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds which have been decomposed along 2-spheres and&lt;br/&gt;2-tori.  Questions concerning virtual properties of&lt;br/&gt;$3$-manifolds, such as if a 3-manifold is virtually Haken or&lt;br/&gt;virtually fibered, are also questions about its commensurability&lt;br/&gt;class.  Commensurability also respects certain number-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;properties of 3-manifolds.  A classification of hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds up to commensurability would be very useful for the&lt;br/&gt;field.  A first step towards understanding commensurability&lt;br/&gt;classes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds is understanding&lt;br/&gt;commensurability classes of hyperbolic knot complements.  The PI&lt;br/&gt;proposes to work on the conjecture that there are at most 3&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic knot complements in a given commensurability class,&lt;br/&gt;and to understand how these commensurabilities can&lt;br/&gt;occur. Commensurability is also a useful equivalence relation on&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic surfaces, with the definition that two hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;2-manifolds are commensurable if they have isometric&lt;br/&gt;finite-sheeted covers.  The PI proposes to further develop this&lt;br/&gt;theory, in particular to understand commensurability classes of&lt;br/&gt;surfaces with large symmetry groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds are spaces which locally look like a 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;ball.  In particular, our universe is a 3-manifold and we do not&lt;br/&gt;know which one it is.  A deeper understanding of&lt;br/&gt;commensurabilities amongst 3-manifolds would significantly refine&lt;br/&gt;geometrization for 3-manifolds.  Knot complements are a naturally&lt;br/&gt;occurring class of 3-manifolds, and thus good candidates for&lt;br/&gt;study.  2-manifolds, or surfaces, are spaces which locally look&lt;br/&gt;like a 2-dimensional disc. Hyperbolic surfaces are the most&lt;br/&gt;common type of surface and are used in an extremely wide variety&lt;br/&gt;of scientific contexts.  The study of symmetry and&lt;br/&gt;commensurability is very useful for these surfaces. The PI&lt;br/&gt;regularly speaks on her work to diverse audiences.  Any results&lt;br/&gt;from this research will be described in research seminars, posted&lt;br/&gt;on the arXiv, and broadly distributed.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
