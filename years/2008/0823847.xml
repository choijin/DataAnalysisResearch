    <AbstractNarration>EEC-0823847&lt;br/&gt;McNeill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRIGE awards maintain global competitiveness by increasing the diversity of ENG researchers, who are initiating research programs early in their careers. BRIGE awards further the broaden participation of engineering researchers by increasing the number of engineering graduates, by improving the representation of women and minorities in engineering, and by understanding how to improve recruitment and retention of engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BRIGE award will investigate fast-time-response, high-sensitivity measurements of aerosol particle composition, which are in demand for explosives detection, bioaerosol analysis, and laboratory and field studies of atmospheric aerosols. This project will develop Aerosol Concentrating Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (AC-CIMS), a technique for on-line, speciated measurements of aerosol organics at low total aerosol concentrations. The primary research goal is to design, develop, and characterize a novel concentrating inlet for submicron aerosols that samples isothermally, has a low cutpoint, and conforms to the operating requirements of CIMS. The inlet will be interfaced with a volatilization flow tube and a CIMS instrument. The performance of ACCIMS will be characterized using laboratory-generated and ambient aerosols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AC-CIMS will be suitable for any application requiring the detection of trace aerosol organics at low total aerosol loadings. Applications in atmospheric research include laboratory studies of secondary organic aerosol formation at low, realistic aerosol concentrations, as well as speciated, highly time-resolved field measurements of aerosol organics. The aerosol concentrating inlet design will be modular and general enough for use with any existing CIMS system or other analytical instruments with similar pressure requirements. In line with the goals of BRIGE, this project will set the stage for the McNeill group to conduct future research involving applications of the AC-CIMS technique under the purview of the NSF Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. The research team will consist of three generations of female chemical engineers. This project will encourage the junior members of the research team to pursue careers in chemical engineering after graduation by providing opportunities for them to participate in cutting-edge research under the supervision of a female mentor, publish their work in peer-reviewed publications, and attend and present their work at scientific conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BRIGE grant will broaden the participation of and increase opportunities for all engineers including those from groups underrepresented in the engineering disciplines. This BRIGE grant will also encourage the PI to become actively and competitively engaged in research as an independent investigator.</AbstractNarration>
