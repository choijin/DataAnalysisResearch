<AbstractNarration>?Innovations in Nanotechnology and Nanosciences? using a Knowledge, Applications, Research, and Technology (KART) Approach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will (i) provide engineering graduate students engaged in state-of-the-art nanotechnology related research to learn the articulation of complex scientific and engineering issues in a GK-12 classroom environment through direct immersive interaction with students and teachers (for example, via interactive modules based on science behind Harry Potter), (ii) provide GK-12 teachers with recent knowledge and innovative learning activities in nanotechnology that are subsequently shared with GK-12 students to enable a deep understanding of the fundamentals of physical sciences. Special features of the program include: (i) active hands-on learning activities using the KART approach for GK-12 students and teachers led by graduate fellows, (ii) summer research experiences for teachers through current NSF funded RET: ?Innovations in Nanotechnology?, and (iii) joint participation by teachers and graduate fellows in journal publications and conferences. Thus, the intellectual merit of the proposed program lies in its unique approach to inculcate, communication skills, alternate career paths, community citizenship, and visionary educator qualities among highly motivated and dedicated graduate fellows conducting research with internationally recognized faculty in nanotechnology and nanosciences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this program is that it will draw participants from a variety of schools across the Houston area with student bodies rich in diversity.  Graduate fellows and teachers will disseminate the results of their teaching modules through appropriate conferences and journals. This grant is anticipated to significantly enhance the diversity and number of future research and development-oriented technological leaders thus helping to fill our nation?s need to establish and maintain a diverse, technological workforce. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pradeep Sharma with the University of Houston has completed the NSF funded award  New, GK-12 Program at the University of Houston: Innovations in Nanotechnology and Nanosciences using a Knowledge, Applications, Research, and Technology (KART) Approach AWARD #084088.   The aim of the first goal of the project was to enhance the intellectual and entrepreneurial citizenship of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) graduate students who will learn to articulate complex ideas pertaining to science, engineering, and their state-of-the-art research in the nanosciences to a broad audience ranging from mature teachers to inquisitive K-12 students to specialized university faculty.  The second goal encompassed providing GK-12 teachers with current knowledge and innovative learning activities in nanotechnology that are subsequently shared with GK-12 students to enable a deep understanding of the fundamentals of physical sciences.   We achieved these goals over the last seven years, by supporting 26 GK-12 graduate student Fellows and 24 GK-12 Teachers. Fellows were paired with Teachers and brought innovative concepts from their graduate research into science, physics, chemistry, anatomy, physiology and biology classrooms throughout the school year.  The following paragraphs further illustrate how the goals of the project have been met.  FellowsÆ written communication skills were strengthened through the Knowledge, Applications, Research, and Technology (KART) approach.  The KART encompasses the active hands-on learning activities in the classrooms for GK-12 students and Teachers led by Graduate Fellows.  It is a virtual repository for teaching units to be shared as they are developed by the GK-12 Fellows.  These units are available to participating Teachers, their colleagues and the general public to ensure maximum dissemination of these teaching products. With the development of original Teaching Lessons, Activities and Units by the Fellows and Teachers, the project has populated the KART with over 140 instructional plans, thus reaching the third goal of the project.  Fellows also submitted their KART items for review and publication on TeachEngineering.org; their instructional materials are reaching an even broader audience.  Additionally, the intellectual merit of this program was its unique approach to inculcate, through immersive interaction with GK-12 teachers, communication skills, alternate career paths, community citizenship, and visionary educator qualities among highly motivated and dedicated Graduate Fellows conducting research with internationally recognized faculty in nanotechnology and nanosciences. Evidence pointing to the merit of the program can be found in the journal publications, conference presentations, and awards the Fellows and Teachers have accrued beyond the KART submissions as well as the career choices and career advancements that Fellows and Teachers have experienced.  Teachers evaluated their paired Fellows throughout their tenure in the classroom.  Consistent themes in these evaluations were the benefits to the Teacher by having the Fellow participating in the classroom and developing teaching materials.  Through that process, the Teachers learned how to incorporate cutting edge research into their curricula. The Fellows showed continued improvement in both oral and written presentation skills as the school year progressed.  As a supplement to the project through an NSF funded RET, Dr. Sharma developed a seminar which has been held during the summer research experience for teachers titled, "Innovations in Nanotechnology". This seminar ensured that participant teachers had the foundational knowledge of nanotechnology and exposure to recent advances in the field that they could then bring back to their classrooms.  International collaboration was an additional goal for the project with participants travelling to four different countries: Egypt, Italy, France and England.
