<AbstractNarration>Ensemble adds a computing pathway to the existing set of NSF STEM Digital Libraries (NSDL). The addition ensures that the NSDL pathways provide a more complete coverage of STEM areas. The computing pathway supports the full range of computing education communities, provides a base for the development of programs blending computing with other STEM areas, and produces digital library innovations that are propagated to other NSDL pathways. Since computing communities including computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, information science, information systems and information technology continue to rapidly evolve; the computing pathway greatly aids computing educators in those areas. The computing pathway also addresses diversity, the complex interactions across the computing communities, as well as meeting the future need for increasing the numbers of computer related graduates. Ensemble reaches across the full range of audiences for computing education from K-12 to graduate and professional education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ensemble creates a distributed portal providing access to the broad range of existing educational resources while preserving the collections and their associated curation processes. Ensemble encourages contribution, use, reuse, review and evaluation of educational materials at multiple levels of granularity. To accomplish the overall goals, the Ensemble team works directly with relevant professional societies and accreditation agencies to articulate inter-relationships among the computing communities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was part of the National Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education Digital Library (NSDL) program whose goals included: enabling the discovery, collaborative selection, organization, and effective usage of quality learning and teaching resources appropriate for educators and learners.  As a pathway project within NSDL, this project set out to meet the needs of the computing education community where we defined computing quite broadly to include the computing aspects of various disciplines including computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, and information systems, to name a few. To meet our goal of providing a distributed digital library over a broad range of existing and new collections of resources for computing education, we developed and continue to host the Ensemble site &ndash; a web-based digital library &ndash; that provides an integrated search capability over a broad range of resources from a variety of contributing collections.  Our collections include: algorithm visualization resources from the AlgoViz collection, curricular materials from The Beauty and Joy of Computing &ndash; an introductory computer science course developed at UC Berkeley, Nifty Assignments developed at Stanford, the educational materials from the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), a digital library curriculum developed at Va. Tech and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and many others.  The resources in the Ensemble site also participate in and thus extend the broader NSDL distributed portal.    To meet our goal of providing better access and interconnection among resources, the Ensemble site includes the terms and relationships from the Computing Ontology.  The system supports automatic suggestion of search terms from the computing ontology, based on the terms that the user types into the search box. To meet our goal of supporting computing education communities around emerging communities, the Ensemble site offers the ability to create a new community where each community has a home page, can contribute resources, can discuss things in a discussion forum, and have other useful resources such as a calendar.  Communities that are supported in Ensemble include: the Association of Computing Machinery Education Board, the Computer Science Curricula 2013 series of drafts leading to a new curricular guideline for computer science, and many others. The community-level access to Ensemble is supported by social navigation To meet our goal of contributing to the NSDL and other digital library communities, we have made some of our innovative software features available to the Drupal open source community and we have published papers describing our enhancements to digital library technology. We have integrated social software into the site by including the ability for users to provide comments and ratings for content, providing an extensive system of badges to reward users for their activity, and providing social navigation features where a user can see the popularity of resources in a search result &ndash; based on the number of other users who have clicked on each resource.  The intellectual merit of this program stems from the advanced features that were developed over the course of the project. Ensemble portal featured a number of innovative techniques for the organization, maintenance, and user access to digital libraries. These innovation were reported in a range of publications and can be applied well beyond Ensemble context.The broader impact of this project stems from the large number of communities that we have supported directly on the Ensemble site, the large number of resources that we make available through the Ensemble site through an integrated search facility, and the many contributors who have placed their resources in the Ensemble site.
