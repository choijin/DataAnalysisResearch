<AbstractNarration>Mobile robots are envisioned to play a significant role in a variety of application domains such as collaborative sensing of a target object or environment, assisting homeland security personnel in safe-guarding buildings and detecting intruders or harmful materials, assisting elderly and disabled individuals in daily-life activities, etc. However, several key challenges related to sensing and control algorithms, network protocols, mobility management, localization, and embedded hardware/software need to be addressed in order to realize the full potential of mobile robots. This project deals with the acquisition and development of an adaptive robotic testbed, consisting of four clusters of heterogeneous mobile robots, to support and expand a wide range of ongoing research and education activities in robotics, embedded sensor systems, wireless sensor networks, distributed computing systems, and power management. The testbed includes four Pioneer 3-DX robots, twenty iRobot Create robots, and several desktop and laptop computers to interact with and control the testbed. The robotic testbed brings together diverse faculty researchers and students to facilitate new advances in each of the above areas and enables the validation of research results that would not have been possible without this infrastructure. In addition to providing state-of-the-art equipment for graduate students to perform their experimental research, the developed infrastructure also provides a flexible and cost-effective testbed for use in undergraduate and graduate courses on robotics, embedded systems, distributed systems, etc. Finally, the testbed also serves as an effective vehicle to recruit high-school and minority students, providing excellent synergy with the highly successful high-school FIRST robotics competition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed project acquired and developed an adaptive robotic test bed, which consists of a networked of robots and cameras (and associated software), to support and expand a wide range of research projects, education and outreach activities in robotics, embedded sensor systems, wireless sensor networks, distributed computing systems, and power management and utilization.  Major outcomes and activities of the proposed project are:  A networked of mobile robots (Pioneer P3-DX and iRobot Creates) for sensing, multi-robot SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping), embedded-system experiments, studentsÆ projects and outreach activities.  Many student projects were related to SLAM, self-driving cars and mapping and reconstruction of the environment. The undergraduate students built a software system for large-scale computer vision. This system is called CAM2 (Continuous Analysis of Many CAMeras, https://cam2.ecn.purdue.edu/). Researchers can register as users. This project received the second prize in the Schurz Innovation Challenge in April 2014. CAM2 platform finds applications in search-and-rescue operations, homeland security, and traffic and crowd control. Characterization of energy management (hardware and software) in mobile devices such as smartphones.  This research covered a wide spectrum of activities including the energy characteristics of mobile apps and devices, and the power consumption of DSPs and other devices in smartphones which has been used to understand app energy drain on these two phones, and opportunities for energy optimizations.  The same principle can be applied to mobile robots that use cellular for data transmissions as well as laptops and tablets, and in the future, Internet of things. Opportunities to recruit REU and high-school students to engineering and computer science disciplines. This project has many outreach activities, encouraging middle- and high-school students to consider STEM careers. The project uses a variety of robots to perform different types of tasks, such as following balls, dance, lifting objects, etc.    Overall, the project was successful in producing several graduate students, sponsoring many REU and undergraduate student projects, and conducting many outreach activities to encourage middle- and high-school students to consider STEM careers.
