<AbstractNarration>This award by the Division of Chemistry supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte for the summers of 2009-2011.  The site director is Banita Brown who is assisted by Sherine Obare as co-PI.  Eight students will be recruited to conduct individual nanoscale science research projects or work as part of a research team centered on interdisciplinary nanoscale science research.  Targeted student participants will range from rising freshmen to rising juniors from the Greater Metropolitan Charlotte Area as well as from a broader region.  Nanoscale science research faculty from the Departments of Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Optical Science, or Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science will provide well defined projects related to the nanoscale science theme.  This project responds to the national need for developing a suitable nanoscale science workforce. In addition to the research activities, the REU students will participate in weekly workshops on various topics including research ethics for physical scientists and engineers, graduate school preparation, GRE test-taking strategies, and careers in nanoscale science, as well as attend and conduct mini-seminars related to recent developments in nanoscale science.  The summer will conclude with an Undergraduate Research Symposium event where the participants will deliver poster and oral presentations of their research results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UNC Charlotte NanoSURE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site provided interdisciplinary training in nanoscale science for a total of 35 undergraduate students during the period 2009 - 2012.  This project was designed to respond to the national need to advance nanoscale science research at the undergraduate level and contribute to the education and training of the nanotechnology workforce of the future.  Participants worked with faculty mentors from the Departments of Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Optical Science, and Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science on research projects that created opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations that are relevant to the field of nanoscale science.  The objectives of the program were to: 1) increase the participation and understanding of nanoscale science research by a diverse population of undergraduate students through hands-on research experiences; 2) give students exposure to various nanoscale science research methods and processes early in their college experience to direct their career paths into the nanotechnology workforce; 3) provide students with interdisciplinary research interactions that encourage communication across the disciplines and encourage their involvement on research teams; 4) provide students with workshops, seminars, and various social activities that will directly impact their academic development and encourage them to enroll in graduate programs in nanoscale science-related fields; and 5) provide opportunities for students to disseminate their research results by submitting a research paper in a peer-reviewed journal format appropriate for their discipline and participating in an annual Undergraduate Research Symposium. Activities include a 10-week undergraduate research experience, workshops and seminars, and various social/cultural activities.   Three categories of undergraduate student participants were targeted, rising freshmen (13/35 = 37%) rising sophomores (7/35 = 20%)  and rising juniors and seniors (15/35 = 43%).  This program was unique in that special emphasis was placed on recruiting undergraduate students who were early in their college experience in order to retain their interest in fields related to nanoscale science. Of the 13 rising freshmen participants, 11 (85%) are completing degrees in or have recently graduated from a field related to nanoscale science.  All of the rising sophomore participants (100%) have reported that they are retaining their majors in a nanoscale science-related field.  Of the 7 individuals who participated as rising sophomores, 6 have enrolled or plan to enroll in a graduate program (86 %).  Rising juniors and seniors were especially encouraged to pursue graduate studies.  Ten of these 14 participants (71%) have enrolled or plan to enroll in a graduate degree program.   A significant broader impact of the NanoSURE REU program has been the success in expanding the access to research opportunities to participants that traditionally lack such opportunities, with 31 out of 35 participants (89%) meeting at least one of the following categories: traditionally underrepresented minorities &ndash; African American or Hispanic (9/35 = 26%), rising freshman (14/35 = 40%), PUI or community college student (10/35 = 29%), and female (15/35 = 43%).
