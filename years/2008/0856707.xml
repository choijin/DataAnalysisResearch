<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: The objectives of this high-risk exploratory research are (1) To determine the role of external magnetic field during laser-induced self-organization on the nanostructure and magnetic anisotropy and (2) To develop a phenomenological model to understand the external field dependent effects. PIs will realize these goals through an integrated activity involving experiments of nanosecond laser-induced self-organization, measurement of nanoscale magnetism, and phenomenological modeling of magnetization in these nanoscopic systems. The control of nanoscale magnetic anisotropy, which prompts the magnetization to point in desired directions, can be viewed as a fundamental requirement towards realizing functional nanomagnetic materials. Thus far, magnetic anisotropy has been realized primarily through the manipulation of two contributions: (i) shape anisotropy, i.e. with large aspect ratio structures; and (ii) magnetocrystalline anisotropy via crystallographic orientation through epitaxy or textured growth. Recently, PIs have discovered that near-hemispherical polycrystalline single-domain nanomagnets created by fast laser-induced self-organization show stable and size-dependent magnetic anisotropy in various directions. This behavior was universally present in all magnetic materials investigated, including Co, Ni, Fe and an Fe-Co alloy. In this project, PIs aim to achieve a fundamental understanding of magnetic anisotropy and its control in nanoscale materials through the following activities: (i) Investigate the role of thermal and uniaxial strain, and hydrostatic pressure on magnetic anisotropy in fast laser self-organized nanoparticles. (ii) Investigate the role of external magnetic field on magnetic anisotropy, microstructure, and nucleation and growth. (iii) Develop a phenomenological model of nanoscale magnetism for fast laser self-organized nanostructures. The intellectual merit of this integrated experimental and theoretical activity will stem from the following features: (a) This will be the first definitive work exploring the coupling between fast laser self-organization, thermal strain, external magnetic field and nucleation and growth on nanoscale magnetic anisotropy. This will result in ?nanoparticle phase diagrams? that accurately describe this coupling and the resulting microstructure and magnetic anisotropy. (b) PIs anticipate the design and synthesis of novel magnetic materials that could impact areas of data storage, sensing and information processing. NON-TECHNICAL: The broader impact from this activity will be through commitments to broadening research and education experiences of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students. Specific impacts include: (a) The training of undergraduate and graduate students in a multidisciplinary area comprising materials science, laser-materials processing, condensed matter physics and magnetism. (b) The phenomenological model developed through this activity could permit researchers and innovators to undertake a design and discovery based program to synthesize new materials. (c) Active participation of university and high-school students (through the Pfizer/Solutia STARS program) will help train future scientists in the area of nanoscience, which is of core national interest, and thereby help the US continue its leadership in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

This work has also led to several new collaborations, including with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and a primarily undergraduate institution (Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville).      Two major research findings     1. Arrays of nanoparticles with  tailored magnet orientation  One of the principal objectives of this project was to find a cost-effective method for producing materials over large areas (several mm and cm) with controlled size as well as tailored direction of magnetization (the nanoparticles are like tiny magnets pointing in some specific direction).  Using the laser process we are able to rapidly create arrays of magnetic nanoparticles of near similar size over large areas, as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, by appropriate choice of the magnetic materials, for example Co versus FeCo alloy, we were able to make arrays in which  the magnetic field of each nanoparticle was oriented in the same direction, and this could be chosen to be either perpendicular to the surface, parallel to it, or at any other desired orientation.

In the future, we hope to be able to utilize this understanding to tailor magnetic materials that can replace some of the expensive rare-earth elements that are presently required in hard magnets. This is an area of national strategic interest as has been highlighted recently in the national news media.     2. New bimetallic nanomaterials   The field of plasmonics is very important because of several practical applications in the areas of disease detection via localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) or surface enhanced Raman (SERS) sensing, energy harvesting, and novel optical devices. One of the continuing goals of research in this field is to find materials that can perform as well or better than the pure ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
