<AbstractNarration>Like the finite element method, the finite volume method is a &lt;br/&gt;discretization technique for solving partial differential equations. Due to the local conservation property and other attractive properties such as robustness with unstructured meshes, the finite volume method is widely used in computational fluid dynamics. Unlike finite element methods, numerical analysis for the finite volume methods is very limited. Only handful of papers analyzing the finite volume approximation for the Navier-Stokes equations can be found. The goal of the proposed research is to establish a complete numerical analysis for a class of the finite volume methods to the Navier-Stokes equations, including establishing stability of the methods; deriving optimal priori error estimates, posteriori error estimates and superconvergence of the solutions; and proving convergence of adaptive procedures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational fluid dynamics covers wide range of problems from air flow around airplane to blood flow of human body. The mathematical foundations of any computational fluid dynamics problem are the Navier-Stokes equations.  The finite volume method is the classical numerical method for the problem used most often in commercial software and research codes. The objective of the project is to provide mathematical theory for the finite volume method.</AbstractNarration>

Due to the local conservation property and other attractive properties such as robustness with unstructured meshes, finite volume methods are widely used in computational fluid dynamics by many scientists and engineers. However, numerical analysis for finite volume methods is significantly behind comparing with its counter part finite element methods. The significance and urgency of providing a complete theoretical analysis for  the finite volume methods to the Navier-Stokes equations cannot be overstated.  The finding of this project can be highlighted as following.   A finite volume method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations is established. The unique solution of the method converges to the true solution.  A general framework for analyzing a class of finite volume methods  for the Stokes equations is established. Under this framework, optimal order of convergence  can be obtained in a natural and systematic way.   Mesh adaptive procedure has become an important tool for scientific and engineering problems. A computable a posteriori error estimator plays a crucial  role in an adaptive procedure. A posteriori error analysis for finite element methods and finite volume methods in solving the Stokes equations  are developed which can be applied to almost all the existing finite element methods and finite volume methods.   The finding of this project provides important mathematical foundation for using finite volume methods to solve the Stokes and the Navier-Stokes equations.
