<AbstractNarration>The two-year project involves academically disadvantaged students beginning their collegiate studies in technical programs through the Department of Academic Development. The project provides comprehensive preparedness for college level degree programs and for work in technical careers. The focus is on interdisciplinary, cooperative, project-based learning in order to improve the basic science, technology, engineering, mathematical, and communication skills of students. By adapting and implementing the Technology Gateway curriculum, developed by the South Carolina Advanced Technological Education (SCATE) Center of Excellence, students investigate various technical fields through hands-on, experiential learning in the context of several workplace problem-scenarios. The goal of this project is to prepare students for technical careers and develop life-long learning skills to advance themselves and also to benefit society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adapting and implementing this project-based education model in the Technical Career Lab increases student engagement, provides for hands-on learning, promotes teamwork and cooperation, and creates adaptive problem-solvers.  The recursive nature of the Technology Gateway curriculum allows for careful measurement of increased teaming skills, the ability to transfer knowledge to new contexts, and the application of academic concepts to real-life situations. The entire community is being impacted through the opportunity for training in this educational model by SCATE and the interdisciplinary project team. Given the target student population, the project is preparing this ethnically, culturally, and economically diverse community to be more successful in the technical workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
