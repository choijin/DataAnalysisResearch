<AbstractNarration>Climate change will alter key aspects of the environment for plants, such as temperature and water availability. Very little is known about how plants will contend with these changes, particularly species that are difficult to study, such as long-lived tropical trees. This project examines short-term physiological responses and the potential for long-term evolutionary changes in response to experimental manipulations of precipitation in populations of a tropical oak species that occur in different climates in Central America.  The project investigates the extent to which these populations are adapted to the climate they currently experience and their potential response to climates that are similar to those predicted for the future. New insights will be gained as to whether impacts of climate change at the seedling stage enhance or constrain adaptation at later life stages of the tree. In addition, the research will identify the physiological and genetic mechanisms that enhance or limit adaptation to altered climates in this tropical tree. The project fosters the education, mentoring, and training of undergraduates, doctoral students, and a postdoctoral associate in plant ecological physiology and quantitative genetics at the University of Minnesota and at the University of Zamorano (Honduras). This work offers unique training and mentoring opportunities for Latin American undergraduates and para-taxonomists in Honduras and Costa Rica. It will also develop a collaborative, interdisciplinary network between researchers at the University of Minnesota, Cornell University, the University of Zamorano in Honduras, the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste in Costa Rica, and the Center for Ecosystem Studies (CIEco-UNAM) in Mexico.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work is a small part of a larger project investigating the adaptability of tropical trees to changing precipitation.  The overall project has been extended for another year and will be generate an overall report at that time.  The subset of the project focused on here described water use in the widespread tropical tree species Quercus oleoides. This tree species persists from Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica in the south to Tamaulipas, Mexico in the north.  Over this range, precipitation varies in both total annual amount and in the length and intensity of the dry season.  At the two extremes of this variability, northern Costa Rica where precipitation levels are high and the dry season is short and central Honduras where precipitation is lower and there is a long, intense growing season, we examined where trees of different size classes (adult trees, saplings, resprouts, and seedlings) acquire water at the height of the dry season. To determine water sources used by particular plants, we used a technique taking advantage of the stable isotopic composition of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water. Because of evaporation and the timing of precipitation, water at progressively deeper depths in the soil has a unique isotopic value dependent upon depth.  By measuring the isotopic value of water held within plant stems, we are able to determine where in the soil profile the plant was obtaining water.  The results we obtained from each site showed distinct differences.  At both the dry site in Honduras and wet site in Costa Rica, adult trees accessed deep groundwater even during the driest time of the year.  However, smaller size class trees were only partially dependent on deep groundwater and used a significant amount of water from more shallow sources of water. The smallest trees were the most variable.  At the wettest site, resprouts (seedlings that come from the root system rather than a seed) were extremely rare and true seedlings were using water from recent precipitation.  In contrast, at the much drier site in Honduras true seedling were very rare and most of the small trees were resprouts from the root systems of adult trees.  From the isotopic values, these æseedlingsÆ receive water during the dry season from deep ground water implying that the water is being transferred from adult trees to resprouts. Physiology information was measured on all trees to determine the stress level as well during the dry season.  These data supported the water-source estimates in that trees that were thought to be accessing groundwater were not under drought stress and those accessing shallow water experienced significant stress from drought.  The results of this study show that, within a species, the strategy of production of new individuals can vary depending upon precipitation regime.  In the dry parts of this species range, vegetative production through resprouts is the dominant form of new tree production.
