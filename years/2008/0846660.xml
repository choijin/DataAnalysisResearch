<AbstractNarration>0846660&lt;br/&gt;Popescu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on extending the boundaries of quantitative phase imaging (QPI), which has the unique ability to quantify subtle changes in both structure and dynamics of cells and tissues without using contrast agents, to high-impact applications, including neuroscience, cancer imaging, and cell membrane biophysics. QPI technologies already developed by the PI include: 1) an interferometric microscopy technique, termed Jones Phase Microscopy (JPM), capable of extracting the spatially-resolved Jones polarization matrix associated with transparent and anisotropic samples, 2) a Fourier transform light scattering (FTLS) experimental approach that combines optical microscopy, holography and light scattering for studying inhomogeneous and dynamic media and 3) a phase contrast imaging technique referred to as phase contrast tomography (PCT) that can retrieve submicron thick sections from a 3D cell or tissue sample. Research activities and methods were described in four areas: 1) nanoscale cell membrane dynamics of red blood cells, 2) viscoelasticity of brain cells using FTLB, 3) imaging dynamic transport and cell-to-cell communication in live neurons, and 4) refractive index mapping of healthy and diseased tissue. The red blood cell studies include developing an analytic model to extract membrane rheology from fluctuation data in collaboration with Alex Levine, UCLA, and a study of out-of-non-equilibrium dynamics focused particularly on determining the effects of ATP mediated processes. The viscoelasticity of brain cells study, in collaboration with Martha Gillete, UIUC, will focus on differences between neuron and glial cells. The transport studies will focus on non-contact measurement of neuronal action potentials and the dynamic imaging of organelle traffic. The refractive index studies proposed extend preliminary work on cm wide blood smears to whole organ scale imaging. The measurements made will be extended to studies of refractive index changes during cancer progression in collaboration with Steve Boppart, UIUC. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Intellectual merit    Optical microscopy has been the most commonly used method of investigation in medicine and biology, and numerous related technologies have been developed during the 350 year long history. Biological samples such as live cells are transparent under visible light illumination and behave essentially as phase objects. Techniques such as phase contrast microscopy provide contrast of nearly invisible sample by transforming the phase information into the intensity distribution and thus reveal structural details of biological systems. However, the information obtained with these techniques about the optical path-length associated with the illuminating field is only qualitative, i.e. cannot be used to quantify refractive index or shape of cells and tissues.    During this CAREER project, our laboratory has advanced the field of quantitative phase imaging in both technology development and biomedical applications. Quantifying the optical phase shifts associated with cells and tissues provides a new, valuable dimension to optical microscopy. Quantitative phase imaging has been recognized as an emerging area of research, as it enables previously inaccessible biological applications: cell motility, cell growth, red blood cell topography and dynamics, molecular detection, cell cytoplasm flow, cardiomyocyte beating, neuron imaging, monitoring electric activity in nerves, cell and tissue refractometry, cell rheology and, more recently, tomographic cell imaging.     Broader impact    During this project, the PI wrote a book on quantitative phase imaging, edited another book on Nanobiophotonics, published 60 peer-reviewed articles, gave 80 invited talks, published 7 book chapters, contributed 80 conference publications, generated 26 news articles, disclosed 12 inventions, founded a company, Phi Optics, which now commercializes quantitative phase technology. The PI is committed to teaching: he completely revised a course on Optics Imaging (ECE 460, http://light.ece.illinois.edu/ECE460/) and developed a completely new course on Modern light microscopy (ECE 564, http://light.ece.illinois.edu/ECE564/). The material for these courses is open access. The PI founded and has been co-organizing the Biophotonics Summer School, which this May will hold its 5th edition (http://light.ece.illinois.edu/bss14/). The two-week school has been a great success, bringing together graduate students from many countries and backgrounds with an interest in Biophotonics, learning from experts from Illinois and the US. Finally, the PI has been serving as founding faculty mentor for iOptics, a student organization that works as an umbrella for the IEEE, OSA, and SPIE student chapters, bringing optics students together and organizing optics-related activities. In particular, the iOptics seminar series has been running for three years with an average audience of 35-40 students.
