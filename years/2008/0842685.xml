<AbstractNarration>Last Modified Date:  01/21/09  Last Modified By:  Adam P. Summers    &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Communities of animals that grow on surfaces in the sea originate and maintain themselves by the steady recruitment of minute larvae produced by animals. The larvae of sponges, clams, snails, worms, etc., swim in the sea for various periods of time and then must settle in the right places to survive, grow and reproduce. In this way, both desired marine animals, such as those important to marine farming (e.g., clams, oysters, shrimp and lobsters) and undesirable ones, such as those that make up the fouling communities on boats, piers, and power plant pipes (e.g., sponges, barnacles, mussels and tube worms) become established and are maintained. This research will focus on members of the fouling community and ask questions about how tiny larvae can recognize specific surface requirements and settle onto them in the kinds of very active water movement that characterize all marine habitats.</AbstractNarration>

To solve this mystery, we formed an interdisciplinary team of scientists from different fields, combining the expertise of biologists who understand how larvae develop and behave with the skill of fluid dynamicists in studying how water moves.       We investigated how larvae settle into an important type of habitat, the "biofouling community" that grows on docks in harbors around the world, on the hulls of ships (slowing ship speed and greatly increasing their fuel consumption and contribution greenhouse gases), and on the insides of pipes that draw water from the sea to cool power plants (clogging the pipes). As biofouling communities grow, the number of species increases and the topography of the community becomes more lumpy and complex.
