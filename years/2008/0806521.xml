<AbstractNarration>This project between the University of Alabama at Birmingham - Center for Nanoscale Materials and Biointegration (UAB-CNMB) and the Technical University of Lodz - Centre of Excellence NANODIAM (TUL-NANODIAM, Poland) addresses compositionally graded, and multiphase carbon-based materials fabricated in microwave (MW) at UAB, radio-frequency (RF) and combined RF+MW at TUL, plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (PACVD) processes, as well as the interdisciplinary training of globally engaged students and young scientists in physics and chemistry of materials, nanoscience, and biomedical engineering technology. The scientific goals of the project are to advance the fundamental knowledge of the phenomena associated with the nucleation and growth of nanostructured diamond (NCD)-based materials in MW, RF, and RF+MW PACVD processes, to develop new approaches to fabricate NCD structures with predetermined microstructure and surface morphologies, and to further improve the mechanical properties and physiochemical performance of NCD coatings on metals, in particular, on biomedical alloys, through the optimization of the surface morphology of the coatings, smart design of the substrate/coating interface, and directed surface functionalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This knowledge will help the advancement of nanostructured NCD materials and devices with potential innovative applications in biomedical and other fields. The project provides exciting opportunities for participating students and junior researchers (at least 3-4 every year from each side) to gain international research and cultural sensitivity experiences through short- and medium-term visits to conduct joint experiments and to use complementary instrumentation at the partner?s institution, and through the participation in international conferences and seminars. The international education component will be enhanced by a unique joint virtual learning resource within the topics of the proposed network program, which will combine two graduate courses of similar content currently taught at UAB (PH732 ?Growth and Characterization of Thin Films I?) and TUL (049L8 ?CVD and PVD Methods in Surface Engineering?). In addition, undergraduate students in the UAB Science and Technology Honors Program and the UAB REU-Site will be exposed to the international collaborative research environment through their participation in the network project activities and through the interaction with visiting TUL researchers and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE). &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This Materials World Network project was international research collaboration in the field of nanomaterials based on carbon. The collaboration involved researchers and students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and the Technical University of Lodz (TU-Lodz) in Poland.  Several carbon materials, like nanoscale diamond or carbon nanotubes, are of high interest and expected to improve the human health and quality of life because of unique combination of mechanical, chemical, and biological properties useful for such purposes. For biomedical applications, these  materials are expected to be used in complex biological environments. Thus, a concerted effort of the researchers in physics, chemistry, biology, materials engineering, and medicine is needed to create the optimal material for a particular application.  One way of making the nano-carbon materials, like nano-diamond, is the decomposition of carbon-containing gas in a process called Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD).  The collaborative research activities of this project were focused on the development of CVD processes for (1) nano-diamond coatings on biomedical alloys to improve the service life of medical implants, and (2) nano-diamond composite materials for a broader range of biomedical and environmental applications. The following results have been obtained:  Researchers in this network have designed nanodiamond-based coatings that have not only hardness close to natural diamond but also high adherence to the metal substrate and the resistance to fracture. Such coatings can significantly increase the service life of biomedical implants such as total hip and knee replacements, and can reduce associated health risks. The UABÆs industrial partner, Vista Engineering in Birmingham, Alabama, has initiated the testing of nanodiamond coating on titanium tempormandibular joint (TMJ) implants.  Researchers at in this network also made a new porous material composed of diamond/ceramic fibers. Such porous nanocomposite can increase efficiency and service life of electrochemical electrodes, sensors, catalysts, and membranes, where the combination of properties of diamond (chemically inert) and ceramics (thermally stable) in one structure can be the answer to many challenges in materials research.  This Materials World Network has provided international research and training travel opportunities for sixteen UAB participants including 3 junior faculty and postdoctoral researchers, 7 graduate students, and 6 undergraduate students with the major foreign partner at TU-Lodz and with other collaborators in Poland, France, and Czech Republic.
