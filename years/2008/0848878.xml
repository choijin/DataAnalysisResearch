<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues development of a major improvement in the cost-benefit equation of learning computer programming. The approach integrates a new programming paradigm particularly suited to real-time, high-interactivity applications, with advances in program liveness and visualization, and game-based learning of essential concepts and skills. The strategy is to draw learners onward and upward through continued creative empowerment, while also facilitating more direct engagement with the core intellectual content of computer programming. The research objectives of this Phase II project address: 1) continued language development, 2) creativity toolset development, 3) development of learning games, 4) a learning environment architecture with an underlying model of learning pathways, and 5) evaluation activities including measurement of learning outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this Phase II project will lead to products that will engage over half a million learners in mastering fundamental computational topics and bending them to creative purposes, thereby addressing the following major national priorities:&lt;br/&gt; - workforce preparation and technological fluency;&lt;br/&gt; - rebuilding computer science enrollment and retention at the college level;&lt;br/&gt; - alternative, hands-on pathways into algebra and mathematics for students who struggle with traditional instruction;&lt;br/&gt; - cultivating technology-based creativity among young people.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  An On-Ramp to Computational Fluency  Overview  This project has developed a learner-friendly, tool-rich programming environment with unprecedented ability to put learners in control of dynamic processes including robots, mathematical models, and games. The project has investigated several models for game-based learning of programming. Technology has been validated primarily through (i) piloting in conjunction with TertlÆs RobotMath prototype curriculum, and (ii) use of the environment by undergraduate interns to develop games and simulations. As a detailed usage case study, and as a first step toward application of the platform for mobile game development, the project developed a mobile game, Swamp Talk, utilizing the projectÆs technology architecture and featuring strong game customization features.  Intellectual Merit  The Tertl Environment advances the state of the art of novice and non-professional game programming through:  (i)             Further evolution of the structured concurrency programming paradigm, which makes it easier for the programmer to express how processes (such as the behaviors of game elements) should unfold and coordinate over time.  (ii)           A novel user interface for developing, controlling and monitoring computer programs.  (iii)          Integration of programming within an environment that incorporates visual tools, components, and presentation capabilities.  The system has performed well in practical piloting with learners and as an internal development tool.  Broader Impact  Discussions with potential partners for commercialization of the technology began during the award period, and are continuing.
