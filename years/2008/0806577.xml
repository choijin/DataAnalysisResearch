<AbstractNarration>In this collaborative effort, Drs Bruce Balick (University of Washington), Richard Henry (University of Oklahoma), and Karen Kwitter (Williams College) will complement extant studies of the least evolved and most extended stellar populations with observations of the metal-enriched gas ejected from early generations of stars in the Milky Way (the "Galaxy") and our nearest sibling neighbor galaxy, M31. The results will constrain and challenge extant models of how all galaxies evolved or merged into others. In addition, the means by which elements such as nitrogen and oxygen have been formed in dying stars will be determined by measuring the historical rates of their production. The data products will include databases of spectra and abundances of planetary nebulae (PNe) in all galactic environments, doubling the size of the present sample derived for of PNe near the Earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of galaxy formation must be read from the shape, dynamics, and chemistry of its oldest and least evolved "fossil" stars. These stars are found throughout the extended, largely undisturbed outer regions of all galaxies, large and small. The chemistry and kinematics of these stars help to constrain the models for the early assembly of galaxies, the role of ongoing assimilation of dwarf galaxies, the ejections of younger stars into the old thick disk and halo, the feedback of heavy elements from the nucleus, supernovae, and AGB mass loss, the influence of dark matter, and the rates and size scales of the formation of structure in the early and highly chaotic universe. As a part of this research, new methods for analyzing the data and measuring chemical abundances will be developed for faint nebulae. These will have application throughout extragalactic astronomy in such areas as element production rates in very early supernovae and the chemical properties of distant quasars. In addition, all of the activities that will take place as a part of this research program have been conceived with the goal of providing research opportunities for undergraduate students, especially those students from underrepresented groups. The students will be direct participants in analyzing the data and developing creative interpretive ideas that form the core motivation for practicing science and research, and for understanding its role in modern society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[FINAL PROJECT OUTCOME REPORT Richard C. Henry December 19, 2012     The Project Outcome Report (POR) submitted by Dr. Karen Kwitter of Williams College, one of the co-PIs on this project, provides an excellent background on the subject of planetary nebulae, and that information will not be repeated here. Instead, the reader is referred to that report for an introduction and overview of our projects, all of which I was directly involved in. This POR will serve as an addendum to Dr. KwitterÆs report, emphasizing a project in which I was particularly active but was not discussed in her report.     The Sulfur Anomaly: In the process of studying the abundances of numerous elements in a large planetary nebula (PN) sample located in the Milky Way disk, I spent a considerable amount of effort trying to understand a peculiarity about sulfur abundances in these objects, namely that they tend to have appreciably lower sulfur abundances (by a factor of 2 on average) relative to their oxygen abundances.     Figure 1 shows the sulfur abundance on the vertical axis and the oxygen abundance on the horizontal axis. The green filled circles demonstrate the existence of a very tight correlation between sulfur and oxygen abundances for a sample of H II regions and blue compact galaxies, objects whose abundances tell us the current elemental content of the interstellar medium of the galaxy in which they are located. The tight correlation is likely the result of the two elements being formed under similar conditions in similar locations (massive stars). The solid line is a fit to the green data points. Since PN abundances of S and O should also reflect the interstellar levels of these two elements, we should expect PNe to fall along this same track.     Our large sample of PNe in the Milky Way disk (blue circles) along with the 16 disk PNe in the disk of M31 which we studied in this project (red triangles) are also shown in the graph. Typical PN abundance uncertainties are indicated by the black cross.  But contrary to expectations, we see a large amount of scatter in the sulfur-oxygen plane with little or no correlation. There is also a strong tendency for sulfur abundances to fall below the expected levels for a given oxygen abundance. This large-scatter-low-abundance pattern is what we call the sulfur anomaly. The dashed lines pinpoint the SunÆs location.     In collaboration with Drs. Angela Speck (U. Missouri), Amanda Karakas (Mt. Stromlo Observatory), and Gary Ferland (U. Kentucky), I undertook a detailed study of the sulfur anomaly in an effort to find an explanation for it. We were able to eliminate hypotheses such as unusual production patterns of sulfur and oxygen by progenitor stars of PNe, depletion of sulfur from the gas phase due to the formation of sulfur-containing dust particles, and unexpected amounts of particular unobserved[1] ions of sulfur caused by an important atomic process called dielectronic recombination which is important in low density high temperature gasses such as PNe. In the end, we found no "silver bullet," but instead concluded that the apparent lack of sulfur in PNe is due to a significant amount of it being hidden in ionization stages such as S+4 which are currently unobservable. A solution to the problem will have to wait until observations of highly ionized species of sulfur become feasible.     In terms of the broader impact of this study, the solution to this problem is related directly to our understanding of the natural history of the chemical elements as well as how stars, in this case massive ones heavier than 10 suns, manufacture elements such as sulfur and oxygen. This kind of information is crucial to our understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies and the Universe.       [1] Due to limitations of the instruments used to make the observations.
