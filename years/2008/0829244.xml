<AbstractNarration>SUZZETTE F. CHOPIN  Texas A&amp;M University, Corpus Christi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Suzzette Chopin is a professor of biomedical sciences, director of the Office of Special Programs and the Office of Research Development and a Texas A&amp;M System Regents Professor at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC). Dr. Chopin has been instrumental in the transition of TAMUCC from a two year institution toward Research I status with an increased emphasis on faculty research. She has demonstrated extraordinary mentoring of students and faculty at TAMUCC, a Hispanic Serving Institution. Her mentoring activities have impacted hundreds of students and dozens of faculty members. Her leadership has been a major driver in changing the TAMUCC culture to one that embraces and promotes undergraduate research, mentoring, and outreach to foster diversity in science and provide students with opportunities that would not have existed without her passion, energy and skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Dr. Chopin has received seven awards for advising and mentoring students. Through her efforts, TAMUCC received the 2001 Role Model Institution Award from Minority Access Inc.; the 2003 Star Award from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board; and the 2004 Diversity Award from Sigma Xi. These awards recognized TAMUCC's success in fostering diversity in science. With a colleague, she recently devised a strategic plan to establish a Center for Undergraduate Excellence and Engagement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Chopin has personally mentored 45 undergraduates in research (69% minority), 89% of who have matriculated into graduate or professional schools or are currently employed in science careers. Her undergraduates have presented at numerous scientific meetings and have won nine awards. For seven years, she was research coordinator for 56 minority students involved in the TAMUCC LSAMP program; of the 50 students who have graduated. Her Research Experiences for Undergraduates program has had 62 participants (58% minority) in the last six years. Of the 48 students whose status is known, 33 (69%) have graduated and have either completed graduate or professional school or are still in graduate or professional school or are employed in science. Dr. Chopin has established additional programs that focus on mentoring underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students. Dr. Chopin has shared her work with others through publications and presentations on mentoring and undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>
