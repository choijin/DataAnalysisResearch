<AbstractNarration>PI: Ji-Young Lee&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: IOS-0818071&lt;br/&gt;Title: Gene regulatory networks in stem cells for root vascular tissues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The procambium/cambium is the stem cell population that controls the cell division and differentiation of plant vascular tissues, conduits of water and nutrients.  The extent of vascular cell division and differentiation from the procambium/cambium determines diverse growth forms of vascular plants, such as trees, shrubs, and herbs.  Considering these various growth forms are essential for plants to grow and reproduce in dynamic environmental conditions, a thorough understanding of genetic regulation operating in the stem cell population for vascular tissue formation is very important. Arabidopsis root is an ideal model system for studying gene regulatory networks in the procambium/cambium because of its feasibility of tracking cell types and extensive molecular information and tools.  Newly developed genome-wide cell type specific expression data and identification of an important vascular stem cell regulatory pathway regulated by two transcription factors, SHORT ROOT (SHR) and PHABULOSA (PHB), provide an excellent starting point for investigating the stem cell regulatory networks in root vascular tissue development. In this project, the downstream regulatory pathways and procambium functions led by SHR and PHB will be identified by employing systematic approaches that combine molecular genetics, genomics, and systems biology.  Investigation of the fundamental regulation for vascular tissue production, the main source of future renewable energy, will have a broad impact on other fields of science and industry, such as agriculture and bioenergy. The proposed research will integrate training post-doc, graduate students, and undergraduate students, together forming a team. The research topics will educate the next generation of scientists who can address interdisciplinary scientific problems with the most up-to-date knowledge and skills.  Results of the project, including the collection of the gene expression data, mutant lines, and cell type specific GFP lines, will be disseminated via scientific publications and a website (http://www.bti.cornell.edu/JiYoungLee.php). &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
