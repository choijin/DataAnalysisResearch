<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0805525&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  David Dumas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will explore complex projective&lt;br/&gt;structures on surfaces and their applications to Teichmuller&lt;br/&gt;theory, Kleinian groups, and hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  The space&lt;br/&gt;of all complex projective structures on a fixed surface is a&lt;br/&gt;contractible manifold which has two natural but very different&lt;br/&gt;coordinate systems: A classical analytic approach uses the&lt;br/&gt;Schwarzian derivative to identify the moduli space with a&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic vector bundle over Teichmuller space, while a more&lt;br/&gt;recent geometric approach builds each projective structure from&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic and Euclidean pieces in a process known as grafting.&lt;br/&gt;The major goals of this project are to understand the relation&lt;br/&gt;between these two coordinate systems (both theoretically and&lt;br/&gt;using computer experiments), and to use that understanding to&lt;br/&gt;study Teichmuller spaces and deformations of Kleinian groups.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also explore ways in which the techniques used to&lt;br/&gt;study complex projective structures could be adapted to other&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional geometric structures, such as real projective&lt;br/&gt;structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the shapes and configurations of geometric objects&lt;br/&gt;has applications to diverse areas of science and engineering,&lt;br/&gt;from understanding the folding of proteins or the formation of&lt;br/&gt;galaxies to programming autonomous robots that must navigate&lt;br/&gt;complex terrain.  In a mathematical abstraction of this type of&lt;br/&gt;problem, one studies the space of all possible shapes, or "moduli&lt;br/&gt;space", of a geometric object.  This project focuses on the&lt;br/&gt;moduli space of complex projective Riemann surfaces, a class of&lt;br/&gt;geometric objects that encode information about 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces (hyperbolic manifolds) in 2-dimensional form.  Through&lt;br/&gt;both theoretical study and computational experiments, the PI will&lt;br/&gt;develop new tools for analyzing these structures, enhance the&lt;br/&gt;connections between 2- and 3-dimensional geometry, and expand&lt;br/&gt;applications of these structures in related fields.  The project&lt;br/&gt;will also produce computer images of the moduli space, displaying&lt;br/&gt;its rich structure and complexity in a way that can be&lt;br/&gt;appreciated by scientists and non-scientists alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
