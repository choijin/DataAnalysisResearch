    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0604805&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jian Song&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns existence and regularity problems of the&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear Monge-Ampere type equations from geometry and physics.&lt;br/&gt;The problem of finding canonical metrics on a compact Kahler&lt;br/&gt;manifold has been the subject of intense study over the last few&lt;br/&gt;decades. In his solution to Calabi's conjecture, Yau proved the&lt;br/&gt;existence of a Kahler-Einstein metric on compact Kahler manifolds&lt;br/&gt;with vanishing or negative first Chern class. An alternative&lt;br/&gt;proof of Calabi's conjecture is given by Cao using the&lt;br/&gt;Kahler-Ricci flow. However, most projective algebraic varieties&lt;br/&gt;do not have definite or trivial first Chern classes. Recently&lt;br/&gt;Perelman has made major breakthrough in Hamilton's program as an&lt;br/&gt;approach to the Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization&lt;br/&gt;conjecture. The principal investigator proposes to study the&lt;br/&gt;canonical metrics on the canonical models of projective varieties&lt;br/&gt;of positive Kodaira dimension by applying the Kahler-Ricci&lt;br/&gt;flow. Such canonical metrics are constructed by the deformation&lt;br/&gt;of the Kaher-Ricci flow on minimal projective surfaces of&lt;br/&gt;positive Kodaira dimension. These generalized Kahler-Einstein&lt;br/&gt;metrics can be considered as an analytic version of the abundance&lt;br/&gt;conjecture in algebraic geometry and will also lead to new&lt;br/&gt;advances in the understanding and application of the Ricci&lt;br/&gt;flow. In Donaldson's far reaching program, the geometry of the&lt;br/&gt;infinite dimensional symmetric space of Kahler metrics in a fixed&lt;br/&gt;class is related to the existence and uniqueness of constant&lt;br/&gt;scalar curvature Kahler metrics. The principal investigator also&lt;br/&gt;intends to study the uniform approximation problem of the&lt;br/&gt;Monge-Ampere geodesics in infinite dimensional symmetric space by&lt;br/&gt;those in the finite dimensional Bergman spaces on toric&lt;br/&gt;varieties. The precise understanding of this problem will give&lt;br/&gt;new insight into the conjecture proposed by Yau between the&lt;br/&gt;relation of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics and certain&lt;br/&gt;stability in the sense of geometric invariant theory. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator will also apply the moment map point of&lt;br/&gt;view and study various geometric flows arising from Kahler&lt;br/&gt;geometry as well as symplectic geometry proposed by&lt;br/&gt;Donaldson. The first is the J-flow, which is the gradient flow of&lt;br/&gt;functional related to the Mabuchi energy. The second is a moment&lt;br/&gt;map flow in a hyperkahler four manifold. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator intends to study the question of convergence and&lt;br/&gt;singularities os such parabolic flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the discovery of the general relativity, geometric analysis&lt;br/&gt;has become crucial to both mathematicians and physicists.&lt;br/&gt;Problems in this proposal arise naturally from our attempts to&lt;br/&gt;understand nonlinear differential equations from geometry and&lt;br/&gt;physics. The solutions to these problems will contribute to&lt;br/&gt;various fields of sciences such as physics and cosmology in the&lt;br/&gt;deep understanding of our universe. The method of analyzing the&lt;br/&gt;singularities of nonlinear equations will have wide applications&lt;br/&gt;in engineering and economics.</AbstractNarration>
