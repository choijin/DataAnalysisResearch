<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR ) Phase II project aims to scale-up and commercialize a low cost and simple process to produce high strength/density Magnesium (Mg) alloy sheet; using Thixomolding Thermomechanical Processing (TTMP). TTMP avoids the decades-long barriers of twinning and shear band deformation that limits the formability of commercial coarse-grained Mg alloys, rather, in TTMP fine isotropic grains are molded in the first Thixomolding step and then these are thermomechanically processed to impose continuous dynamic recrystalization to finer grains of 0.8 to 2 microns. In this fine grained mode of processing, twinning and shear banding are minimized while slip and grain boundary sliding are promoted. The common intermetallic phases of Mg alloys are also refined to nanometer size so that they can serve as dispersion hardeners. The end result of the refined microstructures is an increase of both strength and ductility. The mechanism may apply also to  Titanium (Ti) and Beryllium (Be) alloys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this project are fuel and pollution&lt;br/&gt;savings in automobiles and trucks; fuel and payload benefits in aerospace; energy savings in batteries and fuel cells; and medical benefits in bio-replaceable body implants. Commercially, this project will result in a new U.S. business in manufacture of superior low cost Mg sheet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report   STTR Phase II: New Process for High Strength/Weight Net-Shape Auto and Aero components from Mg Sheet        Original Aims and Objectives   The use of magnesium (Mg) in the transportation industry has been receiving tremendous interest in the past few years. The growth in magnesium components is being driven by demands for reduced vehicle emissions and improved fuel efficiency. Magnesium is the lightest of the structural metals; magnesium alloys are 20 % lighter than polymer composites, 30 % lighter than aluminum alloys and 75% lighter than steels. Light weight vehicles are able to run on lower fuel levels which in turn aids in lowering the greenhouse gas emissions. Thixomat, in collaboration with the University of Michigan, discovered a new technology to produce improved magnesium sheet products with higher strength than the conventional processed magnesium alloys available on the market.  The scientific studies conducted were indeed very successful.  The new process has produced magnesium alloy sheet with double the strength of conventionally processed materials.  The process has been scaled up from the laboratory (1inch by 1 inch samples) to 6 inch and now 18 inch wide sheet on a pilot scale production facility. The technical breakthrough derives from controlling the crystal structure of the magnesium via patented processing methods (patents have been awarded to Thixomat in the US, China and the United Kingdom for this new process). By controlling the crystal structure, major improvements in the mechanical properties as well as the chemical properties of the materials have been achieved.  Shifting of the Market Focus  The original focus of the marketing activities was the automotive and aerospace industries. In this market space, you are competing with other structural materials (steel, aluminum, plastics and composites) in an aggressive environment that is driven by constant pressure by OEM suppliers to reduce their manufacturing costs. Thixomat has engaged several major OEMs on development projects in both automotive and aerospace applications but no commercial products have been introduced to date.  One of the keys to successful entrepreneurial endeavors is being flexible and having a keen awareness of new opportunities that present themselves that are quite often outside of the scope of the original goals and objectives.  While performing the Phase II work, Thixomat was approached by a major medical device manufacturer regarding the feasibility of producing a new class of materials for bioabsorbable medical implants manufactured from magnesium alloys.  In 2010, Thixomat was awarded a supplemental grant under the Technology Enhancement for Commercial Partnerships (TECP) program to conduct some initial feasibility testing on selected magnesium alloys identified as candidates for this entirely new market application.  The initial work sponsored under the TECP was encouraging enough to lead to additional small animal studies also sponsored under NSF funding.  Joining forces with the recently established Engineering Research Center for Revolutionizing Metallic Biomaterials (ERC-RMB) in Greensboro, NC whose research mission is to help speed the commercialization of metallic implants provided Thixomat access to external global experts in the areas of bioengineering, materials and orthopedic medicine. Leveraging these external resources with our team of experienced magnesium alloy developers places Thixomat in a very unique and superior position in the bioabsorbable implant manufacturing space.     The Future Looks Very Bright    Thixomat's newest product is a bioabsorbable magnesium based alloy, BioMg&reg; 250. By using an alloy of chemical elements that are found naturally in the body and a design that appropriately controls the rate of dissolution, the implant can supply the temporary structural reinforcement needed while avoiding all of the complications associated with current permanent metal allo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
