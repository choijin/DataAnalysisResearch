<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this project is to realize the fabrication of multiscale electric devices based on conducting nanowires and their characterization by using nanomanufacturing principles such as self-assembly, dielectrophoresis, and focused ion beam nanolithography. The objectives include the following tasks:&lt;br/&gt;(a) hierarchical integration of nanowires into multiscale electric devices, and&lt;br/&gt;(b) characterization of individual nanowires in terms of Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity.&lt;br/&gt;The self-assembly technique and dielectrophoresis will be combined to control individual nanowires and attract them into desired pairs of microelectrodes. Fountain pen-based metal nanoink soldering or electron-beam metal deposition techniques will be adapted to enhance the conductivity between metal electrodes and nanowires. Focused ion beam will be used to define a nanostructure such as nanoheater/nanothermometer for aiding the characterization of individual nanowires. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of the of the proposed work lies in the fact that the investigation of thermal and electric properties of nanowires will provide a fundamental database for thermoelectric devices, which in turn contributes to developing alternative energy sources. The proposed integration method will provide a practical means for nanomanufacturing massive and multiscale nanowire-based thermoelectric devices. The proposed work yields significant information on the Seebeck and Peltier coefficients of one-dimensional nanostructures. The research outcomes of nanomanufacturing and properties of nanomaterials investigated in the project will contribute to establishing a new research and education program in the recently established Mechanical and Energy Engineering Department at the University of North Texas. A systematic effort will be made to recruit minorities to this research project through the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science program. Talented undergraduate students with a high degree of financial need in this program are ensured of success as they are engaged in the various research experiences proposed herein. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
