<AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Health Organization Transformation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0832439 Texas A&amp;M University System (lead institution); Larry Gamm &lt;br/&gt;0832390 Georgia Institute of Technology; Eva Lee &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;Texas A &amp;M Health Science Center and Georgia Tech propose a center "Center for Health Organization Transformation"(CHOT)to conduct mixed methodology, applied research on the antecedents, execution, and effects of transformational interventions and strategies that combine evidence-based management, clinical and information technology innovations, and ongoing organizational learning and cultural change. The proposed work can result in improved health care quality and more effective use of financial and system resources in the delivery of health care. The research is designed to produce transformation in a critical industry, and the proposed team makes a credible case that the scope of the problem indicates a need for whole-system, transformative change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the health care sector is a significant segment of the US economy, enabling more effective use of resources within this sector could positively impact the economy. More specifically, the proposed research will benefit quality of patient care, operations efficiency of the healthcare delivery systems, and workforce transformation. These successes will be propagateda cross the practicing health systems in the nation through the center's industrial partners as well as the center directors and investigators.Research teams for the proposed center are made up of a diverse set of research faculty and graduate students,working closely with health system leaders. The center activities will support improvements in both masters' and doctoral level education and research.  Broader dissemination will occur via professional and academic associations and conferences,and other mechanisms.  Both schools are committed to inclusion of a diverse faculty and student body.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC), the Center for Health Organization Transformation (CHOT) is pioneering innovations within healthcare through evidence-based research to support major initiatives in healthcare industry management and in clinical/information technology settings.  Since 2009, CHOT has conducted over 100 research projects which benefitted industry-focused research across more than 50 disciplines.  From the research, CHOT researchers have written over 80 peer-reviewed publications and presented their research at more than 20 national and international conferences.    Our mission is to advance the knowledge and practice of transformational strategies in evidence-based management and clinical practice and our vision is to be a nationally and internationally recognized leader in advancing research and education on healthcare transformation through a network of university partners working collaboratively with health systems and other health-related industries.  Our current industry members include: Alabama Quality Assurance Foundation, Alacare, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Grady Health System, HealthSouth, Highmark, Main Line Health, Morehouse School of Medicine, Northside Anesthesiology Consultants, LLC, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, Partners HealthCare, Restore Medical Solutions, Siemens, Studer Group, LLC, Texas Children's Hospital, UAB Health System, UBRICA, and Verizon.   CHOTÆs research model relies on knowledge and experiences of healthcare leaders to guide academic research.  We conduct cooperative research among universities, health systems, and other health-related industries.  This cooperative model ensures that research is not meaningful and applicable to the healthcare industry and provides immediate decision support for CHOT industry members.   At CHOT, our researchers work alongside the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) to conduct research that advances the efforts of healthcare systems to provide safe, effective, efficient, timely, equitable and patient centered care.  The three main areas in which CHOT conducts research are: 1. Investigative research-informed strategy, 2. Validating innovations in healthcare strategy, and 3. Implementing evidence-based innovation across settings.  Through the research conducted at CHOT, healthcare systems have been able to advance evidence-based management, systems engineering, and innovations in information technology, clinical practice, and organizational learning.  Our research also supports the efforts of other industries to more effectively advance the health of populations, working independently or in collaboration with existing health systems.  This enables us to contribute to the education of students and IAB members in research supporting transformation in healthcare.  Since 2009. CHOT has funded more than 60 graduate and undergraduate students to assist on research projects.  Industry Testimonials:  By being part of a multi-university NSF I/UCRC we have access to not just universities within the US, but internationally which benefits us in our pursuit of globalizing healthcare.  We also have access to the universitiesÆ students and scholars to help us look at our project needs in more rigorous way than if we hired consultants.  Dr. Macharia Waruingi, UBRICA  Verizon's involvement with CHOT researchers offers great discovery opportunities as Verizon continues to build out its Healthcare practice. The Verizon technology and strategy teams have been able to shape some of the research projectsthrough our participation as the industry partner to Penn State University. We expect these research engagements will provide unique insights for commercializing our healthcare solutions.
