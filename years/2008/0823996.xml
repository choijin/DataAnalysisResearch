<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop nanostructured ZnO on Si multi-gas sensors capable of room temperature operation with high sensitivity, responsivity, and specificity, compatible with CMOS technology. The approach is to substantially increase the performance capabilities of the sensor (a) by increasing sensor surface through nanostructures and thin catalytic metal contacts, (b) by introducing a ?field assisted? sensing process through nanojunctions, and (c) by conditioning the field assisted process.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is high in several fundamental issues in the physics of nanotechnology and nano-devices, in the physical and electronic properties of the nanostructures (surface area, surface states, surface reactivity, quantum confinement), and the field-assisted effects to gas detection processes. It addresses for the first time the development of novel nanosensors based on ZnO-Si nano-junctions to achieve room temperature, high sensitivity, high responsivity, multi-gas operation monolithically integrated with CMOS biasing and read-out circuitry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact will be in environmental safety, quality and security, in particular in critical environments such as neonatal care, unstable explosive, toxic and hazardous environments, where rapid, sensitive detection is needed. It will impact the way Electrical Engineering Education is perceived and taught by making it a truly multidisciplinary field contributing in all aspects of developments in society, interlinked with every critical area from medical to environmental, chemical and biological. More underrepresented groups and minority students will be attracted as it inherently offers more hands-on experience in an application oriented environment where the students can see their contribution to the work in environmental quality and safety. This is reflected by involving underrepresented group undergrad students in the sensor and CMOS chip design, through the proposed Marquee courses and Summer Training Programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
