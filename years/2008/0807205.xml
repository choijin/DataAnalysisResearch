<AbstractNarration>The rate at which low mass stars flare is a subject of significant current interest for understanding magnetic dynamo evolution, the effect of flares on the evolution of nearby planets, and the transient variability signature of flares in present and future large time-domain sky surveys. Here, a major observational program will be undertaken to obtain new data on flare light curves, frequencies and energies for classes of low mass stars that have been previously ignored (relatively inactive stars, and very late type stars). A set of numerical simulations to model M dwarf flares on a Galactic scale will also be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With these new data, Dr. Hawley and collaborators will determine the changes in flare activity that occur as stars become fully convective, providing insight and empirical constraints on new turbulent dynamo models for magnetic field production. The flare data will also be incorporated into models of planetary atmosphere evolution under the influence of flaring from the parent star. The numerical simulations will transform the study of individual flares on a few nearby stars into definitive predictions of the global implications of M dwarf flares on a Galactic scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observational component of the project will be fully integrated into the University of Washington's Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP) and the advanced undergraduate Capstone observing sequence. Pre-MAP is focused on increasing diversity by immediately involving freshmen from under-represented populations in research projects beginning in their first quarter of study. The Capstone sequence trains advanced undergraduate astronomy majors in observational techniques, data reduction and analysis using a 1-meter class telescope at the nearby Manastash Ridge Observatory. Faculty and graduate students will work with both freshmen and advanced undergraduates, and the undergraduates will additionally work with each other, building a mentor-ladder that will benefit the individual students. This project will also support two graduate students whose thesis material will come from this project.</AbstractNarration>
