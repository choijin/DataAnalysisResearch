<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided for an extension of the MARGINS Office activities at LDGO for an additional 14 months beyond August 2009. The MARGINS office provides a framework for cross-disciplinary studies of the evolution of the continental margins. It provides the infrastructure to advance science planning, disseminate results, foster interdisciplinary collaborations and lead educational and outreach activities for all four MARGINS initiatives.  Priority for the office in FY10 will be to support the MARGINS Steering Committee activities during the transition to a potential successor program to MARGINS, facilitate major that synthesize past results and begin the process of compiling a new Science Plan for the program through a major workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will include support of educational and synthesis meetings, maintenance of a website and Newsletter, holding of distinguish lecture series and support of outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many of the most challenging problems in solid earth geoscience require broadly multidisciplinary approaches.  Furthermore, most active solid-earth processes with highest societal impact (great earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods, etc.) take place on both sides the shoreline, a traditional dividing line between scientists in onshore and marine sciences.  To overcome these barriers and make progress in these critical problems, NSF began in 2000 the decadal MARGINS program.  It funded research in four Initiatives:  Sediment Source to Sink that studies sediment creation and delivery, the Seismogenic Zone Experiment that studies processes generating great earthquakes, the Subduction Factory where material and fluids/gasses recycle from oceans to deep interior and out volcanoes, and Rifting Continental Lithosphere that explores problems of continental breakup and creation of new ocean basins.  Individual scientists and teams apply directly to NSFÃ†s MARGINS program to work in these areas.     The MARGINS Office provided support to facilitate this roughly $50M scientific investment. This award and its predecessors support the MARGINS Office, operating under the present PI from 2006 to 2010, and a transfer period in 2010-11 to its successor. The Office ran meetings of the MARGINS Steering Committee who monitor scientific progress and serve as a conduit between NSF and the scientists involved; ran a variety of workshops for planning, synthesizing, and coordinating efforts; published semi-annual newsletters and maintained a web page to exchange information; ran a variety of education and outreach activities including lectures, student prizes, and course content development; and answered a number of other requests from NSF and the scientific community.  The Office consists of two full-time staff and a part-time director, who also chairs the Steering Committee, and rotates to new institutions every 3-4 years.  This award covers the last year of operation at Columbia University, and the final years of the MARGINS program as originally planned.     These years saw tremendous activity in completion of projects, synthesizing what had been learned from MARGINS, and then planning a new successor program designed to pursue some of the more important problems uncovered in the MARGINS decade.  That successful renewal, termed GeoPRISMS, has begun and broadly investigates active deformation and material cycles at subduction zones (Cascadia, Alaska, New Zealand) and rifts as they initiate and evolve (East Africa, Atlantic margin of North America).  Individual scientific accomplishments within MARGINS are too numerous to list here and are reported in individual awards, although many are summarized in the MARGINS Decadal Review and highlighted in the GeoPRISMS Draft Science Plan, all available on the MARGINS web page (www.nsf-margins.org) or the GeoPRISMS page (www.geoprisms.org).  The former includes one-page Research Highlights, presenting effectively some of the more significant findings within the program.
