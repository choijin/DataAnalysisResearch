<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to investigate the process variables that will enable the assembly of multi-scale patterned structures through the hybrid application of nozzle deposition and near field electro-spinning manufacturing processes.  These structures will be used to advance our understanding on the influence of spatially patterned structures containing both sub-micron to meso-scale dimensional features on the behavior of living cells. The development of the proposed manufacturing platform will enable the fabrication of complex tissue engineering constructs for engineering living tissue systems. The approach to achieve this objective includes biomaterial synthesis, rheological characterization, process modeling and fabrication of spatially patterned heterogeneous structures for biological testing. The educational objective of this award is to impart a vertical-integration-of-design-and-manufacturing-education based theme at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. In doing so, the plan aims to inspire high school students to pursue engineering education, promote the active participation of underrepresented minorities in engineering and to provide graduate students with expertise in bio-manufacturing systems. The approach to achieve these educational objectives includes active participation in the Oklahoma STARBASE organization targeted for K-12 students, the formation of a hovercraft club for freshman engineering students, and by facilitating graduate student international laboratory participation in South Korea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research lies in the capability to print heterogeneous structures at multiple length scales. Specifically, this plan proposes the next generation of scalable bio-manufacturing systems for the fabrication of polymeric medical implants and in-vitro human tissue analog systems. The investigation into cell-environment interaction will help engineers, biologists and clinicians to better understand the role of engineered constructs for regenerative medicine. The proposed educational activities will enhance design and manufacturing education for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Oklahoma. The hovercraft club at the university will introduce the art of engineering through a design and manufacturing perspective for students, and also serve as a focal point for attracting high school students to the engineering discipline. This CAREER plan will also help to setup state-of-the-art infrastructure in advanced manufacturing and usher in new multi-disciplinary collaborative activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
