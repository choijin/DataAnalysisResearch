<AbstractNarration>UBM-Institutional: BioMathletic Training&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interdisciplinary undergraduate research program in mathematical and statistical biology is planned at Ohio State University through a collaborative effort between the Departments of Mathematics, Statistics, and Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology. Research opportunities are also available in Computational Neuroscience &amp; Cell Biology. The program will: (1) expose a broad group of students to research problems in the mathematical biosciences; (2) develop curricula to prepare students to pursue advanced study in interdisciplinary fields; and (3) facilitate participation of a cohort of undergraduates in an intensive and integrated research experience involving teams of students and faculty mentors. Beginning students will participate in a seminar course held during every academic quarter that exposes them to the broad area of mathematical biology; while more advanced students will participate in the program as Undergraduate Research Fellows (URFs). The URFs will participate in a mentored research experience during two or three academic years and the summer before their senior year. Each of the co-Principal Investigators associated with the individual research projects have active research programs. Many of the proposed activities will impact a broad group, ranging from students who participate only in the newly-developed interdisciplinary courses to those selected as URFs. The most profound impact of the proposal will be the production of a group of students who are aware of the opportunities available in research in the mathematical and statistical biosciences, who are prepared to enter into graduate study and careers in these areas, and who are motivated to continue working in interdisciplinary fields, in other words- the next generation of BioMath stars.
