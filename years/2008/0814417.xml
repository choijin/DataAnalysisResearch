<AbstractNarration>Goals: This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) award seeks to build upon prior RII-supported efforts to expand the core facilities of the University?s Center of Excellence in Marine and Environmental Studies. At this center, scientists investigate the connections between ocean and coastal waters; the biological and geophysical linkages of the land-sea interface; and their potential impact on coral reef ecosystems. Specifically, this project will investigate the factors that enhance or reduce coral reefs? tolerance to environmental stress to better understand ecological resilience. The people of the Virgin Islands rely heavily on   Caribbean coastal resources for subsistence, and are alarmed by findings that indicate that nearly 70% of the coral reefs are threatened by costal development, pollution, sedimentation, and over-fishing.  Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification and ineffective management add further threats to Caribbean coral reefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Major Foci: Because of the US Virgin Islands? reliance on the surrounding coastal waters and coral reef ecosystems for tourism (economic engine), transportation, food and recreation, the research focus is Biocomplexity in Caribbean Coral Reefs. Three research projects have been developed into the Integrated Caribbean Coastal Ecosystem Research Plan: 1) Evolutionary and Ecological Patterns and Processes team will investigate the numerous processes that threaten coral reef ecosystems; 2) Ocean and Coastal Processes team will provide the physical foundation for interpreting biological processes based upon field data and ocean modeling; and 3) Environmental Analysis and Management team will address the gap between physical and human interactions in coastal ecosystems and the underlying importance of socio-economics on successful natural resource management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate factors that enhance or reduce a coral reef?s tolerance to environmental stress and the coral reef?s resistance to transitions to alternate ecological states. Anticipated project outcomes include a better understanding of how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The research outcomes will inform decision-makers on natural resource management and spatial planning and will enhance human and ocean health. There is an urgent need for this information given the trends on coral reef mortality in the region and the potential negative impact to the region?s economy.  Research results may be applicable to regions outside the Caribbean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the Research Infrastructure Improvement Project undertaken by the Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research was to build nationally-competitive research capacity at the University of the Virgin Islands.  This was done by improving the research infrastructure and building multi-disciplinary teams of research scientists.     The research was carried out through a program that integrated physical, biological and social science disciplines in order to understand the natural and social patterns and processes that exist in the coastal environment in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The second major component of the project focused on building partnerships between the researchers and the broader community in order to address marine and environmental issues and enable actions that result in sustainable development opportunities for the Territory.     The project produced significant results in all its components, by: providing infrastructure to support research and enhanced student learning outcomes at the University of the Virgin Islands; producing new information on the coastal ecosystems in the U.S. Virgin Islands; increasing the pool of Virgin Islanders with advanced degrees in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields; adding to the science education of Virgin Islands students; enhancing the skills of professionals in the community; and providing technical support to local development initiatives.     The research infrastructure provided by the project includes upgrades to the MacLean Marine Science  Center, renovations to the Virgin Islands Environmental Resource Station, and renovations to establish a new oceanographic laboratory, a new environmental analysis laboratory, and facilities that form the Institute for Geo-Computational Analysis and Statistics.  The infrastructure greatly increased the capacity of the University of the Virgin  Islands to conduct multi-disciplinary research as required by the project.     The research increased local knowledge of how coral reef ecosystems function, including the connections between the physical factors and biological patterns, how coral diseases are transmitted, how corals at different depths respond to different types and levels of stress, and how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by disturbance from natural and human sources.  The project also increased understanding of the relationship between biological systems and human health.     The intellectual merit of the research program was highlighted by the large number of publications in scientific journals of high caliber, the increasing impact factor of those publications (indicating a greater contribution and impact on the scientific community), and the large number of external (including international) scientists that collaborated with Virgin Islands EPSCoR scientists in research activities and co-authoring scientific papers for publication.     The project produced impacts beyond the intellectual merit of the research program.  One such impact is the increase in the research competitiveness of the University of the Virgin Islands, as evidenced by the increase in grant awards and the number of visiting scientists that utilize the research facilities.  The enhanced capacity from improved cyber-infrastructure and the availability of various databases support collaboration with external scientists in projects where significant computing capacity is required.     The project was also beneficial to the wider Virgin Islands community in several ways.  The project partnered with local institutions and groups to support training for large numbers of high school students in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Graduates from the Master of Marine and Environmental Science degree program and the Master of Arts in Mathematics for Secondary Teachers degree program provide enhanced knowledge and skills to the University of the Virgin Islands, agencies...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
