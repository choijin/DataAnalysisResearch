<AbstractNarration>CAPSULE, a capstone project-based learning model, brings the STEM/IT workforce experience to high school students and teachers through industry-driven projects and multimedia production.  Materials developed at the Museum of Science and real-world problems solicited from local industry are formulated as projects to be used in a hands-on capstone elective course or in after school activities so that students can relate STEM concepts covered in the classroom to real world applications and learn the engineering design process (EDP).  As part of the course, students visit companies to learn first hand about the day-to-day activities of the STEM/IT workforce. They also produce their own media content of their projects.  Each year, thirty high school teachers engage in a two week summer professional development workshop with follow-up during the year for a total of 120 hours.  Activities are developed for school administrators, guidance counselors and parents to make them aware of the value and importance of STEM/IT careers and opportunities. The project outcomes are (1) pedagogically proven EDP-based curricula that can be replicated at the local, regional and national levels; (2) teachers who connect STEM content to real-world applications; (3) students who discover the real value of STEM subjects; and (4) a means to address Massachusetts' capacity problem to teach engineering and technology in schools.  The evaluation plan focuses on the quality of professional development, student learning, and perceptions of STEM careers. Partners include high schools, local industry, Northeastern University engineering research centers and the STEM Education Center, and Boston Museum of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The national need for a qualified STEM workforce and the lack of interest among school-age children in STEM subjects are well documented.  Engineering has been identified as a key to improve STEM teaching.  However, there is a need for effective and structured engineering-based teaching methodologies to meet this premise.  This project introduces a new pedagogical methodology, dubbed Engineering-Based Learning (EBL), that allows both teachers and students to follow a structured way of teaching and learning STEM subjects in high schools. EBL structure is rooted in using the Engineering Design Process (EDP).  Moreover, EBL uses the capstone experience typically required in ABET-accredited college engineering curriculum.  EBL has been implemented and tested over a three-year research project in urban high schools including Boston Public Schools. The project has developed an effective two-week summer professional development workshop for teachers to learn EBL. Teachers, in turn, implement EBL is their STEM teaching as they see best for students.  The project trained 82 high school STEM teachers (grades 9-12) from 45 school districts, and 62 distinct high schools. More than 4,500 students have participated in the program over the three years.  Based on studentsÆ quantitative and qualitative surveys and teachersÆ feedback, the results show a positive change in how students perceive STEM subjects and careers, suggesting that EBL is an effective new paradigm for high school STEM teaching.  EBL can help students learn, absorb, retain, and perceive STEM theoretical knowledge.  EBL is the bridge that can solve the disconnect between STEM theory and application for students.
