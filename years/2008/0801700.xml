<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) grant supports the creation of a new interdisciplinary graduate training program in Emergent Functions of Neural Systems within the Center for Mind Brain and Computation at Stanford University.  The effort to understand human mental abilities such as perception, decision making, learning and memory, and motor planning and action as emergent consequences of brain activity remains a major challenge of science, and meeting this challenge requires scientists who combine both quantitative and experimental research methods.   Quantitative methods include computational modeling, applied mathematics, and statistics; experimental methods involve recording brain activity while the brain is engaged in mental activity.   This program will train the next generation of scientists who will address this challenge by combining quantitative and experimental methods.  Trainees may come from Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Neuroscience, or Psychology at Stanford.  Each trainee will formulate an individualized training plan that complements the home department doctoral program, and will pursue research combining quantitative and experimental methods.  The program will develop new courses in quantitative and computational neuroscience, and will provide opportunities to bridge across disciplinary boundaries. This IGERT will strengthen the use of quantitative and computational methods that are crucial for breakthrough progress in research aimed at understanding how mental abilities arise from neural processes, and it will strengthen bridges between the disciplines of psychology and neuroscience and the disciplines of computer science, mathematics, and engineering.   Trainees will go on to careers in which they will enhance expertise in quantitative and computational methods in the behavioral and neural sciences and pass their expertise on to others.  The program will recruit women and underrepresented groups through a variety of outreach and networking activities to pursue careers combining quantitative and computational approaches to understand the relationship between mental and neural processes. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training grant provided funds that have allowed us to create a vibrant community of researchers and trainees who seek to understand how complex mental and behavioral functions emerge from the interactions of neurons in the brain.   A basic tenet of our program has been the view that the effort to understand these functions depends on a synergystic integration of experimental and computational methods.  Accordingly, we have sought to build a community that links the traditionally experimentally oriented disiplines of neuroscience and psychological science with the theoretical, quantitative and computational disciplines of physics, statistics, engineering, and computer science.  Faci;ty and trainees in PhD programs associated with these programs have come together to form a tight-knit community to investigate the neural control of movement, the neural basis of decision making and perception, and the neural basis of learning and memory.  Breakthroughs that trainees in this program have contributed to include explicit computational models explaining how organisms perceive depth, how animals combine head-direction, sensory information and an grid-like map to successfully navigate in space, and how the gradual accumulation of experience sets the stage for rapid learning in the prepared mind.  The research training experience provided by the program. is now well established without the need for on-going IGERT funding.  The program centers on the creation of scientists who are self-directed, autonomous learners whose expertise extends beyond the boundary of any one traditional discipline.  Each trainee formulates a specific training program that forces him or her to stretch outside the traditional range of their home department, including coursework and/or directed study tailored to prepare the trainee to engage in a specific program of research that integrates theoretical and/or computational approaches with experimental investigations.  Trainees are guided by a mentoring team consisting of a primary and one or more secondary mentors with complementary expertise, such as a neuroscientist who is an expert in recording from neurons in the brain and a theoretician trained in the methods of theoratical physics to construct models of the processes that give rise to the observed neural activity.  Currently the program has about 30 active trainees in their 2nd through 5th years of graduate study, with 10 new trainees joining the program for Autumn, 2016.  It hosts a bi-weekly research seminar featuring a speaker who integrates theoretical and computational approaches with experimental investigations; an annual symposium focusing on a specific topic, such as the neural representation of space; and faculty associated with the program serve the needs of a broad range of students across several departments at Stanford University.
