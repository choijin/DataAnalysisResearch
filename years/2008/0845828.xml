<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to understand the reliability behavior of microgrid-based ultra-reliable power systems in extreme conditions. This objective is part of a broader career plan that focuses on improving electric power supply availability through dc microgrids. The approach involves an analytic methodology that estimates failure probability and expected failure duration during hurricanes and earthquakes by relating these events? intensity with location-dependent infrastructure vulnerabilities. Results are verified through simulations and compared with past events? outcomes. The analysis uses telecommunications power plants as a reference technology because of their similarities with dc microgrids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit resides in the introduction of a reliability framework that uses non-homogeneous Markov models. Transitions among states are characterized by the time varying failure and repair rates of each key element in microgrids energy supply infrastructures. The use of microgrids to achieve high availability constitutes a radical shift from the paradigm of relying on energy-based backup systems. This research also advances hurricanes characterization by introducing a new measure of intensity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts extend into improving electric power supply resiliency and national security, potentially reducing the loss of lives after disasters, and creating interdisciplinary collaboration opportunities with scientists studying disasters. This project will leverage the interest on disasters to attract students into the electric power area and to support the development of a power electronics research and educational program with participation opportunities for minority students. Research dissemination and education plans involve outreach goals targeting a diverse audience, including peers, students, and the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
