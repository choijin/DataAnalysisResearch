<AbstractNarration>DRL- 0813135&lt;br/&gt;Communicating Climate Change&lt;br/&gt;PI: Walter Staveloz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC), in collaboration with the Yale Project on Climate Change and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, is conducting a three-year project whose goal is to build the capacity of twelve science centers as well as of twelve NSF-funded Long-term Ecological Research Centers (LTER) for the purpose of engaging the public in climate change science. The twelve sites span the USA from the east coast to Hawaii.  The goal of these simultaneous projects is to illustrate local indicators of global change.  Additional partners include ScienCentral, Inc. (TV media producers), the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the American Geophysical Union, NOAA, Natural History magazine, and a national board of advisors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables include: (1) twelve local demonstration projects with launch programs, exhibits/programs, TV spots, citizen science activities, and an interactive map illustrating the work of the twelve sites, (2) professional development for informal STEM education professionals and LTER research faculty, (3) a national survey to assess the USA population?s climate literacy, and (4) a culminating workshop for the ISE field, a permanent resource database, and a final publication.  Evaluation processes are being conducted by David Heil &amp; Associates.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The main professional development tools created during this project supported the implementation of citizen science in science centers and museums.     Citizen Science Workshops  Over the course of the project, we realized that citizen science was a powerful tool that could help science centers and museums connect their publics to many issues, not just climate change, and after spending three years working to develop citizen science programs at museums across the country, we had a number of promising practices we wanted share with the field. As our primary method of dissemination for the project, ASTC and the CLO organized a series of regional workshops called "Integrating Citizen Science Into Science Center Programming".

The goal of this task force was to advance the development of cultural competence across the field by highlighting PPSR programs that feature promising culturally inclusive practices. We conducted case studies of efforts to engage communities that have been most marginalized and disenfranchised in the sciences and PPSR, including communities of color, low-income communities, and tribal communities. However, we expect the insights gained from these studies to speak to cultural inclusiveness in broader terms.     The product of this effort is a pair of documents available online at http://citizenscience.org/promisingpractices. The first is a report of the teamÆs effort which includes a summary of promising practices for enhancing cultural inclusive...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
