<AbstractNarration>0851910&lt;br/&gt;P.I. - Maya A. Trotz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year REU site program at the University of South Florida will provide ten undergraduate participants each year an opportunity to conduct hands-on research focused on the theme of emerging environmental problems and sustainable solutions in air, soil and water, with a particular emphasis on the Tampa Bay region, a rapidly urbanizing coastal community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this program are: 1) to train participants in the scientific research process; 2) to encourage undergraduate participants to pursue an advanced degree in an environmentally related area of research; 3) to encourage students to consider the ethical aspects surrounding their research and the contribution of the research to sustaining healthy communities; 4) to establish a sustainable mechanism for broadening participation in academic research; and 5) to create a collaborative community committed to mentoring and advising innovative undergraduate experiences that promote and advance faculty research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty and graduate students will interact with undergraduate participants through individual research projects, weekly research seminars, brown-bag student discussion sessions, a journal club, social and community activities, technical and professional training workshops, and through e-forums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU program will focus recruitment efforts on individuals underrepresented in the sciences and engineering including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and students from institutions where research opportunities are limited.  Efforts also will be made to recruit students from community colleges and introduce them to the research environment.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
