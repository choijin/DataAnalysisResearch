<AbstractNarration>This award is to the Computer Research Association (CRA) to coordinate a Principle Investigators' (PIs') meeting in November 2007 for the NSF FIND (Future Internet Network Design). The PIs' meeting is a chance to bring researchers together to learn about the work of other research projects and to provide a forum to discuss new ideas and future directions.  CRA supports the important work of the FIND programs by acting as the facilitator and organizer of the FIND Workshop for FIND researchers to foster information sharing, community building and the generation of research directions for participants in the FIND programs. CRA is in a unique position to provide support to the FIND workshop because this organizational mission is to support research and advanced education in computing and in this capacity brings CRA staff into regular contact with many of the departments funded by FIND grants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRA facilitates the workshop by providing staff support. As the workshop organizer, CRA is responsible for a number of tasks both prior to and during the workshop such as registering participants, organizing the program, distributing handouts, and arranging and staffing the meeting site. The 2007 NSF Future Internet Network Design PI Meeting will be held November 27-28, 2007, at the Westin Hotel in Ballston. CRA will work with the FIND program staff to assemble the program elements. The purpose of the FIND meetings that bring together principal investigators and invited experts is to build a research community to meet the challenges of creating new internet architectures that meet the demands of the 21st century.  This meeting focuses on preliminary ideas on how to begin to build architectures by beginning with ones that address the needs of particular classes of applications such as content based applications, real-time applications with high need for security, and networks under times of crises.  In addition this meeting will bring together relevant researchers from industry and from other countries to discuss potential collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presentations at the meeting will provide PIs with education on what other research efforts are being funded through NSF FIND, as well as interactions with other researchers and invited guests who do work related to FIND topics, and will revitalize efforts to generate new and exciting research endeavors. CRA has organized similar workshops for research community the last 7 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this information attendees have the opportunity to associate themselves with other researchers in their field and possibly form research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
