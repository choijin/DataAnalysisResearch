<AbstractNarration>Information that leaves the eye first encounters a structure called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). From the LGN, information is relayed to the cortex, where neurons have properties closely related to our perceptual experience. To understand how the cortex acquires its remarkable abilities, data on its inputs from the LGN are needed. When we view objects in the world, the neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are stimulated by small regions of space called their receptive fields. This project will record the electrical responses of the LGN neurons of monkeys performing a visual task. Linear mathematical models of the receptive fields of LGN neurons will be constructed based on their responses to simple forms. These models will be used to predict responses of the LGN cells to natural scenes. In addition, the effects of regions of space surrounding the receptive fields will be assessed. These surrounding regions are expected to reduce the activity of the LGN neurons so that they are more efficient and they conserve energy. In addition to improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying human perception, the results may help to generate ideas about improved designs of artificial vision systems that have wide applications in industry. This collaborative project will provide training for a graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Texas and will also provide training and data for graduate students doing mathematical modeling at Boston University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award, a collaborative project between Dr. Max Snodderly at The University of Texas at Austin and Dr. Michele Rucci at Boston University, has funded research aimed at advancing current knowledge of how information is represented and processed in the early stages of the visual system.  Neurons in the visual system are often studied with simple stimuli and under highly controlled conditions that prevent normal motor activity.  In contrast, images of the natural world are much richer than the stimuli typically used in these experiments, and humans and other species move continually during the acquisition of visual information.  Small involuntary eye movements are always present, even when attending to a single point.  This project has focused on how visual neurons respond to natural stimuli and code information about our visual world in the presence of normal eye movements.  An important specific goal of this project has been the experimental validation of previously proposed theories for encoding visual information.  It has long been suggested that neurons in the retina are tuned to discard redundant information in natural scenes so to optimally allocate resources to the unpredictable events.  Early theories primarily focused on the role played by the response characteristics of neurons, as measured in classical experiments.  While these theories have contributed tremendously to current understanding of visual functions, they did not consider the observerÆs motor activity.  More recently, it has been suggested that small incessant eye movements may also play a role in discarding predicable information.  Findings from this project have shown that neuronal characteristics are by themselves not sufficient to discard the redundancy of natural scenes and that eye movements indeed contribute to this process by properly reformatting input signals to the retina.  Intellectual merit.  This project has generated valuable information about the response characteristics of neurons in the visual system and tested fundamental ideas about neural coding of natural stimuli.  Our findings have provided the first direct experimental confirmation of the prediction that fixational eye movements act to discard the visual redundancy of the natural world.  Efficient neural encoding was suggested as a design principle in the visual system a long time ago and is regarded as a cornerstone of our understanding of visual processing.  Our results add new knowledge to the field by showing that eye movements execute important information processing functions prior to any neural processing.   Broader impact.  Elucidation of how visual information is encoded in the early visual system is a prerequisite for fully comprehending the consequences of many retinal disorders as well as for guiding the development of effective prosthetic devices.  In addition, this project has offered valuable training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at both institutions.
