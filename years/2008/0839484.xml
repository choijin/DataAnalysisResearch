    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a scalable process for production of nanomaterials-based, high permeability, energy-efficient membranes for desalination. While recent strides have been made in improving the energy-efficiency of seawater desalination processes, it is widely acknowledged that improvements in membrane permeability are needed to bring the process closer to cost-parity with existing methods of water production. The reverse osmosis membranes developed in this project will utilize unique water transport and salt rejection characteristics of select nanomaterials to achieve the desired high permeability. The project will also enhance understanding of the science behind water and ion transport through membranes on the nanometer-scale, an area of active academic interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts/commercial potential of this project is to develop a reverse osmosis-based desalination system that can operate efficiently at substantially lower feed pressures than currently available systems (and thereby reduce the capital and operating costs of producing potable water from salty water). The concept is likely to be applicable to other challenging molecular separations. Less than one half of one percent of the world's water is readily accessible fresh water. As a result, desalination of brackish and seawater has grown into an enormous ($10B annual) industry. This, however, meets the needs of only 1% of the world's population. A number of global trends will increase world demand for potable water. While reverse osmosis (RO) has emerged as the lowest cost desalination process, it nevertheless remains relatively expensive. Energy and membrane costs comprise 75% of the operating costs of desalination facilities. The total costs of the world's RO desalination facilities today exceed $10B annually. Existing and future RO desalination facility owners need a means to reduce energy consumption, use fewer membrane cartridges, and construct smaller, less expensive facilities. Reduction in cost associated with the next-generation membranes developed in this project will garner interest from a wide array of water suppliers.</AbstractNarration>
