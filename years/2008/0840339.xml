<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to increase science literacy with regard to environmental change.  Deliverables include 1) a two-hour public television program (Reinventing California)  intended for public television broadcast;  2) five Place-Based Programs located at state and national parks in California; 3) an online educational portal with open source  podcast videos and other resources for downloading and use in multiple settings.  Intended audiences include California public television viewers, visitors to California state and national parks, and users on line educational resources.  The secondary professional audience includes park interpretive staff, scientists, teachers, and media professionals. STEM content includes geology, evolution of species, biodiversity, and climate change.  Through strategic partnerships with universities, government agencies, and public television this three year project is creating a new model that builds capacity, and impacts audiences in new ways.  The project evaluation and research conducted by the Institute for Learning Innovation will look at how using media which provides an overarching sense of place within the environment can be integrated with place-based programs that add a personal scale to understanding environmental change.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The California Environmental Legacy Project is a pioneering educational media project that was created to increase public understanding of environmental change and inspire a new culture of stewardship in America. With major funding from the National Science Foundation, the Legacy Project produced a public television documentary called Becoming California, a package of short films and video podcasts created for state and national park visitor centers across California, an educational website (<a href="http://www.calegacy.org">www.calegacy.org</a>) to deliver its media programs and connect with public and professional audiences, and companion K-12 teacher resources. The major goals of the Legacy Project were to inspire viewers and participants to explore how we shape and are shaped by environmental change and the nature of our relationship to the environment. The Legacy Project was created by a team of distinguished scientists, leading educators, and award-winning media professionals, along with a set of project partners, including Sacramento State, Humboldt State University, California State Parks, the National Park Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the San Diego Natural History Museum, and the UC Davis John Muir Institute of the Environment.&nbsp; Project team and partners worked together to create this innovative package of educational media and resources.</p> <p>The Legacy Project was created to reach a broad and diverse public audience of California public television viewers, visitors to California state and national parks, and users of online educational resources, as well as a professional audience of park interpretive staff, scientists, teachers, and media professionals through professional development opportunities.
