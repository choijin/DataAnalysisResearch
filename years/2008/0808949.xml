<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop non-traditional Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection mechanisms and structures, using novel nanowire crossbar array and nano mechanical switch mechanisms, for nanoscale integrated circuits (IC). The approach is to investigate new nanowire switching ESD discharging mechanism, to fabricate and characterize nano crossbar switch arrays, to explore CMOS-compatible fabrication flow and to develop new modeling techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: ESD failure is the most devastating IC reliability problem in sub-100nm regime that causes the industry billions of dollars annually. On-chip ESD protection is hence required to protect ICs against ESD damage. ESD failure and protection involves very complex multi-coupling effects. As IC technologies continue to shrink, ESD-induced leakage and mis-triggering effect at GHz operation, inherent to its traditional transistor-type protection mechanism, become intolerable. It is hence imperative to develop novel ESD protection mechanisms and structures. This project is to develop completely new nanowire crossbar array and nano mechanical switch based ESD protection mechanisms and structures, which intends to replace the decade-long traditional ESD protection mechanism, therefore to eliminate the ESD-induced leakage and mis-triggering problems. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Success of this project will deliver the first nanowire crossbar array and nano mechanical switch ESD protection mechanisms and structures for next generation IC technologies at nanoscale. The new ESD protection solutions are critical to finally resolving the grand IC reliability challenge at nano nodes. NSF support of this research enables the proposed international-academia-industry collaboration activities that greatly benefit American students, the semiconductor industry, the academia and the American society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report concerns a Supplemental REU Award to the original research grant (#0808949, 2007-2010) with no-cost extension for about three months.  Intellectual Merit: Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) failure is the most devastating reliability problem to integrated circuits (IC) as the technologies migrate into sub-100nm and nano nodes. On-chip ESD protection is required to protect ICs against ESD damage. ESD protection design for sub-100nm and next-generation nanoscale IC technologies emerges as a huge IC design challenge. The main goal of this research project was to develop a new nanowire crossbar switch based ESD protection mechanism for integrated circuits and nano nodes. The research outcomes were reported already. Eight research papers were published and one  US patent application was filed.     Broader Impacts: This report concerns the  experiences for undergraduate students (REU) under the supplemental REU award. A group of undergraduate students at University of California, Riverside (UCR) were involved in the REU training during this period. Specifically, Mr. Jose Ramirez, a Hispanic American student, was recruited to conduct research in the Lab for more than one year. Six other undergraduate students were also involved in related research training. This led to seven undergraduate research papers presented. Mr. Ramirez later entered a graduate program to continue his research in nanotechnologies.           Last Modified: 04/14/2013       Submitted by: Albert Wang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
