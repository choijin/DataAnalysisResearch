<AbstractNarration>Computational intractability imposes a limit on the ability to understand nature and design systems.  Intractability is a stumbling block for postmen, travelling salesmen, map colorers, and millions of others who would like to complete their tasks as efficiently as possible, yet it is the foundation of 21st century cryptography, which in turn is a pillar of electronic commerce.  In order to understand, manage, and exploit intractability it is imperative that progress be made on proving intractability in many forms and computational models, and on unraveling the interconnections among different forms and uses of intractability.  This Expedition will explore an array of diverse but interrelated topics in computational intractability including algorithms, complexity, cryptography, analysis, geometry, combinatorics, and quantum mechanics.  A "Center for Intractability," the first of its kind, will be based at Princeton.  Addressing some of the deepest and hardest theoretical problems standing in the way of significant advancements in computer science, this Expedition involves a high degree of collegial interactivity through collaborations among geographically local participating institutions.  Outreach includes an active "Women in Theory" program as well as programs targeting undergraduate and high-school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intractability, the phenomenon whereby problems become computationally infeasible when the input size or dimension grows, has long stood in the way of algorithmic progress on problems in the sciences and engineering. Since this "curse" concerns the limits to information processing &mdash;whether by nature, machine or humans &mdash;understanding it is one of the deepest and broadest intellectual pursuits in computer science. The project assembled a team of a dozen PIs and a large group of grads and postdocs for a deeper study of this phenomenon, including how to overcome it, and also its implications for other disciplines.   Work done during this project ---and recognized by several awards---has helped turn the Unique Games Conjecture into a central problem of computational complexity, in the process also leading to much work in algorithms and spectral graph theory.  The project also created a new information theory for communication protocols, analogous to ---but more complicated than---ShannonÆs information theory for single messages. This new theory has already had substantial impact, such as progress on the longstanding direct sum conjecture ("does solving k instances of the problem take k times as much resources as solving a single instance?") in the communication setting.   The team expanded the importance of computational intractability in several new fields. It was shown that pricing financial derivatives --- including CDOs, the derivatives figuring in the financial crash of 2008---is intractable, and that this intractability can be used to create an information asymmetry between buyers and sellers. This work has obvious implications for financial regulation and was highlighted in the popular press.   Another field impacted by the project is dynamical systems, where it was shown that viewing swarms of particles as interacting micro-algorithmic elements (leading to a new field called Natural Algorithms) sheds new insights into collective behavior, including proofs of impossibility of certain phenomena such as rapid flocking by birds.   The project also focused on intractable problems in machine learning, and tried to identify whether there is hidden structure in real-life instances that enable simpler algorithms. This turned out to be the case for Topic Modeling, a major field of machine learning, where the teamÆs work has led to new algorithms with provable guarantees as well as code that is 50-100 times faster than the best earlier code.

Finally, the Center for Computational Intractability has been proof positive for the idea that theoretical CS can also benefit from a large-scale research effort. The center has seen a constant ferment of activity ---visitors, monthly team meetings, brainstorming meetings etc.---that led to spontaneous formation of subteams that attacked various facets of the problems. Often concepts jumped from one project to another, and led to our best breakthroughs.              Last Modified: 10/30/2014       Submitted by: E...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
