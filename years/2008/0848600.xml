<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop and build a method and system for integrating sophisticated advertising capabilities into the Scientific Media Concise Message Routing System. The technology allows anyone with an internet domain name (individuals, small businesses, large corporations, or other organizations) to quickly, easily, and cheaply distribute information via a variety of mobile media, with particular emphasis on text messaging, or SMS. The technology comprises hardware and software that route text-message requests and responses between "subscribers" who access information and "content publishers" who distribute information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to create the system and methods needed to append highly-targeted advertisements to the content requested from publishers by subscribers.&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Media believes that the system establishes the framework of an important new method of distributing information via SMS that can be applied in a variety of settings, including consumer, education, and research settings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This SBIR program has focused on the research and development of the ScientificMedia Concise Message Routing System, also known as DOTGO. DOTGO is a fundamentally new way for people to access the Internet from their mobile phones using text messaging.  Although text messaging continues to be enormously popular among consumers around the world for person-to-person communication, taking advantage of text-messaging for content dissemination has been technically difficult and expensive due to inflexible and outdated technologies.  To address this, Scientific Media, Inc. sought to develop a completely new technology that would allow anyone with an internet domain name&mdash;individuals, small businesses, large corporations, or other organizations&mdash;to quickly, easily, and cheaply distribute information via a variety of mobile technologies, with particular emphasis on text messaging.  At the same time, Scientific Media, Inc. sought to develop a new way for anyone with even the most basic mobile phone to access that content.  As a result of this SBIR program, Scientific Media, Inc. developed the following three innovative technologies:  A system and method for users to communicate with the Internet by sending and receiving text messages A markup language called CMRL (the Concise Message Routing Language) that allows anyone with a website to publish content so that it can be accessed over the Internet via text messaging A scalable hardware and software platform to route text messages between users and websites.   As a result of these innovations Scientific Media, Inc. was granted a patent from the US Patent Office as well as granted patents in several other countries around the world.  In addition, the research surrounding Scientific Media's technology has spawned the development of new mobile technologies which were not envisioned at the beginning of the program.  Scientific Media, Inc. has met the objectives of this SBIR project and has become a successful and profitable company.  Users in 15 countries around the world now use DOTGO to access the Internet from their mobile phones, and over 10,000 websites have used its technology to make their content available to mobile users over the Internet via text messaging.
