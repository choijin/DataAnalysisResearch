<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is mainly working on three projects. The first one is a fundamental and basic intersection problem between the Hirzebruch-Zagier divisors and arithmetic CM cycles in a Hilbert modular surface over Z. The goal is to prove a beautiful intersection formula conjectured by J. Bruinier and the investigator. It has at least two applications. One is a highly non-trivial generalization of the celebrated Chowla-Selberg formula, a&lt;br/&gt;conjecture of Colmez on Faltings' height of CM abelian varieties. The second is to obtain a nice upper bound for the denominator of the CM values of Igusa invariants|refining a conjecture of Lauter. The second application is also practically important in Cohn-Lauter cryptosystem using genus two curves. The second project is a joint one with Bruinier They try to study how the CM value of twisted Bocherds products behave as the CM&lt;br/&gt;cycle change. They also want to find a factorization formula for CM values. Twisted Borcherds products are a family of canonical Hilbert modular functions with coeficients in the real quadratic field. The third project is to solve a general intersection problem in a degenerated Hilbert modular surface and use it to give another proof of the beautiful formula of Gross and Keating on intersection of three modular correspondences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: Mathematics has always been essential to the development of science and technology. Now Mathematics has become increasingly important to business, finance, biology, and social studies too. Basic research in mathematics, which is usually `pure' mathematics (without application), has increasingly found unexpected and deep application in unexpected areas. For example, the number theory I studies used to call the queen of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, meaning that it is very beautiful and very attractive but useless in practice. But now it is extremely important in coding theory and cryptosystem, both are essential&lt;br/&gt;to our electric communication and electronic business transaction as well as our national security. Arithmetic and algebraic geometry which is also in part of my proposed research has now applications in engineering such as face recognition and economics. My proposed research contributes to basic and deep understanding of some arithmetic and geometric subjects in number theory and arithmetic geometry, and will in turn contribute to our society's well-being. One of my proposed project has direct applications to cryptosystem,&lt;br/&gt;which is essential to our national security and national economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, partialy supported by NSF during 2009-2013, has achieved more than its original goals.  1.  This project has produced 15 very high quality research papers  by myself and three PhD thesis by my students.  The project advanced our understanding of some arithmetic geometric subject called Shimura Varieties.  I, together with my collaborators, discovered a new way to study Shimura varieties and we have produced quite a few signigicant results on this. I also solved a couple of  important conjectures on this subject.     2.  This project has produced a new and faster way to construct the so-called genus two curve crytpography system. This has very important potential practical application on telecommunication and electronic commerce.     3.  This project has helped me trained 3 graduated  PhD students and three current PhD students.  Summer research assistant support enabled them to concentrate on their research and found their footing in research. One of them Michale Woodbury got a prestigious postdoc position at Columbia due to his very high quality PhD thesis.     4. The NSF support has enabled me to travel and lecture on my research results, making these results known to the number theory community. The support also enabled me to invite experts to give lectures at my departments which has always a great help and inspiration to graduate students, postdocs, and faculty.
