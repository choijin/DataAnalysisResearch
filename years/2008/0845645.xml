<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: This  CAREER project will investigate ultrafast  electronic  and  magnetization  dynamics  and  the  dynamic  modification  of  material  properties  associated  with  the  optically  excited  coherent  lattice  motion  in  transition  metal  oxide  nanocrystals. So  far,  studies  of  the  ultrafast  electronic  and  magnetic  properties  of  transition  metal  oxides  are  largely  focused  on  the  bulk  surface  and  thin  layer  structures. The  research  will  address  the  ultrafast  electronic  and  magnetic  dynamics  of  nanometer scale  transition  metal  oxides  using  chemically  synthesized  colloidal  nanocrystals as size and composition tunable  model  systems.  The  coupled  nature  of  the  coherent  lattice  motion  and  material  properties  in  the  electronic  and  spin  degrees  of  freedom  will  also  be  investigated.  For  this  purpose,  time resolved  transient  absorption  and  Faraday rotation  spectroscopy  will  be  employed  in  conjunction  with  the  time resolved  x-ray  absorption  spectroscopy.  For  the  latter,  femtosecond  hard  x-ray beam  line  at  the  Advanced  Light  Source  as  well  as  the  laser based  x-ray source  will  be  used  to  study  the  structural  dynamics  in  real  space. Combined  analysis  of  electronic,  magnetic  dynamics  and  structural  dynamics  will  provide  a  unique  opportunity  to  explore  the  dynamic  structure-property  relationship  in  nanocrystalline  solids  on  the  time  scale  of  the  atomic  motion  in  the  lattice. NON-TECHNICAL: The  knowledge  obtained  from  this  research  has  broad  implications  for  understanding  the  coupling  of  electronic  and  magnetic  properties  with  the  local  molecular  or  lattice  structure  in  nanometer  length  scale.  Relevant  potential  applications  are  switching  and  memory  devices  and  spintronics,  where  the  dynamic  control  of  the  electronic,  magnetic  and  transport  properties  relies  on  the  coupled  nature of  the  electronic,  spin  and  lattice  degrees  of  freedom.  In  addition,  the  length  scale  of  several  nanometers  is  similar  to  that  of  polymeric  molecular  transition  metal  complexes, which  is  another  interesting  class  of  materials  exhibiting  size-dependent  material  properties. In  this  regard,  our  study  in  transition  metal  oxide  nanocrystals  could  bridge  our  understanding  of  the  dynamic  electronic  and  magnetic  properties  of  molecules  and  bulk  crystalline  solids  both  containing  transition  metal  ions  with  partially filled  d-electrons. The  educational  component  of  the  research  focuses  on  the  curricula  development  for  the  undergraduate  physical  and  analytical  chemistry  laboratory  courses  and  the  outreach  program  for  high  school  students. The  developed  curricula  will  be  also  made  available  as  instruction  resources  for  predominantly  undergraduate  institutions.  The  experimental  program  aiming  at  high  school  students  will  be  developed  to  give  insight  into  real  research  in  the  physical  sciences  in  order  to  foster  interests  in  science and  encourage  the  talented  students  to  consider  science  as  their  career  choice.  The  developed  program  will  be  implemented  as  a  newly  added  component  in  the  university run  youth  career  program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is being jointly co-funded by the Metallic Materials and Nanostructures program in the Division of Materials Research and the Experimental Physical Chemistry program in Chemistry Division.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
