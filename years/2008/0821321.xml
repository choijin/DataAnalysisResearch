<AbstractNarration>The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a pathfinder system for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), a next-generation array of very many antennas that will be used to probe many large-scale facets of the universe. One project of the MWA is to attempt to make sensitive, low-frequency observations from its radio-quiet site in Western Australia, to search for redshifted hydrogen from near the earliest epochs of the universe. As part of the project, much will be learned about observing at low frequencies with large arrays of individual antennas. This project will fund a the acquisition of a large (500 terrabyte) archive to store much of the raw data obtained from the MWA, which can then be studied and reprocessed at later dates to refine the design of similar future instruments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "MRI: Acquisition of an Archive for the Murchison Widefield Array" has resulted in the construction and operation of a large archive at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for data acquired with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope in Western Australia.  To date, 1.2 petabytes of data have been collected.  These data are indexed and linked to data that record attributes of the MWA at the time of observation and the results of quality assessments performed on the data. Extensive software has been written for accessing, evaluating, and processing the data.  The MWA data are the result of pioneering design of a low-frequency radio array with a very large field of view.  This design is motivated by the need to be able to survey large areas of the sky quickly in order to measure faint signals from the first stars and galaxies as they formed about 400 million years after the Big Bang.  The sky at these frequencies is dominated by emission from our Galaxy and from the population of radio-loud galaxies and quasars that fill the universe. The investigations supported by this grant have revealed new images of these foreground populations.  An example of one of these images is in the figure.  Further investigations to detect the faint signals from the first stars and galaxies are under way.  The data archive is available more broadly to scientists who wish to carry out radio investigations in astrophysics and space weather.  This work has resulted in new designs of radio antenna components that make use of high-speed digital processing, design that may be useful for other applications that involve the processing of high-bandwidth and throughput radio systems.  Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars have received training in building, operating, and analyzing data from these radio systems.
