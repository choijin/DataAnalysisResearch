<AbstractNarration>Despite advances in genome technology, there is a lack of fundamental information on how DNA determines variation in traits within a species; this project specifically addresses this deficiency.  The goal of this study is to identify the genetic changes that produce beneficial variation within a species and to understand how this variation arises.  The study takes advantage of remarkable natural diversity and advances in genomic technology to finely characterize genetic variation within the genomic regions that are responsible for adaptive color-pattern differences in the wings of the Neotropical butterfly Heliconius erato.  Replicate transition zones between butterfly lineages with differently adapted color patterns allow examination of extensive naturally occurring genetic variation.  Butterfly wing patterns are an excellent system for understanding how complex structures are produced through development.  Thus, this project not only will identify the specific regions responsible for beneficial variation, but also will link this genetic variation to the networks of genes that are responsible for patterning the wing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaining a mechanistic understanding of the links between genetic change, developmental processes, and the establishment of novel variation in traits contributes to understanding the origins of biodiversity and to predicting the responses of organisms to environmental change.  The project also offers interdisciplinary training opportunities through engagement in research and exchange among labs, and includes outreach to middle school and high school teachers and students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
