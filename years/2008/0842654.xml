<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the design, synthesis, and catalytic conversion of cyclic esters derived from renewable resources into useful, sustainable polymeric materials.  An interdisciplinary approach will be taken that integrates chemical synthesis and structural definition of new monomers, catalysts, and polymers, mechanistic studies of polymerization catalysis via synergistic use of experimental and theoretical methods, and characterization of the properties of new and useful multiblock polymeric materials.  An approach aimed at uncovering important and detailed mechanistic information concerning metal alkoxide systems will also be pursued. Finally, expansion and further development of all-renewable and degradable polylactide-polymenthide-polylactide thermoplastic elastomers will be augmented with new efforts to develop these materials for specific applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professors William Tolman and Marc Hillmyer of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.  The jointly directed research efforts of Professors Tolman and Hillmyer address the challenge of transforming traditional chemical and materials processing, production, and disposal methods and contribute to sustainable technology development by providing fundamental insights into catalysis of renewable cyclic ester polymerizations.  The findings from this research will be useful to future industrial efforts to develop new and useful polymeric materials that are environmentally friendly, renewable, and biodegradable.  Through interdisciplinary student training in synthesis, polymer chemistry, and catalysis, dissemination of research findings through publications and lectures at conferences, and other activities aimed at informing the public, the research program will impact efforts to develop sustainable technologies for the benefit of society.</AbstractNarration>
