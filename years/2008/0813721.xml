<AbstractNarration>Mark Estelle, IOS 0813721, Auxin 2008: Biology of the Plant Hormone Auxin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plant hormone auxin regulates virtually every aspect of plant growth and development including many agronomically important traits such as plant stature, seed development, and fruit development and ripening.  During the last ten years, there has been dramatic and exciting progress in our understanding of auxin biology. Scientists around the globe have contributed to this rapidly developing field. In order to maintain this pace, it is essential that the members of the auxin community have opportunities to exchange and discuss their most recent results. In addition, it is very important to train the next generation of auxin biologists. The achieve these goals, the PI and his fellow organizers, have planned an international conference of scientists working on diverse aspects of auxin biology. The conference will be held on October 4th to 9th, 2008 in Marrakech Morroco. The program includes 39 speakers from 10 countries. Twenty-one percent of the speakers are women and 38% of the speakers are postdoctoral fellows or starting assistant professors. In addition, funds are available to support the attendance of graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will have broader impact in two areas. First, the active participation of graduate students and postdocs will make a significant contribution to their training. Second, the conference will promote cooperation and collaboration between scientists from the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
