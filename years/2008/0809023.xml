<AbstractNarration>The Alboran Sea was created in the wake of the young subduction zones that swept across the Western Mediterranean in the Neogene during the convergence of Africa and Europe.  The Gibraltar Arc and Alboran Sea are the westernmost part of the system and one of the most confusing.  The mixture of westward rollback, extension, strike-slip, volcanism, uplift and subsidence has defied attempts to compose a consistent scenario that explains all of the obervations.  Partly as a result of inadequate data, there are many models that have been proposed involving subduction, slab breakoff, delamination and drips.  There is credible evidence that the lithospheric mantle of the overriding plate of a west-facing subduction zone has been thinned by both back-arc stretching and some type of convective removal (e.g. drips, delamination, etc.).  The process of convective thinning is poorly understood but is believed to be important in driving uplift and subsidence of the Earth?s surface, influencing rates of deformation in active orogens, and contributing to recycling of continental materials back into the mantle.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides for a multidisciplinary, international investigation of the Alboran Sea, Gibraltar arc, Atlas Mountains and surrounding areas in the western Mediterranean using passive and active seismology, magnetotellurics, geochemistry, petrology/structural geology, and geodynamic modeling.  The overall goal of the project is to study the processes responsible for convective thinning in the Gibraltar-Alboran Sea region.  The project, known as PICASSO, has now been funded in Spain and Ireland as a colloaborative EU-US program, with proposals from a number of other EU nations submitted or in process.  The project was selected as the pilot experiment for TopoEurope, an EarthScope-like initiative recently approved by the European Science Foundation.  A large part of the field deployments will be done by European scientists, including a 3D EarthScope-type rolling array (IberArray), with additional targeted field experiments by US investigators.  The IberArray is already underway with ~60 stations deployed in the PICASSO field area.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The PICASSO project was a multi-institutional project to investigate the state and evolution of the upper mantle beneath the Alboran Sea (westernmost Mediterranean) and adjacent areas in the Betic, Rif, and Atlas mountains of Southern Spain and Morocco, and the interactions between mantle and crustal processes in this very complex area.&nbsp; The Alboran Sea is an extensional basin, with thin crust and abundant volcanic rocks, which formed by rifting at about the same time as the mountain ranges that flank it to the north, south, and west.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institutions involved in the PICASSO Project include the University of Southern California (USC), Oregon University, Rice University and several institutions in Spain and Morocco.&nbsp; The role of USC included placing an extensive array of seismometers extending across Morocco from the Mediterranean coast to the Atlas, analysis and interpretation of the seismic data in terms of crustal thickness and upper mantle structure, geodynamic modeling analysis of the patterns of flow in the upper mantle, and extensive field and analytical work on the geology of the Betic Cordillera in southern Spain.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key outcomes from this work are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>From seismic anisotropy and modeling, we were able to show that mantle flow beneath the region is deflected downwards around a slab of cold lithosphere beneath the Alboran Sea, interpreted as an inactive slab of subducted lithosphere, and is also deflected by the lithospheric root beneath the West African craton. This allows inferences on the strength of these bodies, which is important for continental dynamics. </li> <li>The crust beneath the Atlas is much thinner than is normal for a mountain range. The elevation of the mountains therefore must be supported by an anomalous mantle beneath it, and we showed that there is likely an active, hot upwelling beneath it.&nbsp; Magma for recent volcanic activity may be supplied from a mantle plume beneath the Canary islands in a conduit along a step in the Moho (the base of the crust).&nbsp; </li> <li>The crust underlying what is now the Alboran Sea (the Alboran Domain) was formed during an early period of subduction around 50 million years ago.&nbsp; This crust was subsequently stretched and thinned between about 25 and 20 million years ago by a combination of vertical shortening and ENE-directed shear at deep crustal levels parallel to the length of the orogen. The upper crust was stretched at about the same time by N-directed shear.&nbsp; These different patterns of deformation at different depths reflect the WSW motion of the Alboran Domain relative to Iberia, and the vertical thinning of the Alboran Domain in response to locally generated gravitational forces. </li> <li>A large body of mantle rocks exposed at the surface in the western Betics (Ronda peridotite) was brought to the surface during this phase of crustal thinning along a 1 km-wide shear zone, in which the overlying crustal rocks moved toward the SW to expose the underlying mantle. Temperature increased initially during this process to a maximum of 1200&deg;C, leading to partial melting in the deeper parts of the peridotite body. Deformation in the shear zone took place by plastic flow at a temperature of ~860&deg;C and a differential stress of 40 MPa. These results help us to understand how mantle rock behaves during rifting, and how it can be brought to the Earth's surface. </li> <li>About 18 million years ago the crust along the southern margin of Iberia was subducted toward the SSW to depths of 50 - 60 km beneath the Alboran Domain, and returned to the surface in less than 10 million years, moving ENE relative to the overlying crust. The subducted crust developed an inverted thermal gradient, with hotter rock at the top and cooler rock below. Return flow took place initially by a diffusional process (pressure solution) at &lt; 10 MPa differential stress, changing to crystal plasticity at higher stresses (up to 100 MPa), and was driven primarily by the bouyancy of the subducted crust. In the final stages deformation took place in a shear zone a few meters wide by a form of grain flow in ultra-fine-grained rock (grain size ~ 4 &micro;m) at stresses up to 200 MPa. These measurements are useful for analysis of the mechanics of subduction zones. </li> <li>Besides the scientific findings, the project supported the training of five PhD graduate students, three of whom are female. The project also provided partial support for five post-doctoral researchers, and international collaboration was strengthened.&nbsp; </li> <li>We took senior USC undergraduates into the field, translating research results into the classroom. Project results were disseminated widely in international scientific publications, and were incorporated in summer school programs.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/05/2016<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;P&nbsp;Platt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973138072_EA41_Platt_Fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973138072_EA41_Platt_Fig5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Active tectonics of the Alboran Region"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973138072_EA41_Platt_Fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Active tectonics of the Alboran Region"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Active tectonics of the Alboran region and the Gulf of Cadiz, showing currently active or potentially active faults by type (see key upper left).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Platt et al (2013)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;P&nbsp;Platt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Active tectonics of the Alboran Region</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973300864_N-F--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973300864_N-F--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Subduction zone"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973300864_N-F--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Subduction zone"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">New tectonic model for the Nevado-Filabride Complex, southern Spain.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Behr and Platt, 2012</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;P&nbsp;Platt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Subduction zone</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973513436_Rondaevolution--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973513436_Rondaevolution--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Evolution of the Ronda peridotite"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973513436_Rondaevolution--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Evolution of the Ronda peridotite"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tectonic evolution of the Ronda peridotite massif, southern Spain.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Johanesen and Platt (2015)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;P&nbsp;Platt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Evolution of the Ronda peridotite</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973681499_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973681499_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Alboran volcanism"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0809023/0809023_10025491_1480973681499_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Alboran volcanism"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Proposed source of volcanism beneath the Alboran Sea and atlas:  tilted plume with small scale instabilities</div> <div class="imageCredit">Meghan Miller</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">John&nbsp;P&nbsp;Platt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Alboran volcanism</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
