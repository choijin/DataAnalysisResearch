<AbstractNarration>Populations adapt genetically to their environments, so populations of the same species in different environments may be genetically distinct.  Movement of individuals between populations can challenge this adaptation by constantly reintroducing poorly-adapted genes.  This proposal will study adaptation in ducks from low and high altitudes in the Andes Mountains, where highland populations maintain distinctive hemoglobin variants despite some level of mixing with lowland populations.  Software will be developed to assess the strength of the pressure to adapt, as well as to measure the rate at which movement of individuals mixes the population gene pools.  This will help clarify the amount of mixing a population can sustain before losing its distinctive local adaptations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The software tools created for this project will be made freely available to biologists, and will be useful in applications such as studying the evolution of pesticide resistance, conservation of locally-adapted plant and animal populations, and evolution of drug resistance in pathogens.  The proposal includes funding for members of the software development team to visit and interact with software users, insuring that the software will be broadly useful.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We proposed to develop a computational method to measure the strength of natural selection on populations in different environments.  The logic is that if  two populations exchange migrants their gene pools will mix, but genes involved in adapting to the different environments will mix less freely.  Our model system is genes involved in high-altitude flight in ducks:  we hoped to measure the strength of selection on these genes by contrasting their transfer across population boundaries with the transfer of other genes.  We were only partly successful in this as the computational problem was more difficult than expected.  We produced software which gives improved estimates of migration rates as well as the ages of the populations involved, but did not succeed in estimating the strength of selection directly.  We were able to verify that altitude-adaptation genes are less often transferred between duck populations than other genes, indicating selection for local adaptations.  The software that we produced (additions to the LAMARC program) will be broadly useful to biologists studying related populations of any type of organism.  They are especially relevant to questions of local adaptation, such as salmon adapting to different rivers.  We also led several workshop sessions on the use of inference software, directed at graduate and postdoctoral students.
