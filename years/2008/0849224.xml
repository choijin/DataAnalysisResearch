<AbstractNarration>This proposal involves applications and further development of a recently&lt;br/&gt;compiled historical data set for the study of international financial crises. The data set covers 66 countries since their time of independence or dating back as far as eight centuries. It includes, among many other things, data on government domestic and foreign debt and defaults, inflation, banking crises, exchange rates, trade, government expenditures and revenues, conflict and trade. While the data set builds on the research of many previous scholars, it is considerably more extensive in many dimensions, encompassing for example, data on Asia including colonial India and pre-communist China, as well as Africa and all of Europe. One novel feature is cross county historical data on domestic debt covering most of the world going back to the early twentieth century. Previously, domestic debt data had been thought relatively small and&lt;br/&gt;unimportant for most emerging market countries until the very recent period. The authors intend to make the entire data set and documentation easily available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three goals. First, the authors wish to explore the extent to which high debt levels are the main fundamental driver of defaults, inflation, and financial crises, as opposed to factors such as the currency composition and maturity structure of debt. The hypothesis is that, in fact, the latter phenomenon are more a manifestation of vulnerability to debt crises rather than proximate drivers (as conjectured by Diamond and Rajan, 2001). The second project looks at the phenomenon of "graduation" from serial default. Why does it seem to take more than a century for most countries, and what are key factors that separate successful graduates from recidivists. The final project explores exchange rate regimes and serial default, building also on related work on exchange rate classification. A central aspect of the proposal is the maintenance, updating and improvement of data sets on financial crises and exchange rates, which are widely used by other researchers. These data sets involve not only collecting and sorting data, but training students to implement (and improve) a wide variety of sorting and classification algorithms (for example, on measuring exchange rate flexibility and developing metrics to gauge whether a country has graduated (from serial default.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The question of how to deal with international financial crises remains one of the central international macroeconomic policy challenges of recent time. The bulk of existing work is based on relatively short or narrow data sets, obscuring important longer term historical patterns. The results of this project should be of great interest to academics, policymakers at central banks and international lending institutions, as well as to private&lt;br/&gt;financial market practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research has involved building a long-dated international data base for studying financial crises that is now being widely used by other academic researchers and by policy economists.  The core data is documented in detail in our 2009 book This Time is Different, and in related academic journal papers.  The data set, together with accompanying analyses and documentation are available at  http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data, and http://www.carmenreinhart.com/this-time-is-different/  As a living database, it is expanded (both country coverage and time span) on an ongoing basis.  Events such as sovereign defaults and banking crises are comparatively rare events, so a historical and international dimension is essential to establish recurring patterns across crises types.  Our research, published as the 2008 crisis began to unfold, suggested that recessions is in the aftermath of financial crises tend to be deep and protracted, with often uneven recoveries.  We also documented that, when it comes to many of the central features of financial crises, the demarcation between advanced economies and emerging markets is not nearly as sharp as once believed.  We document historical cycles in leverage and their connection to global factors, such as commodity prices, and examine the interaction between financial and debt crises. Periods of debt overhang tend to be associated with slower growth which can last for decades. In dealing with debt overhangs (public and private, domestic or external), advanced countries have often adopted heterodox policies, including defaults, partial defaults (ie, haircuts and restructuring), higher inflation, and financial repression.
