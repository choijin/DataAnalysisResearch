<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the subject of algebraic dynamics.  Orbits of&lt;br/&gt;points under iterates of maps are among the most important objects in&lt;br/&gt;dynamics.  In the study of algebraic dynamics, the map is typically a&lt;br/&gt;polynomial or rational map in one or more variables.  It is natural to&lt;br/&gt;ask what kinds of algebraic relations infinite families of elements&lt;br/&gt;within an orbit can satisfy.  The PI conjectures that if infinitely&lt;br/&gt;many elements within an orbit satisfy an algebraic relation, then that&lt;br/&gt;relation must in some sense be stable under some iterate of the map.&lt;br/&gt;This conjecture may be thought of as a general dynamical analog of the&lt;br/&gt;well-known Mordell-Lang conjecture for group varieties.  Thus far,&lt;br/&gt;this conjecture has been proved in a few special cases using a&lt;br/&gt;combination of diophantine and p-adic analytic methods.  The main goal&lt;br/&gt;of this project is to prove the conjecture in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the interaction between algebraic maps and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic equations. An algebraic map is a function such as f(x) =&lt;br/&gt;2x+3.  Applying the map repeatedly to a single number gives what is&lt;br/&gt;called the orbit of that number under f.  For example, if f(x) = 2x+3&lt;br/&gt;and we start with the number 1, then the orbit is 1, 5, 13, 29, 61,&lt;br/&gt;and so on.  One can also form orbits out of pairs, triplets, and&lt;br/&gt;n-tuples of numbers by allowing f to be an algebraic map in more than&lt;br/&gt;one variable.  An algebraic equation is simply a more general version&lt;br/&gt;of the familiar quadratic polynomials one encounters in beginning&lt;br/&gt;algebra, except that it may have more variables and have higher degree&lt;br/&gt;terms.  One expects that if infinitely many numbers in an orbit&lt;br/&gt;satisfy some algebraic relation, then that relation has an innate&lt;br/&gt;connection with the algebraic map.  The PI states a precise conjecture&lt;br/&gt;along these lines, which he hopes to prove.  The strategy for the&lt;br/&gt;proof involves a wide range of techniques, some number theoretic, some&lt;br/&gt;geometric, and some analytic.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the interplay between dynamics and number theory.  Number theory is one of the oldest areas in mathematics, dating back to the Greeks and Egyptians, whereas dynamics is a newer field, with an emphasis on chaos and randomness, but there are many problems on the interface between the two fields.  For example, a better understanding of the number theoretic dynamics of simple polynomial maps would lead to better random number generators and perhaps to better computer security codes (ones that were more efficient and less vulnerable to attack) as well.  The research here focused specifically on dynamical analogs of some of the most important classical number theory theorems of the past half-century -- specifically the Manin-Mumford, Bogomolov, and Mordell-Lang conjectures.  While difficult to describe succinctly, these theorems treat number theoretic problems in the context of "group actions", which  may be thought of as dynamical systems that can be undone or inverted.  One example is multiplication by a nonzero number (the dynamics of this map are more subtle than one would think).   In terms of intellectual merit, progress was made on a number of fronts, both in terms of proving new results and giving counterexamples showing that other conjectures turn out to be false. This resulted in 11 papers published or accepted for publication, with four or five others in the works. As for broader impact, five graduate students were supported; three have now finished their PhD's and a fourth will defend her PhD in a few weeks.  Recently, two undergraduates have become involved with the project as well.    The work supported by this grant also sets the stage for future work combining ideas from complex analysis, number theory, geometry, and possibly computer science.  There is a great deal of interplay between the geometry and analysis of dynamics -- what might be thought of as the "infinite" or "continuous" aspect of the underlying problems -- and finite problems that relate closely to computational (and hopefully applicable) problems.
