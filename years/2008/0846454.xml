<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Nano Tip Sensor for Rapid Detection of Dissolved DNA for Environmental Monitoring&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;One of the critical challenges in environmental monitoring is the detection of dissolved DNA rapidly. Unlike chromosomal DNA in normal cells, the extracellular DNA dissolved in lakes or soil provides critical information of pathogens and toxins, which is of great interest in the field of environmental molecular biology. The current methods, however, are not able to directly detect the dissolved DNA, which causes the loss of the pathogenic information. The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate a nanostructured tip detecting dissolved DNA without amplification and labeling.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed work lies in the fundamental study about the enhancement of specific and nonspecific binding kinetics of DNA onto a nanotip using an electric field, surface chemistry, and capillary action. The electromechanical concentration mechanism in conjunction with surface chemistry eliminates cumbersome sample preparation steps and accelerates molecular binding kinetics. In addition, the nanoscale dimension of a tip renders highly sensitive electrical detection of low concentration DNA. This unique mechanism of a nanotip sensor allows for molecular manipulation in terms of physical size, surface chemistry, and electrical properties. Thus, the slight modification of the tip sensor enables rapid screening of other bacterial cells and viral particles through immunoassay or on?]tip enrichment. Therefore, the proposed work will cultivate a new era of the next generation transformative technology for environmental monitoring and disease diagnostics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Through the proposed work an unprecedented screening system can be achieved. The screening capability of a nanotip sensor can directly identify bacteria and genes, which impacts environmental monitoring and disease diagnostics. Rapid detection (e.g. 10minutes) avoids the loss of the genetic information, which will potentially reveal the paths of DNA in ecosystem. This sensor can also be applied to detect circulating DNA for disease diagnostics. Thus the proposed work directly impacts healthcare monitoring. The proposed education program will leverage the existing programs in the Mechanical Engineering (ME) Department and the Center for Nanotechnology (CNT) at University of Washington. The educational plan will benefit undergraduate, graduate, community college, minority, K?]12, and foreign students through course development, a field practice for lake water, virtual laboratory, outreach activities, and sharing plans of research and education materials.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
