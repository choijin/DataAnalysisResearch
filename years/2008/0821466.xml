<AbstractNarration>Dramatic advances have fueled widespread proclamation of the 21st Century as the ?Century of Biology? with high expectations that genome sciences will provide revolutionary findings and applications.  One key innovation to solving problems as diverse as improving agriculture and human health to preserving biodiversity is the recently developed genome sequencer.  Acquisition of this instrumentation will enable faculty, staff and student members of &gt; 30 research groups across multiple campuses to conduct transformative research.  Research foci include: the genomic basis and evolution of pathogenesis/symbiosis; adaptation to extreme environments; novel regulation of proper development; genetic basis of complex characteristics; measurement and conservation of biodiversity; forensic identity typing; and innovative computational approaches to genome science applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capabilities acquired through this award will help educate the next generation of integrative genome scientists through a number of formal activities, including undergraduate genomics laboratories.  They will prompt the creation of new versions of innovative, modular laboratories that are part of both an award-winning Professional Science Master?s program (designed to enhance economic development and national competitiveness) and interdisciplinary doctoral training.  Enhanced genomics training plays prominent roles in workshops to provide continuing education for faculty from institutions serving under-represented groups, and to recruit diverse graduate student cohorts.  The close proximity of the University?s campuses to the instrument manufacturer provides an excellent opportunity for academic-industrial collaborations and student internships.       &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
