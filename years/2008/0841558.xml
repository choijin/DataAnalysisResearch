<AbstractNarration>ATIP has reported on HPC activities for more than a decade and is well known throughout the Asian S&amp;T community. ATIP has already conducted three China HPC Workshops. The current proposal is for support for the first ATIP workshop on HPC in India. As distinct from China, India has an established reputation for software development, both as an outsourcing site as well as for indigenous software for large applications.&lt;br/&gt;The First ATIP Workshop on HPC in India will include a significant set of presentations, posters, and panels from a delegation of Indian academic, research laboratory, industry experts, and graduate students, addressing topics that include Government Plans, university Research, Infrastructure, and industrial applications. This component will include both Indian and international vendors to get their perspectives on the status of computing in India. Another important component will be a panel in which panelists and the audience identify topics that are suitable for collaborative (US-India) research and the mechanisms for developing those collaborations. A key aspect of the proposed Workshop will be the unique opportunity for members of the US research community to interact and have direct discussions with top Indian scientists who will travel to the US to participate. A specific goal of the Workshop is to motivate the preparation of joint research proposals with researchers from both US and India.&lt;br/&gt;This activity is jointly funded by CISE/CCF and the Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
