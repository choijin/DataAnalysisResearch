    <AbstractNarration>Heil&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0806532&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Four main directions are selected for advancement in this&lt;br/&gt;project:&lt;br/&gt;(a) Time-frequency independence conjectures and related topics;&lt;br/&gt;(b) Quantification of localization for nonabelian coherent state&lt;br/&gt; frames;&lt;br/&gt;(c) Applications to affine pseudodifferential operators&lt;br/&gt; (broadband time-varying filters);&lt;br/&gt;(d) Multiwavelet development of the shearlet transform and&lt;br/&gt; construction of compactly supported shearlets.&lt;br/&gt;Each of these interrelating topics contains deep mathematical&lt;br/&gt;questions directly related to fundamental issues in redundant&lt;br/&gt;representation and transformation of signals. Each topic reaches&lt;br/&gt;into a broad range of areas in mathematical analysis, and&lt;br/&gt;progress requires a synthesis of different ideas from both&lt;br/&gt;abstract analysis and applied harmonic analysis, including&lt;br/&gt;pseudodifferential operator theory, noncommutative Banach&lt;br/&gt;algebras, and new forms of multiresolution analysis suitable for&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional and higher signal processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The problems addressed in this project concern fundamental&lt;br/&gt;questions regarding the basic mathematical tools that underlie&lt;br/&gt;modern signal processing, including such applications as wireless&lt;br/&gt;communications, radar, seismic sensing, and image processing. &lt;br/&gt;Progress on these topics yields applicable mathematics with&lt;br/&gt;potential impact for real-world scientific and engineering&lt;br/&gt;programs. All aspects of this work are intimately tied with&lt;br/&gt;educational endeavors, both at the graduate and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;levels. Students of the investigator cooperate directly in this&lt;br/&gt;research, receiving a breadth and depth of knowledge and&lt;br/&gt;experience that will foster a continued commitment to&lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary interactions among mathematics, physics, and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. Topics related to this project and progress on the&lt;br/&gt;problems of the project are incorporated into courses and&lt;br/&gt;seminars directed by the investigator. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;continues his strong record of producing graduate students,&lt;br/&gt;working with undergraduates, mentoring postdocs, producing Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;students from underrepresented groups, and encouraging&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups to pursue research.</AbstractNarration>
