<AbstractNarration>This project will examine neural circuits that make up a unique region of the insect brain called the central complex. This large midline brain region is made up of several subunits that each has a columnar anatomy. The repeating units that make up these columns provide a unique opportunity for understanding the underlying neural circuitry. They appear to be involved in processing large amounts of sensory information, then using it to influence movement. A range of electrophysiological techniques will be used to examine how central complex circuits process mechanical information arising from antennal stimulation as well as visual cues. In conjunction with behavioral techniques, central complex processing will be related to actual movements. The results are critical to the understanding of how brain systems influence more immediate local reflex circuits that directly control leg movements in walking, turning and climbing which in insects are found in thoracic ganglia. They will complement recent advances in motor control stemming from neurogenetic techniques from several other laboratories. Indeed, because similar interactions between higher brain systems and local reflexes exist in virtually all legged animals, including vertebrates, the results will have wide ranging neurobiological impact. Moreover, the PI has a long-term commitment to bringing knowledge of biological systems to the design of legged robots. As such, the project should also lead to more advanced robots that can move autonomously through tortuous terrain with less direction from a driver. The project will continue a successful record of training both graduate and undergraduate students. Students will have the opportunity to work directly with senior laboratory personnel on the project and a larger number of students will take part in a novel capstone course that brings together undergraduate biologists and engineers on semester-long projects related to this research.</AbstractNarration>
