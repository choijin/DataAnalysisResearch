<AbstractNarration>Seogjoo Jang of the City University of New York Queens College is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research on the development of computational methods for energy flow dynamics in soft optoelectronic molecular systems. The research focuses on three factors:  (1) electronic quantum coherence involving multiple excited states or sites; (2) coupling of electronic excitation to nuclear vibrational dynamics; and (3) disorder and stochastic fluctuations in the structure or energetics of molecules.  For certain conjugated oligomer systems, coarse-grained models are being constructed in order to study energy flow dynamics and to model spectroscopic signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is having a broader impact through the development of methods that may lead to new optical, electronic and sensor devices.  It is having a further impact on students at the graduate, undergraduate and high school level in the New York metropolitan area through workshops and seminar series that Jang is developing in conjunction with his research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Prime examples of soft optoelectronic molecular system are natural photosynthetic complexes. These exhibit near perfect efficiency and fidelity in energy transfer capability that no synthetic soft molecular system has been able to mimic yet.  Nature appears to exploit the softness of constituting molecules, substantial freedom in the dynamics and structure, in a highly positive manner, but clear understanding of the underlying physical principles and molecular-level mechanisms are still largely unknown.  Resolving this issue requires concerted effort to develop new theories of energy transfer and to perform accurate quantitative computational modeling.    The PI's research project funded by this grant has made significant and unique contribution to scientific advances in addressing the issues above. This was achieved (i) by developing a series of new energy transfer theories that can provide practicable and reasonably accurate means to describe quantum dynamical effects and the disorder in complex energy transfer processes, and (ii) by detailed computational modeling of energy transfer dynamics in organic molecular systems, well known model systems, and photosynthetic light harvesting complexes.   In particular, recent computational modeling of energy transfer dynamics in light harvesting complexes of purple bacteria called LH2 helped identifying an important molecular level design principle for efficient and tunable energy transfer capability.     The synergism between theory development and computational modeling helped establishing theories that can describe essential characteristics of real systems and well founded theoretical explanations of complex experimental data on photosynthetic systems and organic molecular systems.  These demonstrated that  quantum coherence and delocalization, when utilized properly, can balance negative effects of the disorder, thermal fluctuations, and energy loss mechanisms to create efficient and robust energy transfer processes. The research project has also resulted in new theoretical and computational tools that can help experimentalists designing novel soft optoelectronic devices.      The PI's consistent efforts to organize workshops and conferences helped energizing theoretical and computational chemistry research in the New York metro region.   The PI has also made extensive outreach efforts to promote science education of local Korean-American community.       Last Modified: 01/27/2015       Submitted by: Seogjoo Jang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
