<AbstractNarration>Investigators propose to establish a linear-free-energy relation (LFER) to predict rates of ligand substitution on Fe(III)-oxide minerals from the &lt;FeIII-OH2&gt; bond lengths, which can either be calculated or measured. In the last funding period we showed experimentally that such a LFER probably exists between &lt;FeIII-OH2&gt; bond lengths and rates of solvent exchanges.  They also used similar data on nanometer-size Al(III) ions to establish a LFER for aluminous surface structures. They coupled 'rare event' simulation methods to experimental &lt;br/&gt;data on rates of water-exchanges from Al(III) metals in large nanometersize clusters. This work showed, for the first time, that the rates at the surfaces are extraordinarily and surprisingly rapid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigators now want to extend the work to Fe(III) (hydr)oxide materials. They use aqueous complexes with particularly useful &lt;FeIII-OH2&gt; bond lengths and aqueous stabilities to establish an experimental scale of rates and bond lengths. In the last funding period, they mastered a 17O-NMR line-broadening method for paramagnetic metals like Fe(III). This method is new to geochemistry, but otherwise well understood and dependable. Once the experimental scale is established, they repeat their 'rare-event' simulations to estimate rates for Fe(III)-(hydr)oxide surface structures that are experimentally inaccessible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For bridging oxygens, and to complement the 17O-NMR measurements, they employ a new ElectroSpray-Ionization Mass-Spectrometry (ESI-MS) method that allows to follow the rates of oxygen-isotope exchanges in the dissolved molecules. With ESI-MS, we follow reactions at oxo bridges and the carboxylate oxygens in a bonded organic ligand. With this method, geochemists can study an enormous range of compounds that were previously impossible, such as the Mn(IV,III)-oxo clusters. In this sense, and in others, this research is both pioneering and transformative to geochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is also Transformative because water-exchange rates are the most fundamental timescale for describing aqueous reactions---slow loss of these bound waters precedes most ligand substitutions ('adsorptions') and many electron exchanges. In soils, these reactions are usually part of a complex network, but these elementary reactions control the essential step. This research is Transformative because reactions are also at the appropriate scale to improve methods of simulation, which will be heavily employed by geochemists for cases where experiments are impossible. They are trying to make aqueous geochemistry quantitative at the molecule scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit is fundamental research in aqueous reactivity where they answer questions such as: 'What are the most promising types of computationally inexpensive methods that can yield hidden reaction pathways in systems that are sufficiently large to be geochemically relevant?' The research also ties to the increased awareness about nanometer-size clusters in natural water chemistry, in transporting toxicants or as toxicants themselves, and as the fundamental building block for amorphous materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts extend well beyond Earth science because this research is used by many disciplines, including colloid chemistry, nanoscience, materials science and medicine (metalloproteins such as ferritin and enzymes such as the purple-acid phosphatases resemble these clusters). Also, enrollment at UCD draws disproportionately from the high population of new immigrants to the United States and lures them into Chemistry and Geochemistry. These funds bring nontraditional but highly talented students into the Earth Sciences, which comprise the population of UCD.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to identify how simple reactions affect oxide materials in water and whether these reaction pathways match to the results of computer simulation.  The oxide materials are small nanometer-size ions made up of several dozen to several hundreds of atoms, but for which the structure and stability is known with complete confidence.  Although the award was focused on iron-oxide clusters, we also conducted experiments and simulations on a wider range of other materials, including materials that are used for energy production.  During research on the iron clusters, the world of science because excited about the discovery of inexpensive electrocatalysts that could be used to store energy in electrolyzed water.  We expanded the scope of the research to incorporate these new materials and showed that they are probably very similar to common Earth materials or minerals.  Only minerals can take repeated abuse in water; thus fancy molecular catalysts convert to these more robust and familiar structures with time under a load.  We had great success in identifying general rules for understanding oxygen-isotope-exchange pathways in these clusters and in minerals.  This work was published in the most prestigious journal Nature Materials because it speaks to an enormous range of materials, including catalysts, minerals and glasses.  Briefly, my coauthor and I discovered that there exist low-erergy forms of a structure at the interface of an oxide material and water.  These alternative metastable forms have several features in common--(1) The first step is partial detachment of a surface metal from an underlying highly coordinated oxygen; (2) The detachment creates a temporarily undercoordinated metal that can add an isotopically distinct water, or hydroxide ion, or hydronium ion to its coordination sphere; (3) Protons move from the added moiety to more basic oxygens in the structure (4)The oxygens in this partly detached structure shuffle; (4) The metastable form collapses back into its stable starting configuration.  This model explains many observations about how oxide materials corrode in water: (1) The reaction is naturally amphoteric because the oxide lattice accepts and donates protons; (2) All atoms near the site of exchange are involved; (3) Counterions play a clear role as stabilizing the charge-separating metastable state; and (4) The number of 'stuffed' metastable states depends on the symmetry of the starting configuration--for a structure with high symmetry (e.g., Td) only a few states are accessible.  For a low-symmetry starting configuration (e.g., D2d) there are dozens of metastable stuctures accessible.  These new ideas are revolutionary because it eliminates geochemist's unhealthy dependence on untestable transition-state models to explain the isotope-exchange reactions and dissolution of minerals.  We now explain a wide variety of observations with a single simple chemistry.  It furthermore shows the limits of simulation of these types of reactions---unless one knows the starting structure in fastidious detail, it is pointless to speculate about the reaction pathways.  Even for structures with 40 atoms, the detailed pathways are impossible to intuit.  Guessing is worse than worthless----it is misleading.
