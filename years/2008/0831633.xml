<AbstractNarration>To counter the inefficiencies of the current spectrum usage, regulatory bodies, all over the world, are exploring ways to deregulate the spectrum market by allowing flexible dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in a broad range of spatio-temporal scale. Recent advances in radio technology have given an impetus to this trend. For DSA to fulfill its promise of economic and societal impact, wireless services based on DSA must be commercially successful, and a tangible spectrum market must evolve that can be supported by technology. This research project will build a realistic DSA architecture for cellular networks supported by appropriate market mechanisms in an integrated fashion that is both technically and economically viable and efficient. This is a truly trans-disciplinary approach spanning the fields of wireless networking and systems, algorithmics, economics, simulation and modeling, which leads to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the spectrum market by (i) realistic modeling of various market entities (i.e., buyers, sellers, and the market mechanisms), (ii) dynamic spectrum demands and bids based on innovative and realistic population dynamics models, and (iii) new and robust market clearing mechanisms with provable performance guarantees. The results will be validated using large-scale simulations, and experiments on a prototype test bed with reconfigurable radio hardware. In addition to fostering new topics in trans-disciplinary education, this project will offer insights into market driven spectrum sharing, provide useful tools for policymakers, and ultimately guide spectrum policy decisions in DSA technology. This will, in turn, open up new business opportunities in the use of wireless spectrum.</AbstractNarration>
