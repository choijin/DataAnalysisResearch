<AbstractNarration>This research will address the question of whether integration and reflection activities via developing a professional portfolio have an impact on students? lifelong learning competencies, their development of professional identity, and the ability to integrate their knowledge. It will advance the scholarship on undergraduate engineering student learning using a three-pronged quasi-experiment in portfolio development. The three experimental treatments are: (1) an academic year-long program in which students develop a comprehensive professional portfolio, (2) a quarter-long program in which students develop a focused professional portfolio, and (3) a competition that invites students to develop professional portfolios on their own and submit them for consideration for an award. These treatments require different levels of commitment from students who participate in them, as well as institutions that host them. In addition to investigating the impact of these three treatments, the resources associated with offering each treatment will be documented in order to better understand the scalability of each. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To effectively prepare for engineering in the 21st century, students must acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes relevant to engineering; the type of integrated understanding of these competencies that is a hallmark of expertise; and the life-long learning skills and professional engineering identity that enable students to apply their understandings in rapidly changing contexts and circumstances. Engineering education researchers are only beginning to understand how to effectively and feasibly support the development of life-long learning skills, professional engineering identities, and integrated knowledge. In order to accomplish these complex and interrelated goals, students need a variety of learning experiences. They also need opportunities to understand and articulate what they have learned from their educational experiences and how what they have learned relates to their futures as engineers?opportunities for both foundational and critical reflection. This project has the potential to transform undergraduate engineering education, not by changing the curriculum of existing programs, but by enabling engineering students to achieve the outcomes espoused by those programs and to develop into lifelong learners. If successful, the ideas proposed in this project will be scalable to fit the needs of almost any college of engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   What happens when students constructed preparedness portfolios:  Synthesizing research on this pedagogical activity   Interest in the pedagogical value of portfolios (I.e., what students can learn through the process of constructing a portfolio) has led to much scholarship of discovery--research studies that seek to understand precisely how students benefit.  Integration of these studies (i.e., scholarship of integration) would be helpful: educators could use the results of the synthesis to inform their decisions about how to use portfolios pedagogically and researchers could use the results to identify appropriate future studies.  However, it is challenging to integrate such studies due to obvious variations related to the research, and underlying variations in how portfolios are used pedagogically.   A key part of our recent has been an effort to integrate research on one pedagogical use of portfolios&mdash;preparedness portfolios.  The research question organizing the effort has been: What are ways in which students benefit from constructing preparedness portfolios?    To address this question, we followed a three step approach.  First, we identified a set of studies to include in the integration and identified the main knowledge claims from each study.  Second, we developed a framework for organizing the knowledge claims resulting from step 1.  This step involved exploring frameworks from the literature, staying sensitive to the range of knowledge claims identified in step 1, and aiming for parsimony.  Finally, we mapped the knowledge claims from step 1 into the framework resulting from step 2, and then used the mapping in order to answer our research question.  In terms of results, we mapped 22 knowledge claims from four studies into a framework featuring three domains of learning.   We found many of the claims to be related to identity, several claims related to prepared for future learning, and only a few claims related to accountable disciplinary knowledge.    Our synthesis suggests that student construction of preparedness portfolios represents a robust pedagogical approach that benefits students in many ways.  Future scholarship of discovery efforts could explore connections between construction of preparedness portfolios and student development of accountable disciplinary knowledge since the research was thin in this area.  Future scholarship of integration efforts could broaden the synthesis to include more studies, and grapple with how to extend the integration into other pedagogical uses of portfolios. Finally, the framework used here to integrate across portfolio research  may be useful for integrating research about reflection activities other than portfolios.
