    <AbstractNarration>Characteristics of species can influence their exposure to environmental contaminants which, in turn, can impact their immune function and susceptibility to infectious diseases. This study will examine two temperate bat species, Eptesicus fuscus and Myotis lucifugus, which differ in diet and foraging habitat, and compare them with respect to mercury tissue concentration, stable isotope concentration, immune function, and stress physiology. Comparisons also will be made between sites with different mercury concentrations. Results should contribute to a better understanding of the effects of mercury on mammalian health, and determine whether mercury is an important factor affecting the health and conservation status of bat species. Bats may be particularly useful indicator species for assessing mercury contamination because of their relatively long life spans, high metabolic rates, wide geographic ranges, and trophic status. If mercury causes a decrease in immune function, it may also increase susceptibility to infection by pathogens such as rabies. Broader impacts of this project include training of a doctoral student and a likely increase in understanding of ecological and environmental influences affecting emerging infectious diseases in bats and humans alike.</AbstractNarration>
