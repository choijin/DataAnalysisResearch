<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will investigate methodologies required to scale and disseminate an online performance-based assessment system for quantifying the scientific problem solving skills of middle school students. This Phase II research will be based on the Phase I results which identified the technical, logistical and professional development challenges that influence the rapid calculation, aggregation and real-time, online, reporting of problem solving assessment data to diverse educational stakeholders. The research will first design and implement an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) model for data analysis and reporting and incorporate these designs into a system scale-up plan to flexibly accommodate the 10-20 fold increase in users indicated by our commercialization plan. A central component of this development will be a data warehouse that will be instrumented allowing the analysis of how teachers access the performance data, which will be linked to a digital dashboard which will provide teachers with an easy, and highly visual access to multi-dimensional assessments of their students and comparison classrooms. Additionally, this information will be used to develop new forms of professional development to support teachers in the better use of the data available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this extensible formative, summative and programmatic assessment system of learning will have broad relevance for helping teachers to teach, students to learn, and administrators to make informed data-driven decisions through the continual, and real-time formative evaluation of a student's problem solving progress, a dimension not frequently or rigorously assessed in today's classrooms, yet a critical component of 21st century skills. The outcomes of this project should have widespread utility at all levels of science education and should allow cumulative comparisons of problem solving across science domains, classrooms, teachers and school systems thus helping to re-think the ways scientific problem solving is systemically assessed and how the impact of teaching these skills becomes quantified.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ideas of being æin the grooveÆ or æout of synchÆ are widespread in teams.  That a team can be in the groove one moment and out of synch another highlights the dynamic processes of teamwork.   Experienced trainers team leaders,  and even casual observers can recognize a team in synch &hellip;.. but few can predict if or when it will be lost, or maybe more importantly, how it can be regained.    But what if you could?  How would this influence how teams are assembled, supported, trained and evaluated?    Decades of teamwork research has provided a framework for understanding how teams function.  Yet there is an increasing sense that new methodologies are needed that go beyond traditional approaches by addressing neurologically-based aspects of behavior and learning.    Neurophysiologic cognitive signatures can improve teamwork by predicting team breakdowns and suggesting routes to regain synchrony.  Unlike prior developments, neurophysiologic synchronies focus on internalized aspects of teamwork: are all team members engaged and working?  Are some team members overworked or stressed? Is there group consensus on their direction and decisions?  Can such predictions be made?    Yes.  The Learning Chameleon, Inc. and our strategic partner Advanced Brain Monitoring, Inc. have developed award-winning and patent-pending neurophysiologic systems and models that:  Capture and analyze team neurophysiologic synchronies in real-world situations and near real-time; Are sensitive to both short (seconds) and long (minutes) term task changes; Allow comparisons across future teams and training session; and, Can distinguish levels of expertise.   Our approach is one that can be effectively applied to novel and continually changing situations and will add objective and quantitative information that can be used to evaluate the interactions of individuals and teams in the increasingly technology-rich environments of contemporary teaming operations. The proposed integration of neurophysiologic metrics into training activities could begin to personalize team activities by real-time highlighting of specific topics / situations that a team is struggling with.
