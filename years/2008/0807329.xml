<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;FODAVA-Partner: Visualizing Audio for Anomaly Detection&lt;br/&gt;Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, Thomas Huang and Camille Goudeseune&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to transform large audio corpora into a form suitable for visualization.  Specifically, this proposal addresses the type of audio anomalies that human data analysts hear instantly: angry shouting, trucks at midnight on a residential street, gunshots.  The human ear detects anomalies of this type rapidly and with high accuracy.  Unfortunately, a data analyst can listen to only one sound at a time.  Visualization shows the analyst many sounds at once, possibly allowing him or her to detect an anomaly several orders of magnitude faster than ?real time.?  This proposal aims to render large audio data sets, comprising thousands of microphones or thousands of minutes, in the form of interactive graphics that reveal important anomalies at a glance.  Data transformations will include signal processing, statistical modeling, and visualization.  Signal processing will seek to characterize all of the ways in which the difference between two audio signals may be ?important,? including, for example, spectral differences, rhythmic differences, and differences in the impression made on the auditory cortex of a human listener.    Statistical modeling will seek to characterize the range of audio events that are ?normal? or easily explicable, so that we may precisely measure the degree to which a potential anomaly is abnormal or inexplicable.  Visualization methods will render measures of abnormality, and information about the signal characteristics of each anomaly, in a form suitable for rapid browsing.  Two testbeds are proposed.  The ?multi-day audio timeline? will be a portable application, visually similar to a nonlinear audio editing suite, which will allow the analyst to rapidly zoom in on potentially anomalous periods of time.  The ?milliphone? will be a three-dimensional visualization tool for command and control centers.  Audio recordings from one thousand security microphones scattered throughout a city or a large industrial site will be rendered in the form of brightly colored visible threads reaching skyward from a map of the secure region.  The analyst will be able to listen to the audio recorded on any microphone by touching its thread; by touching the thread at different heights, the analyst will be able to audit different periods of time.  The brightness, color, and thickness of each thread will display the abnormality and signal characteristics of the audio signal at each point in time.  Data transformation research will map related types of abnormality to related color/brightness codes, so that important anomalies, and anomalies confirmed by multiple microphones, are immediately visible to the trained data analyst.&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks broad impact in the area of security analysis.  Video cameras are routinely used for security monitoring of industrial sites, government installations, day care centers, and nursing homes.  Data analysts and guards routinely browse the video recorded by up to twenty surveillance cameras simultaneously, fast-forwarding through uninteresting periods of time.  Microphones would be used in the same applications, if they were useful; but there is at present no way for a data analyst to rapidly and accurately audit the signals from many different microphones.  The proposed techniques will give guards and data analysts new data transformation and visualization techniques that will help them to rapidly identify dangerous situations signaled by inexplicable but anomalous audio signals.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Elementary school children have short attention spans.  In a paper published in the APSIPA 2011 conference, we describe three multimodal speech and audio user interfaces that captured and held the attention of a few dozen elementary-school and high-school children during the course of a two-day university open house.  One of the displays described in that paper, the "Audio Easter Egg Hunt," demonstrated our timeliner multimedia analytics platform with a faster-than-real-time search through orchestral music for audio anomalies (cuckoo clocks, motorcycles, etc).  Results of the open house experience suggest that competition, collaboration, and other forms of social interaction may motivate children more than prizes.  The Beckman Institute Open House is a biennial outreach event at the University of Illinois, held in conjunction with the annual College of Engineering Open House, at which laboratories demonstrate their research in a style that is educational and entertaining for children and adults from the surrounding community.  The Engineering Open House is more than a century old; the first Department of Physics Open House in 1906 was followed by an Electrical Engineering Open House in 1907, which attracted more than 1600 visitors (much to the surprise of its organizers).  The open house is usually held on a Friday and Saturday. Visitors on Friday are usually elementary school classes;  visitors on Saturday are usually families.  The open house aims to generate excitement and to encourage children to pursue careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  The goal of our demonstration systems was to educate children and to generate excitement specifically about the science, technology, engineering and mathematics of speech, audio, language and learning information environments.  Timeliner was demonstrated at the 2011 Beckman open house in the form of an Audio Easter Egg Hunt.  Visitors were each given 80 seconds to find anomalous sounds in 100 minutes of classical music (orchestral, without singing).  ``Anomalies'' were obviously anomalous when one heard them, e.g., anomalies included a cow mooing, a cuckoo clock and two types of birdcalls, a motorcycle, a ``Pac-Man'' video game character, and several types of spaceships and ray guns.  The challenge was to find the anomalies entirely from the visual display(which is very fast), rather than listening to the audio in real time (which is very slow).  Most visitors were 8 to 12 years old, and had no prior experience with spectrograms at all, let alone with our particular implementation thereof.  One 6-year old visitor was notable because, despite her age, she was able to find anomalies at a rate of more than 7 times faster than real time.  More than half the visitors were female.  Throughout the two days, we posted scores on a scoreboard visible to visitors. This seemed to provoke new visitors to try to do well in the game, as it gave them a benchmark by which to compare their performance to others.  Later, controlled experiments in the lab tested the accuracy (F score) with which human subjects were able to detect anomalous events in a long meeting recording.  Participants were highly precise at this task, thus F-score was primarily determined by recall (the percentage of available events a subject was able to locate).  The proposed saliency-enhanced spectrogram display doubled the speed with which participants were able to locate anomalous events, thus doubling their recall rate and their accuracy (from about 30% F-score to about 70% F-score).  The Milliphone testbed runs in the Beckman Cube, a 6-sided virtual reality theatre.  It extends Timeliner's anomaly-finding task from one audio recording to multiple, simultaneous, geotagged recordings. The name is a pun on a thousand microphones, because it displays a thousand recordings with neither slowdown nor self-occlusion of data.  In our pilot study we hoped to compare Milliphone to Audacity as a baseli...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
