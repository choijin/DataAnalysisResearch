<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Belmont University establishes the Pathways to Science, Technology and Mathematics (Pathways) project which provides four-year scholarships of up to $10,000 for 20 students over the funding period.  It leverages extant long-term academic outreach programs with school districts across Middle Tennessee, a rich history of engaging students in undergraduate research, and a commitment of technology related businesses and organizations in the region to partner with local academic institutions, to accomplish the Pathways project objectives which include: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Increasing the number and quality of students majoring in Physics, Mathematics, Professional Chemistry, Computer Science, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Environmental Science, and Neuroscience, with an emphasis on recruiting women, minorities, first-generation college students, and students who are economically disadvantaged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strengthening the retention of these Pathways Scholars through an early introduction to collaborative research experiences, an array of academic support services, and the development of meaningful experiences between these cohorts of students and the science community internal (students and faculty) and external (regional conferences, internships, and speakers series) to the university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providing knowledge of various opportunities for careers and graduate studies in science and technology, and providing resources and connections that will lead to the success of participating students as they explore these pathways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enriching the relationships with high schools and industry across Middle Tennessee that will sustain the growth in the STEM disciplines beyond the scope of the funding of the present project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
