<AbstractNarration>Microbes living in the plant rhizosphere, the soil in direct contact with a plant's roots, influence nutrient cycling and availability, the plant's susceptibility to disease, and plant growth. Plant roots, in turn, provide resources that support the microbial community, and produce signals that affect plant-microbial interactions. Currently, little is known about the genes and biochemical pathways in plants that influence the development of specific rhizosphere communities, nor the impact that these communities have on the growth, reproduction and competitive ability of plants. Using Arabidopsis thaliana and an important domesticated species, lettuce, and its wild, weedy progenitor (Lactuca serriola), the investigators will identify key genes in plants that affect the microbial communities in the rhizosphere. Specifically, the project will: 1) characterize the composition, successional patterns and robustness of the microbial communities that establish in the rhizosphere of specific plant genotypes; 2) identify quantitative trait loci and candidate genes in the plants that control the differences in microbial populations associated with roots; 3) examine the impact of these plant-microbe interactions on growth and the competitive abilities of plants. This project will cement a multi-investigator research initiative that will enhance student training and engage faculty in multidisciplinary research and teaching.  University of Massachusetts, Boston has a high proportion of low income, under-represented minority and first generation college students, and the investigators are dedicated to their training. Research initiatives developed in this project will be integrated into several active training programs aimed at community college students, secondary school teacher training and enhanced undergraduate research experiences.  Project results will advance the understanding of how plant-microbe interactions alter the soil quality and growing conditions of plants, and demonstrate the relevance of rhizosphere ecology to a broad cluster of applied disciplines, from sustainable agriculture to restoration ecology and management of invasive species.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The term rhizosphere was used by Lorenz Hiltner (1904) to describe the zone of soil and community of microorganisms influenced by the roots of plants.  These microorganisms show increased density and metabolic activity over surrounding areas and this effect is largely attributed to plant derived compounds released from growing root systems.  Despite more than one hundred years of research, a full understanding of the genetic bases underlying the structuring of rhizosphere communities from the plant perspective and the ecological impact of these interactions has remained elusive.   A key challenge has been in associating the observed variation in microbial community structure with the genetic variation among host plants.  In this project we developed a unique strategy to identify the specific genes in the plant that influence the rhizospere communities in the soil.  This strategy did not require any predetermined knowledge about the nature or function of the genes; the controlling genes could produce plant exudates, transport products, regulate pathways, alter root morphology (Figure 1), bestow resistance to disease or have any of dozens of other possible functions.  We used Arabidopsis, a commonly used model plant species, and lettuce, an important agronomic crop species, to validate this approach, to identify the specific genomic regions in these plants that influence the rhizosphere and to determine whether the genes in these regions provide adaptive advantages for the plant.     The approach has proven to be successful as we have identified genomic regions both in lettuce and in Arabidopsis that have significant influence over both dominant and minor bacterial taxa inhabiting the microbial community.   Moreover, the analyses of these regions of the genome appear, as predicted, to have genes that function in different ways to influence the microbial communities in the soil.  Some of the identified regions contain multigene families of disease resistant genes, while others seem to affect gross morphology, root mass or structure, or life history transition stages of the plant.  Finally, in addition to identifying the genomic regions in the plants, we have quantified the effect of the microbial communities on plant growth.   Our studies have confirmed that the microbial communities in the soil largely inhibit the growth and development of the associated plant.  We have, however, found significant variation among species and genotypes of plants in this negative feedback which leads to prospects for breeding domesticated cultivars which resist the inhibitory influences of the soil microbial communities, and for improving agricultural practices.     While we have not yet identified the precise genes that directly affect the species of the microbial communities, we have shown the effects of the genomic regions and have narrowed these to the point that tools for molecular plant breeding could be used to transfer these regions into domesticated lines to improve crop growth.   The multidisciplinary approach of this project has helped to train many students in diverse fields of biology.  The initial stages of this work required understanding of plant genetics, and physiology, as well as microbiology and molecular biology.  Most recently the project has required extensive bioinformatics training.  All students have worked with multiple PIs and in multiple disciplines.
