<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to support the U.S. contribution to a collaborative program with Norwegian investigators to sample the extinct Aegir Ridge, followed by onshore geochemical analyses and geodynamic modeling. Norwegian co-PIs have extensive experience in geophysical field work and geologic sampling in this region and will provide ~10 days of ship time as well as the necessary equipment to dredge the exposed scarps of the Aegir ridge axis.  Major- and trace-elements studies, as well as isotope (Pb, Nd, Hf, Sr) analyses will be performed and 3D numerical models of continental rift-hotspot interaction will be developed which will define the physical conditions needed to explain the data, including quantitatively testing of the possible geologic scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides training for students and promotes international collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Iceland-Faeroes volcanic ridge is surrounded by extensive volcanism on the European and Greenland margins. The magma-starved basin formed by the extinct Aegir Ridge (active from ~53-25 Ma) appears as a major gap or "hole" in the North Atlantic large igneous province, created by the Iceland hotspot. The enigma of such weak or non-existent hotspot influenced volcanism during a time of extensive volcanic eruption, associated with the Iceland Plume and itÃ†s interaction with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, provides a unique opportunity to learn about problems related to dynamics of hotspot-rift interaction, the composition of plume-like mantle upwellings, and the concomitant geochemical evolution of ambient upper mantle mid-ocean ridge basalt source.
