<AbstractNarration>CBET-0829020&lt;br/&gt;Castillo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to perform numerical simulations of complex flows subject to adverse pressure gradient with eventual separation to better understand how the turbulent flows develop over smooth/rough surfaces at different Reynolds numbers. The PIs plan the integration of theoretical, experimental and computational Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Navier-Stokes (DNS) computations to increase the understanding of pressure gradient flows. The main objective is to demonstrate the suitability of LES/DNS methods to strong adverse pressure gradient (APG) flows with eventual separation by using the multi-scale similarity method. If successful, this will be the first time that the LES technique works on APG flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. Validation of the numerical solution will be confirmed with the smooth and rough surface experiments carried out by means of LDA. The PI's multi-scale similarity method is an improvement because it uses different scales for the inner and outer flow. For the first time the rescaling method developed by Lund et al. (1998) for zero pressure gradient flows works on APG, although the single scaling approach fails. The PIs seek to developed analytical tools to calculate the skin friction law and a separation criterion for rough boundary layers. This research will be catalyzed by the Rensselaer's Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations, a 70 TFLOP supercomputer, to carry out one of the most extensive simulations available for the turbulence community. Experiments will be carried out at the new Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Facility equipped with unique optical instrumentation and low turbulence intensity (less than 0.1%). The research proposed herein has been designed for two students from underrepresented groups to dedicate full time to this project. Some additional outreach activities for students in the proposed project will include engaging research experiences for undergraduate students, providing one-to-one mentoring for the participant postdoctoral fellow and undergraduate students, and having summer workshops on multi-scales, data analysis and parallel computing for participating students. The project will interface and use the existing Alliances for Graduate Education in the Professoriate (AGEP) infrastructure and know-how at RPI. For example, seminars and summer workshops will be recorded and uploaded on a website. This will facilitate dissemination and student recruitment. This award is also funded at the Office of Naval Research (R. Joslin PD).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this investigation, the moderate Reynolds number, zero-pressure-gradient, turbulent boundary layer is investigated from a computational perspective in light of the effect of surface roughness.  The range of Reynolds numbers (based on momentum thickness) achieved varied from Re  = 2000 to 2400 and the surface roughness (sandpaper type) was modeled with a roughness parameter of k+  = 11 to match experiments at similar conditions in the transitionally rough regime.  Intellectual Merit:  The major advantages of the present multi-scale similarity over the traditional approach are summarized: (i) Unlike the traditional approach, where scales are dictated by single scaling (i.e., u  ), the present method uses different scales for the inner and outer flows (i.e., spatial, temporal, velocity, etc.). (ii) To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a DNS of a turbulent boundary layer subjected to a true rough surface topography has been performed not only for the velocity field, but also for the temperature field.  Broader Impacts: (i) The methodology presented in this report enable us to reduce the computational resources otherwise required to simulate the transition from laminar to turbulence, and focus these resources on simulating higher Reynolds numbers in the presence of other external conditions such as thermal fields and surface roughness. (ii) The multi-scale dynamic approach implemented for the current simulation allows the accurate representation of a multi-layered boundary layer structure while dynamically computing the necessary flow parameters at the inflow based on the solution downstream. In this way, empirical correlations are not needed. (iii) The experimental data from several researchers is collected and analyzed here to study the validity and accuracy of the present ground-breaking simulations.  Moreover, the simulations of the thermal field show an increase in the outer region of all quantities (mean temperature, temperature fluctuations, and turbulent heat fluxes). Computation of the Stanton number shows an increase over the entire range of Re . The &lt; u't&prime; &gt;  heat flux component shows evidence of a second peak in the outer region, which is not seen for the smooth surface case.
