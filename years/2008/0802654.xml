    <AbstractNarration>SES-0802654&lt;br/&gt;Harvey Molotch&lt;br/&gt;Jane Jones&lt;br/&gt;New York University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discourse on wealth generally does not include African Americans (blacks), but does mention their lack of wealth. Conversely, the literature on race, particularly in regard to African Americans, has only recently come to include a substantive discussion of black members of the middle and upper middle classes. This research is a sociological study of race, as well as class status and focuses on philanthropic practices amongst the black elite. There are two main questions that organize this project. First, what is the relationship between philanthropy and the social organization of the black elite? Second, what meanings and motivations do black donors bring to the practice of philanthropy? The first question lends itself to a group level analysis, while the second question requires an individual level analysis. By conducting interviews with elite black donors in New York City, this study will evaluate how class and race interact in ways that influence black elites? subjectivity and identity. The unique intersection of racial oppression and class privilege at which the black elite are socially located produces an experiential knowledge that informs the practices of this group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader implications of this work are both scholarly and practical. Empirically, this project opens up a new population to be studied ? the black elite. Theoretically, it bridges intersectionality theory and studies of power and privilege by looking at the consolidation of power within a marginalized group. More broadly, practitioners interested in developing relationships with African American donors will find this work useful. One broad implication of the changing nature of philanthropy is that African Americans will become a ?niche market? of sorts for fundraisers. If this is the case, then this study?s portrait of the patterns of giving among black elite philanthropists will be a useful guide. As society increasingly looks to the private sector for solutions to social inequality, the role of philanthropists will become even more important. Determining what types of organizations that black elites support, and why they do so, will provide useful knowledge about black elites? position in the philanthropic field</AbstractNarration>
