<AbstractNarration>In this award, Dr. Weber from University of Colorado at Boulder, will study transition metal complex ions with infrared and photodissociation spectroscopy. The ions will be generated by laser vaporization and supersonic expansion, or by electrospray ionization. Transition metal anion complexes with hydrocarbon molecules or CO and CO2 have significance in heterogeneous catalysis in general, and in CH and CO bond activation in particular. The study of halogen metalates in a solvent-free environment is expected to improve our understanding of their intrinsic properties. Frequently, these metalates are precursors for the formation of metal nanoparticles that play an important role in catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;In his education plan, Dr. Weber proposes to develop a new approach to teaching quantum mechanics, relying on student interaction and engagement. Dr. Weber will liaise with educational specialists and broadly disseminate the course plan via the internet for others to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many industrial processes rely on heterogeneous catalysis. A famous example is the Haber-Bosch process in which ammonia is generated from hydrogen and nitrogen gases. Ammonia is the main feedstock for fertilizers upon which much of the world's food supply depends on. The gases interact with the solid surface of the catalyst that alters the reaction pathway such that less energy is required to make the reaction occur. In order to improve catalytic performance and the associated cost and resources required to run catalytic reactions, a detailed understanding of the chemical species that form intermittently in the reactions is imperative. Dr. Weber from University of Colorado at Boulder will use sophisticated equipment to generate species involved in catalytic reactions, and to study their structure in great detail. His work is unique in so far as he focuses on negatively charged species that are difficult to investigate, yet are expected to play an important role in these processes. &lt;br/&gt;These studies require a solid theoretical understanding on how to mathematically describe bonding interactions. This area of chemistry falls into the realm of quantum mechanics, a course that all chemistry undergraduate students have to pass. It often presents the greatest hurdle for graduation, as the material is mathematically challenging and drastically different from classical physics and chemistry. Dr. Weber plans to develop an interactive course that continuously gauges students' process, and to share this course with his colleagues via the internet.</AbstractNarration>
