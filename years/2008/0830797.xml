<AbstractNarration>The study of algorithms has yielded numerous techniques that are both&lt;br/&gt;interesting mathematically and broadly useful.  This ranges from&lt;br/&gt;linear programming to cryptography to geometry to approaches for&lt;br/&gt;approximately solving optimization problems.  The addition of a&lt;br/&gt;statistical view of the world to the study of algorithms has also been&lt;br/&gt;a compelling area of study. This project will study better algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for linear programming as well as, explore and expand on recent work&lt;br/&gt;in approximation algorithms, and will explore algorithms with a&lt;br/&gt;statistical view of the world.  Recent breakthrough work on&lt;br/&gt;solving linear systems as well as developments in online optimization,&lt;br/&gt;make the development of better algorithms for linear programming a&lt;br/&gt;tantalizing possibility.  This project will pursue this goal. A second&lt;br/&gt;specific area is the study of approximation algorithms which has, in&lt;br/&gt;recent years, been a primary focus of algorithms research.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular, problems such as finding sparse cuts, disjoint paths, and&lt;br/&gt;the traveling salesman problem have been fertile ground for developing&lt;br/&gt;new algorithmic techniques.  The researcher has done some of this&lt;br/&gt;work, and proposes to study this area further.  Finally, this project&lt;br/&gt;will go beyond the ``we know how to solve it'' case of linear&lt;br/&gt;programming, and the ``we will do as well as we can'' notion of&lt;br/&gt;approximation algorithms, to a ``how do we do on data generated by the&lt;br/&gt;world'' view of algorithms.  This latter view is especially&lt;br/&gt;appropriate these days with the growing production of biological data;&lt;br/&gt;This data is generated accordingly to scientifically validated&lt;br/&gt;statistical models.  Quite interesting work has been done in this&lt;br/&gt;area, but the field is begging for more involvement from those trained&lt;br/&gt;in algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the further development&lt;br/&gt;of mathematical techniques for algorithms, and the blending of&lt;br/&gt;traditional ideas with ideas in statistics.  The broader impacts lie&lt;br/&gt;in the many applications of algorithms for the problems addressed in&lt;br/&gt;this project.  Application areas include network design, molecular biology, recommendation systems, and optimization.  The researcher will introduce ideas from this project into graduate and undergraduate classes in algorithms as well.</AbstractNarration>
