<AbstractNarration>This research objective of this collaborative research award is to break the barriers between the disciplines of geometric modeling and engineering analysis by placing engineering analysis of imprecise geometric models on a solid theoretical foundation and by developing the next generation of software tools based on the developed theory.  Significant applications of this research, which cannot be handled by conventional methods, include analysis of unrepaired CAD models, reverse engineered or scanned models, models with small geometric features, toleranced models, and concept sketches.  The research approach is based on treating imprecise models as families of geometric shapes, and on reformulating the problems of engineering analysis in terms of distances to the imprecise geometric boundaries.  Specific deliverables of the research include theoretical foundations for the analysis of imprecise models, development of efficient geometric and numerical algorithms to support the theory, and implementation of prototypes demonstrating the efficacy of the obtained research results in the context of specific applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will lead to significant advances in the field of computational engineering, resulting in a substantially wider adoption of the analysis tools throughout the product design cycle, as well as in emerging areas beyond engineering. Specific practical advances in interoperable systems will include analysis of early design concept models, constructed or acquired models with numerical errors, and detailed toleranced models. The results of this research have the potential to make a major impact on the educational curriculum, liberating students and practitioners from dealing with tedious data preparation and eliminating the need for unrealistic assumptions about the geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Imprecise geometric models are common in science in engineering due to many factors:  uncertainty of data, numerical errors in computations, physical variability, and mechanical tolerances.   Such models usually need to be preprocessed before any analysis or simulation can be carried out.   The goals of this research project were to (1) develop solid theoretical foundations for direct engineering analysis of imprecise geometric models, (2) implement the key theoretical constructions in a prototype software, and (3) demonstrate effectiveness of the theory and software tools on several applications, including automated analysis of approximate unrepaired geometric models, analysis of models with small features that can be neglected, analysis of conceptual and tolerance models.  Critical examination of the computational steps in engineering analysis reveals that all required geometric computations reduce to only two geometric queries: point membership test and distance to-boundary computations.  Additional computational primitives are useful and can speed up the computation, but they are not required.   This result  implies that specific details of geometric representation are not important, as long as it supports the required queries.  In this sense,  geometric models deemed equivalent if they give the same answers to these queries.  Based on these observations,  we have developed a new theory for engineering analysis and simulation of imprecise models, implemented a prototype software that is now commercially available for a popular Rhino modeler.  The approach sets a new standard in the interoperability  between analysis and design tools, and suggest a radically different  architecture of engineering analysis system that provides direct analysis of most imprecise  geometric models -- from CT-scanned and biomedical models to complex designed parts and assemblies. Furthermore,  this reseach provides foundations for new approach to interoperability of many other types of engineering software systems using geometric queries.
