    <AbstractNarration>The research project is aimed at closing the gap between the relatively new&lt;br/&gt;autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) hardware and&lt;br/&gt;control system technology, and the design conceptualization tools needed to&lt;br/&gt;assess their impact on unit load storage and retrieval ULS/R operations.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance the analytical foundations of AVS/RS&lt;br/&gt;modeling through development of a new class of specialized queuing network&lt;br/&gt;models and lead to creation and deployment of analytical conceptualization&lt;br/&gt;tools comparable to those available for crane-based automated storage and&lt;br/&gt;retrieval system (CBAS/RS's). The models developed through this research&lt;br/&gt;will capture several unique features of AVS/R operations such as vehicle&lt;br/&gt;and lift interfacing, storage and retrieval interference effects, selective&lt;br/&gt;transaction dispatching, consolidated load buffering, and explicit linkage&lt;br/&gt;of S/R operations with in-process material flows. The proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will be conducted as a joint effort between Rensselaer Polytechnic&lt;br/&gt;Institute and University of Louisville, with active participation of&lt;br/&gt;industry. In terms of educational activities, this project will lead to&lt;br/&gt;multiple doctoral theses and undergraduate student research opportunities&lt;br/&gt;at the two participating universities. The project will lead to the&lt;br/&gt;development of media-rich multimedia based educational modules that can be&lt;br/&gt;used in universities and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conceptualization tools developed in this research will enable accurate&lt;br/&gt;and efficient prediction of AVS/RS performance and direct comparisons of&lt;br/&gt;CBAS/R and AVS/R technologies with respect to cost and performance. The&lt;br/&gt;models will be deployed through decision support tools that integrate the&lt;br/&gt;systems level problems of ULS/RS design with several operational level&lt;br/&gt;decisions for these systems. The project will also lead to the development&lt;br/&gt;of web based instructional modules summarizing the findings of this&lt;br/&gt;project. Prototype versions of the conceptualizing tools will be&lt;br/&gt;disseminated to universities and industry with the help of the Material&lt;br/&gt;Handling Institute of America (MHIA).</AbstractNarration>
