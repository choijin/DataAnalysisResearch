<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient ice is melting as a result of climate change in high latitude regions.  The life cycles and cultural use of poorly-known features of perennial ice, called "ice patches," are the focus of this research.  Rare and well preserved organic artifacts, including clothing, baskets, and tools are melting from ice patches around the world.  Radiocarbon dating demonstrates that these features have existed for thousands of years, providing a unique opportunity to investigate their role in high latitude human adaptations.  Four locales identified by preliminary research in Alaska's Wrangell St. Elias National Park and Preserve (WRST) are the focus of this program.  Using cultural ecological and geoarcheological approaches the research documents and interprets the role of ice patches in early high latitude human adaptations, 2) interprets their role in high latitude cultural development, 3) defines ice patch composition, character, and projected longevity,  and 4) develops methods to identify fossil ice patches so that they can be recognized after the ice has melted.  This project also contributes baseline data important to understanding the prehistory and paleoecology of a poorly known region, expands the discipline of geoarcheology, and provides insights into the concept that polar environments are "barometers" of climate, environmental, and cultural change.  It enhances education by exciting the public, educators, and resource managers about climate change and the need to locate, collect and preserve rare organic remains melting from ancient ice before they are lost forever. The program also provides opportunities for Native Americans to participate in, and contribute to, science.  Artifacts from this project will support a regional museum/cultural center providing cultural and educational opportunities to local residents and tourists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

A long-term interdisciplinary research project is necessary to accomplish these goals.   Products:  Research results from this project have been included in one book, an encyclopedia article, two peer-reviewed publications, eleven professional academic talks, two museum exhibitions, and twelve public outreach presentations. It has supported seven graduate student research assistants. These publications and presentations document and explain the human use of ice patches in high-latitude and high altitude environments and provide new insights into their physical characteristics. Mapping and measurements of their surface area demonstrates that they are melting and that this reduction in size correlates with recent trends in climate change and global warming.  The research refined criteria to identify the location of extant ice patches and sites where they likely occurred in the recent past.  If the global warming continues at or near its present rate, it is probable that most ice patches in Alaska will have disappeared by the end of this century.  Research funded by this grant served as the catalyst for a new peer-reviewed journal, Journal of Glacial Archaeology. The journal serves as a venue for archeological research at ice patches and glaciers, and released its first peer-reviewed volume in 2014. Results of the project were also used to develop two museum exhibitions, both entitled "Archeology on Ice."  One exhibit consists of nine panels that highlight the geomorphological context of ice patches, the relevance of glacial archeology to the science of climate change, the importance of partnership with indigenous people, and the unique artifacts and information discovered through ice patch research.

The second and smaller exhibition consists of three panels and a video display.  It provides visitors a more synoptic perspective of glacial archaeology and tribal collaboration. The opening of this permanent exhibit at Ahtna Cultural Heritage Center in Glennallen, Alaska was accompanied by a welcoming-home ceremony for the artifacts that were returned to Wrangell-St. Elias National Park at the same time in November, 2014.   While conducting fieldwork, the team filmed ice patch survey techniques and obtained aerial ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
