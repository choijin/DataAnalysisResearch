<AbstractNarration>There is increasing interest in using particle accelerators to form very intense beams of high-energy muons.  However, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate a muon beam. A key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).  The main obstacle to accelerating an intense muon beam is that the way such beams are created makes them too large to fit into the vacuum chamber of a synchrotron, and the short muon lifetime leaves little time to shrink the beam. Ionization cooling is a new technique to shrink, or cool a muon beam quickly.  The goal of MICE is to build a section of an ionization-cooling channel, instrument it to measure its cooling performance, and use a muon beam produced at a particle accelerator to demonstrate that it works as designed.  A collaborative effort of some 150 physicists and engineers from Europe, Asia, and the US, MICE is being mounted at England's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  Construction of the apparatus is currently in progress, and the running of the experiment and analysis of its results is expected to take place during the 3-year period of the grant proposed here.  This proposal requests renewal funding for the Illinois Institute of Technology MICE group in support of continued US leadership in muon cooling and in the muon accelerator facilities that might be constructed, in the US or elsewhere, once the feasibility of ionization cooling is demonstrated.  The broader impact of this work is most evident in the use of an accelerated muon beam for a Neutrino Factory recognized as the most powerful tool yet conceived in the quest to understand the mysterious oscillatory behavior of the neutrino and its possible role in the evolution of the matter-dominated Universe in which we live.  In addition, the pace of MICE development, running, and analysis is particularly well suited to the training of students.  MICE will take approximately three years to complete, a good fit to the typical physics student?s graduate training.</AbstractNarration>

In an accelerator, the accelerated particles become probes to study details of matter. Discovered in 1937, the muon (a more massive "cousin" of the electron) is a subatomic particle whose simple and well-understood interactions with matter make it a useful probe for a variety of purposes.

The entire system will then be commissioned, and the measurements to demonstrate muon ionization cooling will be made.   The development of muon ionization cooling involves advancements in the theory, simulation, and design of cooling configurations.  Central to this effort is a clear understanding of the figure-of-merit for beam cooling, i.e. "transverse emittance reduction."  In addition, suitable spectrometers positioned upstream and downstream of the cooling channel are needed to measure the amount of cooling achieved by a specific channel configuration.  Given the modest amount of cooling expected in MICE and the need to extrapolate the MICE observations to a roughly twenty-fold longer cooling lattice, the quality of the data from the two spectrometers is paramount.  Since the proponents are carrying out this research in university environments, both undergraduate and graduate students can be involved in undertaking both the theoretical and design, as well as the hardware and software development and commissioning, aspects of this research.   One of the significant aspects of this program is the possibility for students, both undergraduate and graduate, to become involved in forefront accelerator physics research at universities.
