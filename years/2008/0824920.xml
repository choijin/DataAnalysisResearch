<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0824920&lt;br/&gt;E. Schubert, University of Nebraska-Lincoln&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on design, fabrication, and proof-of-concept for novel frequency-tunable terahertz resonator structures made from chiral nanocomposit materials (CNM). Nanoscale arrangement and hybridization creates artificial materials (nanostructure electrically conductive coils) with entirely new properties. Applications are envisioned for areas such as nano-photonics, nano-electromechanics, nano-magnetics, nano-electromagnetics, and nano-sensors, for example. The goal of the proposal is to show the feasibility of a frequency-tunable CNM terahertz (THz) resonator device structure using conductive nanocoils and Schottky contact capacitors produced from the depletion layer at the interface between the coil and semiconductor substrate. &lt;br/&gt;The goal will be reached in the following steps: &lt;br/&gt; 1. Investigation of depletion layer properties at the interface between aluminum sculptured thin films and p-type doped silicon substrates and manipulation of the depletion layer thickness by an external applied electric field. &lt;br/&gt; 2. Filling and cross-linking the polymer polyvinyl phenol (PVP) into the sculptured thin film and demonstration of resonance frequency tuning in hybrid resonator device structure. &lt;br/&gt; 3. Reduction of the capacitor area by using patterned substrates for glancing angle deposition of aluminum nanocoils on p-type silicon substrates. &lt;br/&gt; 4. First demonstration of tunable terahertz resonator devices from chiral nanostructure hybrid materials with reduced capacitor area by means of terahertz ellipsometry. The frequency tuning will be obtained by applying an external electrical bias to the depletion layer. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The research plan will lead to breakthroughs for the design and performance of new hybrid electromagnetic devices based on advances for revolutionary new electromagnetic materials from chiral nanostructure hybrids. The active THz resonator device structures may be incorporated in THz sources and detectors and close thereby an current gap electronic device technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact &lt;br/&gt;Terahertz devices are very promising for applications in medicine, remote sensing, imaging, and satellite communications, and they might be also useful for homeland security tasks. Nonetheless the terahertz spectral region is one of the most under-utilized frequency ranges. The proposed active THz resonator device structures will contribute to enhance THz technology with an immediate influence on the society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
