<AbstractNarration>0846259&lt;br/&gt;Carrico&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to provide new insight into fundamental assembly, trafficking, and immune interaction of viral particles. The PI's goal is to utilize chemical biology concepts to enable basic virology and therapeutic applications. The PI's university and high school education programs are taking advantage of modern teaching principles to bring chemical biology principles to the forefront. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outlined research program will build upon the fundamental strength of Stony Brook's chemical biology research and educational programs. The PI plans the development of new core curriculum as well as an aggressive outreach program, both of which are designed to bring underrepresented students into science and give them the tools to turn their interests into a career.</AbstractNarration>

Engineering viral surfaces is a key aspect of developing virus based therapeutics. Viral therapies include vaccine development, gene therapy, and oncolytic therapy.

Through the funded research we have demonstrated the precise chemical modification of adenoviral and lentiviral surfaces. These viruses were chosen as they are leading gene delivery vehicles for both oncolytic therapy and gene therapy.
