<AbstractNarration>The project, in cooperation with Mississippi's State Board for Community and Junior Colleges and the region's electrical power generation and distribution industry, is developing an electrical distribution technician training system in order to address the need for energy industry technicians. The project team is creating specialized technology training that encompasses the academic material and physical skills required for technicians within the energy sector and can lead to an Associate of Applied Science Degree. These efforts include the development and refinement of curricula, exploration of pathways into advanced training, development of instructors in new technologies for the energy sector, and development of an outdoor physical skills laboratory designed to simulate the actual energy transmission environment. The implementation involves a series of modular training blocks or classes, with each module leading to an industry recognized credential.  These are being built into a full AAS degree program and offered to those seeking minimum skills needed to enter employment.  The project team also is establishing an outdoor training facility at the Pearl River Community College's Advanced Technology Center that is providing practical training with real electrical distribution poles and towers, substations, underground utilities, and other training areas that simulate actual electrical distribution networks. The evaluation effort, under the direction of an experienced external evaluator, is looking at student enrollment, retention, achievement, internships, and placement.  The investigators are disseminating their materials and results through website postings and presentations at local and regional conferences.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of their materials and outreach and dual enrollment programs with area high schools.</AbstractNarration>
