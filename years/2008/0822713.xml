<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a biologically-inspired image search and recognition technology to provide rapid object information retrieval from a mobile phone camera. The end result is that potentially any object in the real world is now "clickable": a picture of an object provides a hyperlink to the Internet. The proposed system utilizes a new method for sparse, multi-scale image representation based on the monogenic signal, a 2D generalization of the analytic signal that is robust to image transformations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By 2010, it is estimated that there will be over 1 billion mobile phones with cameras.The mobile phone is becoming an important connection between people and the digital world. The applications for mobile search technology are enormous and include national homeland security, product information retrieval (such as environmental ratings, pricing, or specifications), vision support for the blind, accessing object information for the disabled, and general purpose information retrieval including remote visual data analysis and inspection. Search technology has brought about many profound societal, educational and scientific benefits in the past decade.  The proposed mobile image search technology will extend those benefits to a broader base of users and applications.</AbstractNarration>
