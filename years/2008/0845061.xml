<AbstractNarration>The main objective of the proposed research is to&lt;br/&gt;provide simplified dynamics and design efficient numerical methods for&lt;br/&gt;complex intracellular stochastic chemical reacting networks. Numerical&lt;br/&gt;schemes will be developed to simulate systems exhibiting multiple time&lt;br/&gt;and concentration scales, and to solve transition paths and transition&lt;br/&gt;rates for systems with metastability. Error analysis of the schemes as&lt;br/&gt;well as sharper estimates on the transition rates will be&lt;br/&gt;provided. Applications will be focused on developing and analyzing a&lt;br/&gt;quantitative model for the Insulin response network, through&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with biologists at Michigan State University (MSU). The&lt;br/&gt;education plan includes training of graduate students that will lead&lt;br/&gt;to Ph.D. theses, developing a graduate level course for students in&lt;br/&gt;applied and computational mathematics, introducing the related topics&lt;br/&gt;to undergraduate curriculum, and organizing a workshop on the same topic.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be crucial to the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;functional issues of intracellular reacting networks at the system&lt;br/&gt;level, which is becoming the new focus of genomic research. &lt;br/&gt;Numerical studies of the multi-scale systems will lead to new insights into the simulation&lt;br/&gt;schemes for stochastic systems. The development of accurate and&lt;br/&gt;efficient numerical methods for multi-scale chemical reaction systems&lt;br/&gt;involves novel analytical approaches from stochastic analysis. The study&lt;br/&gt;of the fluctuation driven transitions in metastable chemical reaction&lt;br/&gt;systems will find new applications for advanced probability theory and&lt;br/&gt;optimization techniques. The multi-scale and stochastic methods&lt;br/&gt;developed by the proposed research will find a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;applications in biological sciences and nano-technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is going to build mathematical models and design efficient&lt;br/&gt;computer based simulation algorithms for chemical reactions inside&lt;br/&gt;living cells, which ususally involve many types of reacting channels&lt;br/&gt;and reacting species, as well as random fluctuations. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research is to simplify and reduce complex models, which will lead to&lt;br/&gt;insightful conceptualization of the system. The research will be&lt;br/&gt;conducted in collaboration with biologists and the theoretical results&lt;br/&gt;with be calibrated with real data generated by experiments in&lt;br/&gt;labs. The targeted application, namely the modeling of Insulin&lt;br/&gt;response network, has a significant potential for the promotion of&lt;br/&gt;public health. Type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are top&lt;br/&gt;causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In the case of&lt;br/&gt;insulin resistance, tissues such as muscle, fat and liver become less&lt;br/&gt;responsive or resistant to insulin. The disorder is also linked to&lt;br/&gt;other common health problems, such as obesity, hyperlipidaemia,&lt;br/&gt;hypertension etc. The models and algorithms developed by the PI will&lt;br/&gt;help to dandify the major reactions and reactants that are maintaining&lt;br/&gt;the normal range of plasma glaucous in individuals throughout periods&lt;br/&gt;of feeding and fasting. The research output will help to understand&lt;br/&gt;the mechanism of the Insulin disorders and the cause of type2 diabetes.</AbstractNarration>
