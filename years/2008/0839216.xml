<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) has assembled an international collaboration to operate a high resolution, full-disk, global H-alpha telescope network (GHN), to monitor solar activity round-the-clock. A prior NSF award in 2000 allowed the network to include three stations in the United States, China, and Austria. This effort will continue that collaboration and extend the network to seven stations without additional cost. These seven stations are at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) in the United States, Kanzelh√∂he Solar Observatory (KSO) in Austria, Meudon Observatory and Pic-du-Midi Observatory in France, Yunnan Astronomical Observatory (YNAO) and Huairou Solar Observing Station (HSOS) in China, and Catania Astrophysical Observatory (CAO) in Italy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's team will continue to operate GHN in order to provide valuable data to the solar-terrestrial community and to carry out research programs on solar filaments, flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). GHN will be complementary to the operation of a number of NASA missions, such as Hinode (Solar-B), STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory), and SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory). The PI will also investigate the important role of magnetic reconnection in large scale solar eruptions that travel through the corona and into interplanetary space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international aspect of GHN is important for improving global space weather observations and forecasts. This project will support a number of Ph.D. students who are using GHN data for their thesis work. An undergraduate student will participate in BBSO observations during the summer and carry out research during the academic year. GHN data processing uses artificial intelligence techniques developed within a multidisciplinary collaboration among students and faculty working in solar physics, computer sciences, and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since 2000, the Global Halpha Network (GHN) is a valuable community asset in providing high-cadence (1 minute) monitoring of solar activity in the chromosphere. It now includes eight facilities located at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) in California, Kanzelhohe Solar Observatory (KANZ) in Austria, Catania Astrophysical Observatory (CAO) of Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, Observatoire de Paris, Section de Meudon, the Pic du Midi Observatory in France, Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB), and Yunnan Astronomical Observatory (YNAO) and Huairou Solar Observing Station (HSOS) in China.  The network data are widely used by scientists and agencies (NASA, GDFC, SWPC NOAA, ESA, observatories, and universities) for the solar activity research and forecast, as well as by non-professionals (school teachers, students, amateur astronomers, etc.) for educational and outreach purposes. The full-disk Ha images are used as a ground-based support for space missions such as SOHO, RHESSI, Hinode, STEREO, and SDO. GHN contributes important data for use in the Max Millennium program and Active Region Solar Monitor. In the past five years, we processed over 200 data requests from all over the world, and sent over 400 GB of data over the Internet.  With the data in our network operation, we have obtained significant results.  The most important ones are the discovery of so called "circular-ribbon" flare,  which is different from the traditional two-ribbon flares. Magnetic fields have one polarity in this circular ribbon, while inside the circle, a compact flare kernel is found of opposite polarity.   As part of his Ph.D. thesis, one of Ph.D. students  created a generic method to automatically segment and characterize solar filaments from full-disk Halpha images to monitor the evolution of solar filaments and their eruptions.  This method can be used in other areas that required artificial intelligence such as medical imaging.  We also investigated the most violent waves on the Sun--Moreton wave that is associated with one of the biggest flare in history. The wave interacts with a number of filaments. We offered new explanation of the wave and filament activity.  One of the prominent achievements under grant is the advancement in education. The movies of Halpha network  have been used in the classroom teaching, for both astronomy and physics classes and in the graduate and undergraduate levels. Many students are attracted to the project and thus the solar physics. Several undergraduate students have joined and contributed to the project.  Some students have obtained significant awards, such as the Goldwater scholarship, NOAA internship, and NJIT Provost Research award, as a recognition of their outstanding research. Three Ph.D. students have also used the data in their theses. Notably, two post-docs supported by the project now become mature scientists with established reputation.
