<AbstractNarration>The San Diego Natural History Museum?s collection of over 1 million preserved insects and spiders contains significant historical material for a binational region that is immensely biologically diverse and experiencing pressure from unprecedented population growth and development.  The collection is the largest of its kind in the region (San Diego and Imperial Counties through the southern tip of Baja California in Mexico), yet it is poorly inventoried, not accessible online, and has other urgent needs that restrict the usefulness of this one-of-a-kind resource.  This project will improve overall accessibility through reorganization of the collection and an online inventory for offsite data retrieval.  Additionally, the project will re-house fluid-preserved collections for better long-term storage and develop an online image catalog for our most scientifically valuable material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance the utility of and accessibility to the only major entomological collection in southernmost California and Baja California, an area widely regarded as a biodiversity hotspot. The online availability of collection information will facilitate collaborations with researchers at Mexican universities, regional conservation groups, and government agencies.  Furthermore, the proposed reorganization of the collection will result in large amounts of educational material that will be shared with binational non-profit environmental-education organizations.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
