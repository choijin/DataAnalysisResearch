<AbstractNarration>EMT/QIS: GaAs hole spins as qubits: Eliminating hyperfine interaction-induced&lt;br/&gt;decoherence&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Computing is an emerging area of science and engineering. Its broad goal&lt;br/&gt;is to harness the superposition of quantum states for computing purposes. The elementary&lt;br/&gt;building block of a quantum computer is the quantum bit (qubit). Quantum bits have been&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated in a wide variety of systems ranging from trapped ions, to electron spins in&lt;br/&gt;semiconductors, to superconductors. In order to be useful, a qubit must be properly&lt;br/&gt;initialized, measured, and coupled to other qubits. The quality of a qubit is characterized&lt;br/&gt;by a lifetime (T1) and a coherence time (T2). These time scales vary by several orders of&lt;br/&gt;magnitude from one system to another (e.g. trapped ion versus superconducting qubits).&lt;br/&gt;It is therefore customary to quote a quality factor, Q, which is the ratio of the coherence&lt;br/&gt;time to the typical gate operation time.&lt;br/&gt;We will build qubits based on hole spins in GaAs nanometer-size quantum dots.&lt;br/&gt;Hole spins are promising candidates since the hole wavefunctions have p-like orbitals. As&lt;br/&gt;a result, hyperfine interactions with the host crystal nuclei are expected to be negligible,&lt;br/&gt;leading to spin coherence times approaching the hole spin lifetime of 300 microseconds.&lt;br/&gt;Taking into account the typical gate operation time of ~150 ps, a hole spin qubit, if&lt;br/&gt;realized, could have a quality factor of nearly 2 million, well beyond the threshold for&lt;br/&gt;fault tolerance. The primary goal of this project is to accurately measure, and determine&lt;br/&gt;what limits, the quantum coherence times of hole spins in GaAs quantum dots.</AbstractNarration>
