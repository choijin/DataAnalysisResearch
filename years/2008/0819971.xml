<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) will integrate current space-based and ground-based observing capabilities with new data analysis techniques, in order to develop scalar and vector tomography tools for reconstructing the Sun's 3D coronal magnetic field configuration. The PI will utilize ground-based measurements of coronal magnetic fields through near-IR spectropolarimetric observations, stereoscopic coronal imaging from NASA's STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory) mission, and coronal vector tomography techniques to develop these new space weather tools. He will then use the resulting 3D coronal reconstructions to test theoretical coronal magnetic field models, as well as to study coronal magnetic field configuration variations of active regions, before and after the occurrence of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's goal to directly infer the 3D structure of coronal magnetic fields from observations is of fundamental importance to solar physics. This project will increase our understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the heating of the solar corona, the generation of solar EUV radiation, and the origin of fast and slow solar winds. The proposed research will lead to a better understanding of the energetic solar events that drive space weather, and thus enhance our predictive capabilities for such events.</AbstractNarration>
