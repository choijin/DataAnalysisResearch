<AbstractNarration>The growth of communication networks has profoundly increased &lt;br/&gt;the availability of information and increased productivity. A &lt;br/&gt;key requirement in continuing to reap the benefits of connectivity &lt;br/&gt;is the growth of pervasive wireless networks. Wireless networks &lt;br/&gt;are resource constrained, primarily due to their broadcast nature. &lt;br/&gt;Alleviation of this constraint requires an efficient, distributed &lt;br/&gt;solution to the Medium Access Control (MAC) problem. In this project, &lt;br/&gt;the investigators study `locally-optimal scheduling and PHY &lt;br/&gt;adaptation', by incorporating physical layer (PHY) models into &lt;br/&gt;maximal scheduling for increased accuracy, and priority mechanisms &lt;br/&gt;for increased efficiency. This will result in the design of &lt;br/&gt;efficient, distributed MAC protocols, whose guarantees are accurate, &lt;br/&gt;from the PHY perspective. The results from this research, which is &lt;br/&gt;training a graduate Ph.D., are disseminated through appropriate &lt;br/&gt;publications and seminars, to guide the development of future &lt;br/&gt;wireless network MAC protocols and are incorporated into the &lt;br/&gt;university?s undergraduate and graduate courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PHY adaptation and scheduling (MAC) in general ad hoc wireless &lt;br/&gt;networks, is an NP-hard problem, especially, if distributed &lt;br/&gt;solutions are desired. In this project, the investigators study &lt;br/&gt;locally-optimal algorithms, a generalization of maximal scheduling, &lt;br/&gt;using broad queuing results that prove stability, and adapt them &lt;br/&gt;to wireless networks, with careful attention paid to the PHY model. &lt;br/&gt;Theoretical characterization of the performance of these algorithms &lt;br/&gt;is carried out using graph theoretic and optimization theoretic &lt;br/&gt;analysis, along with intuition on the design of optimal (though, &lt;br/&gt;centralized) MAC algorithms. The key ideas of this research, which &lt;br/&gt;are at the intersection of communication theory, queuing theory, &lt;br/&gt;graph theory and optimization, are incorporated into university &lt;br/&gt;courses, using the concepts of Lyapunov functions and fluid models. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
