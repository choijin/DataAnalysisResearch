<AbstractNarration>0821590 MRI Abstract (Ed Stokes, UNC Charlotte)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a super-atmospheric-pressure MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapor deposition) epitaxial deposition system for group-III nitride semiconductor materials. Such a system does not presently exist in the United States. III-nitrides are of interest as critical active materials optoelectronic devices (light emitting diodes, laser diodes, and solar cells) and transistors. The development complements ongoing investment at UNC Charlotte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is in enabling basic research on III-nitride optoelectronic materials, and through understanding of connections between device performance, material properties, defect formation, and growth conditions. The track record of participants is excellent and adequate resources are in place for conducting this work. The proposed research is not incremental but fundamental in the study of ultra-low defect material growth. A proposed photoluminescence system will provide a means for quantitative analysis of radiative efficiency of semiconductor materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this program is to provide unique optoelectronic heterostructures to many device researchers including: (1) UNC Charlotte faculty and students in several departments, (2) selected high school student interns through established UNC Charlotte programs, (3) businesses operating within the Charlotte Research Institute, and (4) as part of the Optics User Facilities, faculty and researchers at other institutions. Students will benefit by directly operating the reactor, and also by fabricating devices using novel materials provided. Societal impact is considerable, through increased lighting efficiency and improved solar cell technology.</AbstractNarration>

This project was funded through the NSF&rsquo;s Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and was entitled &ldquo;MRI: Development of a high-pressure MOCVD for III-nitride semiconductor devices&rdquo;. Over the last 15 years, first at General Electric, then at UNCC, Professor Stokes has been involved in development of electronic devices which are useful for high efficiency lighting. Since about 25% of electricity is used for lighting, higher efficiency light sources save electricity, and reduce the amount of fossil fuels that are burned to make electricity. The highest efficiency light sources currently available are made from semiconductor light emitting diodes (LEDs). The first generation of LED light bulbs are now commonly available and many citizens and businesses are using them for general illumination. However, there are still improvements to be made. Semiconductor materials for LED lighting are typically manufactured using a process called MOCVD. Many scientists believe that if MOCVD was used at higher pressure, it would be possible to expand the range of colors available from LEDs and therefore to make even higher efficiency LED light bulbs. So the NSF MRI project at UNC Charlotte was focused on design, construction, and commissioning of a high pressure MOCVD system.
