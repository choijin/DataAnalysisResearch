<AbstractNarration>0846342 (Stuart)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to (1) build an integrated toolset for investigation of air quality equity in developing urban areas, (2) advance knowledge on air quality equity and the impacts of growth on equity in the Tampa area, and (3) design a science museum exhibit that enhances interest of girls in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  Research activities will include development of capabilities for air pollution modeling at multiple scales with the CMAQ and CALPUFF models, for local passive sampling and analysis (of NOX, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and acetaldehyde), for urban growth modeling, and for integration and geospatial analyses.  These will be applied to estimating spatial patterns of air quality around Tampa, to determining current equity effects by comparing air quality with population distributions, and to studying impacts of two alternative future urban growth patterns (suburb-oriented versus "smart growth" development).  Educational activities will involve development of an exhibit for a nearby science museum in Tampa.  The exhibit will use inquiry-based learning techniques to teach content.  Evaluation of the exhibit will be designed to assess the effectiveness of enhancing the interest of girls in STEM.  Research and education activities will be integrated by including research results in the exhibit content and in the PI's courses, by involving several students in project research and in exhibit development, and through student writing on project activities for both research and education journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to enhance understanding of interactions between urban growth, air pollution, and equity, in order to improve the design of sustainable cities.  To achieve this, several tools and methods were integrated and improved that simulate emissions of harmful urban air pollutants, measure and model ambient concentrations, and estimate population exposures to air pollution.  These tools were applied to characterize the social distribution of human exposure to air pollution in Tampa, Florida. Potential exposures resulting from alternative future urban and transportation design options were also compared.  An interactive exhibit for a large regional science museum on connections between urban form, air pollution, exposure equity, and health was also designed and installed.  The exhibit was designed to enhance the interest of young girls and socioeconomically disadvantaged minorities in careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by presenting scientific and technical concepts within their societal context, and by incorporating profiles of relevant STEM role models.       Findings include that air pollutant levels vary substantially from place to place in the study area, depending on nearby land uses.  Levels of most of the pollutants studied were found to be highest near large roadways and in more urbanized areas, particularly over the long-term.  Short-term high levels were also found near industrial sources and power plants.  Living in a more urban area and spending more time travelling were found to contribute to higher exposure to air pollution.  On average, blacks, Hispanics, and people in low-income families were found to be disproportionately exposed over the long-term to higher pollutant levels at their residences and elementary schools.  Conversely, these same groups disproportionately reside further from regulatory air quality monitoring sites.  Results vary somewhat by pollutant type and for short-term exposure; some reverse disparities were found for acute exposure and for pollutants that come substantially from regional sources.  A simulated future compact urban design scenario reduced regional emissions of most pollutants when compared with a sprawl growth form, due to reductions in travel and electricity demand. However, pollutant levels in the more urbanized areas and overall exposures increased for a few pollutants, due to the concentration of traffic emissions near population centers. Replacement of the vehicle fleet with electric cars for the compact scenario reduced both the levels of pollution and exposure for most pollutants. However, the levels of one pollutant that is emitted substantially from power plants were higher, indicating the importance of concurrently improving controls on other emission sources.

Additionally, research tools and methods that integrate across multiple fields have been developed for improved study and understanding of air pollution and sustainable urban design.  Important collaborations were established between scholars from the fields of air pollution, environmental health, and transportation, and between these scholars and informal science educators at the museum.
