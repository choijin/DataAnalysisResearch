<AbstractNarration>Professor Daniel T. Chiu of the University of Washington is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to study chemical reactions in femtoliter-volume droplets.  Surfactants with varying concentrations, immiscible oils, and interior solute ionic strength will be varied and tested to determine their exact effects on droplets.  The experimental information obtained will be used to synthesize a model to allow prediction of droplet confined chemical reactions, and how they are affected by the choice of surfactant and immiscible oil as well as the concentration and ionic strength of the solutes contained within the droplet.  While droplet microfluidics are beginning to find broad use in diverse areas, such as biological assays, protein crystallization, DNA sequencing, and chemical synthesis, the fundamentals of chemistry in droplets, in particular, how the high surface-to-volume ratio environment affects the chemistry, is still relatively unexplored.  Students will be trained in interfacial chemistry as well as microfluidics and cutting-edge optical techniques for manipulating and analyzing the contents of droplets.  The predictive model and associated software will be made available on the PI's laboratory website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Droplet microfluidics has emerged rapidly over the past decade as an important area of research and development.  It offers a wide array of phenomena to be studied as well as providing a well controlled system to study these phenomena.  Gaining a detailed understanding of these droplet fluidic phenomena is important because of the potential of droplet microfluidics in making an impact in a wide range of practical applications, as exemplified by the recent introduction of commercial droplet based digital PCR instruments that have the potential to displace traditional real-time PCR techniques because of the higher sensitivity it provides.     To better understand and expand the area of droplet microfluidics, our project has contributed both basic knowledge to this important field as well as developed new methods to help study droplets and translate them for use in important applications. The following lists some of our accomplishments:     1) For studying droplets, it is critical to have an accurate knowledge of the dimensions of the microchannels used to form droplets, because the size of the droplets generated is directly determined by channel dimension. Although the lateral dimensions are relatively easy to ascertain, it is traditionally quite difficult and tedious to measure the height of the channel. We addressed this issue and reported on a new method, based on white-light interferometry, that is extremely easy and practical for measuring the height of channels during microfabrication.     2) To help study the content, reactions, and interfacial properties of droplets, we have developed an ultrasensitive method for analyzing picomolar concentrations of molecules in droplets with very high throughput (350 drops per second) and sensitivity (can detect just a few hundreds to thousands of molecules per droplet).   3) We developed a new device for exchanging the oil phase and surfactants around droplets. We achieved this by taking advantage of the vastly different freezing and boiling points of water and oil. This technique is particularly useful for studying the effect of surfactant and oil on the interfacial properties of droplets, because this method allows the surrounding oil/surfactants to be removed or replaced once the droplets have been formed.   4) We have contributed towards improving a better understanding and characterization of droplets, such as providing an accurate measure of the interfacial tension, the details of droplet formation, and the stresses experienced by cells during droplet generation and encapsulation.   5) Using the new knowledge we gained and the techniques we developed, we have found a new method for forming a large number of docked droplets. We have characterized this system and explained the underlying physics behind this self-digitization phenomenon. We have also demonstrated its usefulness in one application, digital isothermal amplification of a nucleic acid molecule.   On the educational and training front, this project provides valuable multidisciplinary training to the graduate and undergraduate students involved, including microfabrication, fluid mechanics, colloidal and interfacial chemistry, optical instrumentation and single-molecule detection, biochemistry and DNA analysis, and cell culture. Furthermore, the students are trained in writing and presenting scientific data as they publish their results and give talks.
